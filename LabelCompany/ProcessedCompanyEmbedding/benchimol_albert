january  he joined axis capital as executive vice president and chief financial officer in january  previously he had been executive vice president and cfo of partnerre ltd from april  through september  and ceo of the companys capital markets group unit from june  through september  in a recent interview with business insurance associate editor matthew lerner mr benchimol talked about the critical issues facing insurers and reinsurers this year edited excerpts followq what are the greatest challenges to both the insurance and reinsurance businesses in a i actually think the insurance business is doing very well weve had generally close to three years of pricing improvements and based on the various metrics that i look at in terms of renewal pricing i would say that a little less than half of them are still showing some pricing improvement a handful are flat and the rest are starting to come down in those areas where pricing is inadequate we are demonstrating the necessary disciplineon the reinsurance side its a little bit different the significant amount of excess capacity is such that many of our competitors are using price to sustain their relevance as opposed to focusing on the true differentiators of adding value to clientsgiven the price competition in select areas weve been unable to continue support for certain lines and while thats unfortunate its just the reality of the business were inq how are regulatory issues affecting the insurance and reinsurance sectorsa i think theres both a political element and a pure regulatory component at work here the political component is that the distinction between banking and insurance isnt always understood by legislators who under this pretext put pressure on regulators to enact new and expanded rules in the financial services sectoron the pure regulatory side im all in favor of transparency but lets make sure we have consistent demands from the regulators so we dont have to supply different types of reports and data to different regulators wed like to see global consistency in the demand for information and how its reportedfinally we would like a reduction in local protectionism so that we can insure that good products and services are made available to all markets those would be my messages to regulatorsq how does the pressure of alternative capital bear upon the reinsurance spacea clearly the excess capacity in the industry is leading to increased competition primary companies are buying less reinsurance so youve got a situation where there is significant growth in capital coupled with declining demand for the product and thats creating some price pressure one way were dealing with it is by looking to compete in areas where there is less of this commoditytype capacity as with our initiatives in the global agriculture reinsurance business and the weather and commodities risk areaq what are your views on consolidation would axis participatea put me in the camp of those who think there will be fewer reinsurers going forward and in particular smaller reinsurers whose value proposition is generally limited to providing complementary capacity are those that are most threatened in this environment in terms of axis i see little value in acquiring one of these smaller reinsurers that only provides capacityon the primary side we would actually look at a number of acquisitions particularly bolton acquisitions probably accident and health being uppermost in my mind related stories qa james klein american benefits council qa ben beeson lockton cos llc qa dominic burke jardine

albert benchimol thank you linda and good morning to everyone this is albert benchimol from axis capital thank you all for joining this call we’re very excited about the news issued last night about axis proposal to acquire novae this represents a new milestone and the continued evolution of axis as a st century specialty insurer and reinsurer as you’ll hear in more details during the call today this is both strategically and financially compelling let me share some of the highlights and i’m doing so on slide  this acquisition strongly aligned with our strategic vision for axis insurance with low execution risk it increases our scale and leadership in international specialty insurance it brings to the table a highly complementary portfolio of business which enables enhanced growth for the combined entity it significantly strengthens our distribution platform and not only does this deliver all of the aforementioned strategic benefits but it is also financially compelling for axis shareholders we’ll spend more time on these points throughout the call on slide  we show the key terms structure financing and timing for the proposed acquisition of novae the proposed transaction is a  acquisition of novae group plc at a price of  pence per share in cash for a total equity value of  million this represents  times novaes tangible book value as of december   and  premium to the day average closing price as of yesterday the transaction is of course subject to all customary and regulatory approvals as well as approval by novae shareholders with expected completion in the fourth quarter of this year matthew fosh who is here on the call with us today will be appointed executive chair europe and rob forster who is novaes chief underwriting officer will be appointed to a senior underwriting management role on the leadership team for axis insurances international division here in london we’re excited to welcome the novae team to axis and believe that their expertise in london international specialty markets will be valuable in insuring the smooth integration and driving the success of the axis novae combination turning to slide  many of you have followed our story as you can see from this slide much has been accomplished since our inception in  and indeed in recent years weve delivered compound annual growth and diluted book value per share adjusted for dividends of over  since  we’ve achieved this excellent value creation through the execution of a clear strategy rooted in being a leader in specialty insurance and reinsurance businesses critical to this execution is portfolio optimization for those of you who know us weve been delivering very diligently on our plan to deliver less volatile more consistent performance across our portfolio with superior return as we move through this presentation youll see a number of parallels to the novae story and thats one of key reasons that we believe that this combination will be successful before i introduce matthew fosh ceo of novae i do want to say that weve been following novae for many years and weve been very impressed with the work that you and your team matthew have done to focus novae to make it more profitable and to really position it as a very strong leader in the lloyds market i think this is a perfect combination of our businesses to create a london market leader and i welcome you and your team to axis matthew matthew fosh well thank you albert and good day ladies and gentlemen just a bit on the two slides i have in here in front of you to give you a sense of novae that perhaps you dont know that well we are lloyds business  a pure lloyds business and were one of the top players in lloyds if you see that top right  billion of gross premium written in  youll note here the diversity across the three divisions there below and ill come to second in the changes that weve undertaken there to make the business fit for the world that it is now rather than it was come to that in a second novae has an established reputation as a leader in the london market place were a top ten syndicate at lloyds and an operating history of over  years we were founded in the mids and the return on equity averaging  over the last five years after adjusting for the recent ogden rate changes which impacted the  results but other than that  we set over last five in terms of investment portfolio we have a highquality liquid investment portfolio and we have  employees primarily in london so thats the background of the whole business if you turn to that next slide it gives you a sense of the detail behind that recently we announced plans to refocus our portfolio on a select group of core classes now that is a plan that  we completed that plan in may and its been underway for a while basically what it means is saying you need in todays market to focus on those classes where you have a demonstrable and sustainable competitive advantage as the markets got tougher so you need to focus on where you could add value and bring relevance to the brokers and so on that you see going on here in the bottom right hand corner you see that dark area where we show the growth over time over fourfive years of those invest classes where we have a proven track record and thats what we talk about for the invest and maintain classes now we demonstrated our commitment to a portfolio that delivers consistent sustainable and attractive return by doing the difficult thing of exiting over a £ million of gross written premium over that same period while growing our invest and maintain classes by over  over those fourfive years you see there and thats what you need to do as the markets got tougher you have to be ever clearer about where you have a competitive advantage and we believe the portfolio as it stands today fits perfectly with axis the axis strategic vision and if we put the two together the combined is uniquely positioned now to maximize the potential of novae and we can leverage the tremendous assets that axis has the reach the bandwidth the management bench strength and all that which allows us to exploit the advantages of having created a portfolio that we have now so were very excited peter youre next i think peter wilson thank you matthew i think you can  youll be able to tell from the comments that matthew has made and then the comments that i will make from the axis perspective why we view this as such a compelling combination i’d like to turn your attention to slide  if you will ill spend some time discussing just how strongly this acquisition aligns with the axis insurance strategy we value expertise and insight in specialty risks together axis and novae create a top  lloyd’s franchise with an established reputation as a leader in the london market novae’s underwriting teams bring deep expertise and attractive classes which axis has been looking to grow such as specialty property facilities marine liabilities and cyber the addition of these talented underwriters gives us a chance to take more lead position and also brings longstanding relationships with over  cover holders providing increased access to attractive more consistent small account business portfolio optimization is also critical to our strategy novae’s business is largely complementary to axis existing portfolio bringing the benefit of diversification without significant attrition and such as novae’s portfolio that is added to our business novae also bring an appreciation of innovation having brought a number of new products to market including the first computer crime ph product the access to rich underwriting data can also be leveraged to optimize those portfolios and improve underwriting pricing and claims insights novae has an underwriting culture that is focused discipline and highly compatible with the axis vision strategic relationships with our business partners are important to us in addition to increasing the axis profile at lloyd this transaction will also increase scale and relevance with our strategic broker partners and thirdparty capital providers its market leading binder business provides the potential to extend and other lines as well as unique franchise and attractive local uk specialty business finally we cant thrive as a business without an efficient operating platform through this combination opportunities arise to increased operating efficiency and drive meaningful cost synergy and topline growth well be able to leverage recent investments already made in our london in lloyds operation novaes market leading binder operation when combined with axis has greater scale to support our efficiency investment and expansion into other lines or risks and axis company platform creates flexibility for novaes clients and distribution partners with the potential to reduce acquisition costs ill ask you now to turn to slide  slide  with the acquisition of novae axis will increase its scale and market relevance in the international specialty insurance space the pro forma company will be a  billion player in the london specialty market a top  reinsurers insurer at lloyds and a leading underwriter of attractive binder business at lloyds furthermore we meaningfully enhance our position in the emerging cyber insurance space strengthening our leading global professional lines franchise all in addition to axis’s position as a top  us excess in surplus lines player turn it over to slide  we set out a summary at a pro forma business mix on slide  you can see that novae increases the contribution of specialty insurance lloyds and international specialty insurance business to axis which is consistent with the strategic vision we set out for axis the pro forma business writes over  billion of gross premium of which  is insurance business  is from lloyds and  is written outside the us and bermuda turning to slide  the table on slide  demonstrates the complementarily of our two portfolios novaes premier marine and cyber franchise is providing axis with deeper and broader underwriting expertise in this invest classes and the combination with novae brings us lead capabilities in these and many other specialty classes novae also brings the number of new classes to our portfolio including uk and european property business focused on sme and specialty home owners which is additive to our existing property book as we go deeper into the profile of our respective portfolios it was remarkable just how complementary we found these portfolios to be not all of this can be captured in this table were novae is strong as presence leadership and scale we tend not to be in the business line and our sub scale or want to grow where novae rights a large portion of a class to business under binders we are no more oriented towards open market business therefore levels of pure overlap were surprisingly low we’re comfortable with the benefits combining our two portfolios more than offset and the impact of any overlap turning to slide  it shows the combination with axis while enhance novaes top line growth in multiple ways these include access to more distribution channels for certain lines including uk and european property facilities and associated uk liability business access to broader lucas ph platform i guess we can say the axis platform the ability to write larger lines and retain more business increased relevance with strategic broker and increased reinsurance purchasing power and optimization we also believe there are select opportunities to advance axis reinsurance plans for lloyds finally the combination may allow axis and novae to expand our thirdparty capital initiatives which allow us to do more for our client and deliver attractive fee income and finally on slide  it shows the combined company will also benefit from the significantly enhance distribution platform featuring increased relevance and scale with lloyds brokers further we’ll have greater access to more stable attractive binding authority business through novaes market leading binder distribution network of over  cover holders with more than  of novae business produced to cover holders pro forma axis specialty our specialist distribution will grow from  to  of premium written additionally novaes binder relationships will allow us access of attractive sme and personal line businesses diversifying our distribution network while strengthening relationships with key lloyds brokers and with that i’ll turn is back to albert who will discuss the financial merits of the transaction for axis and our shareholders albert benchimol thank you peter our convictional with respect to the strategic merits this transaction is matched by our believe in the significant value creation opportunity for axis shareholders many of whom are on this call we believe methodically that this is the financially compelling transaction as you heard from peter there is a long list of well identified revenue synergies which we believe the specialty offset any overlap between the businesses we’ve also identified  million of run rate pretax cost savings which include very little from front office functions such as underwriting and claims and we are confident that these cost savings will be fully realized by year or two it is our expectation that the transaction will be accretive to operating eps and operating roe in year one with high singledigit eps accretion expected by year two it is also expected to be roughly neutral to book value per share at close and very minimal impact to tangible book value per share with growth in book value per share and tangible book value per share accelerating post transaction driven by the increased earnings powers of the combine company further we believe that given the size of this transaction the scope of integration limited to one office and the complementary nature of the novae business to our existing book the enthusiasm and goodwill of our employees execution risk is very limited in summary we believe that this combination represents a rare opportunity to accelerate our strategic vision hitting on multiple objectives while delivering a very attractive value proposition to our shareholders with limited execution risk and with that id like to open the line for questions operator questionandanswer session operator yes thank you operator instructions and the first question comes from kai pan with morgan stanley kai pan first question can you give us probably more background about these transactions and how do you think of lloyds marketing now because the recent pricing pressure as well at high expense over there and why lloyds is attractive and also did you talk with other independent lloyds syndicates and why novae is best fit for you albert benchimol thank you kai i think theres no question that we are all experiencing challenging market conditions in all markets in all countries and lloyds is no different however we remain convinced that lloyds is the preeminent international market for specialty risk and the concentration of talent here in london and the number of companies and markets and brokers is such that we really do not see that changing in a material way in the near term the other thing is that participating in the london market and participating at lloyds over the last three years weve also been impressed by the increasing conviction by lloyds and by the various markets within lloyds to change the lloyds market looking to become more efficient change the target operation model lower cost so we actually believe that lloyds is doing the right things and so if you like axis want to be in global specialty lines lloyds is one of the markets that we have to participate in as you know we feel veryvery proud that were diversified we are in a number of insurance and reinsurance markets we do us ens we do professional lines we do anh were in a lot of different markets what matters to us is that we cannot be everything to everyone but in a market where we choose to be its imperative that we have the relevance scale expertise to be a differentiated provider and compete in a very positive way and thats what we want to do with lloyds as for novae i really do believe its a perfect fit as youve seen in terms of the books of business and as both matthew and peter have discussed theyre in many lines of business that were not in that we would like to be in they complement many of our lines of business they are a pure specialty lines player we don’t have to work our way through different line of business matthew and his team have already done a lot of the hard work of focusing that book of business as in one of the slides that was referenced to excuse me maintain and invest lines the way we see it given the good actions that matthew and the team have done is that the maintain and invest lines that have delivered an average combined ratio of  over the last five years will essentially comprise a  of the book that we are going to be taking over a year one  so we have the high level of confidence that this is a perfect fit with our book of business there is complementarity the talent within novae is outstanding were really thrilled to be bringing them into our company and combined we will create a very successful  billion plus specialty company in the london market matthew fosh can i just add  this is matthew fosh here the ceo of novae we are something of a rare beast we are only pure lloyds single platform business there is of any scale we’re the only quoted pure lloyd’s player and so whilst i’m sure albert did all the due diligence he needed to do to check whether we were the company he wanted to get to speak to we do offer something that others don’t in terms of that scale in terms of that pure specialty play and as albert said we have taken the surgery necessary in the last two three years to get very very pure on that specialty approach and that’s one thing one fastening reason i suspect why albert lighted on us kai pan thank you very much for the comment so my second question on the financial accretion if you look at novaes earnings for past three years you’ve taken indiscernible for  you’re running about us million to us million pretax earnings that itself is more than  of expected earnings for axis going forward so im just wondering even before the  million cost savings  so i just wondering what’s the basis for the highsingledigits accretion by year two and if something i missing amortization or other things albert benchimol i think we’re taking a reasonably prudent view of the market as we’re seeing it i think that the market today is not as attractive is was three years ago two years ago and so as the business  as you know we earned the business on a lag basis and our view is that we don’t want to create expectations that are unreasonable we’ve always been prudent in our outlook but i  but kai to your point i think it speaks to the high level of confidence that we have that moving forward this union is going to be very attractive for our shareholders kai pan thank you lastly if i may very quick is that the stock novae is trading above your  pence offer so indicating some possibility of additional dates ph so i just wonder what the breakup fee as additional safeguard for the transaction albert benchimol there are no  in the uk the rules for takeovers are very clear there are no protections and no breakup fees in transactions so we believe that the offer that we have put on the table is a very compelling valuation for novae shareholders i think it represents a healthy premium to novaes market price as i mentioned  over the average price for  days it reflects the benefit that we see coming and frankly some of the benefits that could only happen in a union with axis so prices move up and down for any number of reasons but we believe that what we have here is a compelling offer to novae shareholders operator and the next question comes from elyse greenspan with wells fargo elyse greenspan a few questions first albert if you can just walk us through have you become comfortable with novaes reserve position in terms of your diligence for this transaction and i know there has been some press reports surrounding maybe some legacy reserve transactions on novaes part if you guys can just update that kind of where we stand on that and how that kind of came into your thought process surrounding this acquisition albert benchimol so elyse thank you for the question i feel very comfortable with the extent of our due diligence on novae and again going back to the point its a very focused business it’s a business that we participate in every day so we have a lot of similarity with the lines of business we reserve our own lines and similar line i will say that we were very impressed with the processes the professionalism the approach we’ve done our work we feel very comfortable as to the quality of the balance sheet as ive said in one of the interview we wouldn’t have done this deal if we weren’t satisfied with the quality of the people the quality of the book and the quality of the balance sheet and we are satisfied with all three as to the press reports that you refer to my understanding is that these are unsubstantiated rumors and of course we don’t comment on that elyse greenspan okay thank you and my second question can you just comment  i know you guys said you would finance this deal with cash on hand and maybe some debt how do you think about your buyback just given that we’re now in the middle of hurricane season is entering into this transaction now change your thought process around buying back on shares albert benchimol thank you for asking that elyse and in fact it does as you know we’ll be taking on a billion dollars worth of new premium and so it would make sense for us to have a little bit more capital to support that premium so as of now it is our view that we will suspend our share repurchases for the next two quarters and then resume repurchases in early  and we believe that that is the appropriate way to move forward i will say this because i expect there’ll be a question about share buybacks we have been a i believe a very responsible steward of capital and we have given back to our shareholders a significant amount of capital in the form of dividends and share repurchases where we are today is we have done significant analysis of the benefits to our company and to our shareholders of continuing the buybacks and not do this acquisition or do this acquisition and hold back on the buybacks for the next couple of quarters and i can tell you that we are absolutely convinced without a doubt that the economic benefits to our company of making this acquisition far outweighs anything that we could do in the near term in terms of continuing buybacks this is the right strategic and financial decision for this company elyse greenspan okay and then in terms of novae can we  what about its cad exposure i see about half  just under half of business is property if you can just let us know where their biggest cad exposure is and i assume there is some exposure in the us if you’re going to just walk us through that especially now that we’re in the middle of the hurricane season albert benchimol that makes good sense and as you know our net appetite for incremental cad risk is reasonably limited so what i would say to you is that a good part of their property book is already shared with third party capital number one excuse me and although we don’t necessarily have great appetite for incremental cad exposure we believe that this is business that is going to be very attractive to our thirdparty capital partners and so we’re looking to see  we view this as an opportunity to continue to be helpful to the market and also provide attractive premium to our thirdparty capital partners and generate essentially riskfree fee income for axis so for us this is a winwinwin of course as wind season continues we will be doing the normal risk management that you would expect us to do elyse greenspan and so where does their pml i guess where are they writing to today do they disclose it kind of like you guys do albert benchimol i don’t think they do and given that the company continues to be a publicly listed company we don’t think it’s appropriate for us to create new disclosure for them operator thank you and our next question comes from meyer shields from kbw meyer shields i don’t know if this is for albert or for matthew but well see at slide  in terms of the breakdown of novaes gross written premiums between invest to grow and other classes and between that and the various lines that were put into run off how much of the  billion of  gross premiums is axis interested in renewing over the course of  albert benchimol so let me split this question in two if i may i think that the proper question for matthew is you know given all the actions what is the  i dont know if theyve already projected the premium level for  or not but i think from our perspective we can talk about how we feel about the book matthew fosh so we  our gross written premium will be around  million for  or the net earned will fall slightly your question about how much of the business have you discontinued is that really what youre after meyer could you repeat im talking pounds now okay pounds right meyer shields yes that is the question matthew fosh okay so if you look at the  number we have probably  since the end of  we probably discontinued about £ million or £ million of all business that we no longer thought was sustainably profitable okay we have replaced that in  with equivalent amounts of growth so its going to relatively stable for  over  does that answer your question meyer shields it does yes matthew fosh but its the business mix thats changing its this absolute determination to know this market is tough as we acknowledged and when a market gets tough you got to be crystal clear about where you think you have a competitive advantage right thats what albert does the whole time hes a specialty half as he believes specialty is a way you can differentiate now we entirely agree and its part of our  thats our route so when the market changes you constantly got to be adjusting your portfolio because classes that were profitable three years ago are no longer profitable right and so you have to discontinue you have to deemphasize  a classic management just like a fund manager ones managing assets were managing liabilities okay and so thats what you have to do but you have to be reallyreally disciplined in markets as they are now meyer shields thank you albert benchimol and from our perspective as i mentioned earlier we feel very good that in  which will be the first year of operation we believe that a  of that business will be in those maintain and invest classes so were starting with the book of business that we think is very attractive and then after that of course we just do the normal reaction to opportunities in the market meyer shields no that makes perfect sense thats very helpful can you give us some guidance in terms of what youre modeling for sort of typical acquisition related premium spillage albert benchimol you know one of the things that came across here was the complementarity of the books of business and as weve looked at it we felt that there were so many opportunities actually for positive leverage in terms of taking novaes product placing some of them on company paper versus lloyds working through our distribution really leveraging the capabilities that we have buying less reinsurance all of those anyway we cut this we felt that the positive synergies far offset any potential negative matthew fosh and meyer wondering if i could jump in its matthew one of the aspects to board was dealing with  was the fact that we have  by being this specialist half we are enjoying more opportunities than we have capital and so now its a question of how do you cope with the opportunities we’re being faced because when you are very clear about quite where you add value and what you can bring to the brokers in terms of  you get opportunities and they bring you more and this is only we believe albert and i believe that by putting these two businesses together that’s only going to enhance these opportunities and coping with the request and opportunities we have is going to be one of the challenges in putting these two businesses together meyer shields and one last question if i can novaes tax rate has been higher than axis should we assume that  or  tax rate persists on that portion of the business or can it be filtered through lower tax jurisdiction underwriters albert benchimol i think as you look forward i don’t think that’s going to have a significant impact on the pro forma tax rate for the emerge company there is a fair amount of normal volatility related to the location of the earnings and the way they come back and forth so longterm i don’t see a big change in our tax rate operator operator instructions and last question comes from jay cohen with bank of america merrill lynch jay cohen just a couple of other questions it looks like in the spring novae essentially shared some of its catastrophe business and i’m wondering how much and does that free up any capital for the company matthew fosh jay it’s been shared some of its catastrophe business multiple speakers shared okay yes i mean we’re talking about is that it comes back to this point jay about do we  where are the areas we have a demonstrable leadershipcompetitive advantage and in property tax we are not a property tax player of any scale we cannot honestly claim to be a leader in london or anywhere else in property tax then what we do we shared it and shared we worked with the indiscernible that is a leader in property tax in this country and we said okay you take our perfectly nice but not especially good book but they did want you can do more with it we look share that with you and we’ll close a share back some of your book where you are clearly leaders and it comes at this point is unless we aren’t leaders unless we are really special at something we don’t want to do it and so with this journey we’ve been on to complete that portfolio change so when you say shared we actually just exchanged a particular type to business where we thought it was okay but we weren’t leaders working with another partner we then quota shared back their book which was demonstrably top performer so that’s what you’re referring to okay jay multiple speakers jay cohen so netnet your cad premiums probably didn’t change much just something in a different form matthew fosh that’s exactly the point jay yes jay cohen and then the other question the  million of expected savings albert i’m missing sort of a net number in other words you may have to make some investments in the business but  million is what you expected helps the bottomline eventually albert benchimol that’s right look as you know we continue to be investing in the business we spoken to you about some of our initiatives around the future insurance platforms the systems that we have we’re clearly continuing to grow our investments in data and analytics we will continue to do that but for the  million that we’ve identified is a chunk of savings that we can deliver within first two years operator and as there are no more questions at the present time we’d like to return the call to management for any closing comments albert benchimol well thank you very much and thank you for your interest in this transaction as you can tell from everybody on this call we’re highly enthusiastic i think this is really a unique opportunity to put together to specialty underwriting shots that have similar conviction around underwriting discipline around entrepreneurialism and around excelling in the markets in which we chose to compete it’s a unique opportunity and we are very pleased to be able to move forward with the acquisition of novae so again matthew matthew fosh i would second that albert thank you very much it’s been a pleasure so for albert benchimol
