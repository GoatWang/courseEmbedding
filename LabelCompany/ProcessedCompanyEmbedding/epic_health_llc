prestigious starfish award presented to lizer jozefovic and sandy mozdierz in recognition of the amazing support system that they provide to pets alive the prestigious starfish award was bestowed upon lizer jozefovic and sandy mozdierz at the  fur ball fundraiser they have facilitated community involvement via epics network of facilities – coordinating fundraisers and donations for pets alive enabling the organization to save and help even more animals the starfish award was created from the story of a man that is walking along the beach he sees another man also walking along the beach but this man is stopping every few feet to toss stranded starfish back into the sea the first man says tell me why you bother why you waste your time this way theres a million stranded starfish what does it matter anyway and the second man softly replies well i think it matters to this one  pets alive fur ball epic healthcare management is proud to have been the cocktail sponsor for the  pets alive

health today the june  edition of managing health today featured skyview waterview hills water’s edge and salem hills rehabilitation  healthcare these facilities are owned and operated by lizer jozefovic and his brotherinlaw mark neuman the article describes how lizer josefovic revolutionized healthcare by providing aggressive therapy in a luxurious and hotellike environment if you had a grandmother or perhaps a great aunt or uncle that your parents took you to visit in a nursing home back in the s or s then perhaps your memory like mine is of an institutionalized setting with linoleum floors and cinder block walls or perhaps you have visited a nursing home within the past ten years and think of striped wallpaper and newer linoleum floors if that has been your experience then you’d be surprised by the welcoming décor and staff that you’d find when you walk into one of the facilities owned and operated by lizer jozefovic and his brotherinlaw mark neuman as the economy was taking a downward plunge in the mid s lizer jozefovic had a clothing business and was providing his demanding clientele with custommade suits and exceptional customer service by  the slowdown made the business impractical and he knew it was time to look for a new career in  while working with seniors as a social worker’s assistant he had what he calls “an epiphany” in those days once a person was admitted to a nursing home the prevailing feeling was that it was the last stop before death there was no going home jozefovic was working with a distinguished gentleman who turned to him and pleaded “i just want to go home” although jozefovic tried to comfort and encourage his elderly patient he knew that the gentleman would never go home again he wished that he could do something to help him that moment would have a big impact on the goals he set for his organizations once he became an administrator and later the owneroperator of several facilities a year later jozefovic was able to combine his business acumen and experience working in nursing homes to acquire his first job as an administrator and in  he and neuman bought their first facility – water’s edge in trenton new jersey since then their portfolio has grown to include skyview in crotononhudson middletown park manor in orange county and waterview hills and salem hills in purdys in northern westchester county today the name of each facility is followed by “rehabilitation  healthcare” because lizer jozefovic’s hope is that patients can be rehabilitated and that his facilities are a stop on their way back home read
