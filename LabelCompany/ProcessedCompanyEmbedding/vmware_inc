in march  the software freedom conservancy announced it was funding litigation by christoph hellwig against vmware for violation of his copyrights in its esxi product the case will be heard in hamburg germany the sfc claims vmware is using both the linux kernel and busybox without respecting the terms of the gpl copyright license while vmware told journalists that it believed the case was without merit and expressed disappointment that conservancy had resorted to litigation current productsedit vmwares most notable products are its hypervisors vmware became well known for its first type  hypervisor known as gsx this product has since evolved into two hypervisor products lines vmwares type  hypervisors running directly on hardware and their hosted type  hypervisors vmware software provides a completely virtualized set of hardware to the guest operating system vmware software virtualizes the hardware for a video adapter a network adapter and hard disk adapters the host provides passthrough drivers for guest usb serial and parallel devices in this way vmware virtual machines become highly portable between computers because every host looks nearly identical to the guest in practice a system administrator can pause operations on a virtual machine guest move or copy that guest to another physical computer and there resume execution exactly at the point of suspension alternatively for enterprise servers a feature called vmotion allows the migration of operational guest virtual machines between similar but separate hardware hosts sharing the same storage or with vmotion storage separate storage can be used too each of these transitions is completely transparent to any users on the virtual machine at the time it is being migrated vmware workstation server and esx take a more optimized path to running target operating systems on the host than that of emulators such as bochs which simulate the function of each cpu instruction on the target machine onebyone or that of dynamic recompilation which compiles blocks of machineinstructions the first time they execute and then uses the translated code directly when the code runs subsequently microsoft virtual pc for macos takes this approach vmware software does not emulate an instruction set for different hardware not physically present this significantly boosts performance but can cause problems when moving virtual machine guests between hardware hosts using different instruction sets such as found in bit intel and amd cpus or between hardware hosts with a differing number of cpus software that is cpu agnostic can usually survive such a transition unless it is agnostic by forking at startup in which case the software or the guest os must be stopped before moving it then restarted after the move vmwares products predate the virtualization extensions to the x instruction set and do not require virtualizationenabled processors on newer processors the hypervisor is now designed to take advantage of the extensions however unlike many other hypervisors vmware still supports older processors in such cases it uses the cpu to run code directly whenever possible as for example when running usermode and virtual  mode code on x when direct execution cannot operate such as with kernellevel and realmode code vmware products use binary translation bt to rewrite the code dynamically the translated code gets stored in spare memory typically at the end of the address space which segmentation mechanisms can protect and make invisible for these reasons vmware operates dramatically faster than emulators running at more than  of the speed that the virtual guest operating system would run directly on the same hardware in one study vmware claims a slowdown over native ranging from – percent for the vmware esx server vmwares approach avoids some of the difficulties of virtualization on xbased platforms virtual machines may deal with offending instructions by replacing them or by simply running kernel code in user mode replacing instructions runs the risk that the code may fail to find the expected content if it reads itself one cannot protect code against reading while allowing normal execution and replacing in place becomes complicated running the code unmodified in user mode will also fail as most instructions which just read the machine state do not cause an exception and will betray the real state of the program and certain instructions silently change behavior in user mode one must always rewrite performing a simulation of the current program counter in the original location when necessary and notably remapping hardware code breakpoints although vmware virtual machines run in user mode vmware workstation itself requires the installation of various device drivers in the host operating system notably to dynamically switch the global descriptor table gdt and the interrupt descriptor table idt the vmware product line can also run different operating systems on a dualboot system simultaneously by booting one partition natively while using the other as a guest within vmware workstation desktop softwareedit vmware workstation introduced in  was the first product launched by vmware this software suite allows users to run multiple instances of x or x compatible operating systems on a single physical personal computer workstation pro version  was released in
