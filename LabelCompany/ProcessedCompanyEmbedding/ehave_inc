the hospital for sick children “sickkids”           adhd opportunity adhd is a childhood onset clinical disorder of inattention hyperactivity and impulsivity current treatments available for children with adhd are typically classified as pharmacological or behavioralcognitive the pharmacological agents most often used in the treatment of adhd are stimulant medications although stimulant medications help remediate some of the symptoms associated with adhd the benefits are often limited and do not persist following discontinuation of medication the nonpharmacological interventions can be separated into parent training behavioral interventions and cognitive behavioral interventions in general behavioral interventions target parents or the classroom environment rather than the patient in many cases behavioral interventions do not remediate academic difficulties making the benefits limited and transient furthermore although many theories define adhd as a disorder of executive functions we believe the field is lacking an evidencebased intervention which directly tackles the cognitive deficits in adhd for these reasons we believe that cognitive training will be welcomed as an alternative intervention cognitive training through applications like megateam may directly target the cognitive deficits in adhd be more accessible via training in any environment
