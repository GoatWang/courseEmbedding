of dollars and playing just to increase your endorsement deals then you are just playing for fun and bragging rights i like to play games where the prize is something more something better playing the game of wealth generation is one of those games if played right you risk losing very little and if you win you end up with more money that�s my kind of game the second game i like to play is health generation in this game you really can�t lose and if you win you are a healthier person again my kind of game it is true there are no shortcuts to getting healthy you need to eat right exercise blah blah blah you�ve heard it all before but there are simple better steps you can take right now to get you on the path to better health it�s true money can�t buy happiness but i firmly believe happiness can lead to money if you are not a happy person then you�ll find every excuse to not be wealthy it really is a state of mind can you be happy if you�re not healthy i don�t believe so that�s why i truly believe health and wealth go hand in hand so if you weren�t lucky enough to be born into wealth or hit that lottery number then please join in at g investments and let�s work on your

        are you rich by kimberly danger money is the number one topic couples argue about and is a common reason for divorce financial strain can also contribute to health problems like stress anxiety and even depression the average household carries some  as a credit card balance every month if not having money is bad then having lots of it is certainly much better then right well maybe not there�s no doubt that financial security can bring about a less stressful environment in your home it can also bring you opportunities that you might not otherwise have it should be every households goal to be free of consumer debt but beyond that the amount of money that is enough widely varies we can get into trouble when we start projecting whats right for ourselves onto others the amount each of us needs can be very different depending on where we live our fixed expenses and what our personal goals are someone may be very content on a small income while others with big aspirations or goals may be prompted to go for the gold theres nothing wrong with either philosophy as the saying goes �different strokes for different folks� what numbers do you use to define who is rich or poor the government defines poverty lines according to income but i think weve all seen examples of families on very small incomes do better with their money than those who make six figures a net worth calculator can be a valuable tool in letting you know if youre on track in achieving your goals but theyre just that your goals not your neighbors goals its up to each and every individual to define that for him or herself the slogan he who dies with the most toys wins is a destructive way to lead your life if youre wrapped up in only accumulating more things youre bound to miss out on lifes simple pleasures while material things can certainly enhance your life they cant be your main focus live your life in pursuit of experiences that nourish your soul and allow you to give back only then will you truly feel rich five ways to feel truly rich � eliminate consumer debt and live within your means � live your life in gratitude of what you already have � develop relationships with family
