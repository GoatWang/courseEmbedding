testimonials  allison is clearly knowledgeable on issues of estate planning but i appreciated most the aging care power of attorney that i was able to create giving my son an understanding  and my approval  regarding what stages of mental capacity he should step in to help me live safely and securely  my firsthand experience with my own aging family members has revealed just how hard it is for someone to let go of independence such as driving a car so ive made that decision myself  its in writing and hopefully it will provide my son some ease when those tough decisions come  doing this step has helped me to feel more comfortable about my quality of life as i age  allison was a huge help  sandy milliken sc very pleased with all the help  excellent communication skills fast response to emails and texts  could not ask for better  i am glad to refer friends     dr donald l lewis dmd sc we highly recommend farina law firm pc for any of your estate and small business planning needs  allison is highly professional and knowledgeable following through in a timely and organized fashion  were happy to know our family is safer with allison looking after us  drs andrea  charles kelly sc the reason i have allison as my lawyer she is direct plain speaking    no messing about  camilla sc my husband and i found allison through a recommendation from a friend  we were in need of an attorney to set up a trust and a will  with three kids and a grandson we had put it off long enough  allison was a pleasure to work with  she is extremely smart organized and very easy to talk to  when you decide to take the step to tidy up all the loose ends in your life it is important to use an attorney in which you feel comfortable  sharing very personal information regarding family and monetary matters  its a tedious process and allison kept us on task and was also very patient  we would highly recommend her  mary  paul cronin sc we had a great experience working with allison she made the entire process so manageable and her attention to detail was exceptional  peter  kristen sc   professional and efficient you depart as not just a customer but a friend if everyone is blessed with a highly skilled professional they can trust in the legal accounting and medical professions life is a helluva lot easier allison fulfills the legal and we were not left wanting with a lot of professions in the best case what you ask to be done is done  the difference with allison is that she does that well and adds on the options you never thought of and lays them out in simple nonlegalese advice advantagesdisadvantages of each and the option she suggests and why  in fact she would make a superb management consultant  however she likes to provide solutions not perpetuate the problem   matthew bertino management consultant ny   i came to know allison several years ago and she continues to identify herself as one of the more impressive individuals i have had the pleasure of meeting  allison actively and consistently seeks to expand her base of knowledge and conducts herself in a manner which immediately informs of a firm grounding that guides her personal and professional life  these traits see her as unique among her peers and should provide meaningful assurance to her clients that any counsel received is the product of a learned professional focused on their unique needs    richard e conner jr ma jd llm    from start to finish allison was thorough detailed and organized  we felt  confident in her ability to make sure we planned a comprehensive will and trust and she delivered  would highly recommend allison for any estate planning needs  shes the best  m  b ohlson sc   allison van nostrand is an outstanding south carolina attorney when we needed
