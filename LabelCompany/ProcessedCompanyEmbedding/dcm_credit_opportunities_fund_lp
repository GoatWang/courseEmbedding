credit fund that does a grabbag of strategies and could fairly be called credit opportunities big picture credit opportunities is usually used by debt managers who dont want to pigeonhole themselves into one thing and can mean distressed loantoown midmarket private placements and mezz longshort and relative value convertiblespecial situations credit arb etcin practice particularly when youre dealing with the credit arm of a big sponsor its going to depend heavily on organization how a the funds themselves are organized and b how the teams are organized some sponsors bx gso apollo ares have huge credit arms that do everything under the sun while others are more focused on distressed loantoown or mezzanineto me the natural flow is pemezz dip and loantoown and private midmarket debtpublic distressed since you may end up with the keyssenior debt and clo management since a lot of the debt is lbo financing and the funds have a pestyle life cyclegeneral public market credit strategies there start to be natural conflicts and grey areas and organizational challenges in terms of separating the investment process gala coral is a good example where various smartmoney stakeholders shade back and forth between mezz distressed and peheres an example bxs credit arm gso has the following strategies listedleveraged loans basically clo managementcustomized credit strategies essentially separate accounts for their clo platformmezzanine strategies duhdistressed strategies duhsecondary markets basically a hy fundrescue financing basically dip or loantoownand lastly special situations credit strategies basically credit opportunities gsos credit strategy is focused on investing in the leveraged finance marketplace it invests in longshort credit event driven opportunities and liquid stressed and distressed securities gso may invest in both public and private noninvestment grade and nonrated securities including leveraged loans high yield bonds distressed securities second lien loans mezzanine securities common and preferred equity securities and credit derivativesso as you see the sscs is basically a grabbag of every other strategy they say liquid but liquidity is a term of art in this universe how this is organized from a legal structure standpoint can vary but lets pretend its like thisgso manages gso leveraged loan lp mezz strategies lp secondary markets lp rescue financing lp and special situations lp each of these has their own set of investor commitmentscapital though there is likely overlap on the investment team side you might have a different desk for each product distressed senior debt mezz midmarket synthetics relative value or by industry or what have you and each contributes to the credit opportunities fund as sort of

  rank neanderthal the kinds of models you build will depend on how its organized as discussed above heeb and newguy had good posts on some of the key elements of credit modeling because were a small fund i end up doing some of everything but you were at a gso for example youd likely be more focused models ive done in the recent past operating or lbo models for both new debt issuance and existing hy credits sometimes with mezz and midmarket you will get confid and have management projections for this otherwise its a lot like any equity or credit research model this isnt that different than building any operating model though we have a lot of emphasis on leverage debt service and liquidity metrics versus epstype metrics sometimes well do a full lbo model if the deal is still being negotiated or if we need it for enterprise valuation reasons warrants with a mezz piece stressed financing etc distressed modeling on both going concern and liquidationbreakup basis relative value models which can be between companies or intracompany and can be cashsynthetic these are usually based on at least a rudimentary version of  structured credit models basically you use intex to look at portfolio data for a clo and analyze nav coverage andor cash flow distribution to the tranche youre considering under different scenariosthere have been many great comebacks throughout history jesus

theres obviously a much greater focus on debtie presenting a good investment from the credit perspective knowing what specific metrics debt investors look at being able to describe what contributes to
