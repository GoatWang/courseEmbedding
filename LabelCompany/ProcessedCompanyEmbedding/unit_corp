cavanagh and nj kaufman jj mf cavanagh j plaintiff in the underlying action was injured when a steel joist fell on him while he was employed as a steelworker by a thirdparty defendant subcontractor broad crane and engineering service plaintiff filed a complaint against defendantthirdparty plaintiff unit products corporation and alleged  the defendant as general contractor had a duty to use reasonable care andor great care to see that plaintiff was not injured while performing dangerous and unusually perilous work and inherently dangerous work which subjected the plaintiff to great danger and danger out of the ordinary and further defendant had a duty to implement reasonable safety precautions and guard against dangers which created risk of injury to workmen but defendant breached its duty as follows a failed to see that wallplates were in place before the building of the roof structure was commenced b failed to see that work was done in a safe manner so as to prevent injury to workmen c failed to see that osha rules and regulations were complied with d failed to see that state safety regulations and rules were complied with defendant unit products a whollyowned independently operated subsidiary of hf campbell company filed a thirdparty complaint against thirdparty defendant broad crane seeking contractual and commonlaw indemnification  when it was discovered that the general contractor was actually hf campbell company and that campbells whollyowned subsidiary unit products was actually a subcontractor the trial court entered an order adding campbell as a codefendant plaintiff filed an amended complaint alleging the same acts of negligence against codefendants unit products and campbell as he had alleged against defendant unit products in his initial complaint defendant campbell filed a crossclaim against defendant unit products for indemnification thirdparty defendant broad crane filed a motion for summary judgment against defendantthirdparty plaintiff unit products after hearings broad cranes motion was granted unit products appeals as of right from that order unit products raises several issues on appeal we will address each of these issues unit products maintains that the gist of the principal plaintiffs allegation that he was injured while engaging in an inherently dangerous activity constitutes an allegation of passive negligence or vicarious liability on the part of unit products therefore unit products argues commonlaw indemnification would be available to unit products the general principles of commonlaw indemnity were set forth in peeples v detroit  mich app    nwd   commonlaw indemnity is intended only to make whole again a party held vicariously liable to another through no fault of his own this has been referred to as passive rather than causal or active negligence dale v whiteman  mich    nwd   thus one seeking indemnification at common law is required to plead and prove freedom from personal fault mclouth steel corp v a e anderson construction corp  mich app    nwd    husted v consumers power co  mich    nwd   if the indemnitees own negligence played a role in the injury he may not recover wilhelm v detroit edison co  mich app    nwd   the rationale for this requirement is that liability should fall on the party best situated to adopt preventive measures dale v whiteman supra in order to determine whether the indemnitee was actively or passively negligent the court looks to the primary plaintiffs complaint if that complaint alleges active negligence as opposed to derivative liability the defendant is not entitled to commonlaw indemnity hill v sullivan equipment co  mich app    nwd   minster machine co v diamond stamping co  mich app    nwd   diekevers v scm corp  mich app   nwd   those principles were reiterated as follows in duhame v kaiser engineering of michigan inc  mich app    nwd   the law in michigan as to commonlaw indemnity has been succinctly summarized by this court in hill v sullivan equipment co  mich app    nwd   common law indemnity is based on the equitable principle that where the wrongful act of one results in another being held liable the latter party is entitled to restitution from the wrongdoer see eg provencal v parker  mich app   nwd   see generally prosser torts th ed §  p  in the typical case indemnity is available only if the party seeking it is not actively negligent husted v consumers power co  mich   nwd   nanasi v general motors corp  mich app   nwd   mclouth steel corp v a e anderson construction corp  mich app   nwd   in determining this the court looks to the primary plaintiffs complaint if that complaint alleges  only active negligence as opposed to derivative liability the defendant is not entitled to common law indemnity prosky v national acme co  f supp  ed mich  decided under michigan law minster machine co v diamond stamping co  mich app   nwd   accord jordan v solventol chemical products inc  mich app   nwd   see also darin  armstrong inc v ben agree co  mich app   nwd   lv den  mich    am jur d indemnity §  pp  in addressing the question of whether an allegation of an inherently dangerous work place constituted an allegation of passive negligence or vicarious liability the court stated there is a split of authority in this court on the issue of whether invocation of the inherently dangerous activity doctrine can be construed as constituting a vicarious liability claim mulcahy v argo steel construction co  mich app    nwd   and nanasi v general motors corp  mich app   nwd   support defendants position however we believe that the better view is found in witucke v presque isle bank  mich app    nwd   where this court held that the inherently dangerous activity doctrine presents a claim of active rather than passive negligence    see also tiffany v the christman co  mich app    nwd         we believe that witucke and tiffany more closely follow precedent set by the michigan supreme court concerning the inherently dangerous activity doctrine see funk v general motors corp  mich    nwd   and mcdonough v general motors corp  mich   nwd   id   we find that the allegation that defendant unit products engaged in an inherently dangerous activity is not an allegation of passive negligence or vicarious liability and so defendant unit products is precluded from receiving commonlaw indemnification the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of broad crane on this issue unit products next contends that the trial court committed error in denying its claim for contractual indemnification a contract of indemnity will not be construed to indemnify the indemnitee against losses resulting to him through his own negligent acts where such intention is not expressed in unequivocal terms firemans fund american ins cos v general electric co  mich app    nwd   indemnity contracts like other contracts are to be enforced so as to effectuate the intentions of the parties gartside v young mens christian assn  mich app    nwd   in ascertaining the intentions of the parties one must consider not only the language used in the contract but also the situation of the parties and the circumstances surrounding the contract gartside supra indemnity contracts are construed most strictly against the party who drafts them and against the party who is the indemnitee gartside supra firemans fund american ins cos v general electric co  mich app   nwd   robinson v a z shmina  sons co  mich app    nwd   the indemnity provision relied upon by unit products states in part you further agree to fully and unconditionally protect unit products corporation and the purchaser of  the improvements against any and all claims for damage to property or person or persons by virtue of your work we find that this indemnification provision cannot be construed to indemnify unit products for its own negligent acts and unit products has not set forth any circumstances which would support such a construction darin  armstrong supra  therefore the trial court committed no error in refusing to grant the contractual indemnity that unit products sought mcdonough v general motors corp  mich    nwd   justices brennan and tg kavanagh dissenting unit products next contends that it was error for the trial court to submit to the jury the plaintiffs theory that the defendants were liable for plaintiffs injuries because they arose out of an inherently dangerous activity in vannoy v city of warren  mich app    nwd   lv den  mich   remanded on other grounds  mich   the court defined the inherently dangerous activity doctrine as follows in michigan the inherently or intrinsically dangerous activity doctrine is founded upon a theory which is closely akin to but not exactly the same as strict liability the principle is applied where a duty is imposed upon the employer in doing work necessarily involving danger to others unless great care is used to make such provision against negligence as may be commensurate with the obvious danger it is this duty which cannot be delegated to another so as to avoid liability for its neglect inglis v millersburg driving assn   mich     nw  the doctrine imposes a nondelegable duty upon the party desiring the dangerous undertaking see  alr   the court concluded in vannoy that the question of whether an activity was inherently dangerous was an issue of fact to be submitted to the jury whether the performance of decedents task was inherently and intrinsically dangerous was a question of fact which the trial judge properly submitted to the jury it is ludicrous to intimate that working in an atmosphere of deadly tasteless odorless and colorless gas without any protective devices is not a dangerous activity the factual questions concerning the presence of such a gas and other circumstances surrounding decedents employment prompted consideration of the issue by the jury see olah v katz  mich    nw   sun oil co v kneten ca    fd  and mallory v louisiana pure ice  supply co   mo  id  in dowell v general telephone co of michigan  mich app    nwd   lv den  mich   where the defendant alleged as did the defendant in the present case that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on plaintiffs theory of inherently dangerous activity the court said according to  cjs negligence §  p  n  the term inherently dangerous means that type of danger which inheres in the instrumentality or condition itself at all times thereby requiring special precautions to be taken with respect to it to prevent injury whether the activity being analyzed is inherently dangerous is thus a question of fact to be determined by the jury in accordance with vannoy and dowell we find that it was for the trier of fact the jury to make the determination as to whether plaintiff was engaged  in an inherently dangerous activity when he was injured unit products claims that it was error for the trial court to allow plaintiffs expert witness to conclude that the activity in which plaintiff was engaged was inherently dangerous the expert subsequently defined what he meant by the term inherently dangerous counsel for the defense objected to this testimony preserving the issue for appeal the admissibility of evidence is a determination to be made in the trial judges discretion that determination will not be set aside unless there has been an abuse of discretion mre  provides testimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact the conclusion that plaintiff was engaged in an inherently dangerous activity was properly admissible under mre  the admission of this testimony has not been demonstrated to this court to be an abuse of discretion spalding v spalding  mich    nwd   therefore we find no error requiring reversal in the admission of this experts testimony that plaintiff was engaged in an inherently dangerous activity defendant also contends that it was error for the expert to testify as to his definition of inherently dangerous to support their claim on appeal defendants rely on in re powers estate  mich    nwd   a case involving a will contest wherein the ultimate issue pertained to the testatrixs mental competency the expert was asked to respond to the question of whether  he thought there were persons engaged in various official activities throughout society who dont have the bare mental equipment required to make a will and yet cannot be observed by their fellow citizens the expert responded no the standard of incompetency to make a will is much broader on appeal the supreme court held even though the foregoing was adduced on cross examination it exceeded permissible bounds it substituted for the established legal tests of testamentary capacity the espoused standard of the testifying expert the function of the expert witness is to supply expert testimony this includes when proper foundation is laid opinion evidence this opinion evidence may even embrace ultimate issues of fact dudek v popp  mich   and the court rule there cited what the opinion of an expert does not yet extend to is the creation of new legal definitions and standards and legal conclusions id the trial court in the instant case instructed the jury on the appropriate legal standard to use in determining the issue of an inherently dangerous activity mre  permits an expert to give a conclusion as this expert did on whether the activity was inherently dangerous it is the opinion of this court that it was not error for the expert to be given an opportunity to explain what he meant by inherently dangerous once he had expressed the opinion that the plaintiffs job was within that classification it well may have been more prejudicial for the expert to have stated that the activity in question was inherently dangerous without an opportunity to explain what he meant by that term no new legal definition or standard was created id appellants urge this court to find that the jurys  responses to questions on the specialverdict form and their finding that the plaintiff was engaged in an inherently dangerous activity is fatally inconsistent with their finding that the defendant general contractor had not retained control over the construction project plaintiff set forth three alternative theories of liability at trial the first was based upon a common work area theory the second was based upon the inherently dangerous activities doctrine and the third was based upon the general contractors alleged control over the construction site the supreme court in inglis supra stated that one who engaged another to perform inherently dangerous work is liable for injuries incurred in the carrying out of such an activity if reasonable care to prevent the danger has not been taken defendant unit products asserts that the inglis exception to the general rule as to independent contractors presumes that the general contractor retains control over the worksite involving the dangerous activities therefore unit products concludes that the negative jury response to the specialverdict question whether the defendant general contractor retained control over the project involving safety and safety precautions precludes a finding of liability under the inherently dangerous activity doctrine we do not agree that this is a valid presumption in fact in some situations it may be the nonretention of control and resultant failure to insure that proper safety precautions are adhered to that will result in the general contractors being found liable for injuries the jury determination that the defendant general contractor did not retain control of the worksite and their finding of liability based on the inherently dangerous activity theory are not logically or legally inconsistent the final issue defendant raises on appeal is  that the trial court erred in refusing to allow the jury the supreme court in placek v sterling heights  mich   nwd   replaced the defense of contributory negligence with comparative negligence where contributory negligence was previously applicable as a defense therefore comparative negligence would only be available if contributory negligence would have been available this court in vannoy supra  stated in michigan the inherently or intrinsically dangerous activity doctrine is founded upon a theory which is closely akin to but not exactly the same as strict liability footnote omitted in recognition of the strictliability nature of the doctrine of inherently dangerous activities and the nondelegability of the employers duty of care and caution in these circumstances we are not persuaded that the defenses of contributory negligence or comparative negligence are available where such an allegation is made we affirm the trial courts findings and the jurys verdict costs to
