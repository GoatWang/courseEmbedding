religion for herself it is primarily based on being a good person although raised as an episcopalian she has dipped into many others including the edge of gnostic christianity hinduism zoroastrianism and buddhism i am proud of her and the result because it contains no jealous gods but if you want as good a one you have to design it yourself at one time in the midst of her search we happened to be in laos and she discovered spirit houses that are often seen in front of houses in southeast asia and even inns and hotels and act as a location to place offerings of various sorts to buddha and local dieties she decided she would like to bring the custom home but since they are difficult to pack for air travel and since there is no required design for them i told her i would build her one needless to say i procrastinated for quite a while but finally built her one that was six or eight years ago and in the interim it acquired many signs of the wear and tear of being outdoors  including bird droppings an interior of rotting leaves missing parts stained paint and overall scruffiness she felt bad about this   after another bout of procrastination i just redid it as the photo at left shows and i must admit i am proud of it and have regained the points i received from my wife for building it in the first place in order to establish the nature of her beliefs it is located right next to her favorite statue of ganesh the hindu lord of good fortune who provides prosperity fortune and success and is the lord of beginnings and the remover of both material and spiritual obstaclesa statue

popular searches back to top ama ceo outlines digital challenges opportunities facing medicine for immediate release jun   back to top chicago – in his address to the house of delegates at the american medical association ama annual meeting ama ceo james l madara md today outlined the challenges and opportunities facing medicine in todays rapidlychanging digital economy madara drew a direct line between the technological innovations happening today and the challenges that dotted the health landscape at the time of the amas founding when the ama played a leading role in stamping out quackery and creating standards for medical education today we have really remarkable tools—robotic surgery new forms of radiation treatment targeted biologics and we live in a time of rapid development in the digital world—telemedicine as an example madara said in prepared remarks but appearing in disguise among these positive products are other digital socalled advancements that dont have an appropriate evidence base or just dont work that well—or actually impede care confuse patients and waste our time from ineffective electronic health records to an explosion of directtoconsumer digital health products to apps of mixed quality – its the digital snake oil of the early st century dr madara also spoke about how the ama is advancing its mission by partnering with leaders across healthcare that are keenly focused on technologies that work better for our patients and physicians and seeking ways to bring the physician voice into the innovation space recent efforts to create an ama innovation ecosystem include health  the amas integrated healthcare innovation company in silicon valley was launched earlier this year to conduct rapid exploration of innovative solutions to the biggest challenges facing the nations  million physicians and the patients they serve health is working to catalyze collaboration across a network of partners including technology firms product companies providers and payers to drive rapid change and make new solutions possible the ama interaction studio at matter the chicago based healthcare community hub and entrepreneurial incubator which is enabling physician perspective in ideation and collaboration with hundreds of entrepreneurs working on early stage technologies and solutions through its innovation ecosystem the ama is building bridges to tech innovators and entrepreneurs so that physicians have a seat at the table as new products and services are being developed this ultimately ensures new medical products address realworld challenges for physicians and patients to help improve the health of the nation additional remarks as prepared for delivery from dr madaras speech even those digital products that might be helpful often lack a way of enriching the relationship between the physician and the patient more and more were seeing digital tools in medicine that unlike digital tools in other industries make the provision of care less not more efficient and these digital tools often dont connect with each other—interoperability remains a dream we were told that interoperability was the future we didnt expect that it would always be in the future the future is not about eliminating physicians its about leveraging physicians that means leveraging physicians by providing digital and other tools that work like they do in virtually all other industries – making our environments more supportive providing the data we actually need in an organized efficient way and saving time so we can spend more of it with our patients dr madaras full remarks as prepared for delivery are below  address to the house of delegates digital dystopia james l madara mdexecutive vice president and ceo american medical association american medical association annual meeting hyatt regency chicagojune   madam speaker mr president members of the board delegates and guests  over the last five years ive used these opportunities to outline the progress in our strategic plan … creating the medical school of the future … dealing effectively with chronic disease as modeled by prediabetes and hypertension and … creating tools and resources to help physicians better thrive weve made significant—and now nationally recognized—progress in all three areas ill provide a full update at the interim meeting this november  at that time ill also outline our approaches to help physicians adapt to the macra legislation—work thats already started but will be more refined once the final rule is established this fall but today id like to provide thoughts on the emerging digital environment we find ourselves in  and what we might do to move toward digital tools that lead to professional satisfaction and improvements to care rather than to further practice disruption first id like to reflect on the work of our predecessors it provides lessons for today   when the ama emerged in the midth century medicine in the us was poorly developed lagging well behind our european counterparts our ama predecessors engaged the very heavy lifts of stamping out quackery creating standards for medical education and developing the first code of medical ethics simply put the ama stopped the flow of the snake oil remedies of that time quack remedies—snake oil—were all the rage back then heres an example clark stanley raised as a cowboy in texas sold a unique remedy which he claimed healed a variety of ailments  stanley claimed his body was covered with scars from hundreds of rattlesnake bites … any of which might have killed him but for the benefit of his magical elixir his snake oil remedy since the elixir contained no alcohol stanley extended the sell saying it was suitable for everyone of any age without regard to temperance incidentally a skeptic who was governor of texas at the time heard these claims and responded  who would believe theres a better remedy than whiskey it was the ama that identified these fakes and set standards our predecessors did all of this by inserting themselves into the enterprises of the day—public and private leading massive change by engaging broadly with society today snake oil elixirs are a comparative rarity rather we have really remarkable tools—robotic surgery new forms of radiation treatment emerging biologics and we live in a time of rapid development in the digital world—telemedicine as an example as discussed in detail by this house but you know something appearing in disguise among these positive products are other digital socalled advancements that dont have an appropriate evidence base or that just dont work that well—or that actually impede care confuse patients and waste our time from ineffective electronic health records to an explosion of directtoconsumer digital health products to apps of mixed quality this is the digital snake oil of the early st century   even those digital products that might be helpful often lack a way of enriching the relationship between the physician and the patient its like trying to squeeze a gallon product idea into a gallon health care knowledge base more and more were seeing digital tools in medicine that unlike digital tools in other industries make the provision of care less not more efficient and these digital tools often dont connect with each other—interoperability remains a dream we were told that interoperability was the future we didnt expect that it would always be in the futurethe age of digital snake oil energizing this rush of new products we find popular books predicting a future of digital health care that in the near future will bypass physicians altogether—where patients can largely look after themselves   these extravagant claims did achieve their primary goal  lots of books were sold  these claims also drew the attention of the lay press and private sector two groups that couldnt have known any better one highly praised book touted how patients could order their own blood tests by the hundreds—do it today—then follow algorithms to essentially selftreat  snake oil stanley would be so proud anyone been reading the papers of late  been following the many evolving investigations and apparent fraud of such touted new pathways  … that hallucination didnt turn out so well did it  as one of our presidential candidates might tweet  dumb fortunately more sober analysis of the current state can be found elsewhere as in bob wachters wonderful book the digital doctor a more promising digital future can be envisioned that enhances the physicianpatient relationship produces better and more efficient care and allows more time for physicianpatient interactions—the type of outcome that has been so falsely promised by much of the current digital snake oil but wachter provides no false illusions as to the current state and well describes the present  something id call our digital dystopia from directtoconsumer digital health devices—which only in the fine print say for entertainment purposes only—to our clunky electronic records to icus that sound like primitive swamps abuzz with a cacophony of  bells alarms and whistles just as in the midth century when we separated the useful antitoxins and compounds like aspirin from stanleys snake oil remedy today were tasked with separating the digital snake oil from the useful ­­—and potentially magnificent—digital tools the future is not about eliminating physicians its about leveraging physicians leveraging you by providing digital and other tools that work like they do in virtually all other industries—making our environments more supportive providing the data we actually need in an organized efficient way and saving time so we can spend more of it with our patients a new ama study analyzed a variety of settings and type of practices  percent of physician time was devoted to the keyboard— percent only a third of their time was free to interact with patients to compound this physicians also spent two hours each evening on the keyboard finishing the data entry from the day… evening hours that used to be spent reading jama or decompressing with family  our current state   american physicians have become the most expensive data entry workforce on the face of the planet  what a waste  how frustrating lets face this st century digital snake oil the way our predecessors confronted their task in the th century  by inserting ourselves into the processes from which digital tools emanate so how do we do this what are we working on to begin with were intensively working with vendors and manufacturers as well as the federal agencies that regulate them   youll later hear from cms acting administrator andy slavitt on enhanced federal pressure for interoperability and efficiency in our health records  for ehr  not  in retrospect one might argue that our field was insufficiently embedded in the creation of the first wave of digital products  the result  defective products not informed by physicians today were active in pursuits toward correcting this—toward having physician knowledge embedded in the development of new products here are a few examples   first were conveying to manufacturers what physicians actually need digital tools that add layers onto our day are not helpful—those are digital snake oil we hate them—hate hate hate them in contrast digital tools that would simplify and better organize our lives and also adapt to the natural variations in our practices—those that would free more time for patient interactions—thats what we want tools like that wed love—love love love there are too few of these today second were forming interactions with the emerging companies that produce healthrelated goods and services—for example working with matter a chicagobased incubator for emerging health care companies more than  companies are now located in matter as well as our ama interaction space there we inform entrepreneurs of the exact needs of physicians at the creation of innovative ideas some of you have participated in this—and for that i thank you we do much better if new products and services are deeply informed by our actual problems and needs rather than flying on an entrepreneurs incomplete views  we bring the granular understanding of the physicianpatient environment  thats difficult to discern from the outside  third in january we launched an innovation studio in silicon valley health  health —the  in recognition of our th anniversary—will take many of the problems identified by ama studies and apply rapid prototyping and design to achieve tools based on physician need emerging prototypes will be iterated with physicians until the tool gets it right this effort is attracting highlevel talent in silicon valley talent thatll be directed to the problems faced by physicians fourth while shaping this future we also need to address the current state thats why were identifying workflow and practice adjustments that can produce higher practice satisfaction today these digital modules which we call steps forward™ are available to all physicians and can be accessed through our website  i announced steps forward last year at this meeting and since then more than  users have accessed these tools to improve practice new modules are being produced and tested and cms has recognized these as a form by which physicians can be acknowledged for practice improvement under the macra law these ama steps forward modules have in just the last few months received more than five national awards in the digital product area  several of the new steps forward modules address pain points highlighted by physicians in a recent ama crowdsourcing exercise  thanks to those of you who contributed ideas  another crowdsourcing effort—the ama innovation challenge—attracted   users and over  fullyformed product ideas from physicians and trainees five finalists have been selected and will present their ideas at matter this evening three winners will then be supported in design planning and development  also in this effort  physicians indicated interest in helping to pilot and evaluate such new products  i emphasize that all of this work is being done while were intensifying our advocacy work our work on innovation is coordinated and integrated with our critical work on advocacy thus were inserting ourselves in both public and private sectors on behalf of physicians in the midth century our predecessors fought the snake oil of the day by interacting with all segments of society—both public and private   we follow their lead were now fully engaged on many fronts—engaging not only the important aspect of legislation and regulation but also directly engaging those who produce the products and services thatll feed our practices … pipeline products that are now being informed from the start—with the knowledge of what physicians actually need ill end with something from bob wachters book   quote —even when that wonderful day arrives when we have finally coaxed the machines into doing all the things we want them to do and none of the things we dont we will still be left with one human being seeking help at a time of great need and overwhelming anxiety—end quote   that relationship between the physician and the patient isnt a transactional one—but its one that requires time time that should be made available by helpful digital tools tools that work effectively as they do in virtually every other field but ours  we need that…and we need to be directly involved to make it happen what we dont need is more digital snake oil thank you  media contactama media relationsphone  email email protected house james l atty in humble texas with reviews
