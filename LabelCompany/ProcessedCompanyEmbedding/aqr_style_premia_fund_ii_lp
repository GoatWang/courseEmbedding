traditional portfolios focus on dollarbased allocation risk parity portfolios focus on riskbased allocation aqrs risk parity fund invests globally across stocks bonds currencies and commodities allocating smaller amounts of capital to assets that are risky and larger amounts to assets that are less risky in building the portfolio we seek assets that we believe are liquid and provide either a positive expected return or some portfolio diversification benefit over the long term we target balanced risk allocation across the four asset classes but we have the ability to exploit tactical opportunities by making modest adjustments or “tilts” toward assets that we believe are relatively attractive and away from ones we believe are less attractive we believe that by spreading risks in a more balanced manner and adapting to market conditions the fund can generate more stable returns over time than traditional approaches aqr risk parity fund foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty the use of derivatives forward and futures contracts and commodities exposes the fund to additional risks including increased volatility lack of liquidity and possible losses greater than the fund’s initial investment as well as increased transaction costs this fund enters into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed if the market price of a security increases after the fund borrows the security the fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential fund gains and increase potential fund losses when investing in bonds yield and share price will vary with changes in interest rates and market conditions investors should note that if interest rates rise significantly from current levels bond total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term there is also a chance that

 as of    investment approach risk parity is all about diversification whereas traditional portfolios focus on dollarbased allocation risk parity portfolios focus on riskbased allocation aqrs risk parity fund invests globally across stocks bonds currencies and commodities allocating smaller amounts of capital to assets that are risky and larger amounts to assets that are less risky in building the portfolio we seek assets that we believe are liquid and provide either a positive expected return or some portfolio diversification benefit over the long term we target balanced risk allocation across the four asset classes but we have the ability to exploit tactical opportunities by making modest adjustments or “tilts” toward assets that we believe are relatively attractive and away from ones we believe are less attractive we believe that by spreading risks in a more balanced manner and adapting to market conditions the fund can generate more stable returns over time than traditional

traditional markets through applying a systematic investment process to four well known investment styles value momentum carry and defensive to pursue its investment objective the fund will implement each of the investment styles to invest globally both long and short across the following asset groups equities fixed income and currencies a “long” position will benefit from an increase in price of the asset while a “short” position will benefit from a decrease in price of the asset investment approach aqr has identified four investment strategies that based on its research have delivered positive longterm returns with low correlation to each other across a multitude of asset classes markets and time periods these four investment strategies aqr refers to as the “investment styles” value momentum carry and defensive value — the tendency for relatively cheap assets to outperform relatively expensive ones momentum — the tendency for an asset’s recent relative performance to continue in the future carry — the tendency for higheryielding assets to provide higher returns than loweryielding assets defensive — the tendency for lowerrisk and higherquality assets to generate

november   — aqr capital management llc “aqr” announced today the introduction of a mutual fund that seeks to give financial advisors access to systematic investment styles that based on empirical research have generated longterm positive returns in a wide cross section of asset classes the aqr style premia alternative fund class i qspix employs four styles value momentum carry and defensive value means buying assets that are “cheap” relative to their fundamental value and selling “expensive” assets momentum involves buying assets that recently outperformed their peers and selling those that recently underperformed carry implies buying highyielding and selling lowyielding assets defensive consists of buying lowrisk highquality assets and selling highrisk lowquality assets each of these styles is backed by decades of research and rigorous analysis until now they have been used mainly by large institutional investors in a longonly manner the aqr style premia alternative fund uses these four styles to invest both long and short in several asset group hedging out risks of any one asset class with the goal of remaining market neutral the fund seeks to isolate returns from styles alone and thus increase diversification potential the fund began operation on november   and is distributed through financial advisors only “these investment styles have delivered positive longterm returns with low correlation across a multitude of asset classes using liquid securities” said david g kabiller cfa cofounding principal and head of client strategies at aqr “we think the style premia alternative fund provides investors with a strategic way to gain exposure to a diversifying stream of potential returns” because each style seeks to generate returns that are independent of the others they have historically had low correlations to one other this suggests they are likely to be profitable at different times for different reasons so a portfolio combining all four could help provide a morerobust and diversified stream of returns in addition we have seen these styles as a portfolio exhibit consistent returns in various economic environments “given today’s market valuations we believe investors’ portfolios are even more dominated by equity risk and may be wellserved by these uncorrelated return sources” kabiller added aqr capital management launched its first mutual fund on january   its aqr funds unit has grown to approximately  billion as of september   reflecting its expertise in the development of longonly equity and diversifying alternative investment strategies aqr’s total assets under management were approximately  billion as of september   includes assets managed by cnh partners llc an affiliate — about aqr aqr is a global investment management firm built at the nexus of financial theory and practical application we strive to deliver concrete longterm results by looking past market noise to identify and isolate the factors that matter most and by developing ideas that stand up to rigorous testing by putting theory into practice we have become a leader in alternative strategies and an innovator in traditional portfolio management since  aqr is based in greenwich connecticut with offices in chicago los angeles london sydney and hamilton bermuda — disclosures this fund is not suitable for all investors an investor considering the funds
