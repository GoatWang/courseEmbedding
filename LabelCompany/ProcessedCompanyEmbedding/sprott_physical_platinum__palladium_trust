why the sprott physical platinum and palladium trust is the best pgm bullion fund  sprott physical platinum  palladium trust sppp nysearcasppp  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»why the sprott physical platinum and palladium trust is the best pgm bullion fundnov  about sprott physical sppp ben kramermiller gold  precious metals macro research analyst deep valueminingwealthi recently wrote an article in which i argue that shares of sprott inc otcotcpkspoxf stand to benefit from an increase in revenues realized from the sprott physical bullion trusts in my discussion i list specific benefits that the companys gold nysearcaphys and silver nysearcapslv trusts have over their more popular counterparts the spdr gold trust nysearcagld and the ishares silver trust nysearcaslv however i did not discuss the sprott physical platinum and palladium trust nysearcasppp as i felt that doing so would add substantially to the amount of information that readers had to digest without really adding to my thesis sppp is small and there are no comparable funds given that it holds both platinum and palladium i feel a followup is welcomed given my omission from the aforementioned article although my focus here will be to outline the advantages that the sppp has over other platinum and palladium funds particularly those offered by etf securities nysearcapplt for platinum and nysearcapall for palladium this is the case because not only am i bullish on both platinum and palladium although more so on the latter as i discuss here but because there are very few options available to platinum and palladium investors most of the mines are located in geopolitical hot spots and the few that arent have failed to impress me as potential investment options there are just a handful of etps available to platinum and palladium investors and they are all quite illiquid a feature that reflects trading activity in the futures markets especially for palladium the three that are sizeable enough to consider holding are those already mentioned the etf securities physical platinum trust the etf securities physical palladium trust the sprott physical platinum and palladium trust the first two funds are pretty straightforward in their holdings the sprott trust gives investors exposure to both platinum and palladium although like myself it favors the latter as of the end of october the trust contained  ounces of platinum and  ounces of palladium at current spot prices  for an ounce of platinum and  for an ounce of palladium the fund holds about  palladium and  platinum i think that the sprott fund is superior for the following reasons management fees the sprott trust has an annual expense ratio of  whereas the etf securities offerings each have a  expense ratio making the sprott fund  cheaper tax treatment the platinum and palladium held by the etf securites funds are treated as collectibles and profits on them will be taxed at  profits on sppp holdings will be treated as if it were a stock meaning that if you hold the fund for longer than a year then it will be taxed at  or  depending upon your tax bracket the custodial situation sprotts platinum and palladium are held with a single custodian in canada as stated on sprotts website the trusts hold their bullion assets in custody at a federal crown corporation of the government of canada the custodial situations for the etf security funds are far more complex the platinum and palladium may be held with subcustodians which are chosen by the custodian jp morgan nysejpm subcustodians may employ additional subcustodians to hold the funds platinum or palladium the trustee the bank of new york mellon bk has no say in this if platinum or palladium that is held by a subcustodian is lost then pplt or pall shareholders have limited legal recourse etf securities platinum trust prospectus p  basically if  the custodian gives some of the pplts platinum or palls palladium to a subcustodian to hold  this subcustodian loses or steals some or all of this platinum or palladium and  the custodian can prove in court that  was a reasonable action ie jp morgan had reason to believe in the competence and integrity of the subcustodian then the custodian is not responsible for shareholders losses redemption of shares for bullion investors in the sprott trust can redeem shares for physical platinum and palladium this is not the case for etf securities platinum and palladium products disadvantages of the sprott trust there are two disadvantages to the sprott trust that investors should consider first investors are stuck with the allocation to the two metals chosen by sprott if an investor wants  palladium to  platinum then she can easily do this by buying appropriate amounts of the etf securities funds second the sprott trust is a closedend fund and it can trade at a premium or a discount to its nav in fact given its favorable tax treatment it should trade at a slight premium however for those investors and traders looking for more precise exposure to platinum and palladium the etf securities funds should be a better option nevertheless the lack of liquidity in all three funds means that bidask spreads will be relatively wide and direct exposure to platinum and palladium prices will be difficult to achieve using any of them conclusion while all of these funds have their problems especially for those with a traders mentality the sprott trust has several advantages that make it especially appealing for longer term investors in platinum and palladium disclosure i am long pslv i

high supply risk in the british geological survey’s risk list  the platinum group metals pgms of which platinum and palladium are widely viewed as the most significant received a high supply risk index based on the list’s seven criteria scarcity in the earth’s crust production concentration—location of principal producers and contribution to global supply reserve distribution—global distribution of reserves recycling rate substitutability governance top producing nation and governance top reservehosting nation  overall global increase in demand for platinum and palladium is expected result in continued supply deficit in  a substantial increase in industrial and investment demand is expected to keep the platinum and palladium market in deficit in  according to the johnson matthey platinum  interim review gross demand for platinum is predicted to increase by  which will more than compensate for a slight fall in purchases by the jewellery and autocatalyst sectors with supplies recovering only marginally and little growth in recycling the market is set to move further into deficit primary supplies of palladium are forecast to decline slightly in  mainly due to a drop in sales from russian government stocks with an anticipated  decrease in gross demand and a  jump in recycling the gap between supply and demand is expected to narrow nevertheless remaining in significant deficit anticipated to be  oz  production is highly concentrated in only two countries unlike many other metals that are found in numerous regions the majority of platinum and palladium production is concentrated in south africa and russia which combined to account for estimated  of platinum production and  of palladium production in   dwindling stockpiles of palladium in russia are nearing depletion and may not be able to offset declines in mine production russia is the largest source of palladium through both mining and state sales of stockpiles however the supply of the metal from existing stockpiles is projected to drop in  additionally mining supply from the active mines in the norilsk region of russia is projected to drop due to the declining grades of ore extracted  alternative sources of new supply for platinum and palladium are not readily available the only region expected to increase platinum and palladium production in  is zimbabwe though it remains a relatively small producer of the metals however increasing political tensions and threats over security of tenure in the country has deterred new investment  pgm producers in south africa are highly exposed to the south african rand the depreciating south african rand has helped the producers immensely as labour accounts for a majority of the mining costs prior the decline in the rand these pgm producers were in dire straits as a majority of their operations were losing money however a year trend of declining ore grades and anticipated labour settlements with increased wages are expected to further increase cost and stress balance sheets for these producers demand  there are diverse sources of demand for platinum and palladium more than a quarter of the demand for platinum and palladium is from nonautocatalyst industrial uses for platinum sectors utilizing the metal include petroleum refining electrical glass manufacturing medical biomedical and dental and other manufacturing such as turbines for palladium demand comes from the electronics as resistors and capacitors in circuit boards dental and chemical industries the metals are also used in jewelry particularly platinum which is sought after for its rarity silverywhite lustre and resistance to wear and tarnish  investment demand is expected to reach a record  oz in  south africa’s new randdenominated platinum exchange traded fund has accumulated  oz of metal between its launch in april and the end of september of  this etf is the first to be readily accessible to south african institutional investors who are subject to limits on overseas investments and it therefore benefited from considerable pentup demand over  oz of platinum were purchased in the first month including sales through etfs in other regions as well as bars and coins total physical investment is expected to reach an alltime record of  oz in   more stringent vehicle emission standards continue to drive demand growth for platinumpalladium in autocatalysts due to their powerful catalytic properties platinum and palladium are essential components in catalytic converters in automobiles as they form the surface catalyst upon which the critical chemical reaction converting engine exhaust emissions into neutral compounds occurs resulting in the reduction of the toxic components from combustion there is no widely used substitute for the metals in autocatalysts and emission standards are becoming increasingly stringent across asia increasing platinumpalladium loadings per vehicle demand for palladium in autocatalysts is expected to remain strong in   china is an increasingly important demand driver for both platinum and palladium  strong longterm annualized returns and uncertainty about the global financial system has the potential to take more supply of platinum and palladium off the market the returns on both platinum and palladium outpaced the sp  total return index in the ten years leading up to december   according to bloomberg the manager of the trust believes investor demand through etfs and funds acquiring the physical bullion may increase as investors seek to protect their portfolios from inflation

loginregister search loginregister home  etfcom analysis  a sprott fund that’s not a sprott fund that’s not january   ana kostioukova the recently registered sprott physical platinum and palladium trust is just convoluted a few weeks ago sprott asset management a canadian firm owned and operated by eric sprott filed to launch its third physically backed closedend fund worth  million first off let’s dispel any misconceptions about what an etf truly is to the vast majority of investors out there an etf is an openend fund traded on an exchange that at its core has all the benefits of the creationredemption mechanism that keeps its price pegged as closely as possible to its net asset value calling a closedend mutual fund an etf as reuters did in a story about sprott’s plans simply because it trades on an exchange—is wrong dave nadig and i are on the same page on this he had a similar complaint almost two years ago about the launch of the sprott physical gold trust poor alternatives to gold and silver investing in physically backed funds is a safe haven for jittery investors the benefit of holding physical gold and silver is to guard against economic political or social instability—the more uncertain the outlook the higher the prices of gold and silver meanwhile platinum and palladium perform a bit differently in the market and may not be ideal alternatives to gold and silver platinum group metals pgms have many industrial applications in manufacturing according to the world gold council  percent of platinum and  percent of palladium are used in industry compared to  percent of gold therefore the prices of platinum and palladium partly depend on the demand for the products that they help produce in other words platinum and palladium are more tied to cycles of industrial demand than gold and silver the graph below illustrates the price of gold versus platinum per troy ounce note the drop in price of platinum during the unraveling of the  market crash as well as the surge in gold prices in late  brought on by tension in the middle east sp’s downgrade of us debt and the european sovereign debt crisis for savvy investors who already knew this arguing that the sprott physical platinum and palladium trust is a convoluted investment is hardly a stretch hodgepodge exposure the platinumpalladium fund is markedly different from its physically backed sister funds—sprott physical gold trust nysearca phys and sprott physical silver trust nysearca pslv—since it combines two precious metals in one fund     next last view full article     find
