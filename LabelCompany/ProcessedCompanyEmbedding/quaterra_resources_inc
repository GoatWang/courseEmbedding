after all yerington has a rich history in the silver state from the very beginning yerington was committed to transforming the valley into a land of opportunity around  a small community formed along the trail running through the valley one made up of cowboys farmers and optimistic pioneers looking for a fresh start on april   the rough and tumble community was officially named yerington in honor of a prominent nevadan of the times – henry m yerington superintendent of the virginia and truckee railroad from  in these early days citizens were hopeful that the town would feel a boom if only hm yerington and the powers that be would agree to extend a rail line through the valley yerington excavator excavator loading a  ton haultruck in the anaconda pit  over  million truckloads would come out of the pit from  producing over  billion pounds of copper anaconda haultruck anaconda haultruck dressed up for the nevada day parade  blasting crew blasting crew preparing a charge for a new bench in the anaconda pit  oxide ore processing crushed oxide ore was loaded into eight vat leach tanks each tank could hold  tons of ore and  gallons of solution the ore was leached with sulfuric acid over a hour day cycle copper was then recovered from the leach solution by precipitating the copper using scrap iron  but alas the line never came to be and so the people of yerington sought opportunities through agriculture commerce and of course mining as the years rolled on yerington saw largescale production mines move into the valley and surrounding hills finding rich deposits of copper among other metals as the ’s arrived however these mining camps closed luckily the rich pastures and farmlands continued to keep the small town moving forward into the st century today new hope arises in yerington as the oncedormant mines are again buzzing with activity this time it’s mining exploration being conducted by a number of companies including quaterra resources inc through thick and thin yerington has persevered always with a respect for the past and an eye on the future stock quotes latest news quaterra announces commencement of drilling at groundhog prospect alaska july   quaterra
