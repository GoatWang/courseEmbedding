class b stock received one share of ac class b common stock for each share of gamco class b stock held on the record date subsequent to the spinoff gamco no longer consolidates the financial results of ac for the purposes of its own financial reporting and the historical financial results of ac have been reflected in the companys consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the spinoff date historical aum have similarly been adjusted to remove aum managed by ac our revenues are highly correlated to the level of aum and fees associated with our various investment products rather than our own corporate assets aum which are directly influenced by the level and changes of the overall equity markets can also fluctuate through acquisitions the creation of new products the addition of new accounts or the loss of existing accounts since various equity products have different fees changes in our business mix may also affect revenues at times the performance of our equity products may differ markedly from popular market indices and this can also impact our revenues it is our belief that general stock market trends will have the greatest impact on our level of aum and hence revenues as of december   we had  billion of aum we conduct our investment advisory business principally through gamco institutional and private wealth management and funds advisor funds we also are a distributor of our openend funds through our brokerdealer subsidiary gdistributors organizational chart subsequent to the spinoff this is the current organizational chart of the company image removed  business and investment highlights � on december   the company launched gabelli media mogul moglc  its first in a series of actively managed nontransparent exchange traded managed funds etmfs gabelli media mogul will invest primarily in the media industry specifically in companies that were spunoff from dr john malones liberty media corporation liberty media as constituted in  including companies formed through subsequent mergers of those spinoffs and companies in which liberty media and its successors have invested � on august

on september   gamco completed the initial public offering of the gabelli go anywhere trust the companys th closedend fund this newly organized closedend fund initially traded on the nyse mkt as a  combination consisting of one preferred share at  and three common shares at  each under the symbol ggoc this innovative offering demonstrates the flexibility of the closedend fund structure separate trading on the nyse mkt for the common shares ggo and the series a preferred shares ggoa commenced on november   �  was the first full year of advising the bancroft fund and ellsworth growth and income fund the dinsmore team now manages over  million in aum across three closedend funds  was also the first full year of advising the gabelli value plus trust our first london stock exchange listed closedend fund the fund had  million of aum at december   � net debt improved from  million at december   to  million at december   overview consolidated statements of income investment advisory and incentive fees which are based on the amount and composition of aum in our funds institutional and private wealth management accounts represent our largest source of revenues in addition to the general level and trends of the stock market growth in revenues depends on good investment performance which influences the value of existing aum as well as contributes to higher investment and lower redemption rates and facilitates the ability to attract additional investors while maintaining current fee levels growth in aum is also dependent on being able to access various distribution channels which is usually based on several factors including performance and service a majority of our cash inflows to mutual fund products have come through third party distribution programs including ntf programs we have also been engaged to act as a subadvisor for other much larger financial services companies with much larger sales distribution organizations these subadvisory clients are subject to business combinations that may result in the termination of the relationship the loss of a subadvisory relationship could have a significant impact on our financial results in the future advisory fees from the openend funds closedend funds and subadvisory accounts are computed daily or weekly based on average net assets advisory fees from institutional and private wealth management clients are generally computed quarterly based on account values as of the end of the preceding quarter these revenues are based on aum which is highly correlated to the stock market and
