incorporated by reference in this prospectus and in particular the risks described under risk factors beginning on page s of this prospectus supplement before deciding to invest in the notes   cusip  as   isin us as   s table of contents risk factors an investment in the notes involves risks the following describes all known principal risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the rio tinto group risks may materialize individually simultaneously or in combination there may be additional risks unknown to the rio tinto group and other risks currently believed to be immaterial which could turn out to be material the risk factors outlined below omit the management detail on how each is managed and mitigated the principal risks and uncertainties should be considered in connection with any forwardlooking statements in this prospectus supplement and the cautionary statement on page s of this prospectus supplement prior to making a decision about investing you should carefully consider among other matters these principal risks and uncertainties as well as those incorporated by reference in other filings rio tinto may make from time to time with the sec external risks commodity prices and global demand for the groups products are expected to remain uncertain commodity prices and demand are volatile and strongly influenced by world economic conditions the groups normal policy is to sell its products at prices that reflect the value of its products in the market and not to enter into price hedging arrangements recent volatility in commodity prices and demand may continue which could adversely affect the groups earnings cash flow and mineral reserves furthermore iron ore prices are typically determined on a landed in china basis and increases in the freight market would adversely impact group earnings past strong demand for the groups products in china could be affected by future developments in that country the group is heavily exposed to the chinese market chinas demand for any of the groups products and iron ore in particular could be substantially affected by        an economic slowdown in china        financial or banking market conditions impacting investment        an accelerated shift from infrastructureled to serviceoriented growth or        a material change in energy policy any or all of these may adversely affect the groups profitability and cash position rio tinto is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates the vast majority of the groups sales are denominated in us dollars which is also the currency used for holding surplus cash financing operations and presenting external and internal results although many costs are incurred in us dollars a significant portion are incurred in or influenced by the local currencies of the countries where the group operates principally the australian dollar and canadian dollar the groups normal policy is not to hedge foreign exchange rates and so the group may be adversely affected by appreciation in the value of other currencies against the us dollar or to prolonged periods of exchange rate volatility currency fluctuations may negatively impact the groups profitability and dividend payments as well as rating agency metrics and asset carrying values political legal and commercial changes in the places where the group operates the group operates across a large number of jurisdictions resulting in exposure to a broad spectrum of economies political and legal frameworks and societal norms each jurisdiction poses unique complexities and challenges that in turn impose risks on the value chain from new business development through to closure and rehabilitation and on asset carrying values   s table of contents these can include        difficulty in obtaining agreements leases or permits for new activities        renegotiation unilateral variation or nullification of existing agreements leases and permits        changes in government ownership levels in group businesses        changes in taxation rates regimes or international tax agreements        currency and foreign investment restrictions        limitations to power water energy and infrastructure access and        general increases in regulation and compliance requirements jurisdictionspecific behavior or circumstance may also present uncertainties to the groups operating environment unclear land title and rights to land and resources including indigenous title political and administrative change policy reform and changes in law or government regulation an inherent culture of bribery and corruption violent criminal or sectarian tensions any such jurisdictional instability or legislative uncertainty that impacts the groups operations may result in increased costs curtail or negatively impact existing operations andor prevent the group from making future investments community disputes in the countries and territories in which the group operates some of the groups current and potential operations are located in or near communities that may regard these operations as being detrimental to them community expectations are typically complex with the potential for multiple inconsistent stakeholder views that may be difficult to resolve stakeholder opinion and community acceptance can be subject to many influences for example related industries operations of other groups or local regional or national events in other places where the group operates these disputes can disrupt the groups operations and may increase its costs thereby potentially impacting the groups revenue and profitability in the extreme the groups operations may be a focus for civil unrest or criminal activity which can impact its operational and financial performance as well as its reputation increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect the groups cost of operations the groups operations are energyintensive and depend on fossil fuels in numerous jurisdictions there is increasing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions tighter emission reduction targets and progressive introduction of carbon pricing mechanisms these may raise worldwide energy production and transport costs over the medium to long term which may increase the groups cost base and potentially negatively impact the groups profitability regulations standards and stakeholder expectations regarding health safety environment and community evolve over time and unforeseen changes could have an adverse effect on the groups business and reputation the resources sector is subject to extensive health safety and environmental laws regulations and standards alongside community and stakeholder expectations evolving regulation standards and stakeholder expectations could result in increased costs regulatory action litigation or in extreme cases threaten the viability of an operation strategic risks the groups exploration and development of new projects might be unsuccessful the group identifies new orebodies and mining properties through its exploration program and develops or expands other operations as a means of generating shareholder value exploration is not always successful and   s table of contents there is a high degree of competition to develop worldclass orebodies the group may also not be able to source or maintain adequate project financing or may be unable to find willing and suitable joint venture partners to share the cost of developing large projects furthermore project execution may not proceed as planned and project budgets and schedules may prove inaccurate all of which may negatively impact the groups profitability and the mineral resources from which future cash flows should come rio tinto may fail to successfully execute divestments and acquisitions the group may not be able to successfully divest assets it wishes to sell resulting in unforeseen pressure on its cash position or reducing the groups ability to expand operations as a means of generating shareholder value all business combinations or acquisitions entail a number of risks including the cost of effectively integrating acquisitions to realize synergies significant writeoffs or restructuring charges and unanticipated costs and liabilities the group may also be liable for the past acts omissions or liabilities it has acquired that were unforeseen or greater than anticipated the group may also face liabilities for divested entities if the buyer fails to honor all commitments or the group agrees to retain certain liabilities large outsourcing programs may result in exposure to third party failure or loss of intellectual property the group is implementing business transformation programs to increase efficiency these include outsourcing and offshoring elements of important business support delivery as well as increasing procurement of goods and services from emerging market suppliers the group may be exposed to business continuity failure impacting financial performance loss of intellectual property or data data privacy violations andor reputational damage as a result of thirdparty failure or actions financial risks the groups reported results could be adversely affected by the impairment of assets including goodwill the group may be required to record impairment charges as a result of adverse developments in the recoverable values of its assets including goodwill significant assumptions in the determination of recoverable value include but are not limited to pricing of the groups commodities and products reserves and resources infrastructure availability discount and foreign currency exchange rates operating and development cost projections and the timing of expenditure and revenues related to major projects in addition the occurrence of unexpected events or events beyond the groups control that adversely impact its business may have an impact on the assumptions underlying the recoverable value of its assets the foregoing items are not exhaustive and impairments may be caused by factors currently unknown to the group to the extent that the recoverable value of an asset is impaired such impairment will negatively impact the groups profitability during the relevant period discount rates used in determining provisions and asset valuations may change causing changes to provisions asset carrying values and capital allocation discount rates are utilized to determine provisions for costs of known future obligations such as closedown and remediation as well as valuing assets for impairment testing and capital allocation purposes discount rates may vary over time as underlying assumptions change these assumptions include observable long term government bond yields market risk premiums and other situational changes such as change in political stability in a particular jurisdiction changes to the discount rate may impact the size of provisions recognised lead to changes in the carrying value of assets or alter the capital allocated to various projects   s table of contents the groups liquidity and cash flow expectations may not be realized inhibiting planned expenditure both the groups ability to fund planned expenditure such as capital growth mergers and acquisitions innovation and other objectives or obligations as well as the ability to weather a major economic downturn could be compromised by inadequate access to sufficient liquidity including external financing sources such as bank financing or capital markets failure to reduce costs may result in reduced margins failure to reduce costs may have an adverse impact on the groups operating margins and the viability of the groups capital expansion projects operational risks estimates of ore reserves are based on uncertain assumptions that if changed could result in the need to restate ore reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves including subjective judgments and determinations that are based on available geological technical contract and economic information previously valid assumptions may change significantly with new information which may result in changes to the economic viability of some reserves and the need for them to be restated in addition volatility in commodity prices can result in substantial adjustments in the groups recognition of ore reserves labor disputes could lead to lost production andor increased costs some of the groups employees including employees in nonmanaged operations are represented by labor unions under various collective labor agreements the group may not be able to renegotiate agreements satisfactorily when they expire and may face difficult negotiations higher wage demands or industrial action in addition labor agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage and labor disputes may arise even in circumstances where the groups employees are not represented by labor unions some of the groups technologies are unproven and failures could adversely impact costs andor productivity the group has invested in and implemented new technologies both in information systems and in operational initiatives some of which are unproven and their eventual viability cannot be assessed with certainty the actual benefits of these technologies may differ materially from expectations the group may be exposed to major failures in the supply chain for specialist services equipment and materials rio tinto operates within a complex supply chain depending on suppliers of materials services equipment and infrastructure and on providers of logistics supply chain failures or significantly increased costs within the supply chain for whatever reason could have an adverse effect on the groups business joint ventures strategic partnerships or nonmanaged operations may not be successful and may not comply with the groups standards the group participates in several joint venture and partnership arrangements and it may enter into others all of which involve risk whether or not the group holds majority interests or maintains operational control in its joint ventures its partners may        have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with or opposed to those of the group        exercise veto rights to block actions that the group believes are in its or the joint ventures best interests or   s table of contents      be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture or other agreements such as contributing capital to expansion or maintenance projects where these joint ventures are controlled and managed by others the group may provide expertise and advice but has limited control over compliance with its standards and objectives controlling partners may take action contrary to the groups interests or policies resulting in adverse impact to the groups operations financial performance legal liability or reputation the groups operations are vulnerable to a range of interruptions not all of which are covered fully by insurance natural disasters and events mining smelting refining and infrastructure installations are vulnerable to natural events including earthquakes subsidence drought flood fire storm and climate change sustained operational difficulties operating difficulties are many and various ranging from geological variations that could result in significant ground or containment failure to breakdown of key capital equipment reliable roads rail networks ports power generation and transmission and water supplies are required to access and conduct rio tintos operations and deliver product to market limitations delayed development bottlenecks or interruptions in transport infrastructure including as a result of third parties gaining access to rio tintos integrated facilities could impede its ability to deliver products information technology and cyber security the group relies heavily on information technology and process control systems to support its business in common with most large global companies the group has experienced cyber attacks and is faced with ongoing threats to the confidentiality integrity and availability of such systems an extended failure of critical system components caused by accidental or malicious actions including those resulting from a cyber security attack could result in a significant environmental health or safety incident commercial loss or interruption to operations major operational failure the groups operations involve chemicals and other substances stored under high temperature and pressure with the potential for fire explosion or other loss of control of the process leading to a release of hazardous materials this could occur by accident systems failure or a breach of operating standards and could result in a significant environmental health or safety incident sustained pandemic the group has exploration development projects and operations in numerous countries and is reliant on effective global shippingtransportation movements to deliver product to markets the sustained outbreak of a pandemic may result in health exposure to the groups workforce as well as the temporary closure of a site or access to shippingtransportation movements adversely impacting financial performance the groups insurance does not cover every potential loss associated with its operations and adequate coverage at reasonable rates is not always obtainable in addition insurance provision may not fully cover its liability or the consequences of any business interruption any occurrence not fully covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on the groups business   s table of contents the group depends on the continued services of key personnel the groups ability to maintain its competitive position is dependent on the services of a wide range of highlyskilled and experienced personnel available in the locations where they are needed failure to recruit and retain key staff and the inability to deploy staff worldwide where they are most needed could affect the groups business similar constraints may be felt by the groups key consultants contractors and suppliers thereby impacting the groups operations expansion plans or business more generally the groups costs of close down reclamation and rehabilitation could be higher than expected closedown and reclamation works to return operating sites to the community can be extensive and costly estimated costs are provided for and updated annually over the life of each operation but the provisions might prove to be inadequate due to changes in legislation standards and the emergence of new or increase in the cost of reclamation techniques in addition the expected timing of expenditure could change significantly due to changes in the business environment that might vary the life of an operation risks relating to the notes since rio tinto plc and rio tinto limited are holding companies and currently conduct their operations through subsidiaries your right to receive payments on the guarantees is subordinated to the other liabilities of their subsidiaries rio tinto plc and rio tinto limited are organized as holding companies and substantially all of their operations are carried on through subsidiaries their principal source of income is the dividends and distributions they receive from their subsidiaries the ability of rio tinto plc and rio tinto limited to meet their financial obligations is dependent upon the availability of cash flows from their domestic and foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies through dividends intercompany advances management fees and other payments these subsidiaries and affiliated companies are not required to and may not be able to pay dividends or make distributions to rio tinto plc and rio tinto limited claims of the creditors of the subsidiaries of rio tinto plc and rio tinto limited have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over the claims of rio tinto plc or rio tinto limited consequently holders of notes guaranteed by rio tinto plc and rio tinto limited are structurally subordinated to the prior claims of the creditors of subsidiaries of rio tinto plc and rio tinto limited in addition some of rio tintos subsidiaries are subject to laws restricting the amount of dividends they may pay for example these laws may prohibit dividend payments when net assets fall below subscribed share capital when the subsidiary lacks available profits or when the subsidiary fails to meet certain capital and reserve requirements english and australian law prohibits those subsidiaries incorporated in the united kingdom and australia respectively from paying dividends unless these payments are made out of distributable profits these profits consist of accumulated realized profits which have not been previously utilized by distribution or capitalization less accumulated realized losses which have not been previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital duly made other statutory

of intercompany loans since the notes are unsecured your right to receive payments may be adversely affected the notes that we are offering will be unsecured if we default on the notes or rio tinto defaults on the guarantees or after bankruptcy liquidation or reorganization then to the extent that we or rio tinto have granted security over our or rio tintos assets the assets that secure our or rio tintos debts will be used to satisfy the obligations under that secured debt before we or rio tinto could make payment on the notes or the guarantees there may only be limited assets available to

public market there can be no assurance regarding the future development of a market for the notes or the ability of holders of the notes to sell their notes or the price at which such holders may be able to sell their notes if such a market were to develop the notes could trade at prices that may be higher or lower than the initial offering price depending on many factors including among other things prevailing interest rates our or rio tintos operating results and the market for similar notes the underwriters may make a market in the notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations however the underwriters are not obligated to do so and any such marketmaking activities with respect to the notes may be discontinued at any time without notice therefore there can be no assurance as

tinto or other unsecured creditors to prevent or delay the secured creditors from enforcing their security to repay the debts due to them rio tinto limited and rio tinto finance usa limited are

income the savings directive requires eu member states to provide to the tax authorities of other eu member states details of payments of interest and other similar income paid by a person established within its jurisdiction to or secured by such a person for the benefit of an individual resident or to or secured for certain other types of entity established in that other eu member state except that austria will instead impose a withholding system for a transitional period subject to a procedure whereby on meeting certain conditions the beneficial owner of the interest or other income may request that no tax be withheld unless during such period it elects otherwise   s table of contents the council of the european union has adopted a directive the amending savings directive which would when implemented amend and broaden the scope of the requirements of the savings directive described above including by expanding the range of payments covered by the savings directive in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities and by expanding the circumstances in which payments must be reported or paid subject to withholding for example payments made to or secured for i an entity or legal arrangement effectively managed in an eu member state that is not subject to effective taxation or ii a person entity or legal arrangement established or effectively managed outside of the eu and outside any third country or territory that has adopted similar measures to the savings directive which indirectly benefit an individual resident in an eu member state may fall within the scope of the savings directive as amended the amending savings directive requires eu member states to adopt national legislation necessary to comply with it by  january  which legislation must apply from  january  the european commission has published a proposal for a council directive repealing the savings directive from  january   january  in the case of austria in each case subject to transitional arrangements the proposal also provides that if it is adopted eu member states will not be required to implement the amending savings directive if a payment were to be made or collected through an eu member state which has opted for a withholding system and an amount of or in respect of tax were to be withheld from that payment pursuant to any law implementing the savings directive or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ecofin council meeting of  november  or any law implementing or complying with or introduced in order to conform to such directive neither we nor any paying agent nor any other person would be obliged to pay additional amounts with respect to any debt security as a result of the imposition of such withholding tax furthermore if the amending directive is implemented and takes effect in eu member states such withholding may occur in a wider range of circumstances than at present as explained

described in the preceding paragraph libor for the relevant interest determination date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for loans of the following kind to leading european banks quoted at approximately  am london time in the principal financial center for the country of the index currency on that interest determination date by three major banks in that financial center selected by the calculation agent loans of the index currency having the relevant index maturity beginning on the relevant interest reset date and in a representative amount        if fewer than three banks selected by the calculation agent provide quotations as described above libor for the new interest period will be libor in effect for the prior interest period if the initial base rate has been in effect for the prior interest period however it will remain in effect the reference banks and dealers employed by the calculation agent in determining the base rate may include the calculation agent itself and its affiliates guarantees both rio tinto plc and rio tinto limited will fully and unconditionally guarantee the payment of the principal of premium if any and interest on the debt securities including any additional amounts which may be payable in respect of the debt securities as described under  special situations  payment of additional amounts rio tinto plc and rio tinto limited guarantee the payment of such amounts when such amounts become due and payable whether at the stated maturity of the debt securities by declaration or acceleration call for redemption or otherwise each of rio tinto plc and rio tinto limited is individually obligated to pay such amounts legal ownership street name and other indirect holders investors who hold debt securities in accounts at banks or brokers will generally not be recognized by us as legal holders of debt securities this is called holding in street name instead we would recognize only the bank or broker or the financial institution the bank or broker uses to hold its debt securities these intermediary banks brokers and other financial institutions pass along principal interest and other payments on the debt securities either because they agree to do so in their customer agreements or because they are legally required to do so holders of debt securities who hold in street name should check with their institutions to find out        how it handles payments in respect of the debt securities and notices    table of contents      whether it imposes fees or charges        how it would handle voting if it were ever required        whether and how holders can instruct it to send their debt securities registered in their own names so they can be direct holders as described below and        how it would pursue rights under the debt securities if there were a default or other event triggering the need for holders to act to protect their interests direct holders our obligations as well as the obligations of the trustee and those of any third parties employed by us or the trustee run only to persons who are registered as holders of debt securities as noted above we do not have obligations to holders who hold in street name or other indirect means either because such holders choose to hold debt securities in that manner or because the debt securities are issued in the form of global securities as described below for example once we make payment to the registered holder we have no further responsibility for the payment even if that holder is legally required to pass the payment along to the street name customer but does not do so global securities what is a global security a global security is a special type of indirectly held security as described above under  street name and other indirect holders if we choose to issue debt securities in the form of global securities the ultimate beneficial owners can only be indirect holders we require that the global security be registered in the name of a financial institution we select in addition we require that the debt securities included in the global security not be transferred to the name of any other direct holder unless the special circumstances described below occur the financial institution that acts as the sole direct holder of the global security is called the depositary any person wishing to own a security must do so indirectly by virtue of an account with a broker bank or other financial institution that in turn has an account with the depositary the prospectus supplement indicates whether a particular series of debt securities will be issued only in the form of global securities special investor considerations for global securities as an indirect holder an investors rights relating to a global security will be governed by the account rules of the investors financial institution and of the depositary as well as general laws relating to securities transfers we do not recognize this type of investor as a holder of debt securities and instead deal only with the depositary that holds the global security investors in debt securities that are issued only in the form of global debt securities should be aware that        they cannot get debt securities registered in their own names        they cannot receive physical certificates for their interests in the debt securities        they will be street name holders and must look to their own banks or brokers for payments on the debt securities and protection of their legal rights relating to the debt securities as explained earlier under  legal ownership  street name and other indirect holders        they may not be able to sell interests in the debt securities to some insurance companies and other institutions that are required by law to own their debt securities in the form of physical certificates        the depositarys policies will govern payments transfers exchange and other matters relating to holders interests in the global security we and the trustee have no responsibility for any aspect of the depositarys actions or for its records of ownership interests in the global security we and the trustee also do not supervise the depositary in any way        the depositary will require that interests in a global security be purchased or sold within its system using sameday funds    table of contents special situations when global security will be terminated in a few special situations described later the global security will terminate and interests in it will be exchanged for physical certificates representing debt securities after that exchange the choice of whether to hold debt securities directly or in street name will be up to the investor investors must consult their own bank or brokers to find out how to have their interests in debt securities transferred to their own name so that they will be direct holders the rights of street name investors and direct holders in the debt securities have been previously described in the subsections entitled  legal ownership  street name and other indirect holders and  direct holders the special situations for termination of a global security are        when the depositary notifies us or rio tinto that it is unwilling unable or no longer qualified to continue as depositary        when an event of default on the debt securities has occurred and has not been cured defaults are discussed below under  default and related matters  events of default the prospectus supplement may also list additional situations for terminating a global security that would apply only to the particular series of debt securities covered by the prospectus supplement when a global security terminates the depositary and not we or the trustee is responsible for deciding the names of the institutions that will be the initial direct holders  sections  and   overview of remainder of this description the remainder of this description summarizes        additional mechanics relevant to the debt securities under normal circumstances such as how to transfer ownership and where we make payments        holders rights under several special situations  such as if we merge with another company if we want to change a term of the debt securities or if we want to redeem the debt securities for tax reasons        holders rights to receive payment of additional amounts due to changes in the withholding requirements of various jurisdictions        covenants contained in the indenture that restrict our and rio tintos ability to incur liens a particular series of debt securities may have additional covenants        holders rights if we or rio tinto default in respect of our or rio tintos obligations under the debt securities or experience other financial difficulties        our relationship with the trustee  additional mechanics exchange and transfer the debt securities will be issued        only in fully registered form        without interest coupons and        unless indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement in denominations that are even multiples of us holders may have their debt securities broken into more debt securities of smaller denominations or combined into fewer debt securities of larger denominations as long as the total principal amount is not changed  section   this is called an exchange holders may exchange or transfer their debt securities at the office of the trustee the trustee acts as our agent for registering debt securities in the names of holders and transferring the securities we may change this    table of contents appointment to another entity or perform the service ourselves the entity performing the role of maintaining the list of registered holders is called the security registrar it will also register transfers of the debt securities  section   holders will not be required to pay a service charge to transfer or exchange debt securities but may be required to pay for any tax or other governmental charge associated with the exchange or transfer the transfer or exchange of a registered debt security will only be made if the security registrar is satisfied with a holders proof of ownership if we have designated additional transfer agents they are named in the prospectus supplement we may cancel the designation of any particular transfer agent we may also approve a change in the office through which any transfer agent acts  section   if the debt securities are redeemable and we redeem less than all of the debt securities of a particular series we may block the transfer or exchange of debt securities during a specified period of time in order to freeze the list of holders to prepare the mailing the period begins  days before the day we mail the notice of redemption and ends on the day of that mailing we may also refuse to register transfers or exchanges of debt securities selected for redemption however we will continue to permit transfers and exchanges of the unredeemed portion of any security being partially redeemed  section   payment and paying agents we will pay interest to holders who are direct holders listed in the trustees records at the close of business on a particular day in advance of each due date for interest even if such holders no longer own the security on the interest due date that particular day usually the clearing system business day immediately prior to the interest due date is called the regular record date and is stated in the prospectus supplement  section   we will pay interest principal and any other money due on your debt securities at the corporate trust office of the trustee in new york city that office is currently located at  barclay street new york ny  holders must make arrangements to have payments picked up at or wired from that office we may also choose to pay interest by mailing checks interest on global securities will be paid to the holder thereof by wire transfer of sameday funds holders buying and selling debt securities must work out between them how to compensate for the fact that we will pay all the interest for an interest period to in the case of registered debt securities the one who is the registered holder on the regular record date the most common manner is to adjust the sales price of the debt securities to prorate interest fairly between buyer and seller this prorated interest amount is called accrued interest   street name and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how they will receive payments we or rio tinto may also arrange for additional payment offices and may cancel or change these offices including our or rio tintos use of the trustees corporate trust office these offices are called paying agents we may also choose to act as our own paying agent we must notify holders of changes in the paying agents for any particular series of debt securities  section   notices we and the trustee will send notices only to direct holders using their addresses as listed in the trustees records  sections  and      table of contents regardless of who acts as paying agent all money that we pay to a paying agent that remains unclaimed at the end of two years after the amount is due to direct holders will be repaid to us after that twoyear period holders may look only to us for payment and not to the trustee any other paying agent or anyone else  section   special situations mergers and similar events we rio tinto plc and rio tinto limited are generally permitted to consolidate or merge with another entity we rio tinto plc and rio tinto limited are also permitted to sell or lease substantially all of our assets to another entity or to buy or lease substantially all of the assets of another entity however rio tinto finance usa limited may only take these actions if the successor entity is incorporated or organized under the laws of australia any state thereof or the united states any state thereof or the district of columbia and rio tinto finance usa plc may only take these actions if the successor entity is incorporated or organized under the laws of the united kingdom or any political subdivision thereof or the united states any state thereof or the district of columbia in addition neither we rio tinto plc nor rio tinto limited may take any of these actions unless all the following conditions are met        where rio tinto finance usa limited rio tinto finance usa plc rio tinto plc or rio tinto limited merges out of existence or sells or leases substantially all its assets the successor entity must be duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction        if such successor entity is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than australia the united kingdom or the united states any state thereof or the district of columbia it must indemnify holders against any governmental charge or other cost resulting from the transaction        neither we rio tinto plc nor rio tinto limited may be in default on the debt securities or guarantees immediately prior to such action and such action must not cause a default for purposes of this nodefault test a default would include an event of default that has occurred and not been cured as described under  default and related matters  events of default  what is an event of default a default for this purpose would also include any event that would be an event of default if the requirements for notice of default or existence of defaults for a specified period of time were disregarded        if we rio tinto plc or rio tinto limited merges out of existence or sells or leases substantially all of our or their assets the successor entity must execute a supplement to the indenture known as a supplemental indenture in the supplemental indenture the entity must promise to be bound by every obligation in the indenture applicable to rio tinto finance usa limited rio tinto finance usa plc rio tinto plc or rio tinto limited as the case may be        we rio tinto plc or rio tinto limited as the case may be must deliver a certificate and an opinion of counsel to the trustee each stating that the consolidation merger conveyance transfer or lease and if applicable the supplemental indenture pursuant to which the successor entity assumes our obligations or the obligations of rio tinto plc or rio tinto limited are in compliance with the indenture        neither our nor rio tintos assets or properties may become subject to any impermissible lien unless the debt securities issued under the indenture are secured equally and ratably with the indebtedness secured by the impermissible lien impermissible liens are described in further detail below under  restrictive covenants  restrictions on liens under the indenture rio tinto or any rio tinto subsidiary may assume our obligations under the debt securities this would likely be a taxable event to us holders us holders would likely be treated as having exchanged their debt securities for other debt securities issued by rio tinto or such subsidiary and therefore may have to recognize gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes upon such assumption    table of contents modification and waiver there are three types of changes we can make to the indenture and the debt securities changes requiring the approval of all holders first there are changes that cannot be made to the debt securities without the specific approval of each holder of the debt securities of the applicable series following is a list of those types of changes        changes to the stated maturity of the principal or the interest payment dates on a debt security        any reduction in amounts due on a debt security        changes to any of our or rio tintos obligations to pay additional amounts described later under  special situations  payment of additional amounts        any reduction in the amount of principal payable upon acceleration of the maturity of a debt security following a default        changes in the place or currency of payment on a debt security        any impairment of holders right to sue for payment        any reduction in the percentage of holders of debt securities whose consent is

waive various defaults and        any modification in any manner adverse to the holders of the debt securities to the obligations of rio tinto plc or rio tinto limited in respect of the payment of principal premium if any and interest if any  section   changes requiring a majority vote the second type of change to the indenture and the debt securities is the kind that requires a vote in favor by holders of debt securities owning a majority of the principal amount of the particular series affected most changes fall into this category except for clarifying changes amendments supplements and other changes that would not adversely affect holders of the debt securities in any material respect the same vote would be required for us to obtain a waiver of all or part of the covenants described below or a waiver of a past default however we cannot obtain a waiver of a payment default or any other aspect of the indenture or the debt securities listed in the first category described previously under  changes requiring the approval of all holders unless we obtain the individual consent of each holder to the waiver  section   changes not requiring approval the third type of change does not require any vote by holders of debt securities this type is limited to clarifications and other changes that would not adversely affect holders of the debt securities in any material respect  section   further details concerning voting when taking a vote we will use the following rules to decide how much principal amount to attribute to a security        for original issue discount securities we will use the principal amount that would be due and payable on the voting date if the maturity of the debt securities were accelerated to that date because of a default        for debt securities whose principal amount is not known for example because it is based on an index we will use a special rule for that security described in the prospectus supplement        for debt securities denominated in one or more foreign currencies or currency units we will use the us dollar equivalent        debt securities will not be considered outstanding and therefore not eligible to vote if we have deposited or set aside in trust money for their payment or redemption debt securities will also not be    table of contents   eligible to vote if they have been fully defeased as described later under  restrictive covenants  defeasance and discharge  section          we will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the holders of outstanding debt securities that are entitled to vote or take other action under the indenture in limited circumstances the trustee will be entitled to set a record date for action by holders if we or the trustee set a record date for a vote or other action to be taken by holders of a particular series that vote or action may be taken only by persons who are holders of outstanding debt securities of that series on the record date and must be taken within  days following the record date or another period that we may specify or as the trustee may specify if it set the record date we may shorten or lengthen but not beyond  days this period from time to time  section     street name and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how approval may be granted or denied if we seek to change the indenture or the debt securities or request a waiver optional tax redemption the debt securities of any series may be redeemed in whole but not in part in the three situations described below the redemption price for the debt securities will be equal to the principal amount of the debt securities being redeemed plus accrued interest and any additional amounts due on the date fixed for redemption holders must receive between  and  days notice before their debt securities are redeemed the first situation is where as a result of a change in or amendment to any laws regulations or rulings or the official application or interpretation of such laws regulations or rulings or any change in the official application or interpretation of or any execution of or any amendment to any treaty or treaties affecting taxation any of we rio tinto plc or rio tinto limited determines that it would be required to pay additional amounts as described later under  payment of additional amounts the second situation is where as a result of a change in or amendment to any laws rulings or regulations or the official application or interpretation of such laws rulings or regulations or any change in the official application or interpretation of or any execution of or any amendment to any treaty or treaties affecting taxation rio tinto plc or rio tinto limited or any subsidiary of either of them determines that it would have to deduct or withhold tax on any payment to us to enable it to make a payment of principal or interest on a debt security in the first and second situations the option to redeem the debt securities applies only in the case of changes or amendments that occur on or after the date specified in the prospectus supplement for the applicable series of debt securities and in the jurisdiction where rio tinto plc and rio tinto limited are incorporated if we rio tinto plc or rio tinto limited as the case may be have been succeeded by another entity the applicable jurisdiction will be the jurisdiction in which such successor entity is organized and the applicable date will be the date the entity became a successor in addition in the case of the first and second situations we rio tinto plc or rio tinto limited will not have the option to redeem if we could have avoided the payment of additional amounts or the deduction or withholding by using reasonable measures available to us the third situation is where following a merger or consolidation of rio tinto plc or rio tinto limited or a transfer or lease of all of rio tinto plcs or rio tinto limiteds assets the person formed by such merger consolidation transfer or lease is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the united states the united kingdom or australia or any political subdivisions thereof and is required to pay additional amounts as described under  payment of additional amounts we rio tinto plc or rio tinto limited shall deliver to the trustee

or on account of any present or future tax assessment duty or other governmental charge of any nature whatsoever imposed levied or collected by or on behalf of a relevant taxing jurisdiction will not be less than the amount that would have been payable on that debt security in the absence of such deduction or withholding however we rio tinto plc or rio tinto limited as the case may be will not be required to make any payment of additional amounts in respect of taxes imposed as a result of any of the following circumstances        if the holder is a us person and the us government or any political subdivision of the us government is the entity that is imposing the tax or governmental charge for this purpose a us person is any person who for us federal income tax purposes is a citizen

the principal property the restriction on sales and leasebacks does not apply to any sale and leaseback transaction between any companies of the rio tinto group it also does not apply to any lease

enter into sale and leaseback transactions at the date of this prospectus a substantial portion of our and rio tintos consolidated assets is held directly by subsidiaries and so would not be subject to the covenant restricting sale and leaseback transactions the covenant allows us or rio tinto to enter into sale and leaseback transactions in two additional situations first we or rio tinto may enter sale and leaseback transactions if we could grant a lien on the property in an amount equal to the indebtedness attributable to the sale and leaseback transaction without being required to grant an equivalent or higherranking lien to the holders of the debt securities under the restriction on liens described above second we or rio tinto may enter sales and leaseback transactions if within one year of the transaction we or rio tinto as the case may be invest an amount equal to at least the net proceeds of the sale of the principal property that we or rio tinto as the case may be lease in the transaction or the fair value of that property whichever is greater this amount must be invested in any of our or rio tintos property or used to retire indebtedness for money that we borrowed incurred or assumed that either has a maturity of  months or more from the date of incurrence of the indebtedness or which may be extended beyond  months from that date at our and rio tintos option

differently than if we did not make the deposit and just repaid the debt securities ourselves however even if we rio tinto plc or rio tinto limited take these actions a number of our obligations relating to the debt securities will remain these include the following obligations        to register the transfer and exchange of debt securities        to replace mutilated destroyed lost or

else specifying any default  section   regarding the trustee if an event of default occurs or an event occurs that would be an event of default if the requirements for giving default notice or the default having to exist for a specific period of time were disregarded the trustee may be considered to have a conflicting interest with respect to the debt securities for purposes of the trust

supplement clearance and settlement procedures  dtc dtc participants that hold securities through dtc on behalf of investors will follow the settlement practices applicable to us corporate debt obligations in dtcs sameday funds settlement system debt securities will be credited to the securities custody accounts of these dtc participants against payment in the sameday funds for payments in us dollars on the settlement date for payments in a currency other than us dollars securities will be credited free of payment on the settlement date clearance and settlement procedures  euroclear

dtc participants involved trading between euroclear andor clearstream luxembourg participants we understand that secondary market trading between euroclear andor clearstream luxembourg participants will occur in the ordinary way following the applicable rules and operating procedures of euroclear and clearstream luxembourg secondary market trading will be settled using procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in registered form trading between a dtc seller and a euroclear or clearstream luxembourg purchaser a purchaser of debt securities that are held in the account of a dtc participant must send instructions to euroclear or clearstream luxembourg at least one business day prior to settlement the instructions will provide for the transfer of the securities from the selling dtc participants account to the account of the purchasing euroclear or clearstream luxembourg participant euroclear or clearstream luxembourg as the case may be will then instruct the common depositary for euroclear and clearstream luxembourg to receive the debt securities either against payment or free of payment the beneficial interests in the debt securities will be credited to the respective clearing system the clearing system will then credit the account of the participant following its usual procedures credit for the debt securities will appear on the next day european time cash debit will be backvalued to and the interest on the debt securities will accrue from the value date which would be the preceding day when settlement occurs in new york if the trade fails and settlement is not completed on the intended date the euroclear or clearstream luxembourg cash debit will be valued as of the actual settlement date instead euroclear participants or clearstream luxembourg participants will need the funds necessary to process sameday funds settlement the most direct means of doing this is to preposition funds for settlement either from cash or from existing lines of credit as for any settlement occurring within euroclear or clearstream luxembourg under this approach participants may take on credit exposure to euroclear or clearstream luxembourg until the securities are credited to their accounts one business day later as an alternative if euroclear or clearstream luxembourg has extended a line of credit to them participants can choose not to preposition funds and will allow that credit line to be drawn upon to finance settlement under this procedure euroclear participants or clearstream luxembourg participants purchasing debt securities would incur overdraft charges for one business day assuming they cleared the overdraft as soon as the debt securities were credited to their accounts however interest on the debt securities would accrue from the value date therefore in many cases the investment income on debt securities that is earned during that one business day period may substantially reduce or offset the amount of the overdraft charges this result will however depend on each participants particular cost of funds because the settlement will take place during new york business hours dtc participants will use their usual procedures to deliver debt securities to the depositary on behalf of euroclear participants or clearstream luxembourg participants the sale proceeds will be available to the dtc seller on the settlement date for the dtc participants then a crossmarket transaction will settle no differently than a trade between two dtc participants special timing considerations you should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries payments and other communications involving debt securities through clearstream luxembourg and euroclear on days when those    table of contents systems are open for business those systems may not be open for business on days when banks brokers and other institutions are open for business in the united states in addition because of timezone differences there may be problems with completing transactions involving clearstream luxembourg and euroclear on the same business day as in the united states us investors who wish to transfer their interests in the debt securities or to receive or make a payment or delivery of debt securities on a particular day may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in luxembourg or brussels depending on whether clearstream luxembourg or euroclear is used    table of contents taxation this section describes the material australian uk and us federal

pursuant to its guarantee of rtl debt securities to united states holders other than those holding the debt securities in the course of carrying on a business at or through an australian establishment whether payments under the guarantee would be interest for withholding tax purposes is not clear the australian taxation offices ruling as reflected in taxation determination td  is that such payments under a guarantee would be interest for withholding tax purposes however that determination also states that guarantee payments would be treated as exempt from withholding tax under section f if the requirements of that section are satisfied therefore if the requirements of section f as described above are satisfied in relation to the debt securities interest withholding tax should not be

plc under deduction of united kingdom income tax at the basic rate currently  subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any applicable double tax treaty or any other relief that may apply it is not entirely clear whether payments by rio tinto plc under the guarantee in respect of interest on the debt securities are eligible for the quoted eurobond exemption and therefore it is possible that such payments may be subject to withholding or deduction for or on account of united kingdom tax at the basic rate currently  subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any applicable double tax treaty or any other relief that may apply certain holders of debt securities who are us residents may be entitled to receive payments free of deductions for or on account of united kingdom tax under the double taxation treaty between the united kingdom and the united states and may therefore be able to obtain a direction to that effect from hmrc holders of debt securities who are resident in other jurisdictions may also be able to receive payment free of deductions or subject to a lower rate of deduction under an appropriate double taxation treaty and may be able to obtain a direction from hmrc to that effect however such a direction will in either case only be issued on prior application to hmrc by the holder in question if such a direction is not in place at the time a payment of interest is made the person making the payment will be required to withhold tax although a holder of debt securities resident in a jurisdiction outside of the united kingdom who is entitled to relief may subsequently claim the amount withheld from hmrc payments by rio tinto finance usa plc in respect of interest on the rtp debt securities and payments by rio tinto plc under the guarantee in respect of interest on the debt securities will have a united kingdom source and accordingly may be chargeable to united kingdom tax by direct assessment where the interest is paid without withholding or deduction the interest will not be assessed to united kingdom tax in the hands of holders of the debt securities who are not resident in the united kingdom except where     i in the case of corporate holders such persons carry on a trade in the united kingdom through a united kingdom permanent establishment or     ii in the case of other holders such persons carry on

rio tinto finance usa plc in respect of interest on the rtp debt securities and payments by rio tinto plc under the guarantee in respect of interest on the debt securities are subject to withholding or deduction for or on account of united kingdom taxation then the provisions referred to in description of guaranteed debt securities  payment of additional amounts may apply so that the net amount received by the holders after such reduction will not be less than the amount the holders would have received in the absence of such withholding or deduction holders of the debt securities should note that the provisions relating to additional amounts referred to in description of guaranteed debt securities  payment of additional amounts would not apply if hmrc sought to assess directly the person entitled to the relevant interest to united kingdom tax however exemption from or reduction of such united kingdom tax liability might be available under an applicable double

the event we issue contingent payment debt instruments the applicable prospectus supplement will describe the us federal income tax consequences thereof a debt security other than a debt security with a term of one year or less a shortterm debt security will be treated as issued with oid a discount debt security if the excess of the debt securitys stated redemption price at maturity over its issue price is equal to or more than a de minimis amount  of the debt securitys stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years to its maturity an obligation that provides for the payment of amounts other than qualified stated interest before maturity an installment obligation will be treated as a discount debt security if the excess of the debt securitys stated redemption price at maturity over its issue price is greater than  of the debt securitys stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the weighted average maturity of the debt security a debt securitys weighted average maturity is the sum of the following amounts determined for each payment on a debt security other than a payment of qualified stated interest i the number of complete years from the issue date until the payment is made multiplied by ii a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of the payment and the denominator of which is the debt securitys stated redemption price at maturity generally the issue price of a debt security will be the first price at which a substantial amount of debt securities included in the issue of which the debt security is a part is sold to persons other than bond houses brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters placement agents or wholesalers the stated redemption price at maturity of a debt security is the total of all payments provided by the debt security that are not payments of qualified stated interest a qualified stated interest payment generally is any one of

the purposes of determining whether a debt security has oid we will be deemed to exercise any call option that has the effect of decreasing the yield on the debt security and the us holder will be deemed to exercise any put option that has the effect of increasing the yield on the debt security if the option is not in fact exercised the debt security would be treated solely for purposes of calculating oid as if it were redeemed and a new debt security were issued on the deemed exercise date for an amount equal to the adjusted issue price as defined below of the debt security us holders of discount debt securities must include oid in income calculated on a constantyield method before the receipt of cash attributable to the income and generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of oid over the life of the discount debt securities the amount of oid includible in income by a us holder of a discount debt security is the sum of the daily portions of oid with respect to the discount debt security for each day during the taxable year or portion of the taxable year on which the us holder holds the discount debt security accrued oid the daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any accrual period a pro rata portion of the oid allocable to that accrual period accrual periods with respect to a discount debt security may be of any length selected by the us holder and may vary in length over the term of the discount debt security as long as i no accrual period is longer than one year and ii each scheduled payment of interest or principal on the discount debt security occurs on either the final or first day of an accrual period the amount of oid allocable to an accrual period equals the excess of a the product of

accrual period and decreased by y the amount of any payments previously made on the discount debt security that were not qualified stated interest payments the yield to maturity of a security is the discount rate that causes the present value of all payments on the security as of its original issue date to equal the issue price of such security acquisition premium a us holder that purchases a discount debt security for an amount less than or equal to the sum of all amounts payable on the discount debt security after the purchase date other than payments of qualified stated interest but in excess of its adjusted issue price any such excess being acquisition premium and that does not make the election described below under  election to treat all interest as original issue discount is permitted to reduce the daily portions of oid by a fraction the numerator of which is the excess of the us holders adjusted basis in the discount debt security immediately after its purchase over the discount debt securitys adjusted issue price and the denominator of which is the excess of the sum of all amounts payable on the discount debt security after the purchase date other than payments of qualified stated interest over the discount debt securitys adjusted issue price shortterm debt securities in general an individual or other cash basis us holder of a shortterm debt security is not required to accrue oid as specially defined below for the purposes of this paragraph for us federal income tax purposes unless it elects to do so but will be required to include any stated interest in income as the interest is received accrual basis us holders and certain other us holders are required to accrue oid on shortterm debt securities on a straightline basis or if the us holder so elects under the constantyield method based on daily compounding in the case of a us holder not required and not electing to include oid in income currently any gain realized on the sale or retirement of the shortterm debt security will be ordinary income to the extent of    table of contents the oid accrued on a straightline basis unless an election is made to accrue the oid under the constantyield method through the date of sale or retirement us holders who are not required and do not elect to accrue oid on shortterm debt securities will be required to defer deductions for interest on borrowings allocable to shortterm debt securities in an amount not exceeding the deferred income until the deferred income is realized for purposes of determining the amount of oid subject to these rules all interest payments on a shortterm debt security are included in the shortterm debt securitys stated redemption price at maturity a us holder may elect to determine oid on a shortterm debt security as if the shortterm debt security had been originally issued to the us holder at the us holders purchase price for the shortterm debt security this election shall apply to all obligations with a maturity of one year or less acquired by the us holder on or after the first day of the first taxable year to which the election applies and may not be revoked without the consent of the internal revenue service irs market discount a debt security other than a shortterm debt security generally will be treated as purchased at a market discount a market discount debt security if the debt securitys stated redemption price at maturity or in the case of a discount debt security the debt securitys revised issue price exceeds the amount for which the us holder purchased the debt security by at least  of the debt securitys stated redemption price at maturity or revised issue price respectively multiplied by the number of complete years to the debt securitys maturity or in the case of a debt security that is an installment obligation the debt securitys weighted average maturity if this excess is not sufficient to cause the debt security to be a market discount debt security then the excess constitutes de minimis market discount for this purpose the revised issue price of a debt security generally equals its issue price increased by the amount of any oid that has accrued on the debt security and decreased by the amount of any payments previously made on the debt security that were not qualified stated interest payments under current law any gain recognized on the maturity or disposition of a market discount debt security including any payment on a market discount debt security that is not qualified stated interest will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the gain does not exceed the accrued market discount on the market discount debt security alternatively a us holder of a market discount debt security may elect to include market discount in income currently over the life of the market discount debt security this election will apply to all debt instruments with market discount acquired by the electing us holder on or after the first day of the first taxable year to which the election applies this election may not be revoked without the consent of the irs a us holder of a market discount debt security that does not elect to include market discount in income currently will generally be required to defer deductions for interest on borrowings incurred to purchase or carry a market discount debt security that are in excess of the interest and oid on the market discount debt security includible in the us holders income to the extent that this excess interest expense does not exceed the portion of the market discount allocable to the days on which the market discount debt security was held by the us holder under current law market discount will accrue on a straightline basis unless the us holder elects to accrue the market discount on a constantyield method this election applies only to the market discount debt security with respect to which it is made and is irrevocable variable interest rate debt securities debt securities that provide for interest at variable rates variable interest rate debt securities generally will either bear interest at a qualified floating rate or they will bear interest at an objective rate and thus may be treated as variable rate debt instruments under treasury regulations governing accrual of oid a variable interest rate debt security will qualify as a variable rate debt instrument if a its issue price does not exceed the total noncontingent principal payments due under the variable interest rate debt security by more than a    table of contents specified de minimis amount b it provides for stated interest paid or compounded at least annually at i one or more qualified floating rates ii a single fixed rate and one or more qualified floating rates iii a single objective rate or iv a single fixed rate and a single objective rate that is a qualified inverse floating rate and c it does not provide for any principal payments that are contingent other than as described in a above a qualified floating rate is any variable rate where variations in the value of the rate can reasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds in the currency in which the variable interest rate debt security is denominated a fixed multiple of a qualified floating rate will constitute a qualified floating rate only if the multiple is greater than  but not more than  a variable rate equal to the product of a qualified floating rate and a fixed multiple that is greater than  but not more than  increased or decreased by a fixed rate will also constitute a qualified floating rate in addition two or more qualified floating rates that can reasonably be expected to have approximately the same values throughout the term of the variable interest rate debt security eg two or more qualified floating rates with values within  basis points of each other as determined on the variable interest rate debt securitys issue date will be treated as a single qualified floating rate notwithstanding the foregoing a variable rate that would otherwise constitute a qualified floating rate but which is subject to one or more restrictions such as a maximum numerical limitation ie a cap or a minimum numerical limitation ie a floor may under certain circumstances fail to be treated as a qualified floating rate unless the cap or floor is either fixed throughout the term of the variable interest rate debt security or is not reasonably expected as of the issue date to cause the yield on the variable interest rate debt security to significantly deviate from the expected yield determined without the cap or floor an objective rate is a rate that is not itself a qualified floating rate but which is determined using a single fixed formula and which is based on objective financial or economic information eg one or more qualified floating rates or the yield of actively traded personal property a rate will not qualify as an objective rate if it is based on information that is within our control or the control of a related party or that is unique to our circumstances or the circumstances of a related party such as dividends profits or the value of rio tinto ordinary shares or the shares of the relevant issuer although a rate does not fail to be an objective rate merely because it is based on the credit quality of rio tinto or the relevant issuer other variable interest rates may be treated as objective rates if so designated by the irs in the future despite the foregoing a variable rate of interest on a variable interest rate debt security will not constitute an objective rate if it is reasonably expected that the average value of the rate during the first half of the variable interest rate debt securitys term will be either significantly less than or significantly greater than the average value of the rate during the final half of the variable interest rate debt securitys term a qualified inverse floating rate is any objective rate where the rate is equal to a fixed rate minus a qualified floating rate as long as variations in the rate can reasonably be expected to inversely reflect contemporaneous variations in the qualified floating rate if a variable interest rate debt security provides for stated interest at a fixed rate for an initial period of one year or less followed by a variable rate that is either a qualified floating rate or an objective rate for a subsequent period and if the variable rate on the variable interest rate debt securitys issue date is intended to approximate the fixed rate eg the value of the variable rate on the issue date does not differ from the value of the fixed rate by more than  basis points then the fixed rate and the variable rate together will constitute either a single qualified floating rate or objective rate as the case may be a qualified floating rate or objective rate in effect at any time during the term of the instrument must be set at a current value of that rate a current value of a rate is the value of the rate on any day that is no earlier than  months prior to the first day on which that value is in effect and no later than  year following that first day if a variable interest rate debt security that provides for stated interest at either a single qualified floating rate or a single objective rate throughout the term thereof qualifies as a variable rate debt instrument then any stated interest on the variable interest debt security which is unconditionally payable in cash or property other than our debt instruments at least annually will constitute qualified stated interest and will be taxed accordingly thus a variable interest rate debt security that provides for stated interest at either a single qualified floating    table of contents rate or a single objective rate throughout the term thereof and that qualifies as a variable rate debt instrument generally will not be treated as having been issued with oid unless the variable interest rate debt security is issued at a true discount ie at a price below the variable interest rate debt securitys stated principal amount in excess of the de minimis amount described in original issue discount  general above oid on a variable interest rate debt security arising from true discount is allocated to an accrual period using the constant yield method described above by assuming that the variable rate is a fixed rate equal to i in the case of a qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate the value as of the issue date of the qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate or ii in the case of an objective rate other than a qualified inverse floating rate a fixed rate that reflects the yield that is reasonably expected for the variable interest rate debt security in general any other variable interest rate debt security that qualifies as a variable rate debt instrument will be converted into an equivalent fixed rate debt instrument for purposes of determining the amount and accrual of oid and qualified stated interest on the variable interest rate debt security such a variable interest rate debt security must be converted into an equivalent fixed rate debt instrument by substituting any qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate provided for under the terms of the variable interest rate debt security with a fixed rate equal to the value of the qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate as the case may be as of the variable interest rate debt securitys issue date any objective rate other than a qualified inverse floating rate provided for under the terms of the variable interest rate debt security is converted into a fixed rate that reflects the yield that is reasonably expected for the variable interest rate debt security in the case of a variable interest rate debt security that qualifies as a variable rate debt instrument and provides for stated interest at a fixed rate in addition to either one or more qualified floating rates or a qualified inverse floating rate the fixed rate is initially converted into a qualified floating rate or a qualified inverse floating rate if the variable interest rate debt security provides for a qualified inverse floating rate under these circumstances the qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate that replaces the fixed rate must be such that the fair market value of the variable interest rate debt security as of the variable interest rate debt securitys issue date is approximately the same as the fair market value of an otherwise identical debt instrument that provides for either the qualified floating rate or qualified inverse floating rate rather than the fixed rate subsequent to converting the fixed rate into either a qualified floating rate or a qualified inverse floating rate the variable interest rate debt security is converted into an equivalent fixed rate debt instrument in the manner described above once the variable interest rate debt security is converted into an equivalent fixed rate debt instrument pursuant to the foregoing rules the amount of oid and qualified stated interest if any are determined for the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument by applying the general oid rules to the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument and a us holder of the variable interest rate debt security will account for the oid and qualified stated interest as if the us holder held the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument in each accrual period appropriate adjustments will be made to the amount of qualified stated interest or oid assumed to have been accrued or paid with respect to the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument in the event that these amounts differ from the actual amount of interest accrued or paid on the variable interest rate debt security during the accrual period if a variable interest rate debt security does not qualify as a variable rate debt instrument then the variable interest rate debt security will generally be treated as a contingent payment debt obligation the proper us federal income tax treatment of variable interest rate debt securities that are treated as contingent payment debt obligations will be more fully described in the applicable prospectus supplement election to treat all interest as original issue discount a us holder may elect to include in gross income all interest that accrues on a debt security using the constantyield method described above under  original issue discount  general with certain modifications for purposes of this election interest includes stated interest oid de minimis oid market discount de minimis market discount and unstated interest as adjusted by any amortizable bond premium    table of contents described below under  debt securities purchased at a premium or acquisition premium

include market discount in income currently over the life of all debt instruments with market discount held or thereafter acquired by the us holder us holders should consult their tax advisors concerning the propriety and consequences of this election debt securities purchased at a premium a us holder that purchases a debt security for an amount in excess of its principal amount or for a discount debt security its stated redemption price at maturity may elect to treat the excess as amortizable bond premium in which case the amount required to be included in the us holders income each year with respect to interest on the debt security will be reduced by the amount of amortizable bond premium allocable based on the debt securitys yield to maturity to that year any election to amortize bond premium will apply to all bonds other than bonds the interest on which is excludable from gross income for us federal income tax purposes held by the us holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the us holder and is irrevocable without the consent of the irs a us holder that does not elect to take bond premium other than acquisition premium into account currently will recognize a market loss when the debt security matures see also  original issue discount  election to treat all interest as original issue

of this deemed disposition a us holder could be required to recognize capital gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes equal to the difference if any between the issue price of the new debt

relating to foreign financial asset reporting fatca sections  through  of the us internal revenue code of  fatca impose a reporting regime and potentially a  withholding tax with respect to certain payments to any nonus financial institution a foreign financial institution or ffi as defined by fatca that does not become a participating ffi by entering into an agreement with the irs to provide the irs with certain information in respect of its account holders and investors or is not otherwise exempt from or in deemed compliance with fatca each issuer may be classified as an ffi this withholding regime will be phased in beginning july   for payments from sources within the united states and will apply to foreign passthru payments a term not yet defined no earlier than january   this withholding would potentially apply to payments in respect of i any debt securities characterized as debt or which are not otherwise characterized as equity and have a fixed term for us federal tax purposes that are issued on or after the grandfathering date which is the date that is six months after the date on which final us treasury regulations defining the term foreign passthru payment are filed with the federal register or which are materially modified on or after the grandfathering date and ii any debt securities characterized as equity or which do not have a fixed term for us federal tax purposes whenever issued if debt securities are issued before the grandfathering date and additional debt securities of the same series are issued on or after that date the additional debt securities may not be treated as grandfathered which may have negative consequences for the existing debt securities including a negative impact on market price the application of fatca to interest principal or other amounts paid with respect to the debt securities and the information reporting obligations of the issuers and other entities in the payment chain is still developing in particular a number of jurisdictions including the united kingdom and australia have entered into or have announced their intention to enter into intergovernmental agreements igas or similar mutual understandings with the united states which modify the way in which fatca applies in their jurisdictions the full impact of such agreements and the laws implementing such agreements in such jurisdictions on reporting and withholding responsibilities under fatca is unclear the issuers and other entities in the payment chain may be required to report certain information on their us account holders to government authorities in their respective jurisdictions or the united states in order i to obtain an exemption from fatca withholding on payments they receive andor ii to comply with applicable law in their jurisdiction it is not yet certain how the united states and the jurisdictions which enter into intergovernmental agreements will address withholding on foreign passthru payments which may include payments on the debt securities or if such withholding will be required at all rio tinto finance usa plc expects to be treated as a reporting fi pursuant to the intergovernmental agreement between the united states and the united kingdom and does not anticipate being obliged to deduct any withholding under fatca an iga or any law implementing an iga any such withholding being fatca withholding on payments it makes there can be no assurance however that rio tinto finance usa plc will be treated as a reporting fi or that it would in the future not be required to deduct fatca withholding from payments it makes the relevant issuer and financial institutions through which payments on the debt securities    table of contents are made may be required to withhold fatca withholding if any ffi through or to which payment on such debt securities is made is not a participating ffi a reporting fi or otherwise exempt from or in deemed compliance with fatca whilst the debt securities are in global form and held within dtc or euroclear and clearstream luxembourg it is expected that fatca will not affect the amount of any payments made under or in respect of the debt securities by the relevant issuer the guarantors any paying agent and the common depositary or common safekeeper given that each of the entities in the payment chain between the relevant issuer and the participants in dtc and the icsds is a major financial institution whose business is dependent on compliance with fatca or is exempt from fatca withholding and that any alternative approach introduced under an iga will be unlikely to affect the debt securities the documentation expressly contemplates the possibility that physical certificates representing debt securities may be issued and therefore that the debt securities may be taken out of dtc and the icsds if this were to happen then a nonfatca compliant holder could be subject to fatca withholding however physical certificates representing debt securities will only be issued in remote circumstances if an amount in respect of fatca withholding tax were to be deducted or withheld from interest principal or other payments on the debt securities as a result of fatca none of the issuers the guarantors any paying agent or any other person would pursuant to the terms and conditions of the debt securities be required to pay additional amounts as a result of the deduction or withholding as a result investors may receive less interest or principal than expected fatca is particularly complex and its application is uncertain at this time the above description is based in part on regulations official guidance and model igas all of which are subject to change or may be implemented in a materially different form prospective investors should consult their tax advisers on how these rules may apply to the issuers and guarantors and to payments they may receive in connection with the

years ago due to acid mine drainage hugh matheson led the purchase of the rio tinto mines from spain and was the companys first president since antiquity a site along the rio tinto in the andalusian province of huelva in spain has been mined for copper silver gold and other minerals around  bc iberians and tartessians began mining the site followed by the phoenicians greeks romans visigoths and moors after a period of abandonment the mines were rediscovered in  and the spanish government began operating them once again in  however spains mining operations there were inefficient and the government itself was otherwise distracted by political and financial crises leading the government to sell the mines in  at a price later determined to be well below actual value the purchasers of the mine were led by hugh mathesons matheson and company which ultimately formed a syndicate consisting of deutsche bank  ownership matheson  and the civil engineering firm clark punchard and company  at an auction held by the spanish government for sale of the mine on  february  the group won with a bid gb£ esp  the bid also specified that spain permanently relinquish any right to claim royalties on the mines production following purchase of the mine the syndicate launched the rio tinto company registering it on  march  at the end of the s control of the firm was passed to the rothschild family who greatly increased the scale of its mining operations operating historyedit following their purchase of the rio tinto mine the new ownership constructed a number of new processing facilities innovated new mining techniques and expanded mining activities from  to  the rio tinto mine was the worlds leading producer of copper the openpit corta atalaya mine was part of rio tintos original operations in spain from  through  the company was inwardly focused on fully exploiting the rio tinto mine with little attention paid to expansion or exploration activities outside of spain the company enjoyed strong financial success until  colluding with other pyrite producers to control market prices however world war i and its aftermath effectively eliminated the united states as a viable market for european pyrites leading to a decline in the firms prominence pyrite was a major product of rio tintos first mines the companys failure to diversify during this period led to the slow decline of the company among the ranks of international mining firms however this changed in  when sir auckland geddes succeeded lord alfred milner as chairman geddes and the new management team he installed focused on diversification of the companys investments and operations and reformation of marketing strategy geddes led the company into a series of joint ventures with customers in the development of new technologies as well as exploration and development of new mines outside of spain perhaps most significant was the companys investment in copper mines in northern rhodesia later zambia which it eventually consolidated into the rhokana corporation these and later efforts at diversification eventually allowed the company to divest from the rio tinto mine in spain by the s francos nationalistic government had made it increasingly difficult to exploit spanish resources for the profit of foreigners rio tinto company supported by its international investments was able to divest twothirds of its spanish operations in  and the remainder over the following years major mergers and acquisitionsedit like many major mining companies the rio tinto group has historically grown through a series of mergers and acquisitions early acquisitionsedit rhodesia was the location of rio tintos first major international expansion of mining activities the companys first major acquisition occurred in  when the company issued stock for the purpose of raising  million pounds to invest in northern rhodesian copper mining companies which was fully invested by the end of  the rio tinto company consolidated its holdings of these various firms under the rhokana corporation by forcing the various companies to merge rio tintos investment in rhodesian copper mines did much to support the company through troubled times at its spanish rio tinto operations spanning the spanish civil war world war ii and francos nationalistic policies in the s the political situation made it increasingly difficult for mostly british and french owners to extract profits from spanish operations and the company decided to dispose of the mines from which it took its name thus in  rio tinto company sold twothirds of its stake in the rio tinto mines disposing of the rest over the following years the sale of the mines financed extensive exploration activities over the following decade merger with consolidated zincedit the companys exploration activities presented the company with an abundance of opportunities but it lacked sufficient capital and operating revenue to exploit those opportunities this situation precipitated the next and perhaps most significant merger in the companys history in  rio tinto company merged with the australian firm consolidated zinc to form the rio tinto – zinc corporation rtz and its main subsidiary conzinc riotinto of australia cra the merger provided rio tinto the ability to exploit its newfound opportunities and gave consolidated zinc a much larger asset base rtz and cra were separately managed and operated with cra focusing on opportunities within australasia and rtz taking the rest of the world however the companies continued to trade separately and rtzs ownership of cra dipped below  by  strategic needs of the two companies eventually led to conflicts of interest regarding new mining opportunities and shareholders of both companies determined a merger was in their mutual best interest in  the companies merged into a dual listed company in which management was consolidated into a single entity and share holder interests were aligned and equivalent although maintained as shares in separately named entities the merger also precipitated a name change after two years as rtzcra rtz became rio tinto plc and cra became rio tinto limited referred to collectively as rio tinto group or simply rio tinto recent mergers acquisitions and eventsedit major acquisitions following the consolidated zinc merger included us borax a

in world war iiedit rio tintos status as a mainly britishowned company located in spain and producing pyrites – an important material for military applications – created a complicated set of circumstances for the companys operation in the s and s during the spanish civil war the region in which rio tintos mines were located came under the control of general francos nationalists in  however franco increasingly intervened in the companys operations at times requisitioning pyrite supplies for use by spain and its axis allies germany and italy forcing price controls on the companys production restricting exports and threatening nationalisation of the mines although company management and indirectly the british government managed to counteract some of these efforts by franco much of the mines pyrite production was channelled to axis powers before and during world war ii nonetheless francos meddling caused the mines production and profitability to fall precipitously during and after the war leading the company to ultimately exit from its spanish operations in  in  rio tinto was criticised by the guinean government for the many mining delays at the local simandou mine cece

from the government of norway which divested itself from rio tinto shares and banned further investment due to environmental concerns claims of severe environmental damages related to rio tintos engagement in the grasberg mine in indonesia led the government pension fund of norway to exclude rio tinto from its investment portfolio the fund which is said to be the worlds secondlargest pension fund sold shares in the company valued at  billion kr us million to avoid contributing to environmental damages caused by the company exclusion of a company from the fund reflects our unwillingness to run an unacceptable risk of contributing to grossly unethical conduct the council on ethics has concluded that rio tinto is directly involved through its participation in the grasberg mine in

comes from the rio tinto in southwestern spain which has flowed red since mining began there about  years ago due to acid mine drainage hugh matheson led the purchase of the rio tinto mines from spain and was the companys first president since antiquity a site along the rio tinto in the andalusian province of huelva in spain has been mined for copper silver gold and other minerals around  bc iberians and tartessians began mining the site followed by the phoenicians greeks romans visigoths and moors after a period of abandonment the mines were rediscovered in  and the spanish government began operating them once again in  however spains mining operations there were inefficient and the government itself was otherwise distracted by political and financial crises leading the government to sell the mines in  at a price later determined to be well below actual value the purchasers of the mine were led by hugh mathesons matheson and company which ultimately formed a syndicate consisting of deutsche bank  ownership matheson  and the civil engineering firm clark punchard and company  at an auction held by the spanish government for sale of the mine on  february  the group won with a bid gb£ esp  the bid also specified that spain permanently relinquish any right to claim royalties on the mines production following purchase of the mine the syndicate launched the rio tinto company registering it on  march  at the end of the s control of the firm was passed to the rothschild family who greatly increased the scale of its mining operations operating historyedit following their purchase of the rio tinto mine the new ownership constructed a number of new processing facilities innovated new mining techniques and expanded mining activities from  to  the rio tinto mine was the worlds leading producer of copper the openpit corta atalaya mine was part of rio tintos original operations in spain from  through  the company was inwardly focused on fully exploiting the rio tinto mine with little attention paid to expansion or exploration activities outside of spain the company enjoyed strong financial success until  colluding with other pyrite producers to control market prices however world war i and its aftermath effectively eliminated the united states as a viable market for european pyrites leading to a decline in the firms prominence pyrite was a major product of rio tintos first mines the companys failure to diversify during this period led to the slow decline of the company among the ranks of international mining firms however this changed in  when sir auckland geddes succeeded lord alfred milner as chairman geddes and the new management team he installed focused on diversification of the companys investments and operations and reformation of marketing strategy geddes led the company into a series of joint ventures with customers in the development of new technologies as well as exploration and development of new mines outside of spain perhaps most significant was the companys investment in copper mines in northern rhodesia later zambia which it eventually consolidated into the rhokana corporation these and later efforts at diversification eventually allowed the company to divest from the rio tinto mine in spain by the s francos nationalistic government had made it increasingly difficult to exploit spanish resources for the profit of foreigners rio tinto company supported by its international investments was able to divest twothirds of its spanish operations in  and the remainder over the following years major mergers and acquisitionsedit like many major mining companies the rio tinto group has historically grown through a series of mergers and acquisitions early acquisitionsedit rhodesia was the location of rio tintos first major international expansion of mining activities the companys first major acquisition occurred in  when the company issued stock for the purpose of raising  million pounds to invest in northern rhodesian copper mining companies which was fully invested by the end of  the rio tinto company consolidated its holdings of these various firms under the rhokana corporation by forcing the various companies to merge rio tintos investment in rhodesian copper mines did much to support the company through troubled times at its spanish rio tinto operations spanning the spanish civil war world war ii and francos nationalistic policies in the s the political situation made it increasingly difficult for mostly british and french owners to extract profits from spanish operations and the company decided to dispose of the mines from which it took its name thus in  rio tinto company sold twothirds of its stake in the rio tinto mines disposing of the rest over the following years the sale of the mines financed extensive exploration activities over the following decade merger with consolidated zincedit the companys exploration activities presented the company with an abundance of opportunities but it lacked sufficient capital and operating revenue to exploit those opportunities this situation precipitated the next and perhaps most significant merger in the companys history in  rio tinto company merged with the australian firm consolidated zinc to form the rio tinto – zinc corporation rtz and its main subsidiary conzinc riotinto of australia cra the merger provided rio tinto the ability to exploit its newfound opportunities and gave consolidated zinc a much larger asset base rtz and cra were separately managed and operated with cra focusing on opportunities within australasia and rtz taking the rest of the world however the companies continued to trade separately and rtzs ownership of cra dipped below  by  strategic needs of the two companies eventually led to conflicts of interest regarding new mining opportunities and shareholders of both companies determined a merger was in their mutual best interest in  the companies merged into a dual listed company in which management was consolidated into a single entity and share holder interests were aligned and equivalent although maintained as shares in separately named entities the merger also precipitated a name change after two years as rtzcra rtz became rio tinto plc and cra became rio tinto limited referred to collectively as rio tinto group or simply rio tinto recent mergers acquisitions and eventsedit major acquisitions following the consolidated zinc merger included us borax a major producer of borax bought in  kennecott utah copper and bp australias coal

supplies for use by spain and its axis allies germany and italy forcing price controls on the companys production restricting exports and threatening nationalisation of the mines although company management and indirectly the british government managed to counteract some of these efforts by franco much of the mines pyrite production was channelled to axis powers before and during world war ii

and was the companys first president since antiquity a site along the rio tinto in the andalusian province of huelva in spain has been mined for copper silver gold and other minerals around  bc iberians and tartessians began mining the site followed by the phoenicians greeks romans visigoths and moors after a period of abandonment the mines were rediscovered in  and the spanish government began operating them once again in  however spains mining operations there were inefficient and the government itself was otherwise distracted by political and financial crises leading the government to sell the mines in  at a price later determined to be well below actual value the purchasers of the mine were led by hugh mathesons matheson and company which ultimately formed a syndicate consisting of deutsche bank  ownership matheson  and the civil engineering firm clark punchard and company  at an auction held by the spanish government for sale of the mine on  february  the group won with a bid gb£ esp  the bid also specified that spain permanently relinquish any right to claim royalties on the mines production following purchase of the mine the syndicate launched the rio tinto company registering it on  march  at the end of the s control of the firm was passed to the rothschild family who greatly increased the scale of its mining operations operating historyedit following their purchase of the rio tinto mine the new ownership constructed a number of new processing facilities innovated new mining techniques and expanded mining activities from  to  the rio tinto mine was the worlds leading producer of copper the openpit corta atalaya mine was part of rio tintos original operations in spain from  through  the company was inwardly focused on fully exploiting the rio tinto mine with little attention paid to expansion or exploration activities outside of spain the company enjoyed strong financial success until  colluding with other pyrite producers to control market prices however world war i and its aftermath effectively eliminated the united states as a viable market for european pyrites leading to a decline in the firms prominence pyrite was a major product of rio tintos first mines the companys failure to diversify during this period led to the slow decline of the company among the ranks of international mining firms however this changed in  when sir auckland geddes succeeded lord alfred milner as chairman geddes and the new management team he installed focused on diversification of the companys investments and operations and reformation of marketing strategy geddes led the company into a series of joint ventures with customers in the development of new technologies as well as exploration and development of new mines outside of spain perhaps most significant was the companys investment in copper mines in northern rhodesia later zambia which it eventually consolidated into the rhokana corporation these and later efforts at diversification eventually allowed the company to divest from the rio tinto mine in spain by the s francos nationalistic government had made it increasingly difficult to exploit spanish resources for the profit of foreigners rio tinto company supported by its international investments was able to divest twothirds of its spanish operations in  and the remainder over the following years major mergers and acquisitionsedit like many major mining companies the rio tinto group has historically grown through a series of mergers and acquisitions early acquisitionsedit rhodesia was the location of rio tintos first major international expansion of mining activities the companys first major acquisition occurred in  when the company issued stock for the purpose of raising  million pounds to invest in northern rhodesian copper mining companies which was fully invested by the end of  the rio tinto company consolidated its holdings of these various firms under the rhokana corporation by forcing the various companies to merge rio tintos investment in rhodesian copper mines did much to support the company through troubled times at its spanish rio tinto operations spanning the spanish civil war world war ii and francos nationalistic policies in the s the political situation made it increasingly difficult for mostly british and french owners to extract profits from spanish operations and the company decided to dispose of the mines from which it took its name thus in  rio tinto company sold twothirds of its stake in the rio tinto mines disposing of the rest over the following years the sale of the mines financed extensive exploration activities over the following decade merger with consolidated zincedit the companys exploration activities presented the company with an abundance of opportunities but it lacked sufficient capital and operating revenue to exploit those opportunities this situation precipitated the next and perhaps most significant merger in the companys history in  rio tinto company merged with the australian firm consolidated zinc to form the rio tinto – zinc corporation rtz and its main subsidiary conzinc riotinto of australia cra the merger provided rio tinto the ability to exploit its newfound opportunities and gave consolidated zinc a much larger asset base rtz and cra were separately managed and operated with cra focusing on opportunities within australasia and rtz taking the rest of the world however the companies continued to trade separately and rtzs ownership of cra dipped below  by  strategic needs of the two companies eventually led to conflicts of interest regarding new mining opportunities and shareholders of both companies determined a merger was in their mutual best interest in  the companies merged into a dual listed company in which management was consolidated into a single entity and share holder interests were aligned and equivalent although maintained as shares in separately named entities the merger also precipitated a name change after two years as rtzcra rtz became rio tinto plc and cra became rio tinto limited referred to collectively as rio tinto group or simply rio tinto

comes from the rio tinto in southwestern spain which has flowed red since mining began there about  years ago due to acid mine drainage hugh matheson led the purchase of the rio tinto mines from spain and was the companys first president since antiquity a site along the rio tinto in the andalusian province of huelva in spain has been mined for copper silver gold and other minerals around  bc iberians and tartessians began mining the site followed by the phoenicians greeks romans visigoths and moors after a period of abandonment the mines were rediscovered in  and the spanish government began operating them once again in  however spains mining operations there were inefficient and the government itself was otherwise distracted by political and financial crises leading the government to sell the mines in  at a price later determined to be well below actual value the purchasers of the mine were led by hugh mathesons matheson and company which ultimately formed a syndicate consisting of deutsche bank  ownership matheson  and the civil engineering firm clark punchard and company  at an auction held by the spanish government for sale of the mine on  february  the group won with a bid gb£ esp  the bid also specified that spain permanently relinquish any right to claim royalties on the mines production following purchase of the mine the syndicate launched the rio tinto company registering it on  march  at the end of the s control of the firm was passed to the rothschild family who greatly increased the scale of its mining operations operating historyedit following their purchase of the rio tinto mine the new ownership constructed a number of new processing facilities innovated new mining techniques and expanded mining activities from  to  the rio tinto mine was the worlds leading producer of copper the openpit corta atalaya mine was part of rio tintos original operations in spain from  through  the company was inwardly focused on fully exploiting the rio tinto mine with little attention paid to expansion or exploration activities outside of spain the company enjoyed strong financial success until  colluding with other pyrite producers to control market prices however world war i and its aftermath effectively eliminated the united states as a viable market for european pyrites leading to a decline in the firms prominence pyrite was a major product of rio tintos first mines the companys failure to diversify during this period led to the slow decline of the company among the ranks of international mining firms however this changed in  when sir auckland geddes succeeded lord alfred milner as chairman geddes and the new management team he installed focused on diversification of the companys investments and operations and reformation of marketing strategy geddes led the company into a series of joint ventures with customers in the development of new technologies as well as exploration and development of new mines outside of spain perhaps most significant was the companys investment in copper mines in northern rhodesia later zambia which it eventually consolidated into the rhokana corporation these and later efforts at diversification eventually allowed the company to divest from the rio tinto mine in spain by the s francos nationalistic government had made it increasingly difficult to exploit spanish resources for the profit of foreigners rio tinto company supported by its international investments was able to divest twothirds of its spanish operations in  and the remainder over the following years major mergers and acquisitionsedit like many major mining companies the rio tinto group has historically grown through a series of mergers and acquisitions early acquisitionsedit rhodesia was the location of rio tintos first major international expansion of mining activities the companys first major acquisition occurred in  when the company issued stock for the purpose of raising  million pounds to invest in northern rhodesian copper mining companies which was fully invested by the end of  the rio tinto company consolidated its holdings of these various firms under the rhokana corporation by forcing the various companies to merge rio tintos investment in rhodesian copper mines did much to support the company through troubled times at its spanish rio tinto operations spanning the spanish civil war world war ii and francos nationalistic policies in the s the political situation made it increasingly difficult for mostly british and french owners to extract profits from spanish operations and the company decided to dispose of the mines from which it took its name thus in  rio tinto company sold twothirds of its stake in the rio tinto mines disposing of the rest over the following years the sale of the mines financed extensive exploration activities over the following decade merger with consolidated zincedit the companys exploration activities presented the company with an abundance of opportunities but it lacked sufficient capital and operating revenue to exploit those opportunities this situation precipitated the next and perhaps most significant merger in the companys history in  rio tinto company merged with the australian firm consolidated zinc to form the rio tinto – zinc corporation rtz and its main subsidiary conzinc riotinto of australia cra the merger provided rio tinto the ability to exploit its newfound opportunities and gave consolidated zinc a much larger asset base rtz and cra were separately managed and operated with cra focusing on opportunities within australasia and rtz taking the rest of the world however the companies continued to trade separately and rtzs ownership of cra dipped below  by  strategic needs of the two companies eventually led to conflicts of interest regarding new mining opportunities and shareholders of both companies determined a merger was in their mutual best interest in  the companies merged into a dual listed company in which management was consolidated into a single entity and share holder interests were aligned and equivalent although maintained as shares in separately named entities the merger also precipitated a name change after two years as rtzcra rtz became rio tinto plc and cra became rio tinto limited referred to collectively as rio tinto group or simply rio tinto recent mergers acquisitions and eventsedit major acquisitions following the consolidated zinc merger included us borax a major producer of borax bought in  kennecott utah copper and bp australias coal

supplies for use by spain and its axis allies germany and italy forcing price controls on the companys production restricting exports and threatening nationalisation of the mines although company management and indirectly the british government managed to counteract some of these efforts by franco much of the mines pyrite production was channelled to axis powers before and during world war ii

rio tinto from its investment portfolio the fund which is said to be the worlds secondlargest pension fund sold shares in the company valued at  billion kr us million to avoid contributing to

comes from the rio tinto in southwestern spain which has flowed red since mining began there about  years ago due to acid mine drainage hugh matheson led the purchase of the rio tinto mines from spain and was the companys first president since antiquity a site along the rio tinto in the andalusian province of huelva in spain has been mined for copper silver gold and other minerals around  bc iberians and tartessians began mining the site followed by the phoenicians greeks romans visigoths and moors after a period of abandonment the mines were rediscovered in  and the spanish government began operating them once again in  however spains mining operations there were inefficient and the government itself was otherwise distracted by political and financial crises leading the government to sell the mines in  at a price later determined to be well below actual value the purchasers of the mine were led by hugh mathesons matheson and company which ultimately formed a syndicate consisting of deutsche bank  ownership matheson  and the civil engineering firm clark punchard and company  at an auction held by the spanish government for sale of the mine on  february  the group won with a bid gb£ esp  the bid also specified that spain permanently relinquish any right to claim royalties on the mines production following purchase of the mine the syndicate launched the rio tinto company registering it on  march  at the end of the s control of the firm was passed to the rothschild family who greatly increased the scale of its mining operations operating historyedit following their purchase of the rio tinto mine the new ownership constructed a number of new processing facilities innovated new mining techniques and expanded mining activities from  to  the rio tinto mine was the worlds leading producer of copper the openpit corta atalaya mine was part of rio tintos original operations in spain from  through  the company was inwardly focused on fully exploiting the rio tinto mine with little attention paid to expansion or exploration activities outside of spain the company enjoyed strong financial success until  colluding with other pyrite producers to control market prices however world war i and its aftermath effectively eliminated the united states as a viable market for european pyrites leading to a decline in the firms prominence pyrite was a major product of rio tintos first mines the companys failure to diversify during this period led to the slow decline of the company among the ranks of international mining firms however this changed in  when sir auckland geddes succeeded lord alfred milner as chairman geddes and the new management team he installed focused on diversification of the companys investments and operations and reformation of marketing strategy geddes led the company into a series of joint ventures with customers in the development of new technologies as well as exploration and development of new mines outside of spain perhaps most significant was the companys investment in copper mines in northern rhodesia later zambia which it eventually consolidated into the rhokana corporation these and later efforts at diversification eventually allowed the company to divest from the rio tinto mine in spain by the s francos nationalistic government had made it increasingly difficult to exploit spanish resources for the profit of foreigners rio tinto company supported by its international investments was able to divest twothirds of its spanish operations in  and the remainder over the following years major mergers and acquisitionsedit like many major mining companies the rio tinto group has historically grown through a series of mergers and acquisitions early acquisitionsedit rhodesia was the location of rio tintos first major international expansion of mining activities the companys first major acquisition occurred in  when the company issued stock for the purpose of raising  million pounds to invest in northern rhodesian copper mining companies which was fully invested by the end of  the rio tinto company consolidated its holdings of these various firms under the rhokana corporation by forcing the various companies to merge rio tintos investment in rhodesian copper mines did much to support the company through troubled times at its spanish rio tinto operations spanning the spanish civil war world war ii and francos nationalistic policies in the s the political situation made it increasingly difficult for mostly british and french owners to extract profits from spanish operations and the company decided to dispose of the mines from which it took its name thus in  rio tinto company sold twothirds of its stake in the rio tinto mines disposing of the rest over the following years the sale of the mines financed extensive exploration activities over the following decade merger with consolidated zincedit the companys exploration activities presented the company with an abundance of opportunities but it lacked sufficient capital and operating revenue to exploit those opportunities this situation precipitated the next and perhaps most significant merger in the companys history in  rio tinto company merged with the australian firm consolidated zinc to form the rio tinto – zinc corporation rtz and its main subsidiary conzinc riotinto of australia cra the merger provided rio tinto the ability to exploit its newfound opportunities and gave consolidated zinc a much larger asset base rtz and cra were separately managed and operated with cra focusing on opportunities within australasia and rtz taking the rest of the world however the companies continued to trade separately and rtzs ownership of cra dipped below  by  strategic needs of the two companies eventually led to conflicts of interest regarding new mining opportunities and shareholders of both companies determined a merger was in their mutual best interest in  the companies merged into a dual listed company in which management was consolidated into a single entity and share holder interests were aligned and equivalent although maintained as shares in separately named entities the merger also precipitated a name change after two years as rtzcra rtz became rio tinto plc and cra became rio tinto limited referred to collectively as rio tinto group or simply rio tinto recent mergers acquisitions and eventsedit major acquisitions following the consolidated zinc merger included us borax a major producer of borax bought in  kennecott utah copper and bp australias coal

supplies for use by spain and its axis allies germany and italy forcing price controls on the companys production restricting exports and threatening nationalisation of the mines although company management and indirectly the british government managed to counteract some of these efforts by franco much of the mines pyrite production was channelled to axis powers before and during world war ii

rio tinto from its investment portfolio the fund which is said to be the worlds secondlargest pension fund sold shares in the company valued at  billion kr us million to avoid contributing to environmental damages caused by the company exclusion of a company from the fund reflects our unwillingness to run an unacceptable risk of contributing to grossly unethical conduct the council on
