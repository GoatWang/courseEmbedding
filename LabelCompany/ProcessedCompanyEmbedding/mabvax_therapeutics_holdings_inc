cojune   to date twelve patients have been treated in this firstinhuman trial evaluating the safety and feasibility of mvt to image pancreatic tumors and other ca positive malignancies mvt was administered alone and in combination with mvt and was well tolerated in all cohorts the only toxicities were infusion reactions that resolved on the day of the injection with some requiring supportive medication uptake of mvt was observed in primary tumors and metastases as early as day  and continuously through day  standard uptake values suv a measurement of activity in pet imaging reached as high as  in the study the investigators reported that the high suv is amongst the highest lesion uptake they have ever seen for a radiolabeled antibody bone and soft tissue disease were readily visualized and lesion uptake of the radiotracer was higher than typically seen with pet imaging agents the correlation with computerized tomography ct scans was high results showed that mvt cold antibody predose reduces liver suv facilitating detection of liver metastases in addition the mvt cold antibody predose does not interfere with the uptake of mvt on cancer lesions mabvax
