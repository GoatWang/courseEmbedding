sara foster  commerce bank  zoominfocom sara foster sarafoster • instagram photos and videos erin foster and sara foster vhs barely famous tnp videos whats the new potato the new potato    barely famous’ sara  erin foster on their fake reality show avoiding candy  hating treadmills  april th  the hollywood sister duo erin and sara foster would never consider doing a reality tv show erin’s a screenwriter and sara’s an actress – why would they it’s just a coincidence that vh happens to follow them around with cameras turning the footage they get into a ‘nonseries’ called barely famous which they accidentally started airing last month every wednesday at pm central but seriously with their fake reality show where they spoof tv’s biggest phenomenon these two may just be our newest carrie and samantha this season’s ilana and abbi next year’s hannah and marni…you get the gist if you’ve watched you may already be obsessed with the show and have realized these sisters are most definitely fish in water when it comes to the camera it’s no surprise fame runs in the family their dad is acclaimed music producer david foster and their stepsisters are gigi and bella hadid but who cares they don’t want to be reality stars they just play them in real life and on tv get to know the foster girls who have recently stolen our hearts… from start to finish what would be your ideal food day erin i have a complicated relationship with food as many women do is it just me or do we all complain about feeling sick every time we eat anyway that’s a whole other interview my ideal food day always starts with oatmeal but on special occasions starts with avocado toast either will always be accompanied by a strong cup of homemade coffee and almond milk up next for lunch would be a shredded chicken salad or sandwich from mendocino farms then i would want a snack maybe some yogurt and granola or chips and hummus for dinner i would want mexican food or indian food all of this is making me very hungry oh and let’s not forget around  pm when i sneak downstairs and eat chocolate out of the freezer after spending fortyfive minutes trying to talk myself out of it sara i’m all over the place in the morning trying to get my fouryearold off to school on time i rarely have time for breakfast so ideally i would be able to sit and enjoy eggs and toast with avocado a turkey salad or sandwich is my favorite lunch i like to have a kale smoothie with protein powder before school pickup from my local juice shop for dinner i eat what my daughter eats usually which ranges from glutenfree spaghetti bolognese salmon with rice and veggies chicken and mashed potatoes or our local lebanese takeout how do you practice beauty from the inside out erin for my insides i try to eat clean organic and glutenfree foods and very little dairy i do yoga and try to make it to the gym three times a week but i’m not a fitness freak i do the least amount i can get away with i would always rather be sitting down than running on any treadmill but i also want to have a good body so that conflict stresses me out daily sara i wish i was a woman who woke up at am worked out and was ready to go by am but i’m just not i need eight hours of sleep and going to bed before pm isn’t always realistic i workout when i can i have tried it all – from tracy anderson to pilates plus to hot yoga for me the standard weight training is what works best i absolutely do not diet and never have i would be a very angry person if i were not allowing myself foods that i crave food brings me happiness and i love the bad stuff all that being said i will not eat candy or drink soda those are two things you will not find in my house i also don’t drink alcohol that often – only on special occasions i wear stress on my face it affects the inside and out for me so i am working on a meditation program i get very caught up on the outside and forget that it all starts on the inside what are your morning and nightly beauty regimens erin i never wash my face in the morning all you’ve done is slept no need for a face wash in my opinion i splash cold water on my face and then i use straight coconut oil on my face that i buy from whole foods i noticed a huge difference in my skin when i started using it it seemed to get hydrated and fuller and honestly younger at night i wash my face with this japanese brand called nsk komenuka bijin you can buy it at most beauty supply stores then i use the coconut oil on my face again and on my body sometimes i will also use pure aloe vera on my face but you can’t do it too often sara i have been keeping it very simple lately coconut oil all over my face and body followed by skinceuticals sport  sunscreen i also just visited georgia louise who is an excellent facialist in nyc and she felt my skin was extremely dehydrated so she put me on multiple serums including a vitamin c serum to help she also introduced me to the needle roller i already notice my crow’s feet diminishing five things you’re coveting right now… erin i’ve been dying to get a pair of ancient greek sandals i really like their clio sandal i need to get some frame denim i saw a pair on a friend and have been wanting their distressed skinny jeans there is so much elizabeth and james that i want the kisa dress the edmund vest and the crop tank sweater i need them so badly i’m obsessed with this nail earring from established jewelry it looks like there is a nail going straight through your ear it’s so cool but it’s solid gold if i could have a closet filled with lna tshirts i would oh and i always need more sonos speakers i live for sonos i’ve been buying them roombyroom in my house and i always find a new nook that needs one they have changed the game for me in listening to music sara a needle roller the saint laurent betty bag charlotte tilbury makeup alexandre birman heels and eberjey pajamas how did barely famous come about erin living in los angeles you look around and just see so much ridiculous behavior and we realized there was a good show in poking fun at it then we realized we should throw in reality tv culture too and make a curb your enthusiasm style show with a pop culture tone about the making of a fake reality show it got very confusing at times but i think in the end we really made the show we wanted to make sara i’ll let erin the writer take this one as her explanation is far more eloquent than mine what’s the thing you love most about your sister erin sara doesn’t really dwell on the past she just keeps moving forward she’s not overly sensitive she can shake something off pretty easily she is also always thinking of ways to help someone else wondering how she can connect them to the right person or help them in their job position she likes to fix things like that she also gives great advice which is part of her being an excellent problemsolver sara my favorite thing about erin is her love for my daughter she treats her as if she is her own she is literally her second mother nanny and aunt all wrapped up in one and i don’t even pay her what’s the thing that annoys you most about your sister erin i would never put that in writing she is still my older sister and i’m afraid of her sara she hums and it is the most annoying thing ever we will be arguing or talking about something important and out of nowhere she breaks into a hum it’s so passive aggressive and drives me nuts she knows it too therefore i think now she just does it on purpose… what food does your sister love that you hate and visa versa erin i love sushi and the sight of fish makes her gag she has the taste buds of a sixyearold so there is nothing she likes that i don’t also like i mean who doesn’t like cheeseburgers and mexican food sara she loves sushi and i absolutely don’t touch raw fish or raw anything for that matter i’m alienated from many dinners with my friends who are going to sugarfish i could eat mexican food at casa vega every night and erin is glutenfree so that doesn’t work for her so much best advice your sister’s ever given you erin she is really good when i feel out of control in a situation at reminding me that i am in control if i just look at it from a different angle she always reminds me to take the power back sara she is the first person to remind me to step back and take inventory of my fortunate life i get very overwhelmed with things and am not a multitasker and she always points out that my struggles and stress are minute compared to others and she is right it’s allrelative but the little daytoday battles i fight pale in comparison to real struggles that others are dealing with daily best advice you’ve ever received erin i think when my dad said “if you’re doing something that isn’t working anymore retreat and attack from a different direction” he means in business and i think it has helped me a lot when i’ve gotten stuck to not stop but just look at it from another view and find a different way in sara there are no short cuts in life the same people you see on the way up you see on the way down luck may get you somewhere for a second but if the hard work isn’t there then you will quickly fall longevity is the hardest thing to have in this business and talent always prevails hone your craft and work at it because if you aren’t willing to put in the hard yards then you won’t have a career to be proud of this is something i wish i learned in my early twenties funniest thing that’s happened on the set of the show thus far erin honestly every day of shooting was filled with us desperately trying to not ruin takes by laughing we improvised a ton of the material so you never knew what was going to come out of each others mouths at any given time and sometimes one of us would come up with something and it would be so insane we couldn’t hold it in then we would try to recreate it without laughing but the timing was gone and we just had to come up with something else sara shooting interviews were the toughest part of the show we were trying to move story but also tell jokes the show is a “fake reality show” so we are obviously not talking about real things happening to us in our lives and we are in character the whole time i play very out of it and “dumb blonde” in these scenes because we really wanted that dynamic with the girls we had a long day and at the very end erin came up with metal detector thing where i have just declared “fake anything is gross” she – on the fly – started going all over my body insinuating that i had plastic surgery from head to toe it was brilliant and so on point to the girls we are playing – girls who make such statements about things but are actually totally full of it and lying we all laughed for a good ten minutes after and the final product was pretty amazing comedy do you watch reality television if so what do you like if not why not erin i watch some i love the bachelor and the bachelorette i love a dating show those are my favorite the ones that are just following people in their lives aren’t as exciting to me sara i have seen a lot of the reality shows i don’t want to judge but the notion that people have their lives filmed while going out to eat and fighting with a husband or going on vacation and calling that work is just something i can’t fathom it’s not work and i think it’s a bad message to young people all that being said i am certainly not above being entertained by the bachelor words to yourself upon waking up in the morning looking in the mirror and getting dressed… erin i usually wake up and look in the mirror and go “whoa you look crazy” and then i wonder how some girls manage to look really delicate and fresh in the morning or maybe that is fake and only happens in notting hill sara be grateful for your health be grateful for your family’s health i think about this  health is freedom and without that we have nothing i have lost loved ones to illness and it’s horrific there isn’t a moment that goes by where i don’t count my lucky stars for it what are your favorite cities for food what restaurants do you go to in each erin i had the best beef in my life in tokyo it took me out of a tenyear stretch being a vegetarian and i’ve never given up meat since i think i had the best pasta of my life in napa california sara in los angeles craig’s for allaround american cuisine madeo for italian sunnin for lebanese and casa vega for mexican in new york elio’s for italian via quadronno for salami sandwiches westville for the best organic vegetables in the city and john’s for pizza in paris diep is the best chinese food i have ever had in the world l’ami louis is an incredible brasserie which i seldom can get a reservation at but when possible it’s an experience the burger at the park hyatt hotel is fantastic ladurée is where i go every morning for breakfast and chocolate croissants it’s touristy but i’m a tourist in the same vein as ‘what is the new black’ in fashion what’s ‘the new potato’ right now  erin ted talks are the new potato sara barely famous is the new potato sara foster on left and erin foster on right
