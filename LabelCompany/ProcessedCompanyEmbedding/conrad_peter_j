beauty of buddhism a religion now more relevant than ever to westerners perishing from the nihilism of the age i did not want to proselytise or convert or to write sociology of religion but simply tell the inside story of why so many professional people in the west – no longer only hippies – have recently found buddhist meditation helpful the oxherding pictures made charming illustrations

which his chosen stretch of country what was once the county of radnorshire in the welsh march now a subdivision of powys has over the centuries in the minds of one writer and visionary after another occupied a peculiar and private condition both marginal and somehow illuminated impoverished but rich in ways far beyond all the worldly goods the valley can offer it is a great subject full of mystery and inheritance landing on one bright pearl after another how does a place he repeatedly asks have the power to summon the transcendent and how is it that from the objective realities of hedge

like the glimpse of a lover has the thrilling power to stop the mind he brings the passion of the incomer the curiosity about every detail the longing to belong being jewish he says recalls being welsh the sense of being different in which pride and shame are usually indistinguishable the ferocious presence of your family the endless cousinly connections that stretch across the miles and years the claustrophobia you both hate and need like anyone in love with remote and marginal places mr conradi disputes the dismissive adjectives this is not the edge it is the forgotten centre it is all too easy to think of such landscapes as widows or orphans appendices halfderelict leftovers from the life that matters but radnorshire – at least this version of radnorshire – is not like that it is its own middle it conserves its own ways of life and mind whose centrality somehow consists in the deepest of privacies just heres the middle of a silence thathas already sung the centuries like a gnat as the modern poet roland mathias has put it  the story stretches from the medieval to the modern and through all of it this idea of the marginal middle endlessly circles around itself from geoffrey of monmouth to kilvert eric gill david jones and bruce chatwin it is a hymn to the importance of the unimportant nowhere however does this theme reach greater heights than in the miraculous

unsettling paradoxical nature of the young iris murdoch… we can see here the evolution of the novelist from the jejune chrysalis of her student experiences…her dominant subject as a novelist – the interplay between intelligence and eros reality and illusion false magic and true – reached down into the intensity of her early adult relations… murdoch grows up in the course of the two

disappear…but if the author is as accomplished as peter conradi then its a journey worth taking’ —alan judd literary review ‘impeccably researched “since we cannot enjoy his company in the flesh” conradi concludes “biography is one way of enjoying him in spirit” it is a fine description of the biographer’s role and generous quotations from frank thompson’s letters and poems recreate his bulky restless energetic presence but it is conradi’s own more subtle presence that locks the reader into the narrative a pensive moving and very personal book’ —frances wilson observer ‘inspiring’ —sunday
