acr  february   page  of   cole opened the driverside door and put his hands in the air but then pulled the door closed dyer opened the passengerside door with his left hand and then put his left hand out while keeping his right hand hidden dyer then briefly put his right foot on the ground as if he was going to get out of the car but then pulled it back inside dyer then started rummaging around on the floorboard and under his seat continuing to disregard the officers’ commands to put his hands up officer harper then observed dyer who was bent over and whose hands were not in view make a motion with his shoulder that officer harper believed was consistent with cocking a firearm dyer then sat up and began to raise his right elbow as if he had something in his hand at the same time cole put the car in reverse and accelerated the car fishtailed first toward officer elliott and then toward officer harper who was trapped between the accelerating car and the fence in response to the threat of the oncoming car and believing that dyer was armed and preparing to fire on him officer harper shot and fatally wounded dyer officer harper was unable to get a clear shot at cole so he did not fire again cole continued to accelerate and only surrendered when the car became stuck on a chainlink fence  after cole was taken into custody police searched the car and discovered three handguns—a  revolver and a mm taurus were found in the glove box and a ruger  with an obliterated serial number was found on the rear passenger floorboard additionally a large amount of ammunition and numerous syringes were found throughout the car in the center console police found two court of appeals of indiana  opinion acr  february   page  of  digital scales a glass pipe with methamphetamine residue and a manicure kit containing a spoon with heroin residue a razor blade and  grams of heroin  as a result of these events cole was charged as follows count i resisting law enforcement as a level  felony count ii possession of an altered handgun a level  felony count iii possession of methamphetamine as a level  felony count iv possession of a narcotic drug as a level  felony counts vvii carrying a handgun without a license as a class a misdemeanor and count viii possession of paraphernalia as a class a infraction a twoday jury trial commenced on november   at the conclusion of which cole was found guilty as charged the trial court sentenced cole to an aggregate term of eighteen years with ten years executed and eight years suspended to probation cole now appeals discussion  decision  on appeal cole argues that the state presented insufficient evidence to support his convictions in reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence we neither reweigh the evidence nor judge the credibility of witnesses atteberry v state  ned   ind ct app  instead we consider only the evidence supporting the conviction and the reasonable inferences flowing therefrom id if there is substantial evidence of probative value from which a  effective july   this offense has been reclassified as a class c misdemeanor see ind code §  court of appeals of indiana  opinion acr  february   page  of  reasonable trier of fact could have drawn the conclusion that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt the judgment will not be disturbed baumgartner v state  ned   ind ct app  it is not necessary that the evidence overcome every reasonable hypothesis of innocence rather the evidence is sufficient if an inference may reasonably be drawn from it to support the conviction drane v state  ned   ind   resisting law enforcement  cole first challenges his conviction for resisting law enforcement as a level  felony a person commits resisting law enforcement as a class a misdemeanor if he or she knowingly or intentionally “forcibly resists obstructs or interferes with a law enforcement officer or a person assisting the officer while the officer is lawfully engaged in the execution of the officer’s duties” ind code § a the offense is elevated to a level  felony if while committing the offense “the person operates a vehicle in a manner that causes the death of another person” ic § b on appeal cole argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the elevation of his conviction to a level  felony because the state failed to prove that it was cole’s operation of the car that caused dyer’s death instead he argues that dyer’s death was caused by officer harper who shot dyer in response to dyer’s own actions in making furtive movements and refusing to show his hands court of appeals of indiana  opinion acr  february   page  of   this court recently discussed causation in the context of the resisting law enforcement statute in moore v state  ned  ind ct app  trans denied in that case the court was asked to consider whether the evidence was sufficient to establish that the defendant had caused the injury sustained by the arresting officer when he fell down while chasing the fleeing defendant id at  see also ic § bb elevating resisting law enforcement to a level  felony when the defendant “inflicts bodily injury on or otherwise causes bodily injury to another person” the court held that the defendant’s acts of resistance must be a proximate cause of the injury and not merely a contributing cause id at  as the court noted a contributing cause is “a factor that—though not the primary cause—plays a part in producing a result” id at  quoting abney v state  ned   ind  the court described proximate cause as follows a finding of proximate cause embodies a value judgment as to the extent of the physical consequences of an action for which the actor should be held responsible accordingly “proximate cause questions are often couched in terms of ‘foreseeability’ an actor is not held responsible for consequences which are unforeseeable” it follows that where an intervening cause is claimed as superseding the defendant’s actions the intervening cause must be unforeseeable to relieve the defendant of criminal liability id at  quoting gibbs v state  ned   ind ct app  court of appeals of indiana  opinion acr  february   page  of   applying the proximate cause standard the majority in moore found the evidence insufficient to prove that the defendant’s actions caused the arresting officer’s injuries the court noted that the officer would not have been injured if he had not pursued the defendant but reasoned that “that fact is only sufficient to prove that moore was a contributing cause of the injury” and that “the actual cause of the officers fall was not clear from the record” id at  judge bradford dissented reasoning that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of proximate cause because “it is not unreasonable to anticipate that a consequence of fleeing from the police would be that an officer could fall and be injured during the ensuing chase” id at  bradford j dissenting  cole directs our attention to two additional cases both of which predate moore and neither of which employed the proximatecause standard in whaley v state  ned   ind ct app  trans denied this court held that the defendant had caused injuries to the arresting officers so as to support the elevation of his resisting law enforcement charges to class d felonies in that case whaley was lying on the ground and put his arms underneath his body to prevent the officers from handcuffing him the officers had to hit whaley’s forearms in order to bring his arms behind his back and both officers sustained injuries in the process of doing so this court held that the convictions were properly elevated because the officers’ injuries “were directly related to and caused by whaley’s resisting arrest” id at  court of appeals of indiana  opinion acr  february   page  of   in smith v state  ned   ind ct app  however another panel of this court found the evidence insufficient to support a finding that the defendant had inflicted or otherwise caused bodily injury to the arresting officer as necessary to support the elevation of the crime to a class d felony in that case smith refused to put her hands behind her back to be handcuffed even after receiving a “knee strike” from the officer so the officer pulled her arm “possibly as hard as he could” and they both ended up on the ground id at  during this process the officer sustained injuries to his knuckles and fingers in reversing the elevation of smith’s conviction the smith court reasoned that “we do not believe a person who is thrown to the ground necessarily ‘inflicts’ or ‘causes’ an injury suffered by the person who throws her to the ground” id at  the court went on to distinguish whaley noting that “unlike whaley smith did not create a scenario in which officer jones’s only option in handcuffing her was to remove her hands from a location in which he could not reach” id at   although smith and whaley did not use the language of proximate cause in moore  ned at  this court noted that those cases may be interpreted in a manner consistent with that standard in whaley whaley was the direct cause of the officers’ injuries because he left the officers no other choice but to hit his arms in terms of proximate cause this meant that the officers’ injuries were a highly foreseeable result of whaley’s actions in contrast in smith the officer had other options and his decision to take smith “to the ground” and injure himself was not as foreseeable therefore although the smith court did not frame its decision in court of appeals of indiana  opinion acr  february   page  of  terms of proximate cause we interpret the smith court’s holding to imply that smith’s actions were not a proximate cause of the officers injuries id  thus we are brought back to the touchstone of our proximate cause analysis— foreseeability although cole cites moore and acknowledges that the proximate cause standard is controlling in his analysis he does not discuss the foreseeability of the shooting that led to dyer’s death instead he simply argues that while his operation of the car might have been a contributing factor “the proximate cause of dyer’s death was the shooting of dyer by officer harper and officer harper pulled that trigger because he thought dyer was going to try and shoot him” appellant’s brief at  we interpret this as an argument that an intervening cause—whether it be officer harper’s decision to fire his weapon or dyer’s furtive gestures and refusal to show his hands— superseded cole’s actions but as we noted above this court has explained that an intervening cause must itself be unforeseeable if it is to relieve the defendant of criminal liability see moore  ned at   the foreseeability of an intervening cause presents a question of fact for the jury marlow v better bars inc  ned   ind ct app  trans denied under the circumstances of this case we conclude that all of the events cole claims to be superseding causes were foreseeable cole and dyer were attempting to evade police in a car containing multiple firearms and a large amount of ammunition in fleeing from police cole drove very court of appeals of indiana  opinion acr  february   page  of  recklessly crossing into the path of oncoming traffic disregarding traffic signals nearly striking pedestrians and reaching a top speed of approximately ninety miles per hour before crashing through a fence and coming to a stop in a residential backyard when police approached the car cole accelerated toward them and officer harper was trapped between a fence and the oncoming car simultaneously dyer was reaching down and although officer harper could not see what he was doing it appeared that dyer was cocking a gun in light of these facts it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that cole and dyer were acting in concert to evade the police by any means necessary including the use of deadly force against the officers and dyer’s furtive movements and refusal to show his hands were therefore easily foreseeable it was equally foreseeable that a police officer would respond by firing on the occupants of the vehicle contrary to cole’s arguments it makes little difference that officer harper shot dyer rather than cole officer harper testified as follows this is a very very small amount of time i assessed that the first threat was the person with the gun and the second threat is the car moving you can’t really decipher which one is more important it’s just you go with what you see and have a picture of i know i can’t shoot a car so i shot the person with the gun transcript at  officer harper testified further that if he had been able to get a clear shot he would have shot cole as well  in sum cole created a situation in which officer harper’s only option to protect himself was to discharge his weapon the fact that officer harper was able to get a clear shot at dyer and not cole does nothing to relieve cole of court of appeals of indiana  opinion acr  february   page  of  responsibility for the foreseeable results of his actions for all of these reasons we conclude that the state presented sufficient evidence to prove that cole’s operation of the car was a proximate cause of dyer’s death accordingly his resisting law enforcement conviction was properly elevated to a level  felony  possession of an altered handgun  next cole argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for possession of an altered handgun a level  felony in order to support this conviction the state was required to prove that cole “possessed any handgun on which the name of the maker model manufacturers serial number or other mark of identification has been changed altered removed or obliterated” ind code §  this court has interpreted this statute to also require the state to prove that the defendant knew that the handgun had been altered robles v state  ned   ind ct app  trans denied cole does not dispute that he possessed the ruger or that its serial number was obliterated instead he argues that the state presented insufficient evidence to prove that he was aware that the ruger had been altered  “a person engages in conduct ‘knowingly’ if when he engages in the conduct he is aware of a high probability that he is doing so” ind code § b see also robles  ned at  knowledge may be proven by circumstantial evidence and inferred from the facts and circumstances presented in a particular case robles  ned at  in robles our supreme court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to permit a reasonable inference that the defendant court of appeals of indiana  opinion acr  february   page  of  was aware that the handgun he possessed was altered because “the spot where the serial number had been filed off was ‘shiny’” and the defendant had “possessed the gun for over a week and had ample opportunity to discover that the serial number had been removed” id at  in wagerman v state on the other hand this court found that the evidence was insufficient to establish knowledge where the weapons at issue were “thrust upon” the defendant by his companions mere seconds before he was searched  ned   ind ct app  trans denied under those circumstances this court held that the defendant had no opportunity to apprise himself of the facts and avoid the prohibited conduct id at   the evidence in this case was sufficient to support a reasonable inference that cole had the opportunity to apprise himself of the fact that the ruger had been altered when police searched the car they found the ruger within cole’s reach on the rear passenger floor board moreover the holster cole was wearing on his belt at the time of his arrest was sized to fit the ruger and its curvature and wear patterns matched the ruger this evidence supports an inference that cole not only possessed the ruger but had been carrying it on his person for some length of time under these circumstances it was reasonable for the jury to infer that cole knew that the ruger had been altered  possession of a narcotic drug  cole next argues that the state presented insufficient evidence to support his conviction for level  felony possession of a narcotic drug ie heroin his court of appeals of indiana  opinion acr  february   page  of  argument however is premised on a misunderstanding of the evidence presented at trial and relied upon by the state specifically cole asserts that he was convicted of possessing heroin found in dyer’s groin area during an autopsy a review of the record reveals that this is not the case as an initial matter the substance found on dyer’s body during his autopsy was methamphetamine not heroin second the record reveals that cole’s conviction for possession of a narcotic drug was based on the heroin residue on the spoon and the baggie of heroin found in the manicure kit in the car’s center console indeed during closing argument the state referred to the baggie and the residue and made no mention of the substance found on dyer’s body see transcript at  prosecutor noting in closing argument “the heroin the residue on the spoon the spoon thats in that manicure kit additionally there was a baggie an actual baggie of heroin in that kit” cole makes no argument that he did not possess the heroin found in the manicure kit accordingly we cannot conclude that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for possession of a narcotic drug  carrying a handgun without a license  to the extent that cole intended to use his argument that he did not possess the substance found on dyer’s body to challenge his conviction for possession of methamphetamine as a level  felony we note that his conviction on that charge was based on methamphetamine residue found on two glass pipes found in the center console not the substance found on dyer’s body indeed the prosecutor made the following statement in closing argument “methamphetamine we saw that—the residue on the two glass pipes you heard matthew whitt from the crime lab testify that there were two glass pipes you saw them in the center console you saw the manicure kit” transcript at  the state did not ask the jury to convict cole of possessing the methamphetamine discovered on dyer’s body court of appeals of indiana  opinion acr  february   page  of   finally cole challenges two of his three convictions for carrying a handgun without a license although he does not challenge the conviction relating to the ruger he argues that the state presented insufficient evidence to support his convictions with respect to the  revolver and the mm taurus both of which were found in the glove box cole concedes that he was not licensed to carry a handgun but he argues that these convictions must be reversed because the state failed to prove that he knew the guns were in the glove box  ind code § a provides in relevant part that “a person shall not carry a handgun in any vehicle or on or about the persons body without being licensed under this chapter to carry a handgun” to support a conviction for carrying a handgun in a vehicle the state is required to prove that “ the defendant had control over the vehicle  the unlicensed handgun was found in a vehicle and  the defendant had knowledge of the weapons’ presence” henderson v state  ned   n ind  as held by this court in klopfenstein v state  ned   ind ct app  to establish this offense the state must prove that a handgun was found in a vehicle and that the defendant had control of either the weapon or of the vehicle with knowledge of the weapons presence in addition it must be established that there was an intention to convey or transport the weapon id see also dcc v state  ned   ind ct app  ferrell v state  ned   ind ct app  although the presence of a passenger in a car in which a handgun is being transported is insufficient to find that passenger guilty of carrying a handgun in a vehicle the driver of a vehicle is in violation of the statute if he conveys a handgun in the vehicle regardless of whether it is on or about his person court of appeals of indiana  opinion acr  february   page  of  klopfenstein  ned at  knowledge of the presence of the handgun is all that is required id thurman v state  ned   ind ct app  emphasis in original  in this case there is ample evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer cole’s knowledge and intent when officer elliot asked for the car’s registration during the initial stop cole started to reach for the glove box but then stopped and told the officer that he did not have the registration it is reasonable to infer from this that cole knew that there was contraband in the glove box and did not want officer elliot to see it moreover there was a large amount of ammunition of various calibers found throughout the car specifically there were thirtytwo unfired cartridges found scattered among loose change unwrapped candy and miscellaneous debris in the driverside door pocket four of the cartridges were mm one was  caliber and the remaining twentyseven cartridges bore a “c” headstamp four more cartridges were found in a backpack in the backseat two of which were  caliber and two of which bore the “c” headstamp a gun box found behind the driver’s seat contained firearm pieces and fortythree unfired cartridges and a separate ammunition box also found on the rear driverside floorboard  for this reason cole’s reliance on henderson  ned at  is misplaced because the defendant in that case was a passenger not a driver in control of the vehicle see thurman v state  ned   n noting “that the defendant in henderson was charged with carrying the handgun on or about his person not in a vehicle” court of appeals of indiana  opinion acr  february   page  of  contained an additional nine unfired cartridges five of which were  caliber and four of which were  caliber additionally a loaded mm magazine was found in the center console a holster was wedged between the driver’s seat and the center console and a gun box for a smith  wesson was found in the trunk the sheer ubiquity of ammunition and firearm accessories throughout the entire car was more than sufficient to support an inference that cole had control of the car with knowledge of the guns’ presence as well as the intent to convey or transport those weapons accordingly cole’s convictions for carrying a handgun without a license are supported by sufficient evidence  judgment affirmed  bradford j and pyle j concur court of
