between the regulated fund and the whollyowned investment sub the regulated funds board would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a whollyowned investment subs participation in a coinvestment transaction and the regulated funds board would be informed of and take into consideration any proposed use of a whollyowned investment sub in the regulated funds place if the regulated fund proposes to participate in the same coinvestment transaction with any of its whollyowned investment subs the board will also be informed of and take into consideration the
