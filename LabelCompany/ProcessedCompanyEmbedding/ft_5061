prairie dogsproduct type journal articleyear authors baker bw dj augustine ja sedgwick and bc lubowsuggested citation baker bw dj augustine ja sedgwick and bc lubow  ecosystem engineering varies spatially a test of the vegetation modification paradigm for prairie dogs ecography  – colonial burrowing herbivores can be engineers of grassland and shrubland ecosystems worldwide spatial variation in landscapes suggests caution when extrapolating singleplace studies of single species but lack of data and the need to generalize often leads to ‘model system’ thinking and application of results beyond appropriate statistical inference generalizations about the engineering effects of prairie dogs cynomys sp developed largely from intensive study at a single complex of blacktailed prairie dogs c ludovicianus in northern mixed prairie but have been extrapolated to other ecoregions and prairie dog species in north america and other colonial burrowing herbivores we tested the paradigm that prairie dogs decrease vegetation volume and the cover of grasses and tall shrubs and increase bare ground and forb cover we sampled vegetation on and off  colonies at  complexes of  prairie dog species widely distributed across  ecoregions in north america the paradigm was generally supported at  blacktailed prairie dog complexes in northern mixed prairie where vegetation volume grass cover and tall shrub cover were lower and bare ground and forb cover were higher on colonies than at paired offcolony sites outside the northern mixed prairie all  prairie dog species consistently reduced vegetation volume but their effects on cover of plant functional groups varied with prairie dog species and the grazing tolerance of dominant perennial grasses whitetailed prairie dogs c leucurus in sagebrush steppe did not reduce shrub cover whereas blacktailed prairie dogs suppressed shrub cover at all complexes with tall shrubs in the surrounding habitat matrix blacktailed prairie dogs in shortgrass steppe and gunnisons prairie dogs c gunnisoni in colorado plateau grassland both had relatively minor effects on grass cover which may reflect the dominance of grazingtolerant shortgrasses at both complexes variation in modification of vegetation structure may be understood in terms of the responses of different dominant perennial grasses to intense defoliation and differences in foraging behavior among prairie dog species spatial variation in the engineering role of prairie dogs suggests spatial variation in their keystone role and spatial variation in the roles of other ecosystem engineers thus ecosystem engineering can have a spatial component not evident from singleplace studies related projects no science projects found        bruce bakerbruce bakerjames
