environmental solutions inc destined for greatness lets see what the numbers say about nuverra nes alex planes tmfbiggles apr   at am investors love stocks that consistently beat the street without getting ahead of their fundamentals and risking a meltdown the best stocks offer sustainable marketbeating gains with robust and improving financial metrics that support strong price growth does nuverra environmental solutions inc nysenes fit the bill lets take a look at what its recent results tell us about its potential for future gains what were looking for the graphs youre about to see tell nuverras story and well be grading the quality of that story in several ways growth are profits margins and free cash flow all increasing valuation is share price growing in line with earnings per share opportunities is return on equity increasing while debt to equity declines dividends are dividends consistently growing in a sustainable way what the numbers tell you now lets take a look at nuverras key statistics nes total return price data source ycharts passing criteria year change grade revenue growth    pass improving profit margin  fail free cash flow growth  net income growth  vs  pass improving eps  fail stock growth    eps growth  vs  fail source ycharts  period begins at end of q  nes return on equity ttm data source ycharts passing criteria year change grade improving return on equity  fail declining debt to equity  fail source ycharts  period begins at end of q  how we got here and where were going things dont look good at all for nuverra in its second assessment as it earned only two out of seven possible passing grades compared to the four passes it picked up previously when it was still known as heckmann corporation nuverras biggest weakness is its sinking net income which has not only remained in negative territory for quite some time but also taken a much steeper drop lately as the company tries a more aggressive expansion strategy this has resulted in declining profit margins weaker equity metrics and increasing debt burdens this is somewhat offset by the fact that nuverras free cash flow is finally in positive territory but will it be enough for this oil and gas services specialist to turn around its sagging fortunes and falling share price lets dig a little deeper to find out last month nuverra reported lackluster fourthquarter earnings as competitive pressures and inclement weather tagteamed its top and bottom lines it also announced the sale of its thermo fluids division  which brought in revenues of  million in the fourth quarter  to verolube for  million in cash and stock my fellow writer dan caplinger notes that the sale of thermo fluids should allow nuverra to tighten its focus on shaledrilling environmental solutions which should ultimately drive better longterm results however investors are a bit disappointed with nuverras decision as the sale produced a hefty  million loss against what it originally paid to acquire thermo fluids in  the sale of thermo fluids business will also help nuverra trim its high debt load of over  million but the company is already facing some shortterm liquidity problems to counteract this issue it plans to increase its existing credit facility from  million to  million which is also likely to create increased interest expenses the companys brisk expansion seems to demand this financing boost as it plans to build a  million thermal desorption facility to treat and recycle oil well cuttings or solid waste and between  million and  million worth of water pipelines in the bakken region nuverra could also benefit from its water recycling program  ho forward  which will leverage a partnership with halliburton to obtain future contracts in other shale areas recovering natural gas prices and increased energy exploration activities in the united states should put nuverra in a good position for sustainable revenue growth over the next few quarters fellow writer mark holder notes that nuverra ought to benefit from ongoing shale gas exploration activities in the gulf coast coupled with thusfar underutilized pipeline assets in the haynesville and marcellus shale regions however nuverras underperforming texas and louisiana assets as well as recent weatherrelated weakness have left investors skeptical about its future potential putting the pieces together today nuverra has few of the qualities that make up a great stock but no stock is truly perfect digging deeper can help you uncover the answers you need to make a great buy  or to stay away from a stock
