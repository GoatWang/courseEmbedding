ipad customer reviews helpful       by irisheyes ive used this app for over a year and find it very helpful for falling asleep and preparing for the day it has come to be a part of my routine after listening to the falling asleep meditation i change to another app that allows you to mix various sounds as background for a wide variety of activities i have a mix i made for sleep and i set it to play for two hours i always fall asleep quickly and sleep soundly the option this app has to record how you feel physically and emotionally before and after your meditation intrigues me and i do record the before feeling but it is not particularly instructive i would like it if i could record a current condition or event that contributes to the feelings a note about what is going on that relates to the feeling such as sick or worried about politics or friends in town or pet hurt or great photos of jack rabbits or read inspiring book or terrific hike etc it could only record a designated number of characters but could be very helpful as a kind of ongoing measure of ones physical and emotional state along with factors that contributed to that state and meditations that help you manage your responses  you could get a running and long term view from which a targeted meditation plan could be created this app is routinely updated and has consistently improved i see great potential for future versions amazing app       by kat this is my favorite app on my phone i love the variety of meditations and even yoga it helps me stop think and breathe  not to be cliche or anything but it reminds me to slow down and to breathe when i have anxiety it truly helps my anxiety and reminds me my anxiety is not my identity i also love the stickers this app has helped me through so much and constantly reminds me to be mindful such a great guided meditation and even helps those whose minds can be constantly running and going to stop and be present i like that there are a variety of lengths so i can build up to something a little longer or if i am short on time i can still make time for a small mediation the voices are soothing and compassionate i feel like i am being wrapped in a warm blanket this is just a great app i just love this app⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️       by oh just me everything about this app is amazing i find it very relaxing grounding and clearing up my mind are use it every day at like all times this is just about may be the best app on my phone i give this app five stars for being easy to use and giving a great amount of content without paying a

nothing yet… total time meditating  the basics how it works practice meditations learn the basics get meditating in  minutes easy with this app you can practice mindfulness and meditation through a process called stop breathe  think stop what you are doing check in with what you are thinking and how you are feeling breathe practice mindful breathing to create space between your thoughts emotions and reactions think learn to settle down and strengthen your force field of peace and calm by practicing one of the meditations what is mindfulness and meditation mindfulness is a way of paying attention to what is happening right now by observing what’s going on inside your thoughts feelings and physical sensations and outside your interactions and surroundings with an open mind and without judgment mindfulness helps us stay focused and present when we practice the two kinds of meditation offered in sbt active thinking where we intentionally direct our thoughts and imagination to think and feel positively and resting the mind where we let it all go what mindfulness can do for you have you ever been in a bad mood and didn’t know why you can practice mindfulness to investigatefigure out what’s going on in your head and to see how it’s impacting your feelings and actions you can identify and work with nagging repetitive thoughts that add to stress you can change annoying habits you can create space between your thoughts and reactions so you don’t keep doing unproductive things you can create a sense of peace and wellbeing by strengthening your kindness and compassion what to expect all sorts of things come up when you practice mindfulness thoughts feelings sounds and physical sensations sometimes it can feel uncomfortable other times it goes really smoothly and feels great don’t worry  it’s all part of the experience the point is to notice  observe what’s going on with an open mind and to learn not to get hung up on anything in particular if you get stuck just bring your attention to something neutral like your breathing how do mindfulness  meditation work thoughts and the brain you can rewire your brain just by meditating because our brains change based on how they are used every time you have a thought neurons connect like little impulses across the map of your brain when these neurons connect your brain grows thicker and stronger in certain places based on the thoughts you think we can actually change the circuitry of the brain to help us be more peaceful and compassionate simply by directing our thoughts and imaginations just like a bodybuilder lifting weights to build muscle the more you think positive thoughts the stronger the part of your brain that allows you to experience positive feelings will become stress and the body many of the body’s functions work automatically like breathing blood pressure and digestion these functions are controlled by the autonomic nervous system ans the ans is divided into two branches the sympathetic nervous system sns  the fight or flight response during stress intense activity and emergencies and the parasympathetic nervous system pns  the rest  digest or calming response the sns or fight or flight is responsible for what happens to your body in response to very stressful situations adrenaline circulates through the blood affecting every organ your heart pumps faster blood pressure rises breathing becomes faster and more shallow pupils expand and your muscles tighten the sns is your body’s natural response during emergencies but often times it is triggered during everyday stress and when this happens it can make us feel unhealthy when we practice mindfulness and meditation and focus on deep relaxed breaths we can turn off the sns and turn on our parasympathetic nervous system pns also known as rest and digest which calms us down and helps us to relax when the pns is activated your heart rate drops blood pressure falls breathing slows and deepens pupils shrink and muscles relax this promotes good digestion supports your immune system and just makes you feel good all over practice practice practice creating an environment mindfulness and meditation can be done anytime anywhere and people don’t even have to know you are doing it practice mindfulness anytime walking taking the bus riding a bike playing sports opening a book answering the phone getting out of your chair you can do any of these things mindfully by just noticing your breathing what your body feels like what you are thinking and what you are feeling if you have the opportunity you can create a quiet space without distractions where you can sit comfortably and in a relaxed position on a cushion or chair if you are sitting on a chair place your feet flat on the floor when you begin your mindfulness practice remember to check your posture is your back straight can you breathe easy if you feel tired or lethargic it helps to sit up straight practice makes perfect you’re not going to be master of mindfulness right away the more you do it the better you get just like lifting weights to make your body stronger you’re using mindfulness to help strengthen your brain sometimes it helps to set a regular time and place to practice sometimes you might have a hard time actually feeling some of the positive feelings talked about in each of the meditations that’s ok just doing the meditations and giving yourself the opportunity to feel these positive feelings is a huge step about each meditation these meditations are intended to encourage and inspire thinking and acting in positive ways they give you a chance to broaden your perspective which can help you settle yourself down when you are upset or stressed it may not happen right away but be confident that with practice it will welcoming the day meditation can be especially fruitful when transitioning from being asleep to being awake begin the day mindfully with this gentle meditation for awakening by focusing on your body’s natural feelings of warmth and peace plant the seed of peacefulness when your mind is dawning just like the new day falling asleep meditation can be especially fruitful when transitioning from being awake to falling asleep let go of the day’s stresses and prepare for sleep with this guided meditation allow yourself to relax into open awareness and enjoy your body’s natural warmth and peace as you drift into sleep mindful breathing learn to observe what’s going on inside your thoughts feelings and physical sensations and outside your interactions and surroundings with an open mind and without judging by intentionally bringing your awareness to the sensation of your breathing body scan bring awareness to each part of your body noticing your experience with a sense of curiosity and without judging we often carry stress and emotions in the body becoming aware of sensations in the body can help us recognize emotions and impulses as they arise we can change habits of reactivity by choosing to settle ourselves down and respond differently engaging your senses observe what you experience through your senses without labels like good or bad or pleasant or unpleasant learn to notice and experience things as they are without reacting to or judging them mindful walk by bringing mindfulness to everyday activities like walking you can be more attentive to what’s going on inside your thoughts feelings physical sensations and outside your interactions and surroundings without getting caught up in judging or evaluating life is a journey enjoy a little peace of mind on your path toward your destination be present listening to the being present meditation is about taking a timeout by focusing on one thing  the sound of running water  you can destress and settle yourself down gratitude appreciate the positive aspects of your life by focusing on the love kindness and support you have experienced through this

more happiness and contentment by coping with strong feelings like sadness and loss feel more balanced and grounded whether things are going great or not so well commonality of suffering because we all suffer in some way recognizing the commonality of suffering can help you to be patient and understanding empathetic compassionate  recognizing that we are all in the same boat allows you to develop compassion for yourself and for other people whether you know them or not appreciative of what you have cause  effect every action has a result when you engage in positive actions you increase your chances of having positive experiences and vice versa the thing to remember is that whatever you do it is entirely up to you  you’re in the driver’s seat of your choices and future kindness kindness is the wish that others experience happiness focusing on kindness helps you to maintain a broader perspective and look at situations beyond your own point of view a broader perspective can help you be less affected by the turbulence of life and remain calm and settled if you are having a hard time wishing for the happiness of someone you dislike try practicing the commonality of suffering and cause and effect meditations equanimity equanimity is a mental calmness and evenness even when faced with difficulty equanimity allows you to keep an open mind and extend your kindness

good the bad and the ugly try the equanimity meditation to overcome the habit of always judging people or situations compassion compassion is the recognition that others are suffering paired with the sincere wish that they be free from it shifting your focus from yourself is another way to strengthen your kindness and your forcefield of peace and calmness if you are having a hard time feeling compassion try doing the commonality of suffering meditation just do your best to put yourself in another person’s shoes and try to feel what they are feeling joy joy means rejoicing celebrate the
