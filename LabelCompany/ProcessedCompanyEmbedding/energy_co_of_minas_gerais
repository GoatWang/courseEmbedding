municipality in brazil after the cities of são paulo rio de janeiro salvador brasilia and fortaleza but its metropolitan area is the third largest in brazil with just over  inhabitants after those of são paulo and rio de janeiro minas gerais is the state with the largest number of brazilian presidentscitation needed with an area of  square kilometres  sq mi—larger than metropolitan france—it is the fourth most extensive state in brazil the main producer of coffee and milk in the country minas gerais is known for its heritage of architecture and colonial art in historical cities such as são

sports  flag  cities  references  external links etymologyedit two interpretations are given for the origin of the name minas gerais it comes from minas dos matos gerais the former name of the colonial province mines of the general woods so a first and more common understanding affirms that the name simply means general mines with the word gerais serving as an adjective to the mines which were themselves spread in several spots around a larger region another explanation is that this ignores the two large geographical spaces which conformed the state in its history the region of the mines minas and the region of the gerais matos gerais or campos gerais which means something close to general fields these corresponded to the areas of sertão which were farther and hard to access with an economy based on farming and agriculture from the mining spots whose economic space was urban from its origin the confusion comes from the fact that the term gerais is taken as an adjective to minas in the first version although according to this point of view it refers to the region called gerais as a noun a further complication is that this is not a welldefined area on the map of the state but rather a designation to these parts outside the mining spots more related to the geography of sertão and more isolated from the states nucleus locationedit minas gerais is in the north of the southeastern subdivision of brasil which also contains the states of são paulo rio de janeiro and espírito santo it borders on bahia north goiás west and northwest mato grosso do sul far west the states of são paulo and rio de janeiro south and the state of espírito santo east it also shares a short boundary with the distrito federal northwest minas gerais is situated between ° and ° s

notably the são francisco the paraná and to a lesser extent the rio doce the state also holds many hydroelectric power plants including furnas some of the highest peaks in brazil are in the mountain ranges in the southern part of the state such as serra da mantiqueira and serra do cervo that mark the border between minas and its neighbors são paulo and rio de janeiro the most notable one is the pico da bandeira the third highest mountain in brazil at  m standing on the border with espírito santo state the state also has huge reserves of iron and sizeable reserves of gold and gemstones including emerald topaz and aquamarine mines emeralds found in this location are comparable to the best colombiaorigin emeralds and are most often a bluishgreen color each region of the state has a distinct character geographically and to a certain extent culturally town of bom jesus de matosinhos c the central and eastern area of the state is hilly and rocky with little vegetation on the mountains around lagoa santa and sete lagoas a typical karst topography with caves and lakes is found some of the mountains are almost entirely iron ore which led to extensive mining in some places at the expense of the environment recent advances in environmental policy helped to put limits to mining about  kilometres  mi to the east of belo horizonte is the second metropolitan region of the state vale do aço steel valley which has iron and steel processing companies along the course of the rio doce and its tributaries vale do aços largest cities are ipatinga coronel fabriciano and timóteo now that mining is restricted large areas of forest are being removed for timber charcoal and to clear land for cattle ranching the original forest cover of these inland hills is very much fragmented the city of governador valadares is in the limit of this region with the poorer north the south of minas gerais is hilly and green with coffee and milk production this region is notably cooler than the rest of the state and some locations are subject to temperatures just below the freezing point during the winter the region is also famed for its mineralwater resorts including the cities of poços de caldas lambari são lourenço and caxambu many industries are located at varginha and pouso alegre the southeast of the state called zona da mata forest zone was the richest region until the mid th century nowadays the biggest city juiz de fora remains an important industrial cultural and educational center being also the fourth largest in the minas state the daytoday living in the zona da mata however is better represented by a group of smaller cities like além paraíba viçosa leopoldina cataguases muriaé ubá astolfo dutra and several others those cities put together form a strong economic presence based mostly on agriculture textiles and minerals the city of the principal coffee region in minas gerais is são joão do manhuaçu situated in zona da mata the west of minas gerais also known as triângulo mineiro which means the minas triangle due to the geographic shape of this region is composed of a particular type of savanna known as the cerrado this region was initially occupied by large freewheeling beef ranches which are still important for the economy of the region over the s extensive soy and corn farms occupied much of the farming land available the cerrado is also one of the principal coffeegrowing areas of brazil the main cities of this region are uberlândia uberaba patos de minas and araguari the north of minas gerais is arid being subject to frequent droughts recent irrigation projects use the water from the são francisco river for agriculture the river crosses the northern region carrying water from its basin in the central area of the state which is subject to a regular rainfall pattern the diamond mines of this region mainly in diamantina attracted miners but are now exhausted and the remaining population lives in poor conditions especially in the valley of the jequitinhonha river the region is however known for its high quality cachaça production salinas in particular exports large amounts of this alcoholic beverage the main cities of this

geologyedit paleontologyedit maxakalisaurus the discovery of the maxakalisaurus topai dinoprata fossils was a significant paleontological find the fossil is a genus of titanosaurid dinosaur found  kilometers  mi from the city of prata triângulo mineiro in the state of minas gerais in  it was closely related to saltasaurus a sauropod considered unusual because it had evolved apparently defensive traits including bony plates on its skin and vertical plates along its spine such osteoderms have also been found for maxakalisaurus the genus name is derived from the tribe of the maxakali the maxakalisaurus fossils belonged to an animal about  meters  ft long with an estimated weight of  tons although according to paleontologist alexander kellner it could reach a length of approximately  meters  ft it had a long neck and tail ridged teeth unusual among sauropods and lived about  million years ago because sauropods seem to have lacked significant competition in south america they evolved there with greater diversity and more unusual traits than elsewhere in the world a replica has been displayed at the museu nacional in rio de janeiro since august   historyedit baruch th century baroque architecture by aleijadinho in the colonial era the brazilian interior was colonized by portuguese and bandeirantes the brazilian gold rush ushered in an influx of new settlers in search of veins of gold discovered  and gems and later diamonds which come from the naturally occurring itacolumite rock that can be found in great numbers in the region these helped to boost occupation of the inner lands and led to the foundation of several new villages in  the portuguese used enslaved african labor to start building the estrada real the royal road that would connect the ports of cities of rio de janeiro and paraty to the mineralrich regions of ouro preto serro and at the northernmost point diamantina prior to  minas gerais was part of the captaincy of são vicente later renamed são paulo e minas de ouro the first capital of minas gerais and seat of the local see was the city of mariana it was later moved to vila rica in the late th century vila rica was the largest city in brazil and one of the most populous in america as the gold mines were exhausted over the th century the city lost its importance it was later renamed ouro preto and remained the state capital until the construction of the allnew planned city of belo horizonte at the turn of the th century the gold cycle left its mark in cities such as mariana ouro preto diamantina sabará tiradentes and são joão del rei the relative isolation from european influence added to the huge influx of gold and other valuable minerals helped the local people to develop their own style of art which became known as barroco mineiro prime examples of this period are the richly decorated churches in the colonial cities the most important artist of this period was antônio francisco lisboa who became known as aleijadinho his sculptural and architectural work is highly valued by experts as one of the most refined artistic expressions outside europe at that time in addition to art and architecture there was an explosion of musical activity in minas gerais in the th century printed copies of european music as well as accomplished musicians made the journey to the area and soon a local school of composition and performance was born and achieved considerable sophistication several composers worked in minas gerais in the th century mainly in vila rica now ouro preto sabará mariana and other cities some of the names which have survived include josé joaquim emerico lobo de mesquita marcos coelho netto francisco gomes da rocha and ignácio parreiras neves they cultivated a style related to the classical european style but marked by more a more chordal homophonic sound and they usually wrote for mixed groups of voices and instruments guimarães rosas literature is mostly situated in minas gerais with locations widely located across the state hence the term general although more concentrated in its north rather than delimited and identifiable this northern area began to be colonized with brutal conflicts with the large amerindian population who lived in some parts especially in vale do jequitinhonha and became accessible to colonists departing from bahia up north which made the portuguese crown insert the region within the state of minas geraiss borders in order to prevent gold and diamond smuggling from people trying to avoid colonial taxation and oversight thus the state of mg was closely watched by the crown because of its tax revenue people of minas gerais c during the th century mining exploration was strongly controlled by the portuguese crown which imposed heavy taxes on everything extracted one fifth of all gold would go to the crown several rebellions were attempted by the colonists always facing strong reaction by the imperial crown one of the most important was the felipe dos santos revolt that ended with his execution but also with the separation of minas gerais of são paulo the most notable one however was the inconfidência started in  by group of middleclass colonists mostly intellectuals and young officers they were inspired by the american and french enlightenment ideals the conspiracy failed and the rebels were arrested and exiled the most famous of them joaquim josé da silva xavier known as tiradentes was hanged by order of queen maria i of portugal becoming a local hero and a national martyr of brazil the minas gerais flag—a red triangle on a white background along with the latin motto libertas quæ sera tamen freedom albeit late—is based on the design for the national flag proposed by the inconfidentes as the rebels became known in the economic history of brazil minas gerais plays a pivotal role in shifting the economic axis from the brazilian northeast based on sugarcane that starts declining in the th century to the southeast of the country which still remains the major economic center the large amounts of gold found in the region attracted the attention of portugal back to brazil progressively turning rio de janeiro into an important port city from where these would be shipped to portugal and where the portuguese crown would eventually move its administration in  after napoleon bonapartes invasion of portugal see transfer of the portuguese court to brazil due to the economic importance of the state and the particular traits of the local population—famed for its reserved and balanced character—minas gerais has also played an important role on national politics during the th century politicians such as josé bonifácio de andrada e silva were instrumental in the establishment of the brazilian empire under the rule of dom pedro i and later his son dom pedro ii after the installation of the brazilian republic during the early th century minas gerais shared the control of the national political scene with são paulo in what became known as the coffee with milk café com leite political cycle coffee being the major product of são paulo and milk representing minas gerais dairy industry despite the latter also being an important coffee producer minas gerais was also home to two of the most influential brazilian politicians of the second half of the th century juscelino kubitschek was president from  to  and he was responsible for the construction of brasília as the new capital of brazil tancredo neves had an extensive political career that culminated with his election in  to be the first civil president after the  military countercoup however he died after a series of health complications just as he was about to assume the position also itamar brazils

lebanese the ethnic composition of the population varies from town to town for example in córrego do bom jesus a small town located in the extreme south of minas gerais white people make up  of the population the south of minas gerais is both the most european and the most densely populated part of the state on the other hand in setubinha located in the northeast part of the state  are mixedrace and  blacks it is historically explainable southern minas gerais in the border with são paulo received larger numbers of portuguese farmers in colonial times in the late th century italian immigrants also arrived the north region close to bahia was a place to the arrival of many african slaves since the th century the central part of the state where the capital belo horizonte is has a more balanced ratio between whites blacks and mixed people downtown of uberlândia largest city in the state after belo horizonte indians visiting a brazilian farm plantation in minas gerais  the population of minas gerais is the result of an intense mixture of peoples particularly between black africans and portuguese in colonial minas gerais the population was divided in five different categories whites mostly portuguese africans who often did not have a surname and were usually known for their region of origin for example francisca benguela would refer to benguela crioulos black people born in brazil usually to both african parents mulattoes people of mixed black and white ancestry usually born to a black mother and a portuguese father and cabras people of mixed ancestry usually with high degree of amerindian admixture blacks and mulattoes predominated in the population after the beginning of the colonization by the th century however whites were already the largest single group in the minas gerais population taking the population as a whole all groups included european genes account for the majority of the minas gerais genetic heritage which has been explained on the basis of the extremely high mortality rates of the enslaved african population and lower reproductive rate of african slaves the vast majority of them were males among other reasons for their lower reproductive success the amerindian population was hit hard by the diseases brought by the european colonists and they did not have much of an impact either especially in minas gerais where european presence and colonization was massive during the colonial period the disproportion between the number of men and women was quite sharp the census of  in serro do frio which included diamantina revealed that of the  inhabitants  were men and  women among the slaves women were only  the number of free women of color blacks and mulattoes was very high the same census revealed that  of the former slaves were women and only  men since interracial relationships between women of color and white men were widespread the female slaves were more likely to be freed than the male slaves the monogamous family structure that the catholic church tried to deploy in colonial brazil was the exception in minas gerais at that time cohabitation and temporary relationships predominated in minas gerais as well as in brazil as a whole monogamy and weddings in churches would only take root in brazil in the th century fitting the moral standards imposed by the church the role of women in colonial minas gerais was much more dynamic than it would be allowed by the standards of the time many women used to live on their own were heads of family and worked particularly the women of color and former slaves the society of minas gerais provided a great social mobility to former slaves mainly for women in tejuco the percentage of white males who were head of family  was very similar to the percentage of black women who were head of family  many former slaves were able to accumulate goods and many of them became slave owners as well some blacks and mainly mulattos were able to integrate themselves in the highest social stratum of the society of minas gerais once restricted to whites this happened through a process of whitening their descendence and through the assimilation of the culture of the white elite like being members of catholic brotherhoods cohabitation was the most common crime in minas gerais the catholic church was strict in the punishment of this crime in order to prevent the widespread miscegenation between white mostly portuguese males with black or mulatto women according to a  autosomal dna study the ancestral composition of the state of minas gerais can be described as  european  african and  native american  a genetic study with a few samples and not covering the most populated part of the state the south of minas gerais suggested that the whites from minas gerais would have slightly lower levels of european at  ancestry among the brazilian regions and higher levels at  of african admixture with significant amerindian  admixture the european reference population in the study being  european  native american and  african which would give an actual percentage of european ancestry of about  actual european ancestry and less than  of each native american and african ancestries according to another study however the european ancestry is dominant throughout brazil at about  minas gerais included and this taking into account the whole of the population of minas gerais white pardos and blacks a new portrayal of each ethnicity contribution to the dna of brazilians obtained with samples from the five regions of the country has indicated that on average european ancestors are responsible for nearly  of the genetic heritage of the population the variation between the regions is small with the possible exception of the south where the european contribution reaches nearly  the results published by the scientific magazine american journal of human biology by a team of the catholic university of brasília show that in brazil physical indicators such as skin colour colour of the eyes and colour of the hair have little to do with the genetic ancestry of each person which has been shown in previous studies during the time of the gold rush the largest european immigration of the colonial period to all of the americas took place about  portuguese immigrated to brazil during the gold rush and most of them to minas gerais the place where the gold rush activities took place most of them came from entre douro e minho in northern portugal the reference book for a large number of these families is velhos troncos mineiros old

etymologyedit two interpretations are given for the origin of the name minas gerais it comes from minas dos matos gerais the former name of the colonial province mines of the general woods so a first and more common understanding affirms that the name simply means general mines with the word gerais serving as an adjective to the mines which were themselves spread in several spots around a larger region another explanation is that this ignores the two large geographical spaces which conformed the state in its history the region of the mines minas and the region of the gerais matos gerais or campos gerais which means something close to general fields these corresponded to the areas of sertão which were farther and hard to access with an economy based on farming and agriculture from the mining spots whose economic space was urban from its origin the confusion comes from the fact that the term gerais is taken as an adjective to minas in the first version although according to this point of view it refers to the region called gerais as a noun a further complication is that this is not a welldefined area on the map of the state but rather a designation to these parts outside the mining spots more related to the geography of sertão and more isolated from the states nucleus locationedit minas gerais is in the north of the southeastern subdivision of brasil which also contains the states of são paulo rio de janeiro and espírito santo it borders on bahia north goiás west and northwest mato grosso do sul far west the states of são paulo and rio de janeiro south and the state

maxakalisaurus topai dinoprata fossils was a significant paleontological find the fossil is a genus of titanosaurid dinosaur found  kilometers  mi from the city of prata triângulo mineiro in the state of minas gerais in  it was closely related to saltasaurus a sauropod considered unusual because it had evolved apparently defensive traits including bony plates on its skin and vertical plates along its spine such osteoderms have also been found for maxakalisaurus the genus name is derived from the tribe of the maxakali the maxakalisaurus fossils belonged to an animal about  meters  ft long with an estimated weight of  tons although according to paleontologist alexander kellner it could reach a length of approximately  meters  ft it had a long neck and tail ridged teeth unusual among sauropods and lived about  million years ago because sauropods seem to have lacked significant competition in south america they evolved there with greater diversity and more unusual traits than elsewhere in the world a replica has been displayed at the museu nacional in rio de janeiro since august   historyedit baruch th century baroque architecture by aleijadinho in the colonial era the brazilian interior was colonized by portuguese and bandeirantes the brazilian gold rush ushered in an influx of new settlers in search of veins of gold discovered  and gems and later diamonds which come from the naturally occurring itacolumite rock that can be found in great numbers in the region these helped to boost occupation of the inner lands and led to the foundation of several new villages in  the portuguese used enslaved african labor to start building the estrada real the royal road that would connect the ports of cities of rio de janeiro and paraty to the mineralrich regions of ouro preto serro and at the northernmost point diamantina prior to  minas gerais was part of the captaincy of são vicente later renamed são paulo e minas de ouro the first capital of minas gerais and seat of the local see was the city of mariana it was later moved to vila rica in the late th century vila rica was the largest city in brazil and one of the most populous in america as the gold mines were exhausted over the th century the city lost its importance it was later renamed ouro preto and remained the state capital until the construction of the allnew planned city of belo horizonte at the turn of the th century the gold cycle left its mark in cities such as mariana ouro preto diamantina sabará tiradentes and são joão del rei the relative isolation from european influence added to the huge influx of gold and other valuable minerals helped the local people to develop their own style of art which became known as barroco mineiro prime examples of this period are the richly decorated churches in the colonial cities the most important artist of this period was antônio francisco lisboa who became known as aleijadinho his sculptural and architectural work is highly valued by experts as one of the most refined artistic expressions outside europe at that time in addition to art and architecture there was an explosion of musical activity in minas gerais in the th century printed copies of european music as well as accomplished musicians made the journey to the area and soon a local school of composition and performance was born and achieved considerable sophistication several composers worked in minas gerais in the th century mainly in vila rica now ouro preto sabará mariana and other cities some of the names which have survived include josé joaquim emerico lobo de mesquita marcos coelho netto francisco gomes da rocha and ignácio parreiras neves they cultivated a style related to the classical european style but marked by more a more chordal homophonic sound and they usually wrote for mixed groups of voices and instruments guimarães rosas literature is mostly situated in minas gerais with locations widely located across the state hence the term general although more concentrated in its north rather than delimited and identifiable this northern area began to be colonized with brutal conflicts with the large amerindian population who lived in some parts especially in vale do jequitinhonha and became accessible to colonists departing from bahia up north which made the portuguese crown insert the region within the state of minas geraiss borders in order to prevent gold and diamond smuggling from people trying to avoid colonial taxation and oversight thus the state of mg was closely watched by the crown because of its tax revenue people of minas gerais c during the th century mining exploration was strongly controlled by the portuguese crown which imposed heavy taxes on everything extracted one fifth of all gold would go to the crown several rebellions were attempted by the colonists always facing strong reaction by the imperial crown one of the most important was the felipe dos santos revolt that ended with his execution but also with the separation of minas gerais of são paulo the most notable one however was the inconfidência started in  by group of middleclass colonists mostly intellectuals and young officers they were inspired by the american and french enlightenment ideals the conspiracy failed and the rebels were arrested and exiled the most famous of them joaquim josé da silva xavier known as tiradentes was hanged by order of queen maria i of portugal becoming a local hero and a national martyr of brazil the minas gerais flag—a red triangle on a white background along with the latin motto libertas quæ sera tamen freedom albeit late—is based on the design for the national flag proposed by the inconfidentes as the rebels became known in the economic history of brazil minas gerais plays a pivotal role in shifting the economic axis from the brazilian northeast based on sugarcane that starts declining in the th century to the southeast of the country which still remains the major economic center the large amounts of gold found in the region attracted the attention of portugal back to brazil progressively turning rio de janeiro into an important port city from where these would be shipped to portugal and where the portuguese crown would eventually move its administration in  after napoleon bonapartes invasion of portugal see transfer of the portuguese court to brazil due to the economic importance of the state and the particular traits of the local population—famed for its reserved and balanced character—minas gerais has also played an important role on national politics during the th century politicians such as josé bonifácio de andrada e silva were instrumental in the establishment of the brazilian empire under the rule of dom pedro i and later his son dom pedro ii after the installation of the brazilian republic during the early th century minas gerais shared the control of the national political scene with são paulo in what became known as the coffee with milk café com leite political cycle coffee being the major product of são paulo and milk representing minas gerais dairy industry despite the latter also being an important coffee producer minas gerais was also home to two of the most influential brazilian politicians of the second half of the th century juscelino kubitschek was president from  to  and he was responsible for the construction of brasília as the new capital of brazil tancredo neves had an extensive political career that culminated with his election in  to be the first civil president after the  military countercoup however he died after a

found in minas gerais include amerindians portuguese africans italians germans and lebanese the ethnic composition of the population varies from town to town for example in córrego do bom jesus a

the other hand in setubinha located in the northeast part of the state  are mixedrace and  blacks it is historically explainable southern minas gerais in the border with são paulo received larger numbers of portuguese farmers in colonial times in the late th century italian immigrants also arrived the north region close to bahia was a place to the arrival of many african slaves since the th century the central part of the state where the capital belo horizonte is has a more balanced ratio between whites blacks and mixed people downtown of uberlândia largest city in the state after belo horizonte indians visiting a brazilian farm plantation in minas gerais  the population of minas gerais is the result of an intense mixture of peoples particularly between black africans and portuguese in colonial minas gerais the population was divided in five different categories whites mostly portuguese africans who often did not have a surname and were usually known for their region of origin for example francisca benguela would refer to benguela crioulos black people born in brazil usually to both african parents mulattoes people of mixed black and white ancestry usually born to a black mother and a portuguese father and cabras people of mixed ancestry usually with high degree of amerindian admixture blacks and mulattoes predominated in the population after the beginning of the colonization by the th century however whites were already the largest single group in the minas gerais population taking the population as a whole all groups included european genes account for the majority of the minas gerais genetic heritage which has been explained on the basis of the extremely high mortality rates of the enslaved african population and lower reproductive rate of african slaves the vast majority of them were males among other reasons for their lower reproductive success the amerindian population was hit hard by the diseases brought by the european colonists and they did not have much of an impact either especially in minas gerais where european presence and colonization was massive during the colonial period the disproportion between the number of men and women was quite sharp the census of  in serro do frio which included diamantina revealed that of the  inhabitants  were men and  women among the slaves women were only  the number of free women of color blacks and mulattoes was very high the same census revealed that  of the former slaves were women and only  men since interracial relationships between women of color and white men were widespread the female slaves were more likely to be freed than the male slaves the monogamous family structure that the catholic church tried to deploy in colonial brazil was the exception in minas gerais at that time cohabitation and temporary relationships predominated in minas gerais as well as in brazil as a whole monogamy and weddings in churches would only take root in brazil in the th century fitting the moral standards imposed by the church the role of women in colonial minas gerais was much more dynamic than it would be allowed by the standards of the time many women used to live on their own were heads of family and worked particularly the women of color and former slaves the society of minas gerais provided a great social mobility to former slaves mainly for women in tejuco the percentage of white males who were head of family  was very similar to the percentage of black women who were head of family  many former slaves were able to accumulate goods and many of them became slave owners as well some blacks and mainly mulattos were able to integrate themselves in the highest social stratum of the society of minas gerais once restricted to whites this happened through a process of whitening their descendence and through the assimilation of the culture of the white elite like being members of catholic brotherhoods cohabitation was the most common crime in minas gerais the catholic church was strict in the punishment of this crime in order to prevent the widespread miscegenation between white mostly portuguese males with black or mulatto women according to a  autosomal dna study the ancestral composition of the state of minas gerais can be described as  european  african and  native american  a genetic study with a few samples and not covering the most populated part of the state the south of minas gerais suggested that the whites from minas gerais would have slightly lower levels of european at  ancestry among the brazilian regions and higher levels at  of african admixture with significant amerindian  admixture the european reference population in the study being  european  native american and  african which would give an actual percentage of european ancestry of about  actual european ancestry and less than  of each native american and african ancestries according to another study however the european ancestry is dominant throughout brazil at about  minas gerais included and this taking into account the whole of the population of minas gerais white pardos and blacks a new portrayal of each ethnicity contribution to the dna of brazilians obtained with samples from the five regions of the country has indicated that on average european ancestors are responsible for nearly  of the genetic heritage of the population the variation between the regions is small with the possible exception of the south where the european contribution reaches nearly  the results published by the scientific magazine american journal of human biology by a team of the catholic university of brasília show that in brazil physical indicators such as skin colour colour of the eyes and colour of the hair have little to do with the genetic ancestry of each person which has been shown in previous studies during the time of the gold rush the largest european immigration of the colonial period to all of the americas took place about  portuguese immigrated to brazil during the gold rush and most of them to minas gerais the place where the gold rush activities took place most of them came from entre douro e minho in northern

the states capital and largest city belo horizonte is a major urban and finance center in latin america and is the sixth largest municipality in brazil after the cities of são paulo rio de janeiro salvador brasilia and fortaleza but its metropolitan area is the third largest in brazil with just over  inhabitants after those of são paulo and rio de janeiro minas gerais is the state with the largest number of brazilian presidentscitation needed with an area of  square kilometres  sq mi—larger than metropolitan france—it is the fourth most extensive state in brazil the main producer of

etymologyedit two interpretations are given for the origin of the name minas gerais it comes from minas dos matos gerais the former name of the colonial province mines of the general woods so a first and more common understanding affirms that the name simply means general mines with the word gerais serving as an adjective to the mines which were themselves spread in several spots around a larger region another explanation is that this ignores the two large geographical spaces which conformed the state in its history the region of the mines minas and the region of the gerais matos gerais or campos gerais which means something close to general fields these corresponded to the areas of sertão which were farther and hard to access with an economy based on farming and agriculture from the mining spots whose economic space was urban from its origin the confusion comes from the fact that the term gerais is taken as an adjective to minas in the first version although according to this point of view it refers to the region called gerais as a noun a further complication is that this is not a welldefined area on the map of the state but rather a designation to these parts outside the mining spots more related to the geography of sertão and more isolated from the states nucleus locationedit minas gerais is in the north of the southeastern subdivision of brasil which also contains the states of são paulo rio de janeiro and espírito santo it borders on bahia north goiás west and northwest mato grosso do sul far west the states of são paulo and rio de janeiro south and the state of espírito santo east it also shares a short boundary with the distrito federal northwest minas gerais is situated between ° and ° s latitude and between ° and ° w longitude it is larger in area than

doce the state also holds many hydroelectric power plants including furnas some of the highest peaks in brazil are in the mountain ranges in the southern part of the state such as serra da mantiqueira and serra do cervo that mark the border between minas and its neighbors são paulo and rio de janeiro the most notable one is the pico da bandeira the third highest mountain in brazil at  m standing on the border with espírito santo state the state also has huge reserves of iron and sizeable reserves of gold and gemstones including emerald topaz and aquamarine mines emeralds found in this location are comparable to the best colombiaorigin emeralds and are most often a bluishgreen color each region of the state has a distinct character geographically and to a certain extent culturally town of bom jesus de matosinhos c the central and eastern area of the state is hilly and rocky with little vegetation on the mountains around lagoa santa and sete lagoas a typical karst topography with caves and lakes is found some of the mountains are almost entirely iron ore which led to extensive mining in some places at the expense of the environment recent advances in environmental policy helped to put limits to mining about  kilometres  mi to the east of belo horizonte is the second metropolitan region of the state vale do aço steel valley which has iron and steel processing companies along the course of the rio doce and its tributaries vale do aços largest cities are ipatinga coronel fabriciano and timóteo now that mining is restricted large areas of forest are being removed for timber charcoal and to clear land for cattle ranching the original forest cover of these inland hills is very much fragmented the city of governador valadares is in the limit of this region with the poorer north the south of minas gerais is hilly and green with coffee and milk production this region is notably cooler than the rest of the state and some locations are subject to temperatures just below the freezing point during the winter the region is also famed for its mineralwater resorts including the cities of poços de caldas lambari são lourenço and caxambu many industries are located at varginha and pouso alegre the southeast of the state called zona da mata forest zone was the richest region until the mid th century nowadays the biggest city juiz de fora remains an important industrial cultural and educational center being also the fourth largest in the minas state the daytoday living in the zona da mata however is better represented by a group of smaller cities like além paraíba viçosa leopoldina cataguases muriaé ubá astolfo dutra and several others those cities put together form a strong economic presence based mostly on agriculture textiles and minerals the city of the principal coffee region in minas gerais is são joão do manhuaçu situated in zona da mata the west of minas gerais also known as triângulo mineiro which means the minas triangle due to the geographic shape of this region is composed of a particular type of savanna known as the cerrado this region was initially occupied by large freewheeling beef ranches which are still important for the economy of the region over the s extensive soy and corn farms occupied much of the farming land available the cerrado is also one of the principal coffeegrowing areas of brazil the main cities of this region are uberlândia uberaba patos de minas and araguari the north of minas gerais is arid being subject to frequent droughts recent irrigation projects use the water from the são francisco river for agriculture the river crosses the northern region carrying water from its basin in the central area of the state which is subject to a regular rainfall pattern the diamond mines of this region mainly in diamantina attracted miners but are now exhausted and the remaining population lives in poor conditions especially in the valley of the jequitinhonha river the region is however known for its high quality cachaça production salinas in particular exports large amounts of this alcoholic beverage the main cities of this region are montes claros teófilo otoni pirapora and janaúba serra da

maxakalisaurus topai dinoprata fossils was a significant paleontological find the fossil is a genus of titanosaurid dinosaur found  kilometers  mi from the city of prata triângulo mineiro in the state of minas gerais in  it was closely related to saltasaurus a sauropod considered unusual because it had evolved apparently defensive traits including bony plates on its skin and vertical plates along its spine such osteoderms have also been found for maxakalisaurus the genus name is derived from the tribe of the maxakali the maxakalisaurus fossils belonged to an animal about  meters  ft long with an estimated weight of  tons although according to paleontologist alexander kellner it could reach a length of approximately  meters  ft it had a long neck and tail ridged teeth unusual among sauropods and lived about  million years ago because sauropods seem to have lacked significant competition in south america they evolved there with greater diversity and more unusual traits than elsewhere in the world a replica has been displayed at the museu nacional in rio de janeiro since august   historyedit baruch th century baroque architecture by aleijadinho in the colonial era the brazilian interior was colonized by portuguese and bandeirantes the brazilian gold rush ushered in an influx of new settlers in search of veins of gold discovered  and gems and later diamonds which come from the naturally occurring itacolumite rock that can be found in great numbers in the region these helped to boost occupation of the inner lands and led to the foundation of several new villages in  the portuguese used enslaved african labor to start building the estrada real the royal road that would connect the ports of cities of rio de janeiro and paraty to the mineralrich regions of ouro preto serro and at the northernmost point diamantina prior to  minas gerais was part of the captaincy of são vicente later renamed são paulo e minas de ouro the first capital of minas gerais and seat of the local see was the city of mariana it was later moved to vila rica in the late th century vila rica was the largest city in brazil and one of the most populous in america as the gold mines were exhausted over the th century the city lost its importance it was later renamed ouro preto and remained the state capital until the construction of the allnew planned city of belo horizonte at the turn of the th century the gold cycle left its mark in cities such as mariana ouro preto diamantina sabará tiradentes and são joão del rei the relative isolation from european influence added to the huge influx of gold and other valuable minerals helped the local people to develop their own style of art which became known as barroco mineiro prime examples of this period are the richly decorated churches in the colonial cities the most important artist of this period was antônio francisco lisboa who became known as aleijadinho his sculptural and architectural work is highly valued by experts as one of the most refined artistic expressions outside europe at that time in addition to art and architecture there was an explosion of musical activity in minas gerais in the th century printed copies of european music as well as accomplished musicians made the journey to the area and soon a local school of composition and performance was born and achieved considerable sophistication several composers worked in minas gerais in the th century mainly in vila rica now ouro preto sabará mariana and other cities some of the names which have survived include josé joaquim emerico lobo de mesquita marcos coelho netto francisco gomes da rocha and ignácio parreiras neves they cultivated a style related to the classical european style but marked by more a more chordal homophonic sound and they usually wrote for mixed groups of voices and instruments guimarães rosas literature is mostly situated in minas gerais with locations widely located across the state hence the term general although more concentrated in its north rather than delimited and identifiable this northern area began to be colonized with brutal conflicts with the large amerindian population who lived in some parts especially in vale do jequitinhonha and became accessible to colonists departing from bahia up north which made the portuguese crown insert the region within the state of minas geraiss borders in order to prevent gold and diamond smuggling from people trying to avoid colonial taxation and oversight thus the state of mg was closely watched by the crown because of its tax revenue people of minas gerais c during the th century mining exploration was strongly controlled by the portuguese crown which imposed heavy taxes on everything extracted one fifth of all gold would go to the crown several rebellions were attempted by the colonists always facing strong reaction by the imperial crown one of the most important was the felipe dos santos revolt that ended with his execution but also with the separation of minas gerais of são paulo the most notable one however was the inconfidência started in  by group of middleclass colonists mostly intellectuals and young officers they were inspired by the american and french enlightenment ideals the conspiracy failed and the rebels were arrested and exiled the most famous of them joaquim josé da silva xavier known as tiradentes was hanged by order of queen maria i of portugal becoming a local hero and a national martyr of brazil the minas gerais flag—a red triangle on a white background along with the latin motto libertas quæ sera tamen freedom albeit late—is based on the design for the national flag proposed by the inconfidentes as the rebels became known in the economic history of brazil minas gerais plays a pivotal role in shifting the economic axis from the brazilian northeast based on sugarcane that starts declining in the th century to the southeast of the country which still remains the major economic center the large amounts of gold found in the region attracted the attention of portugal back to brazil progressively turning rio de janeiro into an important port city from where these would be shipped to portugal and where the portuguese crown would eventually move its administration in  after napoleon bonapartes invasion of portugal see transfer of the portuguese court to brazil due to the economic importance of the state and the particular traits of the local population—famed for its reserved and balanced character—minas gerais has also played an important role on national politics during the th century politicians such as josé bonifácio de andrada e silva were instrumental in the establishment of the brazilian empire under the rule of dom pedro i and later his son dom pedro ii after the installation of the brazilian republic during the early th century minas gerais shared the control of the national political scene with são paulo in what became known as the coffee with milk café com leite political cycle coffee being the major product of são paulo and milk representing minas gerais dairy industry despite the latter also being an important coffee producer minas gerais was also home to two of the most influential brazilian politicians of the second half of the th century juscelino kubitschek was president from  to  and he was responsible for the construction of brasília as the new capital of brazil tancredo neves had an extensive political career that culminated with his election in  to be the first civil president after the  military countercoup however he died after a

last pnad national research for sample of domiciles census revealed the following numbers  white people   brown multiracial people   black people   asian people   amerindian people  ethnic groups found in minas gerais include amerindians portuguese africans italians germans and lebanese the ethnic composition of the population varies from town to town for example in córrego do bom jesus a small town located in the extreme south of minas gerais white people make up  of the population the south of minas gerais is both the most european and the most densely populated part of the state on the other hand in setubinha located in the northeast part of the state  are mixedrace and  blacks it is historically explainable southern minas gerais in the border with são paulo received larger numbers of portuguese farmers in colonial times in the late th century italian immigrants also arrived the north region close to bahia was a place to the arrival of many african slaves since the th century the central part of the state where the capital belo horizonte is has a more balanced ratio between whites blacks and mixed people downtown of uberlândia largest city in the state after belo horizonte indians visiting a brazilian farm plantation in minas gerais  the population of minas gerais is the result of an intense mixture of peoples particularly between black africans and portuguese in colonial minas gerais the population was divided in five different categories whites mostly portuguese africans who often did not have a surname and were usually known for their region of origin for example francisca benguela would refer to benguela crioulos black people born in brazil usually to both african parents mulattoes people of mixed black and white ancestry usually born to a black mother and a portuguese father and cabras people of mixed ancestry usually with high degree of amerindian admixture blacks and mulattoes predominated in the population after the beginning of the colonization by the th century however whites were already the largest single group in the minas gerais population taking the population as a whole all groups included european genes account for the majority of the minas gerais genetic heritage which has been explained on the basis of the extremely high mortality rates of the enslaved african population and lower reproductive rate of african slaves the vast majority of them were males among other reasons for their lower reproductive success the amerindian population was hit hard by the diseases brought by the european colonists and they did not have much of an impact either especially in minas gerais where european presence and colonization was massive during the colonial period the disproportion between the number of men and women was quite sharp the census of  in serro do frio which included diamantina revealed that of the  inhabitants  were men and  women among the slaves women were only  the number of free women of color blacks and mulattoes was very high the same census revealed that  of the former slaves were women and only  men since interracial relationships between women of color and white men were widespread the female slaves were more likely to be freed than the male slaves the monogamous family structure that the catholic church tried to deploy in colonial brazil was the exception in minas gerais at that time cohabitation and temporary relationships predominated in minas gerais as well as in brazil as a whole monogamy and weddings in churches would only take root in brazil in the th century fitting the moral standards imposed by the church the role of women in colonial minas gerais was much more dynamic than it would be allowed by the standards of the time many women used to live on their own were heads of family and worked particularly the women of color and former slaves the society of minas gerais provided a great social mobility to former slaves mainly for women in tejuco the percentage of white males who were head of family  was very similar to the percentage of black women who were head of family  many former slaves were able to accumulate goods and many of them became slave owners as well some blacks and mainly mulattos were able to integrate themselves in the highest social stratum of the society of minas gerais once restricted to whites this happened through a process of whitening their descendence and through the assimilation of the culture of the white elite like being members of catholic brotherhoods cohabitation was the most common crime in minas gerais the catholic church was strict in the punishment of this crime in order to prevent the widespread miscegenation between white mostly portuguese males with black or mulatto women according to a  autosomal dna study the ancestral composition of the state of minas gerais can be described as  european  african and  native american  a genetic study with a few samples and not covering the most populated part of the state the south of minas gerais suggested that the whites from minas gerais would have slightly lower levels of european at  ancestry among the brazilian regions and higher levels at  of african admixture with significant amerindian  admixture the european reference population in the study being  european  native american and  african which would give an actual percentage of european ancestry of about  actual european ancestry and less than  of each native american and african ancestries according to another study however the european ancestry is dominant throughout brazil at about  minas gerais included and this taking into account the whole of the population of minas gerais white pardos and blacks a new portrayal of each ethnicity contribution to the dna of brazilians obtained with samples from the five regions of the country has indicated that on average european ancestors are responsible for nearly  of the genetic heritage of the population the variation between the regions is small with the possible exception of the south where the european contribution reaches nearly  the results published by the scientific magazine american journal of human biology by a team of the catholic university of brasília show that in brazil physical indicators such as skin colour colour of the eyes and colour of the hair have little to do with the genetic ancestry of each person which has been shown in previous studies during the time of the gold rush the largest european immigration of the colonial period to all of the americas took place about  portuguese immigrated to brazil during the gold rush and most of them to minas gerais the place where the gold rush activities took place most of them came from entre douro e minho in northern portugal the reference book for a large number of these families is velhos troncos mineiros old mineiro branches by raimundo trindade the native american population of minas gerais was estimated to be

the states capital and largest city belo horizonte is a major urban and finance center in latin america and is the sixth largest municipality in brazil after the cities of são paulo rio de janeiro salvador brasilia and fortaleza but its metropolitan area is the third largest in brazil with just over  inhabitants after those of são paulo and rio de janeiro minas gerais is the state with the largest number of brazilian presidentscitation needed with an area of  square kilometres  sq mi—larger than metropolitan france—it is the fourth most extensive state in brazil the main producer of

etymologyedit two interpretations are given for the origin of the name minas gerais it comes from minas dos matos gerais the former name of the colonial province mines of the general woods so a first and more common understanding affirms that the name simply means general mines with the word gerais serving as an adjective to the mines which were themselves spread in several spots around a larger region another explanation is that this ignores the two large geographical spaces which conformed the state in its history the region of the mines minas and the region of the gerais matos gerais or campos gerais which means something close to general fields these corresponded to the areas of sertão which were farther and hard to access with an economy based on farming and agriculture from the mining spots whose economic space was urban from its origin the confusion comes from the fact that the term gerais is taken as an adjective to minas in the first version although according to this point of view it refers to the region called gerais as a noun a further complication is that this is not a welldefined area on the map of the state but rather a designation to these parts outside the mining spots more related to the geography of sertão and more isolated from the states nucleus locationedit minas gerais is in the north of the southeastern subdivision of brasil which also contains the states of são paulo rio de janeiro and espírito santo it borders on bahia north goiás west and northwest mato grosso do sul far west the states of são paulo and rio de janeiro south and the state of espírito santo east it also shares a short boundary with the distrito federal northwest minas gerais is situated between ° and ° s latitude and between ° and ° w longitude it is larger in area than

doce the state also holds many hydroelectric power plants including furnas some of the highest peaks in brazil are in the mountain ranges in the southern part of the state such as serra da mantiqueira and serra do cervo that mark the border between minas and its neighbors são paulo and rio de janeiro the most notable one is the pico da bandeira the third highest mountain in brazil at  m standing on the border with espírito santo state the state also has huge reserves of iron and sizeable reserves of gold and gemstones including emerald topaz and aquamarine mines emeralds found in this location are comparable to the best colombiaorigin emeralds and are most often a bluishgreen color each region of the state has a distinct character geographically and to a certain extent culturally town of bom jesus de matosinhos c the central and eastern area of the state is hilly and rocky with little vegetation on the mountains around lagoa santa and sete lagoas a typical karst topography with caves and lakes is found some of the mountains are almost entirely iron ore which led to extensive mining in some places at the expense of the environment recent advances in environmental policy helped to put limits to mining about  kilometres  mi to the east of belo horizonte is the second metropolitan region of the state vale do aço steel valley which has iron and steel processing companies along the course of the rio doce and its tributaries vale do aços largest cities are ipatinga coronel fabriciano and timóteo now that mining is restricted large areas of forest are being removed for timber charcoal and to clear land for cattle ranching the original forest cover of these inland hills is very much fragmented the city of governador valadares is in the limit of this region with the poorer north the south of minas gerais is hilly and green with coffee and milk production this region is notably cooler than the rest of the state and some locations are subject to temperatures just below the freezing point during the winter the region is also famed for its mineralwater resorts including the cities of poços de caldas lambari são lourenço and caxambu many industries are located at varginha and pouso alegre the southeast of the state called zona da mata forest zone was the richest region until the mid th century nowadays the biggest city juiz de fora remains an important industrial cultural and educational center being also the fourth largest in the minas state the daytoday living in the zona da mata however is better represented by a group of smaller cities like além paraíba viçosa leopoldina cataguases muriaé ubá astolfo dutra and several others those cities put together form a strong economic presence based mostly on agriculture textiles and minerals the city of the principal coffee region in minas gerais is são joão do manhuaçu situated in zona da mata the west of minas gerais also known as triângulo mineiro which means the minas triangle due to the geographic shape of this region is composed of a particular type of savanna known as the cerrado this region was initially occupied by large freewheeling beef ranches which are still important for the economy of the region over the s extensive soy and corn farms occupied much of the farming land available the cerrado is also one of the principal coffeegrowing areas of brazil the main cities of this region are uberlândia uberaba patos de minas and araguari the north of minas gerais is arid being subject to frequent droughts recent irrigation projects use the water from the são francisco river for agriculture the river crosses the northern region carrying water from its basin in the central area of the state which is subject to a regular rainfall pattern the diamond mines of this region mainly in diamantina attracted miners but are now exhausted and the remaining population lives in poor conditions especially in the valley of the jequitinhonha river the region is however known for its high quality cachaça production salinas in particular exports large amounts of this alcoholic beverage the main cities of this region are montes claros teófilo otoni pirapora and janaúba serra da

maxakalisaurus topai dinoprata fossils was a significant paleontological find the fossil is a genus of titanosaurid dinosaur found  kilometers  mi from the city of prata triângulo mineiro in the state of minas gerais in  it was closely related to saltasaurus a sauropod considered unusual because it had evolved apparently defensive traits including bony plates on its skin and vertical plates along its spine such osteoderms have also been found for maxakalisaurus the genus name is derived from the tribe of the maxakali the maxakalisaurus fossils belonged to an animal about  meters  ft long with an estimated weight of  tons although according to paleontologist alexander kellner it could reach a length of approximately  meters  ft it had a long neck and tail ridged teeth unusual among sauropods and lived about  million years ago because sauropods seem to have lacked significant competition in south america they evolved there with greater diversity and more unusual traits than elsewhere in the world a replica has been displayed at the museu nacional in rio de janeiro since august   historyedit baruch th century baroque architecture by aleijadinho in the colonial era the brazilian interior was colonized by portuguese and bandeirantes the brazilian gold rush ushered in an influx of new settlers in search of veins of gold discovered  and gems and later diamonds which come from the naturally occurring itacolumite rock that can be found in great numbers in the region these helped to boost occupation of the inner lands and led to the foundation of several new villages in  the portuguese used enslaved african labor to start building the estrada real the royal road that would connect the ports of cities of rio de janeiro and paraty to the mineralrich regions of ouro preto serro and at the northernmost point diamantina prior to  minas gerais was part of the captaincy of são vicente later renamed são paulo e minas de ouro the first capital of minas gerais and seat of the local see was the city of mariana it was later moved to vila rica in the late th century vila rica was the largest city in brazil and one of the most populous in america as the gold mines were exhausted over the th century the city lost its importance it was later renamed ouro preto and remained the state capital until the construction of the allnew planned city of belo horizonte at the turn of the th century the gold cycle left its mark in cities such as mariana ouro preto diamantina sabará tiradentes and são joão del rei the relative isolation from european influence added to the huge influx of gold and other valuable minerals helped the local people to develop their own style of art which became known as barroco mineiro prime examples of this period are the richly decorated churches in the colonial cities the most important artist of this period was antônio francisco lisboa who became known as aleijadinho his sculptural and architectural work is highly valued by experts as one of the most refined artistic expressions outside europe at that time in addition to art and architecture there was an explosion of musical activity in minas gerais in the th century printed copies of european music as well as accomplished musicians made the journey to the area and soon a local school of composition and performance was born and achieved considerable sophistication several composers worked in minas gerais in the th century mainly in vila rica now ouro preto sabará mariana and other cities some of the names which have survived include josé joaquim emerico lobo de mesquita marcos coelho netto francisco gomes da rocha and ignácio parreiras neves they cultivated a style related to the classical european style but marked by more a more chordal homophonic sound and they usually wrote for mixed groups of voices and instruments guimarães rosas literature is mostly situated in minas gerais with locations widely located across the state hence the term general although more concentrated in its north rather than delimited and identifiable this northern area began to be colonized with brutal conflicts with the large amerindian population who lived in some parts especially in vale do jequitinhonha and became accessible to colonists departing from bahia up north which made the portuguese crown insert the region within the state of minas geraiss borders in order to prevent gold and diamond smuggling from people trying to avoid colonial taxation and oversight thus the state of mg was closely watched by the crown because of its tax revenue people of minas gerais c during the th century mining exploration was strongly controlled by the portuguese crown which imposed heavy taxes on everything extracted one fifth of all gold would go to the crown several rebellions were attempted by the colonists always facing strong reaction by the imperial crown one of the most important was the felipe dos santos revolt that ended with his execution but also with the separation of minas gerais of são paulo the most notable one however was the inconfidência started in  by group of middleclass colonists mostly intellectuals and young officers they were inspired by the american and french enlightenment ideals the conspiracy failed and the rebels were arrested and exiled the most famous of them joaquim josé da silva xavier known as tiradentes was hanged by order of queen maria i of portugal becoming a local hero and a national martyr of brazil the minas gerais flag—a red triangle on a white background along with the latin motto libertas quæ sera tamen freedom albeit late—is based on the design for the national flag proposed by the inconfidentes as the rebels became known in the economic history of brazil minas gerais plays a pivotal role in shifting the economic axis from the brazilian northeast based on sugarcane that starts declining in the th century to the southeast of the country which still remains the major economic center the large amounts of gold found in the region attracted the attention of portugal back to brazil progressively turning rio de janeiro into an important port city from where these would be shipped to portugal and where the portuguese crown would eventually move its administration in  after napoleon bonapartes invasion of portugal see transfer of the portuguese court to brazil due to the economic importance of the state and the particular traits of the local population—famed for its reserved and balanced character—minas gerais has also played an important role on national politics during the th century politicians such as josé bonifácio de andrada e silva were instrumental in the establishment of the brazilian empire under the rule of dom pedro i and later his son dom pedro ii after the installation of the brazilian republic during the early th century minas gerais shared the control of the national political scene with são paulo in what became known as the coffee with milk café com leite political cycle coffee being the major product of são paulo and milk representing minas gerais dairy industry despite the latter also being an important coffee producer minas gerais was also home to two of the most influential brazilian politicians of the second half of the th century juscelino kubitschek was president from  to  and he was responsible for the construction of brasília as the new capital of brazil tancredo neves had an extensive political career that culminated with his election in  to be the first civil president after the  military countercoup however he died after a series of health complications just as he was about to assume the position also itamar brazils previous president lived there though he was not born in minas see also the list of governors of minas

numbers of portuguese farmers in colonial times in the late th century italian immigrants also arrived the north region close to bahia was a place to the arrival of many african slaves since the th century the central part of the state where the capital belo horizonte is has a more balanced ratio between whites blacks and mixed people downtown of uberlândia largest city in the state after belo horizonte indians visiting a brazilian farm plantation in minas gerais  the population of minas gerais is the result of an intense mixture of peoples particularly between black africans and portuguese in colonial minas gerais the population was divided in five different categories whites mostly portuguese africans who often did not have a surname and were usually known for their region of origin for example francisca benguela would refer to benguela crioulos black people born in brazil usually to both african parents mulattoes people of mixed black and white ancestry usually born to a black mother and a portuguese father and cabras people of mixed ancestry usually with high degree of amerindian admixture blacks and mulattoes predominated in the population after the beginning of the colonization by the th century however whites were already the largest single group in the minas gerais population taking the population as a whole all groups included european genes account for the majority of the minas gerais genetic heritage which has been explained on the basis of the extremely high mortality rates of the enslaved african population and lower reproductive rate of african slaves the vast majority of them were males among other reasons for their lower reproductive success the amerindian population was hit hard by the diseases brought by the european colonists and they did not have much of an impact either especially in minas gerais where european presence and colonization was massive during the colonial period the disproportion between the number of men and women was quite sharp the census of  in serro do frio which included diamantina revealed that of the  inhabitants  were men and  women among the slaves women were only  the number of free women of color blacks and mulattoes was very high the same census revealed that  of the former slaves were women and only  men since interracial relationships between women of color and white men were widespread the female slaves were more likely to be freed than the male slaves the monogamous family structure that the catholic church tried to deploy in colonial brazil was the exception in minas gerais at that time cohabitation and temporary relationships predominated in minas gerais as well as in brazil as a whole monogamy and weddings in churches would only take root in brazil in the th century fitting the moral standards imposed by the church the role of women in colonial minas gerais was much more dynamic than it would be allowed by the standards of the time many women used to live on their own were heads of family and worked particularly the women of color and former slaves the society of minas gerais provided a great social mobility to former slaves mainly for women in tejuco the percentage of white males who were head of family  was very similar to the percentage of black women who were head of family  many former slaves were able to accumulate goods and many of them became slave owners as well some blacks and mainly mulattos were able to integrate themselves in the highest social stratum of the society of minas gerais once restricted to whites this happened through a process of whitening their descendence and through the assimilation of the culture of the white elite like being members of catholic brotherhoods cohabitation was the most common crime in minas gerais the catholic church was strict in the punishment of this crime in order to prevent the widespread miscegenation between white mostly portuguese males with black or mulatto women according to a  autosomal dna study the ancestral composition of the state of minas gerais can be described as  european  african and  native american  a genetic study with a few samples and not covering the most populated part of the state the south of minas gerais suggested that the whites from minas gerais would have slightly lower levels of european at  ancestry among the brazilian regions and higher levels at  of african admixture with significant amerindian  admixture the european reference population in the study being  european  native american and  african which would give an actual percentage of european ancestry of about  actual european ancestry and less than  of each native american and african ancestries according to another study however the european ancestry is dominant throughout brazil at about  minas gerais included and this taking into account the whole of the population of minas gerais white pardos and blacks a new portrayal of each ethnicity contribution to the dna of brazilians obtained with samples from the five regions of the country has indicated that on average european ancestors are responsible for nearly  of the genetic heritage of the population the variation between the regions is small with the possible exception of the south where the european contribution reaches nearly  the results published by the scientific magazine american journal of human biology by a team of the catholic university of brasília show that in brazil physical indicators such as skin colour colour of the eyes and colour of the hair have little to do with the genetic ancestry of each person which has been shown in previous studies during the time of the gold rush the largest european immigration of the colonial period to all of the americas took place about  portuguese immigrated to brazil during the gold rush and most of them to minas gerais the place where the gold rush activities took place most of them came from entre douro e minho in northern portugal the reference book for a large number of these families is velhos troncos mineiros old mineiro branches by raimundo trindade the native american population of minas gerais was estimated to be

etymologyedit two interpretations are given for the origin of the name minas gerais it comes from minas dos matos gerais the former name of the colonial province mines of the general woods so a first and more common understanding affirms that the name simply means general mines with the word gerais serving as an adjective to the mines which were themselves spread in several spots around a larger region another explanation is that this ignores the two large geographical spaces which conformed the state in its history the region of the mines minas and the region of the gerais matos gerais or campos gerais which means something close to general fields these corresponded to the areas of sertão which were farther and hard to access with an economy based on farming and agriculture from the mining spots whose economic space was urban from its origin the confusion comes from the fact that the term gerais is taken as an adjective to minas in the first version although according to this point of view it refers to the region called gerais as a noun a further complication is that this is not a welldefined area on the map of the state but rather a designation to these parts outside the mining spots more related to the geography of sertão and more isolated from the states nucleus locationedit minas gerais is in the north of the southeastern subdivision of brasil which also contains the states of são paulo rio de janeiro and espírito santo it borders on bahia north goiás west and northwest mato grosso do sul far west the states of são paulo and rio de janeiro south and the state

bom jesus de matosinhos c the central and eastern area of the state is hilly and rocky with little vegetation on the mountains around lagoa santa and sete lagoas a typical karst topography with caves and lakes is found some of the mountains are almost entirely iron ore which led to extensive mining in some places at the expense of the environment recent advances in environmental policy helped to

varginha and pouso alegre the southeast of the state called zona da mata forest zone was the richest region until the mid th century nowadays the biggest city juiz de fora remains an important industrial cultural and educational center being also the fourth largest in the minas state the daytoday living in the zona da mata however is better represented by a group of smaller cities like além

the principal coffee region in minas gerais is são joão do manhuaçu situated in zona da mata the west of minas gerais also known as triângulo mineiro which means the minas triangle due to the geographic shape of this region is composed of a particular type of savanna known as the cerrado this region was initially occupied by large freewheeling beef ranches which are still important for the

maxakalisaurus topai dinoprata fossils was a significant paleontological find the fossil is a genus of titanosaurid dinosaur found  kilometers  mi from the city of prata triângulo mineiro in the state of minas gerais in  it was closely related to saltasaurus a sauropod considered unusual because it had evolved apparently defensive traits including bony plates on its skin and vertical plates along its spine such osteoderms have also been found for maxakalisaurus the genus name is derived from the tribe of the maxakali the maxakalisaurus fossils belonged to an animal about  meters  ft long with an estimated weight of  tons although according to paleontologist alexander kellner it could reach a length of approximately  meters  ft it had a long neck and tail ridged teeth unusual among sauropods and lived about  million years ago because sauropods seem to have lacked significant competition in south america they evolved there with greater diversity and more unusual traits than elsewhere in the world a replica has been displayed at the museu nacional in rio de janeiro since august   historyedit baruch th century baroque architecture by aleijadinho in the colonial era the brazilian interior was colonized by portuguese and bandeirantes the brazilian gold rush ushered in an influx of new settlers in search of veins of gold discovered  and gems and later diamonds which come from the naturally occurring itacolumite rock that can be found in great numbers in the region these helped to boost occupation of the inner lands and led to the foundation of several new villages in  the portuguese used enslaved african labor to start building the estrada real the royal road that would connect the ports of cities of rio de janeiro and paraty to the mineralrich regions of ouro preto serro and at the northernmost point diamantina prior to  minas gerais was part of the captaincy of são vicente later renamed são paulo e minas de ouro the first capital of minas gerais and seat of the local see was the city of mariana it was later moved to vila rica in the late th century vila rica was the largest city in brazil and one of the most populous in america as the gold mines were exhausted over the th century the city lost its importance it was later renamed ouro preto and remained the state capital until the construction of the allnew planned city of belo horizonte at the turn of the th century the gold cycle left its mark in cities such as mariana ouro preto diamantina sabará tiradentes and são joão del rei the relative isolation from european influence added to the huge influx of gold and other valuable minerals helped the local people to develop their own style of art which became known as barroco mineiro prime examples of this period are the richly decorated churches in the colonial cities the most important artist of this period was antônio francisco lisboa who became known as aleijadinho his sculptural and architectural work is highly valued by experts as one of the most refined artistic expressions outside europe at that time in addition to art and architecture there was an explosion of musical activity in minas gerais in the th century printed copies of european music as well as accomplished musicians made the journey to the area and soon a local school of composition and performance was born and achieved considerable sophistication several composers worked in minas gerais in the th century mainly in vila rica now ouro preto sabará mariana and other cities some of the names which have survived include josé joaquim emerico lobo de mesquita marcos coelho netto francisco gomes da rocha and ignácio parreiras neves they cultivated a style related to the classical european style but marked by more a more chordal homophonic sound and they usually wrote for mixed groups of voices and instruments guimarães rosas literature is mostly situated in minas gerais with locations widely located across the state hence the term general although more concentrated in its north rather than delimited and identifiable this northern area began to be colonized with brutal conflicts with the large amerindian population who lived in some parts especially in vale do jequitinhonha and became accessible to colonists departing from bahia up north which made the portuguese crown insert the region within the state of minas geraiss borders in order to prevent gold and diamond smuggling from people trying to avoid colonial taxation and oversight thus the state of mg was closely watched by the crown because of its tax revenue people of minas gerais c during the th century mining exploration was strongly controlled by the portuguese crown which imposed heavy taxes on everything extracted one fifth of all gold would go to the crown several rebellions were attempted by the colonists always facing strong reaction by the imperial crown one of the most important was the felipe dos santos revolt that ended with his execution but also with the separation of minas gerais of são paulo the most notable one however was the inconfidência started in  by group of middleclass colonists mostly intellectuals and young officers they were inspired by the american and french enlightenment ideals the conspiracy failed and the rebels were arrested and exiled the most famous of them joaquim josé da silva xavier known as tiradentes was hanged by order of queen maria i of portugal becoming a local hero and a national martyr of brazil the minas gerais flag—a red triangle on a white background along with the latin motto libertas quæ sera tamen freedom albeit late—is based on the design for the national flag proposed by the inconfidentes as the rebels became known in the economic history of brazil minas gerais plays a pivotal role in shifting the economic axis from the brazilian northeast based on sugarcane that starts declining in the th century to the southeast of the country which still remains the major economic center the large amounts of gold found in the region attracted the attention of portugal back to brazil progressively turning rio de janeiro into an important port city from where these would be shipped to portugal and where the portuguese crown would eventually move its administration in  after napoleon bonapartes invasion of portugal see transfer of the portuguese court to brazil due to the economic importance of the state and the particular traits of the local population—famed for its reserved and balanced character—minas gerais has also played an important role on national politics during the th century politicians such as josé bonifácio de andrada e silva were instrumental in the establishment of the brazilian empire under the rule of dom pedro i and later his son dom pedro ii after the installation of the brazilian republic during the early th century minas gerais shared the control of the national political scene with são paulo in what became known as the coffee with milk café com leite political cycle coffee being the major product of são paulo and milk representing minas gerais dairy industry despite the latter also being an important coffee producer minas gerais was also home to two of the most influential brazilian politicians of the second half of the th century juscelino kubitschek was president from  to  and he was responsible for the construction of brasília as the new capital of brazil tancredo neves had an extensive political career that culminated with his election in  to be the first civil president after the  military countercoup however he died after a

numbers of portuguese farmers in colonial times in the late th century italian immigrants also arrived the north region close to bahia was a place to the arrival of many african slaves since the th century the central part of the state where the capital belo horizonte is has a more balanced ratio between whites blacks and mixed people downtown of uberlândia largest city in the state after belo horizonte indians visiting a brazilian farm plantation in minas gerais  the population of minas gerais is the result of an intense mixture of peoples particularly between black africans and portuguese in colonial minas gerais the population was divided in five different categories whites mostly portuguese africans who often did not have a surname and were usually known for their region of origin for example francisca benguela would refer to benguela crioulos black people born in brazil usually to both african parents mulattoes people of mixed black and white ancestry usually born to a black mother and a portuguese father and cabras people of mixed ancestry usually with high degree of amerindian admixture blacks and mulattoes predominated in the population after the beginning of the colonization by the th century however whites were already the largest single group in the minas gerais population taking the population as a whole all groups included european genes account for the majority of the minas gerais genetic heritage which has been explained on the basis of the extremely high mortality rates of the enslaved african population and lower reproductive rate of african slaves the vast majority of them were males among other reasons for their lower reproductive success the amerindian population was hit hard by the diseases brought by the european colonists and they did not have much of an impact either especially in minas gerais where european presence and colonization was massive during the colonial period the disproportion between the number of men and women was quite sharp the census of  in serro do frio which included diamantina revealed that of the  inhabitants  were men and  women among the slaves women were only  the number of free women of color blacks and mulattoes was very high the same census revealed that  of the former slaves were women and only  men since interracial relationships between women of color and white men were widespread the female slaves were more likely to be freed than the male slaves the monogamous family structure that the catholic church tried to deploy in colonial brazil was the exception in minas gerais at that time cohabitation and temporary relationships predominated in minas gerais as well as in brazil as a whole monogamy and weddings in churches would only take root in brazil in the th century fitting the moral standards imposed by the church the role of women in colonial minas gerais was much more dynamic than it would be allowed by the standards of the time many women used to live on their own were heads of family and worked particularly the women of color and former slaves the society of minas gerais provided a great social mobility to former slaves mainly for women in tejuco the percentage of white males who were head of family  was very similar to the percentage of black women who were head of family  many former slaves were able to accumulate goods and many of them became slave owners as well some blacks and mainly mulattos were able to integrate themselves in the highest social stratum of the society of minas gerais once restricted to whites this happened through a process of whitening their descendence and through the assimilation of the culture of the white elite like being members of catholic brotherhoods cohabitation was the most common crime in minas gerais the catholic church was strict in the punishment of this crime in order to prevent the widespread miscegenation between white mostly portuguese males with black or mulatto women according to a  autosomal dna study the ancestral composition of the state of minas gerais can be described as  european  african and  native american  a genetic study with a few samples and not covering the most populated part of the state the south of minas gerais suggested that the whites from minas gerais would have slightly lower levels of european at  ancestry among the brazilian regions and higher levels at  of african admixture with significant amerindian  admixture the european reference population in the study being  european  native american and  african which would give an actual percentage of european ancestry of about  actual european ancestry and less than  of each native american and african ancestries according to another study however the european ancestry is dominant throughout brazil at about  minas gerais included and this taking into account the whole of the population of minas gerais white pardos and blacks a new portrayal of each ethnicity contribution to the dna of brazilians obtained with samples from the five regions of the country has indicated that on average european ancestors are responsible for nearly  of the genetic heritage of the population the variation between the regions is small with the possible exception of the south where the european contribution reaches nearly  the results published by the scientific magazine american journal of human biology by a team of the catholic university of brasília show that in brazil physical indicators such as skin colour colour of the eyes and colour of the hair have little to do with the genetic ancestry of each person which has been shown in previous studies during the time of the gold rush the largest european immigration of the colonial period to all of the americas took place about  portuguese immigrated to brazil during the gold rush and most of them to minas gerais the place where the gold rush activities took place most of them came from entre douro e minho in northern portugal the reference book for a large number of these families is velhos troncos mineiros old mineiro branches by raimundo trindade the native american population of minas gerais was estimated to be

etymologyedit two interpretations are given for the origin of the name minas gerais it comes from minas dos matos gerais the former name of the colonial province mines of the general woods so a first and more common understanding affirms that the name simply means general mines with the word gerais serving as an adjective to the mines which were themselves spread in several spots around a larger region another explanation is that this ignores the two large geographical spaces which conformed the state in its history the region of the mines minas and the region of the gerais matos gerais or campos gerais which means something close to general fields these corresponded to the areas of sertão which were farther and hard to access with an economy based on farming and agriculture from the mining spots whose economic space was urban from its origin the confusion comes from the fact that the term gerais is taken as an adjective to minas in the first version although according to this point of view it refers to the region called gerais as a noun a further complication is that this is not a welldefined area on the map of the state but rather a designation to these parts outside the mining spots more related to the geography of sertão and more isolated from the states nucleus locationedit minas gerais is in the north of the southeastern subdivision of brasil which also contains the states of são paulo rio de janeiro and espírito santo it borders on bahia north goiás west and northwest mato grosso do sul far west the states of são paulo and rio de janeiro south and the state of espírito santo east it also shares a short boundary with the distrito federal northwest minas gerais is situated between ° and ° s latitude and between ° and ° w longitude it is larger in area than

and serra do cervo that mark the border between minas and its neighbors são paulo and rio de janeiro the most notable one is the pico da bandeira the third highest mountain in brazil at  m standing on the border with espírito santo state the state also has huge reserves of iron and sizeable reserves of gold and gemstones including emerald topaz and aquamarine mines emeralds found in this location

bom jesus de matosinhos c the central and eastern area of the state is hilly and rocky with little vegetation on the mountains around lagoa santa and sete lagoas a typical karst topography with caves and lakes is found some of the mountains are almost entirely iron ore which led to extensive mining in some places at the expense of the environment recent advances in environmental policy helped to put limits to mining about  kilometres  mi to the east of belo horizonte is the second metropolitan region of the state vale do aço steel valley which has iron and steel processing companies along the course of the rio doce and its tributaries vale do aços largest cities are ipatinga coronel fabriciano and timóteo now that mining is restricted large areas of forest are being removed for timber

the principal coffee region in minas gerais is são joão do manhuaçu situated in zona da mata the west of minas gerais also known as triângulo mineiro which means the minas triangle due to the geographic shape of this region is composed of a particular type of savanna known as the cerrado this region was initially occupied by large freewheeling beef ranches which are still important for the

maxakalisaurus topai dinoprata fossils was a significant paleontological find the fossil is a genus of titanosaurid dinosaur found  kilometers  mi from the city of prata triângulo mineiro in the state of minas gerais in  it was closely related to saltasaurus a sauropod considered unusual because it had evolved apparently defensive traits including bony plates on its skin and vertical plates along its spine such osteoderms have also been found for maxakalisaurus the genus name is derived from the tribe of the maxakali the maxakalisaurus fossils belonged to an animal about  meters  ft long with an estimated weight of  tons although according to paleontologist alexander kellner it could reach a length of approximately  meters  ft it had a long neck and tail ridged teeth unusual among sauropods and lived about  million years ago because sauropods seem to have lacked significant competition in south america they evolved there with greater diversity and more unusual traits than elsewhere in the world a replica has been displayed at the museu nacional in rio de janeiro since august   historyedit baruch th century baroque architecture by aleijadinho in the colonial era the brazilian interior was colonized by portuguese and bandeirantes the brazilian gold rush ushered in an influx of new settlers in search of veins of gold discovered  and gems and later diamonds which come from the naturally occurring itacolumite rock that can be found in great numbers in the region these helped to boost occupation of the inner lands and led to the foundation of several new villages in  the portuguese used enslaved african labor to start building the estrada real the royal road that would connect the ports of cities of rio de janeiro and paraty to the mineralrich regions of ouro preto serro and at the northernmost point diamantina prior to  minas gerais was part of the captaincy of são vicente later renamed são paulo e minas de ouro the first capital of minas gerais and seat of the local see was the city of mariana it was later moved to vila rica in the late th century vila rica was the largest city in brazil and one of the most populous in america as the gold mines were exhausted over the th century the city lost its importance it was later renamed ouro preto and remained the state capital until the construction of the allnew planned city of belo horizonte at the turn of the th century the gold cycle left its mark in cities such as mariana ouro preto diamantina sabará tiradentes and são joão del rei the relative isolation from european influence added to the huge influx of gold and other valuable minerals helped the local people to develop their own style of art which became known as barroco mineiro prime examples of this period are the richly decorated churches in the colonial cities the most important artist of this period was antônio francisco lisboa who became known as aleijadinho his sculptural and architectural work is highly valued by experts as one of the most refined artistic expressions outside europe at that time in addition to art and architecture there was an explosion of musical activity in minas gerais in the th century printed copies of european music as well as accomplished musicians made the journey to the area and soon a local school of composition and performance was born and achieved considerable sophistication several composers worked in minas gerais in the th century mainly in vila rica now ouro preto sabará mariana and other cities some of the names which have survived include josé joaquim emerico lobo de mesquita marcos coelho netto francisco gomes da rocha and ignácio parreiras neves they cultivated a style related to the classical european style but marked by more a more chordal homophonic sound and they usually wrote for mixed groups of voices and instruments guimarães rosas literature is mostly situated in minas gerais with locations widely located across the state hence the term general although more concentrated in its north rather than delimited and identifiable this northern area began to be colonized with brutal conflicts with the large amerindian population who lived in some parts especially in vale do jequitinhonha and became accessible to colonists departing from bahia up north which made the portuguese crown insert the region within the state of minas geraiss borders in order to prevent gold and diamond smuggling from people trying to avoid colonial taxation and oversight thus the state of mg was closely watched by the crown because of its tax revenue people of minas gerais c during the th century mining exploration was strongly controlled by the portuguese crown which imposed heavy taxes on everything extracted one fifth of all gold would go to the crown several rebellions were attempted by the colonists always facing strong reaction by the imperial crown one of the most important was the felipe dos santos revolt that ended with his execution but also with the separation of minas gerais of são paulo the most notable one however was the inconfidência started in  by group of middleclass colonists mostly intellectuals and young officers they were inspired by the american and french enlightenment ideals the conspiracy failed and the rebels were arrested and exiled the most famous of them joaquim josé da silva xavier known as tiradentes was hanged by order of queen maria i of portugal becoming a local hero and a national martyr of brazil the minas gerais flag—a red triangle on a white background along with the latin motto libertas quæ sera tamen freedom albeit late—is based on the design for the national flag proposed by the inconfidentes as the rebels became known in the economic history of brazil minas gerais plays a pivotal role in shifting the economic axis from the brazilian northeast based on sugarcane that starts declining in the th century to the southeast of the country which still remains the major economic center the large amounts of gold found in the region attracted the attention of portugal back to brazil progressively turning rio de janeiro into an important port city from where these would be shipped to portugal and where the portuguese crown would eventually move its administration in  after napoleon bonapartes invasion of portugal see transfer of the portuguese court to brazil due to the economic importance of the state and the particular traits of the local population—famed for its reserved and balanced character—minas gerais has also played an important role on national politics during the th century politicians such as josé bonifácio de andrada e silva were instrumental in the establishment of the brazilian empire under the rule of dom pedro i and later his son dom pedro ii after the installation of the brazilian republic during the early th century minas gerais shared the control of the national political scene with são paulo in what became known as the coffee with milk café com leite political cycle coffee being the major product of são paulo and milk representing minas gerais dairy industry despite the latter also being an important coffee producer minas gerais was also home to two of the most influential brazilian politicians of the second half of the th century juscelino kubitschek was president from  to  and he was responsible for the construction of brasília as the new capital of brazil tancredo neves had an extensive political career that culminated with his election in  to be the first civil president after the  military countercoup however he died after a

last pnad national research for sample of domiciles census revealed the following numbers  white people   brown multiracial people   black people   asian people   amerindian people  ethnic groups found in minas gerais include amerindians portuguese africans italians germans and lebanese the ethnic composition of the population varies from town to town for example in córrego do bom jesus a small town located in the extreme south of minas gerais white people make up  of the population the south of minas gerais is both the most european and the most densely populated part of the state on the other hand in setubinha located in the northeast part of the state  are mixedrace and  blacks it is historically explainable southern minas gerais in the border with são paulo received larger numbers of portuguese farmers in colonial times in the late th century italian immigrants also arrived the north region close to bahia was a place to the arrival of many african slaves since the th century the central part of the state where the capital belo horizonte is has a more balanced ratio between whites blacks and mixed people downtown of uberlândia largest city in the state after belo horizonte indians visiting a brazilian farm plantation in minas gerais  the population of minas gerais is the result of an intense mixture of peoples particularly between black africans and portuguese in colonial minas gerais the population was divided in five different categories whites mostly portuguese africans who often did not have a surname and were usually known for their region of origin for example francisca benguela would refer to benguela crioulos black people born in brazil usually to both african parents mulattoes people of mixed black and white ancestry usually born to a black mother and a portuguese father and cabras people of mixed ancestry usually with high degree of amerindian admixture blacks and mulattoes predominated in the population after the beginning of the colonization by the th century however whites were already the largest single group in the minas gerais population taking the population as a whole all groups included european genes account for the majority of the minas gerais genetic heritage which has been explained on the basis of the extremely high mortality rates of the enslaved african population and lower reproductive rate of african slaves the vast majority of them were males among other reasons for their lower reproductive success the amerindian population was hit hard by the diseases brought by the european colonists and they did not have much of an impact either especially in minas gerais where european presence and colonization was massive during the colonial period the disproportion between the number of men and women was quite sharp the census of  in serro do frio which included diamantina revealed that of the  inhabitants  were men and  women among the slaves women were only  the number of free women of color blacks and mulattoes was very high the same census revealed that  of the former slaves were women and only  men since interracial relationships between women of color and white men were widespread the female slaves were more likely to be freed than the male slaves the monogamous family structure that the catholic church tried to deploy in colonial brazil was the exception in minas gerais at that time cohabitation and temporary relationships predominated in minas gerais as well as in brazil as a whole monogamy and weddings in churches would only take root in brazil in the th century fitting the moral standards imposed by the church the role of women in colonial minas gerais was much more dynamic than it would be allowed by the standards of the time many women used to live on their own were heads of family and worked particularly the women of color and former slaves the society of minas gerais provided a great social mobility to former slaves mainly for women in tejuco the percentage of white males who were head of family  was very similar to the percentage of black women who were head of family  many former slaves were able to accumulate goods and many of them became slave owners as well some blacks and mainly mulattos were able to integrate themselves in the highest social stratum of the society of minas gerais once restricted to whites this happened through a process of whitening their descendence and through the assimilation of the culture of the white elite like being members of catholic brotherhoods cohabitation was the most common crime in minas gerais the catholic church was strict in the punishment of this crime in order to prevent the widespread miscegenation between white mostly portuguese males with black or mulatto women according to a  autosomal dna study the ancestral composition of the state of minas gerais can be described as  european  african and  native american  a genetic study with a few samples and not covering the most populated part of the state the south of minas gerais suggested that the whites from minas gerais would have slightly lower levels of european at  ancestry among the brazilian regions and higher levels at  of african admixture with significant amerindian  admixture the european reference population in the study being  european  native american and  african which would give an actual percentage of european ancestry of about  actual european ancestry and less than  of each native american and african ancestries according to another study however the european ancestry is dominant throughout brazil at about  minas gerais included and this taking into account the whole of the population of minas gerais white pardos and blacks a new portrayal of each ethnicity contribution to the dna of brazilians obtained with samples from the five regions of the country has indicated that on average european ancestors are responsible for nearly  of the genetic heritage of the population the variation between the regions is small with the possible exception of the south where the european contribution reaches nearly  the results published by the scientific magazine american journal of human biology by a team of the catholic university of brasília show that in brazil physical indicators such as skin colour colour of the eyes and colour of the hair have little to do with the genetic ancestry of each person which has been shown in previous studies during the time of the gold rush the largest european immigration of the colonial period to all of the americas took place about  portuguese immigrated to brazil during the gold rush and most of them to minas gerais the place where the gold rush activities took place most of them came from entre douro e minho in northern portugal the reference book for a large number of these families is velhos troncos mineiros old mineiro branches by raimundo trindade the native american population of minas gerais was estimated to be

the states capital and largest city belo horizonte is a major urban and finance center in latin america and is the sixth largest municipality in brazil after the cities of são paulo rio de janeiro salvador brasilia and fortaleza but its metropolitan area is the third largest in brazil with just over  inhabitants after those of são paulo and rio de janeiro minas gerais is the state with the largest number of brazilian presidentscitation needed with an area of  square kilometres  sq mi—larger than metropolitan france—it is the fourth most extensive state in brazil the main producer of

etymologyedit two interpretations are given for the origin of the name minas gerais it comes from minas dos matos gerais the former name of the colonial province mines of the general woods so a first and more common understanding affirms that the name simply means general mines with the word gerais serving as an adjective to the mines which were themselves spread in several spots around a larger region another explanation is that this ignores the two large geographical spaces which conformed the state in its history the region of the mines minas and the region of the gerais matos gerais or campos gerais which means something close to general fields these corresponded to the areas of sertão which were farther and hard to access with an economy based on farming and agriculture from the mining spots whose economic space was urban from its origin the confusion comes from the fact that the term gerais is taken as an adjective to minas in the first version although according to this point of view it refers to the region called gerais as a noun a further complication is that this is not a welldefined area on the map of the state but rather a designation to these parts outside the mining spots more related to the geography of sertão and more isolated from the states nucleus locationedit minas gerais is in the north of the southeastern subdivision of brasil which also contains the states of são paulo rio de janeiro and espírito santo it borders on bahia north goiás west and northwest mato grosso do sul far west the states of são paulo and rio de janeiro south and the state of espírito santo east it also shares a short boundary with the distrito federal northwest minas gerais is situated between ° and ° s latitude and between ° and ° w longitude it is larger in area than

doce the state also holds many hydroelectric power plants including furnas some of the highest peaks in brazil are in the mountain ranges in the southern part of the state such as serra da mantiqueira and serra do cervo that mark the border between minas and its neighbors são paulo and rio de janeiro the most notable one is the pico da bandeira the third highest mountain in brazil at  m standing on the border with espírito santo state the state also has huge reserves of iron and sizeable reserves of gold and gemstones including emerald topaz and aquamarine mines emeralds found in this location are comparable to the best colombiaorigin emeralds and are most often a bluishgreen color each region of the state has a distinct character geographically and to a certain extent culturally town of bom jesus de matosinhos c the central and eastern area of the state is hilly and rocky with little vegetation on the mountains around lagoa santa and sete lagoas a typical karst topography with caves and lakes is found some of the mountains are almost entirely iron ore which led to extensive mining in some places at the expense of the environment recent advances in environmental policy helped to put limits to mining about  kilometres  mi to the east of belo horizonte is the second metropolitan region of the state vale do aço steel valley which has iron and steel processing companies along the course of the rio doce and its tributaries vale do aços largest cities are ipatinga coronel fabriciano and timóteo now that mining is restricted large areas of forest are being removed for timber charcoal and to clear land for cattle ranching the original forest cover of these inland hills is very much fragmented the city of governador valadares is in the limit of this region with the poorer north the south of minas gerais is hilly and green with coffee and milk production this region is notably cooler than the rest of the state and some locations are subject to temperatures just below the freezing point during the winter the region is also famed for its mineralwater resorts including the cities of poços de caldas lambari são lourenço and caxambu many industries are located at varginha and pouso alegre the southeast of the state called zona da mata forest zone was the richest region until the mid th century nowadays the biggest city juiz de fora remains an important industrial cultural and educational center being also the fourth largest in the minas state the daytoday living in the zona da mata however is better represented by a group of smaller cities like além paraíba viçosa leopoldina cataguases muriaé ubá astolfo dutra and several others those cities put together form a strong economic presence based mostly on agriculture textiles and minerals the city of the principal coffee region in minas gerais is são joão do manhuaçu situated in zona da mata the west of minas gerais also known as triângulo mineiro which means the minas triangle due to the geographic shape of this region is composed of a particular type of savanna known as the cerrado this region was initially occupied by large freewheeling beef ranches which are still important for the economy of the region over the s extensive soy and corn farms occupied much of the farming land available the cerrado is also one of the principal coffeegrowing areas of brazil the main cities of this region are uberlândia uberaba patos de minas and araguari the north of minas gerais is arid being subject to frequent droughts recent irrigation projects use the water from the são francisco river for agriculture the river crosses the northern region carrying water from its basin in the central area of the state which is subject to a regular rainfall pattern the diamond mines of this region mainly in diamantina attracted miners but are now exhausted and the remaining population lives in poor conditions especially in the valley of the jequitinhonha river the region is however known for its high quality cachaça production salinas in particular exports large amounts of this alcoholic beverage the main cities of this region are montes claros teófilo otoni pirapora and janaúba serra da

maxakalisaurus topai dinoprata fossils was a significant paleontological find the fossil is a genus of titanosaurid dinosaur found  kilometers  mi from the city of prata triângulo mineiro in the state of minas gerais in  it was closely related to saltasaurus a sauropod considered unusual because it had evolved apparently defensive traits including bony plates on its skin and vertical plates along its spine such osteoderms have also been found for maxakalisaurus the genus name is derived from the tribe of the maxakali the maxakalisaurus fossils belonged to an animal about  meters  ft long with an estimated weight of  tons although according to paleontologist alexander kellner it could reach a length of approximately  meters  ft it had a long neck and tail ridged teeth unusual among sauropods and lived about  million years ago because sauropods seem to have lacked significant competition in south america they evolved there with greater diversity and more unusual traits than elsewhere in the world a replica has been displayed at the museu nacional in rio de janeiro since august   historyedit baruch th century baroque architecture by aleijadinho in the colonial era the brazilian interior was colonized by portuguese and bandeirantes the brazilian gold rush ushered in an influx of new settlers in search of veins of gold discovered  and gems and later diamonds which come from the naturally occurring itacolumite rock that can be found in great numbers in the region these helped to boost occupation of the inner lands and led to the foundation of several new villages in  the portuguese used enslaved african labor to start building the estrada real the royal road that would connect the ports of cities of rio de janeiro and paraty to the mineralrich regions of ouro preto serro and at the northernmost point diamantina prior to  minas gerais was part of the captaincy of são vicente later renamed são paulo e minas de ouro the first capital of minas gerais and seat of the local see was the city of mariana it was later moved to vila rica in the late th century vila rica was the largest city in brazil and one of the most populous in america as the gold mines were exhausted over the th century the city lost its importance it was later renamed ouro preto and remained the state capital until the construction of the allnew planned city of belo horizonte at the turn of the th century the gold cycle left its mark in cities such as mariana ouro preto diamantina sabará tiradentes and são joão del rei the relative isolation from european influence added to the huge influx of gold and other valuable minerals helped the local people to develop their own style of art which became known as barroco mineiro prime examples of this period are the richly decorated churches in the colonial cities the most important artist of this period was antônio francisco lisboa who became known as aleijadinho his sculptural and architectural work is highly valued by experts as one of the most refined artistic expressions outside europe at that time in addition to art and architecture there was an explosion of musical activity in minas gerais in the th century printed copies of european music as well as accomplished musicians made the journey to the area and soon a local school of composition and performance was born and achieved considerable sophistication several composers worked in minas gerais in the th century mainly in vila rica now ouro preto sabará mariana and other cities some of the names which have survived include josé joaquim emerico lobo de mesquita marcos coelho netto francisco gomes da rocha and ignácio parreiras neves they cultivated a style related to the classical european style but marked by more a more chordal homophonic sound and they usually wrote for mixed groups of voices and instruments guimarães rosas literature is mostly situated in minas gerais with locations widely located across the state hence the term general although more concentrated in its north rather than delimited and identifiable this northern area began to be colonized with brutal conflicts with the large amerindian population who lived in some parts especially in vale do jequitinhonha and became accessible to colonists departing from bahia up north which made the portuguese crown insert the region within the state of minas geraiss borders in order to prevent gold and diamond smuggling from people trying to avoid colonial taxation and oversight thus the state of mg was closely watched by the crown because of its tax revenue people of minas gerais c during the th century mining exploration was strongly controlled by the portuguese crown which imposed heavy taxes on everything extracted one fifth of all gold would go to the crown several rebellions were attempted by the colonists always facing strong reaction by the imperial crown one of the most important was the felipe dos santos revolt that ended with his execution but also with the separation of minas gerais of são paulo the most notable one however was the inconfidência started in  by group of middleclass colonists mostly intellectuals and young officers they were inspired by the american and french enlightenment ideals the conspiracy failed and the rebels were arrested and exiled the most famous of them joaquim josé da silva xavier known as tiradentes was hanged by order of queen maria i of portugal becoming a local hero and a national martyr of brazil the minas gerais flag—a red triangle on a white background along with the latin motto libertas quæ sera tamen freedom albeit late—is based on the design for the national flag proposed by the inconfidentes as the rebels became known in the economic history of brazil minas gerais plays a pivotal role in shifting the economic axis from the brazilian northeast based on sugarcane that starts declining in the th century to the southeast of the country which still remains the major economic center the large amounts of gold found in the region attracted the attention of portugal back to brazil progressively turning rio de janeiro into an important port city from where these would be shipped to portugal and where the portuguese crown would eventually move its administration in  after napoleon bonapartes invasion of portugal see transfer of the portuguese court to brazil due to the economic importance of the state and the particular traits of the local population—famed for its reserved and balanced character—minas gerais has also played an important role on national politics during the th century politicians such as josé bonifácio de andrada e silva were instrumental in the establishment of the brazilian empire under the rule of dom pedro i and later his son dom pedro ii after the installation of the brazilian republic during the early th century minas gerais shared the control of the national political scene with são paulo in what became known as the coffee with milk café com leite political cycle coffee being the major product of são paulo and milk representing minas gerais dairy industry despite the latter also being an important coffee producer minas gerais was also home to two of the most influential brazilian politicians of the second half of the th century juscelino kubitschek was president from  to  and he was responsible for the construction of brasília as the new capital of brazil tancredo neves had an extensive political career that culminated with his election in  to be the first civil president after the  military countercoup however he died after a series of health complications just as he was about to assume the position also itamar brazils previous president lived there though he was not born in minas see also the list of governors of minas

demographicsedit according to the ibge of  there were  people residing in the state the population density was  inhabitants per square kilometre sq mi urbanization   population growth  – houses   the last pnad national research for sample of domiciles census revealed the following numbers  white people   brown multiracial people   black people   asian people   amerindian people  ethnic groups found in minas gerais include amerindians portuguese africans italians germans and lebanese the ethnic composition of the population varies from town to town for example in córrego do bom jesus a small town located in the extreme south of minas gerais white people make up  of the population the south of minas gerais is both the most european and the most densely populated part of the state on the other hand in setubinha located in the northeast part of the state  are mixedrace and  blacks it is historically explainable southern minas gerais in the border with são paulo received larger numbers of portuguese farmers in colonial times in the late th century italian immigrants also arrived the north region close to bahia was a place to the arrival of many african slaves since the th century the central part of the state where the capital belo horizonte is has a more balanced ratio between whites blacks and mixed people downtown of uberlândia largest city in the state after belo horizonte indians visiting a brazilian farm plantation in minas gerais  the population of minas gerais is the result of an intense mixture of peoples particularly between black africans and portuguese in colonial minas gerais the population was divided in five different categories whites mostly portuguese africans who often did not have a surname and were usually known for their region of origin for example francisca benguela would refer to benguela crioulos black people born in brazil usually to both african parents mulattoes people of mixed black and white ancestry usually born to a black mother and a portuguese father and cabras people of mixed ancestry usually with high degree of amerindian admixture blacks and mulattoes predominated in the population after the beginning of the colonization by the th century however whites were already the largest single group in the minas gerais population taking the population as a whole all groups included european genes account for the majority of the minas gerais genetic heritage which has been explained on the basis of the extremely high mortality rates of the enslaved african population and lower reproductive rate of african slaves the vast majority of them were males among other reasons for their lower reproductive success the amerindian population was hit hard by the diseases brought by the european colonists and they did not have much of an impact either especially in minas gerais where european presence and colonization was massive during the colonial period the disproportion between the number of men and women was quite sharp the census of  in serro do frio which included diamantina revealed that of the  inhabitants  were men and  women among the slaves women were only  the number of free women of color blacks and mulattoes was very high the same census revealed that  of the former slaves were women and only  men since interracial relationships between women of color and white men were widespread the female slaves were more likely to be freed than the male slaves the monogamous family structure that the catholic church tried to deploy in colonial brazil was the exception in minas gerais at that time cohabitation and temporary relationships predominated in minas gerais as well as in brazil as a whole monogamy and weddings in churches would only take root in brazil in the th century fitting the moral standards imposed by the church the role of women in colonial minas gerais was much more dynamic than it would be allowed by the standards of the time many women used to live on their own were heads of family and worked particularly the women of color and former slaves the society of minas gerais provided a great social mobility to former slaves mainly for women in tejuco the percentage of white males who were head of family  was very similar to the percentage of black women who were head of family  many former slaves were able to accumulate goods and many of them became slave owners as well some blacks and mainly mulattos were able to integrate themselves in the highest social stratum of the society of minas gerais once restricted to whites this happened through a process of whitening their descendence and through the assimilation of the culture of the white elite like being members of catholic brotherhoods cohabitation was the most common crime in minas gerais the catholic church was strict in the punishment of this crime in order to prevent the widespread miscegenation between white mostly portuguese males with black or mulatto women according to a  autosomal dna study the ancestral composition of the state of minas gerais can be described as  european  african and  native american  a genetic study with a few samples and not covering the most populated part of the state the south of minas gerais suggested that the whites from minas gerais would have slightly lower levels of european at  ancestry among the brazilian regions and higher levels at  of african admixture with significant amerindian  admixture the european reference population in the study being  european  native american and  african which would give an actual percentage of european ancestry of about  actual european ancestry and less than  of each native american and african ancestries according to another study however the european ancestry is dominant
