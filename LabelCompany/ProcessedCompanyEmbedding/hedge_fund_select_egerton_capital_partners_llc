bluecrest money managers start funds soros paloma partners among backers of european managers george soros photographer akos stillerbloomberg as hedge funds hemorrhage cash at the fastest pace since the financial crisis a new crop of money managers is starting to buck the trend in europe with backing from some of the industry’s biggest names including george soros and donald sussman at paloma partners llcthe new funds are being started by traders who have built reputations at some of the bestknown investment firms former bluebay asset management managers neil phillips and jonathan fayman have raised almost  billion including money from soros according to people familiar with the matter former highbridge capital management’s john aylward  has received about  million from paloma to start a credit fund“this vintage of new funds is probably going to be the best performing vintage since  because you are getting higher quality managers coming out hungry to prove a point said erik serrano berntsen chief executive officer of stable asset management which invests in hedgefund startups “all the best investments to some extent are a bit contrarian poor returns the mounting cost of regulatory compliance and investors’ reluctance to allocate capital has led to more hedge funds closing than starting in europe since  investors are also balking at high fees  hedge funds have traditionally charged  percent of assets and taken a  percent cut of performance  that have rewarded managers so well in the past charges are declining according to industry tracker preqin ltd and investors want them to fall furtherabout  hedge funds have closed in the region since the start of  while only  have started according to eurekahedge data the industry is dominated by managers overseeing less than  million and they are struggling to remain afloat with the eurekahedge index for european hedge funds declining  percent through august this year underperforming a  percent rise in a gauge that measures returns for global peers“there’s an opportunity right now because all the big guys have become super big and the smaller guys are struggling in between there’s an empty space” said marcello sallusti who left egerton capital uk llp after  years in february to start his own hedge fund in a zero interestrates world people are looking for investment opportunities and a startup doesn’t need multibillion assets under management to cover running costssallusti  who was part of the core investment team at  billion egerton capital said he will start engadine partners in london later this year to bet on equities with more than  million raised from partners and earlystage investors “everybody tells me it’s very tough” sallusti said in an interview“there’s never an ideal moment to start a new business important choices in life come naturally” among other startups mikael brantberg  a former managing director at farallon capital management llc is seeking regulatory approval to start a credit hedge fund while andrew manuel a cofounder of the  billion hedgefund firm lmr partners llp is setting up ixworth capital llp in london tej johar  a former money manager at bluecrest capital management is starting an eventdriven firm broad bridge capital llp and has received money from a us institution a person familiar saidthe sorosbacked glen point capital where phillips and fayman have already started trading is one of the largest hedgefund startups in europe this year according to two people familiar with the matter officials at glen point declined to comment as did a spokesman for soros the most important market news of the day get our markets daily newsletter sign up glen point bets on macroeconomic trends with a focus on emerging markets phillips  joined bluebay owned by royal bank of canada in  and managed a macro hedge fund the firm closed the  billion fund after he and fayman  left in november  the fund had gained  percent through october of  and closed under “ridiculously successful circumstances” phillips had said in an interview at the timechallenges remain because investors are backing only the best of the breed with some of the biggest players in the industry still seeing negative returns funds managed for some of europe’s biggest firms such as lansdowne partners and brevan howard asset management have lost money this yearwe are witnessing hedgefund culling in europe said mohammad hassan at singaporebased industry tracker eurekahedge “managers continue to face the axe following a disappointing stream of returns”for the moment investors are focusing their attention on smaller firms with data from research firm evestment showing hedge funds with less than  billion in assets received net inflows of  billion globally in august more than double the amount that went into funds managing more than  billionthat may drive more money managers to venture out on their own according to stable asset management’s berntsen who said there are many traders at big firms unable to take risks because their employers want to play safe and that’s cutting into pay packetssome younger mangers “may be incentivized to leave because they know that they are not going to be paid this year and probably next year” said michele gesualdi the londonbased chief investment officer at kairos investment
