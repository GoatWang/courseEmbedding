an alliance with two of his senate colleagues guy goff and james e watson as well as governor frank lowden of illinois less than a week before the convention he described hoover as a man for whom the party will be on the defensive from the day he is named until he close of the polls on election day however despite his opposition curtis had no qualms about accepting the vicepresidential nomination while covering the convention h l mencken described curtis as the kansas comic character who is half indian and half windmill charlie ran against hoover with great energy and let fly some very embarrassing truths about him but when the hoover managers threw charlie the vicepresidency as a solatium he shut up instantly and a few days later he was hymning his late bugaboo as the greatest statesman since pericles the hoover–curtis ticket won the  presidential election in a landslide securing  of the popular vote curtis resigned from the senate only the day before he was sworn in as vicepresident he took the oath of office in the senate chamber with the presidential party then proceeding to the east portico of the united states capitol for hoovers inauguration curtis arranged for

artifacts and posed for pictures wearing indian headdresses he was  when he took office making him the oldest incoming vicepresident at the time he is now the secondoldest behind alben w barkley at  curtis was the first vice president to take the oath of office on a bible in the same manner as the president since he employed a woman as secretary to the vice president instead of the customary man

encyclopedia and one of the best political poker players in america time magazine featured him on the cover in december  and reported it is in the party caucuses in the committee rooms in the cloakrooms that he patches up troubles puts through legislation as one of the two leading senators with reed smoot curtis was remembered for not making many speeches he was noted for keeping the best card index of the state ever made curtis used a black notebook and later a card index to record all the people he met while in office or campaigning and continually referred to it resulting in his being known for his remarkable memory for faces and names never a pension letter or any other letter for that matter came in that wasnt answered promptly and another name went into the allembracing card index the doctors were listed the farm leaders the school teachers the lists were kept up to date how such an intricate index could be kept up to date and function so smoothly was a marvel to his associates it was one of curtis prides curtis was celebrated as a stand patter the most regular of republicans and yet a man who could always bargain with his partys progressives and with senators from across the center aisle newspapers claimed that curtis knew the senate rules better than any other senator and declared him the most competent man in congress to look after the legislative program of the administration vice presidency –edit curtis received  votes on the presidential ballot at the  republican national convention in kansas city out of  total the winning candidate herbert hoover secured  votes having been the favourite for the nomination since august  when president calvin coolidge ruled himself out of contention curtis was a leader of the antihoover movement forming an alliance with two of his senate colleagues guy goff and james e watson as well as governor frank lowden of illinois less than a week before the convention he described hoover as a man for whom the party will be on the defensive from the day he is named until he close of the polls on election day however despite his opposition curtis had no qualms about accepting the vicepresidential nomination while covering the convention h l mencken described curtis as the kansas comic character who is half indian and half windmill charlie ran against hoover with great energy and let fly some very embarrassing truths about him but when the hoover managers threw charlie the vicepresidency as a solatium he shut up instantly and a few days later he was hymning his late bugaboo as the greatest statesman since pericles the hoover–curtis ticket won the  presidential election in a landslide securing  of the popular vote curtis resigned from the senate only the day before he was sworn in as vicepresident he took the oath of office in the senate chamber with the presidential party then proceeding to the east portico of the united states capitol for hoovers inauguration curtis arranged for a native american jazz band to perform at the inauguration curtis election as vice president made history because he was the only native kansan and only native american to hold the post as well as the first person of acknowledged noneuropean ancestry the first american of significant native american ancestry to be elected to such high office curtis decorated his office with native american artifacts and posed for pictures wearing indian headdresses he was  when he took office making him the oldest incoming vicepresident at the time he is now the secondoldest behind alben w barkley at  curtis was the first vice president to take the oath of office on a bible in the same manner as the president since he employed a woman as secretary to the vice president instead of the customary man he scored another minor first lola m williams of columbus kansas who had been working for curtis for some time was one of the first women to enter the senate floor traditionally a male monopoly soon after the great depression began curtis endorsed the fiveday work week with no reduction in wages as a worksharing solution to unemployment in october  in the middle of the campaign for  midterm elections curtis made an offhand remark that good times are just around the corner this statement was later erroneously attributed to president hoover and became a lethal political boomerang at the  republican national convention president hoover was renominated almost unanimously despite having no major opposition himself – charles dawes ruled himself out – curtis failed to secure a majority of votes on the first ballot for the vicepresidential nomination he received  out of a possible  votes or  with generals hanford macnider  and james harbord  being his nearest contenders on the second ballot the pennsylvania delegation shifted its votes to curtis from edward martin giving him  votes  and securing him the nomination for the second time curtiss final duty as vicepresident was to administer the oath of office to his successor john nance garner garners swearingin ceremony was the last to take place in the senate chamber later yearsedit after the stock market crash in  the problems of the great depression led to the defeat of the republican ticket in the next election democrat franklin d roosevelt was elected as president by a margin of  to  in  curtis term as vice president ended on march   and he was succeeded by john nance garner after politicsedit curtis decided to stay in washington dc to resume his legal career as he had a wide network of professional

encyclopedia and one of the best political poker players in america time magazine featured him on the cover in december  and reported it is in the party caucuses in the committee rooms in the cloakrooms that he patches up troubles puts through legislation as one of the two leading senators with reed smoot curtis was remembered for not making many speeches he was noted for keeping the best card index of the state ever made curtis used a black notebook and later a card index to record all the people he met while in office or campaigning and continually referred to it resulting in his being known for his remarkable memory for faces and names never a pension letter or any other letter for that matter came in that wasnt answered promptly and another name went into the allembracing card index the doctors were listed the farm leaders the school teachers the lists were kept up to date how such an intricate index could be kept up to date and function so smoothly was a marvel to his associates it was one of curtis prides curtis was celebrated as a stand patter the most regular of republicans and yet a man who could always bargain with his partys progressives and with senators from across the center aisle newspapers claimed that curtis knew the senate rules better than any other senator and declared him the most competent man in congress to look after the legislative program of the administration vice presidency –edit curtis received  votes on the presidential ballot at the  republican national convention in kansas city out of  total the winning candidate herbert hoover secured  votes having been the favourite for the nomination since august  when president calvin coolidge ruled himself out of contention curtis was a leader of the antihoover movement forming an alliance with two of his senate colleagues guy goff and james e watson as well as governor frank lowden of illinois less than a week before the convention he described hoover as a man for whom the party will be on the defensive from the day he is named until he close of the polls on election day however despite his opposition curtis had no qualms about accepting the vicepresidential nomination while covering the convention h l mencken described curtis as the kansas comic character who is half indian and half windmill charlie ran against hoover with great energy and let fly some very embarrassing truths about him but when the hoover managers threw charlie the vicepresidency as a solatium he shut up instantly and a few days later he was hymning his late bugaboo as the greatest statesman since pericles the hoover–curtis ticket won the  presidential election in a landslide securing  of the popular vote curtis resigned from the senate only the day before he was sworn in as vicepresident he took the oath of office in the senate chamber with the presidential party then proceeding to the east portico of the united states capitol for hoovers inauguration curtis arranged for a native american jazz band to perform at the inauguration curtis election as vice president made history because he was the only native kansan and only native american to hold the post as well as the first person of acknowledged noneuropean ancestry the first american of significant native american ancestry to be elected to such high office curtis decorated his office with native american artifacts and posed for pictures wearing indian headdresses he was  when he took office making him the oldest incoming vicepresident at the time he is now the secondoldest behind alben w barkley at  curtis was the first vice president to take the oath of office on a bible in the same manner as the president since he employed a woman as secretary to the vice president instead of the customary man he scored another minor first lola m williams of columbus kansas who had been working for curtis for some time was one of the first women to enter the senate floor traditionally a male monopoly soon after the great depression began curtis endorsed the fiveday work week with no reduction in wages as a worksharing solution to unemployment in october  in the middle of the campaign for  midterm elections curtis made an offhand remark that good times are just around the corner this statement was later erroneously attributed to president hoover and became a lethal political boomerang at the  republican national convention president hoover was renominated almost unanimously despite having no major opposition himself – charles dawes ruled himself out – curtis failed to secure a majority of votes on the first ballot for the vicepresidential nomination he received  out of a possible  votes or  with generals hanford macnider  and james harbord  being his nearest contenders on the second ballot the pennsylvania delegation shifted its votes to curtis from edward martin giving him  votes  and securing him the nomination for the second time curtiss final duty as vicepresident was to administer the oath of office to his successor john nance garner garners swearingin ceremony was the last to take place in the senate chamber later yearsedit after the stock market crash in  the problems of the great depression led to the defeat of the republican ticket in the next election democrat franklin d roosevelt was elected as president by a margin of  to  in  curtis term as vice president ended on march   and he was succeeded by john nance garner after politicsedit curtis decided to stay in washington dc to resume his legal career as he had a wide network of professional

encyclopedia and one of the best political poker players in america time magazine featured him on the cover in december  and reported it is in the party caucuses in the committee rooms in the cloakrooms that he patches up troubles puts through legislation as one of the two leading senators with reed smoot curtis was remembered for not making many speeches he was noted for keeping the best card index of the state ever made curtis used a black notebook and later a card index to record all the people he met while in office or campaigning and continually referred to it resulting in his being known for his remarkable memory for faces and names never a pension letter or any other letter for that matter came in that wasnt answered promptly and another name went into the allembracing card index the doctors were listed the farm leaders the school teachers the lists were kept up to date how such an intricate index could be kept up to date and function so smoothly was a marvel to his associates it was one of curtis prides curtis was celebrated as a stand patter the most regular of republicans and yet a man who could always bargain with his partys progressives and with senators from across the center aisle newspapers claimed that curtis knew the senate rules better than any other senator and declared him the most competent man in congress to look after the legislative program of the administration vice presidency –edit curtis received  votes on the presidential ballot at the  republican national convention in kansas city out of  total the winning candidate herbert hoover secured  votes having been the favourite for the nomination since august  when president calvin coolidge ruled himself out of contention curtis was a leader of the antihoover movement forming an alliance with two of his senate colleagues guy goff and james e watson as well as governor frank lowden of illinois less than a week before the convention he described hoover as a man for whom the party will be on the defensive from the day he is named until he close of the polls on election day however despite his opposition curtis had no qualms about accepting the vicepresidential nomination while covering the convention h l mencken described curtis as the kansas comic character who is half indian and half windmill charlie ran against hoover with great energy and let fly some very embarrassing truths about him but when the hoover managers threw charlie the vicepresidency as a solatium he shut up instantly and a few days later he was hymning his late bugaboo as the greatest statesman since pericles the hoover–curtis ticket won the  presidential election in a landslide securing  of the popular vote curtis resigned from the senate only the day before he was sworn in as vicepresident he took the oath of office in the senate chamber with the presidential party then proceeding to the east portico of the united states capitol for hoovers inauguration curtis arranged for a native american jazz band to perform at the inauguration curtis election as vice president made history because he was the only native kansan and only native american to hold the post as well as the first person of acknowledged noneuropean ancestry the first american of significant native american ancestry to be elected to such high office curtis decorated his office with native american artifacts and posed for pictures wearing indian headdresses he was  when he took office making him the oldest incoming vicepresident at the time he is now the secondoldest behind alben w barkley at  curtis was the first vice president to take the oath of office on a bible in the same manner as the president since he employed a woman as secretary to the vice president instead of the customary man he scored another minor first lola m williams of columbus kansas who had been working for curtis for some time was one of the first women to enter the senate floor traditionally a male monopoly soon after the great depression began curtis endorsed the fiveday work week with no reduction in wages as a worksharing solution to unemployment in october  in the middle of the campaign for  midterm elections curtis made an offhand remark that good times are just around the corner this statement was later erroneously attributed to president hoover and became a lethal political boomerang at the  republican national convention president hoover was renominated almost unanimously despite having no major opposition himself – charles dawes ruled himself out – curtis failed to secure a majority of votes on the first ballot for the vicepresidential nomination he received  out of a possible  votes or  with generals hanford macnider  and james harbord  being his nearest contenders on the second ballot the pennsylvania delegation shifted its votes to curtis from edward martin giving him  votes  and securing him the nomination for the second time curtiss final duty as vicepresident was to administer the oath of office to his successor john nance garner garners swearingin ceremony was the last to take place in the senate chamber later yearsedit after the stock market crash in  the problems of the great depression led to the defeat of the republican ticket in the next election democrat franklin d roosevelt was elected as president by a margin of  to  in  curtis term as vice president ended on march   and he was succeeded by john nance garner after politicsedit curtis decided to stay in washington dc to resume his legal career as he had a wide network of professional
