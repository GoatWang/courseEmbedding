of equity securities that the sponsor expects to perform well in an environment of rising interest rates as measured by movements in the us ten year treasury bond the sponsor has sought the assistance of ned davis research ndr as portfolio consultant to develop the trusts investment strategy ndr evaluates companies based on their sensitivity to key factors identified as having positive correlations of returns in rising interest rate environments a rising rate environment is a period in which a  basis point reversal in the us treasury year yield occurs a reversal is determined when the yield

includes both quantitative screening and qualitative analysis the portfolio selection process begins with the folowing universe of companies as of the date of the security selection o only companies that have one or more common stock issues are considered for membership o only companies that have one or more stocks trading on nyse nasdaq or amex stock exchanges are considered o only companies that are incorporated in the united states or its territories are considered depository receipts issues are not foreign issues that trade directly on us exchanges and are based in a us territory are eligible ndr then selects the securities for the portfolio that it believes possess the potential to have a positive correlation to rising interest rates by applying the following series of screens which ndr has determined have historically produced a portfolio that outperforms the benchmark during periods of rising interest rates these screens include earnings revision a higher score indicates an upward revision which signals an improved analyst outlook for the stock going forward raw materials sensitivity a higher score indicates a stronger relationship with the upward movement of commodity prices which are generally influenced positively by an improving economy and rising rates earnings retention rate measures the percentage of current earnings retained by the company a higher score indicates a higher rate of retained earnings and a lower need to take on debt in a rising rate environment cyclical vs consumer sensitivity a higher number is preferred when cyclical stocks are expected to outperform consumer stocks generally associated with an improving economy ebitdaenterprise value a higher ebitdaenterprise value signifies that each unit of a stocks value is used to generate more ebitda profits which normally leads to higher stock returns the approximately  stocks with the highest rankings are then selected and equalweighted within the portfolio at the time of selection future trusts the sponsor intends to create future trusts that follow the same investment strategy one such trust is expected to be available approximately six months after the initial date

of your investment in your trust recently equity markets have experienced significant volatility if the value of the securities falls the value of your units will also fall we cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security in the trust the trust itself or securities in general may fall in value market value may be affected by a variety of factors including o general securities markets movements o changes in the financial condition of an issuer or a sector o changes in perceptions about an issuer or a sector o interest rates and inflation o governmental policies and litigation and o purchases and sales of securities by the trust even though we carefully supervise the portfolio you should remember that we do not manage your portfolio your trust will not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund smallcapitalization and midcapitalization company risk the trust includes securities issued by smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies these securities customarily involve more investment risk than largecapitalization companies these additional risks are due in part to the following factors smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies may o have limited product lines markets or financial resources o be new and developing companies which seek to develop and utilize new andor emerging technologies these technologies may be slow to develop or fail to develop altogether o have less publicly available information o lack management depth or experience o be less liquid o be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments and o be dependent upon products that were recently brought to market or key personnel litigation and legislation risk your trust is also subject to litigation and legislation risk from time to time various legislative initiatives are proposed in the united states and abroad which may have a negative impact on certain of the issuers represented in your trust in addition litigation regarding any of the issuers of the securities or of the sectors represented by these issuers may raise potential bankruptcy concerns and may negatively impact the share prices of these securities we cannot predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation or any bankruptcy concerns will have on the share prices of the securities inflation risk inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money significant unitholders risk there may be unitholders of the trust who hold a significant portion of the trust and as result a redemption by such significant holder may have a material impact on the size expenses and viability of the trust see risk factors in part b of the prospectus for additional information how the trust works your trust your trust is a unit investment trust registered under the investment company act of  and the securities act of  we created your trust under a trust agreement between guggenheim funds

irrevocable letter of credit or other consideration to pay for the securities in exchange the trustee delivered units of your trust to us each unit represents an undivided interest in the assets of your trust these units remain outstanding until redeemed or until your trust terminates changing your portfolio your trust is not a managed fund unlike a managed fund we designed your portfolio to remain relatively fixed after its inception your trust will generally buy and sell securities o to pay expenses o to issue additional units or redeem units o in limited circumstances to protect the

its portfolio however if a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger or acquisition has been announced affecting a security your trust may either sell the security or accept a tender offer for cash if the supervisor determines that the sale or tender is in the best interest of unitholders the trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to unitholders if your trust receives securities or property other than cash it may either hold the securities or property in its portfolio or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds for example this could happen in a merger or similar transaction we will increase the size of your trust as we sell units when we create additional units we will seek to replicate the existing portfolio in certain cases the trustee may need additional time to acquire the securities necessary to create units and consequently the trust may not be fully invested at all times which may impact the trusts performance when your trust buys securities it will pay brokerage or other acquisition fees you could experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and fluctuations in security prices between the time we create units

regarding the guggenheim defined portfolios you should read both parts of the prospectus and retain them for future reference except as provided in part a of the prospectus the information contained in this part b will apply to each trust contents general information  investment policies  risk factors  administration of the trust  expenses of the trust  portfolio transactions and brokerage allocation  purchase redemption and pricing of units  taxes  experts  description of ratings  general information each trust is one of a series of separate unit investment trusts created under the name guggenheim defined portfolios and registered under the investment company act of  and the securities act of  each trust was created as a common law trust on the inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of new york each trust was created under a trust agreement among guggenheim funds distributors llc as sponsor evaluator and supervisor and the bank of new york mellon as trustee when your trust was created the sponsor delivered to the trustee securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the trust after your trust is created the sponsor may deposit additional securities in the trust contracts to purchase additional securities along with cash or a bank letter of credit in lieu of cash to pay for such contracted securities or cash including a letter of credit with instructions to purchase additional securities such additional deposits will be in amounts which will seek to replicate as closely as practicable the portfolio immediately prior to such deposits if the sponsor deposits cash existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust will pay the associated brokerage fees a trust consists of i the securities listed under trust portfolio in the prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust ii any additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions of the trust agreement and iii any cash held in the accounts of the trust neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of the securities however should any contract for the purchase of any of the securities initially deposited in a trust fail the sponsor will unless substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement refund the cash and sales charge attributable to such failed contract to all unitholders on the next distribution date investment policies the trust is a unit investment trust and is not an actively managed fund traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic financial and market analysis the portfolio of a trust however will not be actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio unitholders will not be able to dispose of or vote any of the securities in a trust as the holder of the securities the trustee will vote the securities and will endeavor to vote the securities such that the securities are voted as closely as possible in the same manner and the same general proportion as are the securities held by owners other than such trust however the trustee may not be able to vote the securities in a trust that are traded on foreign exchanges the trust agreement provides that the sponsor may but need not direct the trustee to dispose of a security in certain events such as the issuer having defaulted on the payment on any of its outstanding obligations the issuer having qualified as a passive foreign investment company under the internal revenue code or the price of a security has declined to such an extent or other such credit factors exist so that in the opinion of the sponsor the retention of such securities would be detrimental to the trust if a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger or acquisition has been announced affecting a security the trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer for cash if the supervisor determines that the sale or tender is in the best interest of unitholders the trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to unitholders pursuant to the trust agreement and with limited exceptions the trustee may sell any securities or other properties acquired in exchange for securities such as those acquired in connection with a merger or other transaction if offered such new or exchanged securities or property other than cash the trustee shall reject the offer however in the event such securities or property are nonetheless acquired by the trust they may be accepted for deposit in a trust and either sold by the trustee or held in a trust pursuant to the direction of the sponsor proceeds from the sale of securities or any securities or other property received by the trust in exchange for securities are credited to the capital account for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions except as stated in the trust agreement or in the prospectus the acquisition by the trust of any securities other than the portfolio securities is prohibited the trustee may sell securities designated by the sponsor from the trust for the purpose of redeeming units of a trust tendered for redemption and the payment of expenses and for such other purposes as permitted under the trust agreement notwithstanding the foregoing the trustee is authorized to reinvest any funds held in the capital or income accounts pending distribution in us treasury obligations which mature on or before the next applicable distribution date any obligations so acquired must be held until they mature and proceeds therefrom may not be reinvested proceeds from the sale of securities or any securities or other property received by a trust in exchange for securities are credited to the capital account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions except for failed securities and as provided in the prospectus or in the trust agreement the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the portfolio securities is prohibited the trustee may sell securities from a trust for limited purposes including redeeming units tendered for redemption and the payment of expenses risk factors stocks an investment in units of a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an investment in equity securities including the risk that the financial condition of issuers of the securities may become impaired or that the general condition of the stock market may worsen both of which may contribute directly to a decrease in the value of the securities and thus in the value of the units or the risk that holders of common stock have a right to receive payments from the issuers of those stocks that is generally inferior to that of creditors of or holders of debt obligations issued by the issuers and that the rights of holders of common stock generally rank inferior to the rights of holders of preferred stock you could lose some or all of your investment in the trust common stocks are especially susceptible to general stock market movements and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of the issuers change these perceptions are based on unpredictable factors including expectations regarding government economic monetary and fiscal policies inflation and interest rates economic expansion or contraction and global or regional political economic or banking crises holders of common stock incur more risk than the holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations because common stockholders as owners of the entity have generally inferior rights to receive payments from the issuer in comparison with the rights of creditors of or holders of debt obligations or preferred stock issued by the issuer holders of common stock of the type held by a trust have a right to receive dividends only when and if and in the amounts declared by the issuers board of directors and to participate in amounts available for distribution by the issuer only after all other claims on the issuer have been paid or provided for by contrast holders of preferred stock have the right to receive dividends at a fixed rate when and as declared by the issuers board of directors normally on a cumulative basis but do not participate in other amounts available for distribution by the issuing corporation cumulative preferred stock dividends must be paid before common stock dividends and any cumulative preferred stock dividend omitted is added to future dividends payable to the holders of cumulative preferred stock preferred stocks are also entitled to rights on liquidation which are senior to those of common stocks moreover common stocks do not represent an obligation of the issuer and therefore do not offer any assurance of income or provide the degree of protection of capital debt securities indeed the issuance of debt securities or even preferred stock will create prior claims for payment of principal interest liquidation preferences and dividends which could adversely affect the ability and inclination of the issuer to declare or pay dividends on its common stock or the rights of holders of common stock with respect to assets of the issuer upon liquidation or bankruptcy further unlike debt securities which typically have a stated principal amount payable at maturity whose value however will be subject to market fluctuations prior thereto common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity and have values which are subject to market fluctuations for as long as the stocks remain outstanding the value of the securities in a portfolio thus may be expected to fluctuate over the entire life of a trust to values higher or lower than those prevailing at the time of purchase the sponsors buying and selling of the securities especially during the initial offering of units of the trust or to satisfy redemptions of units may impact upon the value of the underlying securities and the units the publication of the list of the securities selected for the trust may also cause increased buying activity in certain of the stocks comprising the portfolio after such announcement investment advisory and brokerage clients of the sponsor and its affiliates may purchase individual securities appearing on the list during the course of the initial offering period or may purchase warrants issued by the sponsor or its affiliates which are based on the performance of the securities on the list the sponsor or its affiliates may also purchase securities as a hedge against its risk on the warrants although generally the sponsor and its affiliates will not purchase securities for their own account until after the trust portfolio has been acquired such buying activity in the stock of these companies or issuance of the warrants prior to the purchase of the securities by the trust may cause the trust to purchase stocks at a higher price than those buyers who effect purchases by the trust fixed portfolio investors should be aware that the trust is not managed and as a result the adverse financial condition of a company will not result in the elimination of its securities from the portfolio of the trust except under extraordinary circumstances investors should note in particular that the securities were selected on the basis of the criteria set forth in the prospectus and that the trust may continue to purchase or hold securities originally selected through this process even though the evaluation of the attractiveness of the securities may have changed a number of the securities in the trust may also be owned by other clients of the sponsor however because these clients may have differing investment objectives the sponsor may sell certain securities from those accounts in instances where a sale by the trust would be impermissible such as to maximize return by taking advantage of market fluctuations in the event a public tender offer is made for a security or a merger or acquisition is announced affecting a security the sponsor may instruct the trustee to tender or sell the security on the open market when in its opinion it is in the best interest of the unitholders of the unit to do so although the portfolio is regularly reviewed and evaluated and the sponsor may instruct the trustee to sell securities under certain limited circumstances securities will not be sold by the trust to take advantage of market fluctuations or changes in anticipated rates of appreciation as a result the amount realized upon the sale of the securities may not be the highest price attained by an individual security during the life of the trust the prices of single shares of each of the securities in the trust vary widely and the effect of a dollar of fluctuation either higher or lower in stock prices will be much greater as a percentage of the lowerprice stocks purchase price than as a percentage of the higherprice stocks purchase price closedend fund risks if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust may invest in the common stock of closedend funds closedend funds closedend funds are actively managed investment companies which invest in various types of securities closedend funds issue shares of common stock that are traded on a securities exchange closedend funds are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the closedend funds investment objective and to manage the closedend fund portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil and as investors perceptions regarding closedend funds or their underlying investments change shares of closedend funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of closedend fund shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors certain of the closedend funds included in a trust may employ the use of leverage in their portfolios through the issuance of preferred stock while leverage often serves to increase the yield of a closedend fund this leverage also subjects the closedend fund to increased risks including the likelihood of increased volatility and the possibility that the closedend funds common share income will fall if the dividend rate on the preferred shares or the interest rate on any borrowings rises exchangetraded fund risks if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust may invest in the common stock of exchangetraded funds etfs etfs are investment pools that hold other securities etfs are either openend management investment companies or unit investment trusts registered under the investment company act of  unlike typical openend funds or unit investment trusts etfs generally do not sell or redeem their individual shares at net asset value in addition securities exchanges list etf shares for trading which allows investors to purchase and sell individual etf shares at current market prices throughout the day etfs therefore possess characteristics of traditional openend funds and unit investment trusts which issue redeemable shares and of corporate common stocks or closedend funds which generally issue shares that trade at negotiated prices on securities exchanges and are not redeemable etfs are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the funds investment objective the underlying etf has management and operating expenses you will bear not only your share of the trusts expenses but also the expenses of the underlying etf by investing in an etf the trust incurs greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the etf shares of etfs may trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of the etf shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors market discounts or premiums certain of the securities may have been deposited at a market discount or premium principally because their dividend rates are lower or higher than prevailing rates on comparable securities the current returns of market discount securities are lower than comparably rated securities selling at par because discount securities tend to increase in market value as they approach maturity the current returns of market premium securities are higher than comparably rated securities selling at par because premium securities tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity because part of the purchase price is returned through current income payments and not at maturity an early redemption at par of a premium security will result in a reduction in yield to the trust market premium or discount attributable to dividend rate changes does not indicate market confidence or lack of confidence in the issue liquidity whether or not the securities are listed on a national securities exchange the principal trading market for the securities may be in the overthecounter market as a result the existence of a liquid trading market for the securities may depend on whether dealers will make a market in the securities there can be no assurance that a market will be made for any of the securities that any market for the securities will be maintained or of the liquidity of the securities in any markets made in addition a trust is restricted under the investment company act of  from selling securities to the sponsor the price at which the securities may be sold to meet redemptions and the value of a trust will be adversely affected if trading markets for the securities are limited or absent additional deposits the trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of additional securities or cash including a letter of credit with instructions to purchase additional securities in such trust and the issuance of a corresponding number of additional units if the sponsor deposits cash existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the securities and because a trust will pay the associated brokerage fees to minimize this effect the trusts will attempt to purchase the securities as close to the evaluation time or as close to the evaluation prices as possible some of the securities may have limited trading volume the trustee with directions from the sponsor will endeavor to purchase securities with deposited cash as soon as practicable reserving the right to purchase those securities over the  business days following each deposit in an effort to reduce the effect of these purchases on the market price of those stocks this could however result in the trusts failure to participate in any appreciation of those stocks before the cash is invested if any cash remains at the end of this period and such date is within the day period following the inception date and cannot be invested in one or more stocks at what the sponsor considers reasonable prices it intends to use that cash to purchase each of the other securities in the original proportionate relationship among those securities similarly at termination of the trust the sponsor reserves the right to sell securities over a period of up to nine business days to lessen the impact of its sales on the market price of the securities the proceeds received by unitholders following termination of the trust will reflect the actual sales proceeds received on the securities which will likely differ from the closing sale price on the termination date litigation and legislation at any time litigation may be initiated on a variety of grounds or legislation may be enacted with respect to the securities in a trust or the issuers of the securities there can be no assurance that future litigation or legislation will not have a material adverse effect on the trust or will not impair the ability of issuers to achieve their business goals financial sector risks if set forth in part a of the prospectus certain of the issuers of securities in a trust may be involved in the financial sector an investment in units of a trust containing securities of such issuers should be made with an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the financial sector in general banks thrifts and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets in commercial and residential real estate loans or any particular segment or industry and competition from new entrants in their fields of business banks and thrifts are highly dependent on net interest margin banks and thrifts traditionally receive a significant portion of their revenues from consumer mortgage fee income as a result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets as home purchasing and refinancing activity has subsided this revenue has diminished economic conditions in the real estate markets have deteriorated leading to asset writeoffs and decreased liquidity in the credit markets which can have a substantial negative effect upon banks and thrifts because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans secured by real estate difficulties in the mortgage and broader credit markets have resulted in decreases in the availability of funds financial performance of many banks and thrifts especially in securities collateralized by mortgage loans has deteriorated in response to recent market and economic conditions the united states government particularly the us department of the treasury us treasury the federal reserve board frb and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic have taken a variety of extraordinary measures including capital injections guarantees of bank liabilities and the acquisition of illiquid assets from banks designed to provide fiscal stimulus restore confidence in the financial markets and to strengthen financial institutions the emergency economic stabilization act of  eesa gave the us treasury  billion to purchase bad mortgagerelated securities that caused much of the difficulties experienced by financial institutions and the credit markets in general additionally the american recovery and reinvestment act of  arra was signed into law in february  the eesa and arra along with the us treasurys capital purchase program which provides for direct purchases by the us treasury of equity from financial institutions contain provisions limiting the way banks and their holding companies are able pay dividends purchase their own common stock and compensate officers furthermore participants have been subject to forward looking stress tests to determine if they have sufficient capital to withstand certain economic scenarios including situations more severe than the current recession as a result of these stress tests some financial institutions were required to increase their level of capital through a combination of asset sales additional equity offerings and the conversion of preferred shares into common stock the longterm effects of the eesa arra and the stress tests are not yet known and cannot be predicted this uncertainty may cause increased costs and risks for the firms associated with the respective programs banks thrifts and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and when such institutions are statechartered to state regulation as well such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks and thrifts may pursue furthermore bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund regulatory actions such as increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and thrifts and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the fdic can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a company to pay dividends neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental regulations however insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their holding companies or insures against any risk of investment in the securities issued by such institutions in light of the current credit market difficulties the us government is considering changes to the laws and regulatory structure new legislation and regulatory changes could cause business disruptions result in significant loss of revenue limit financial firms ability to pursue business opportunities impact the value of business assets and impose additional costs that may adversely affect business there can be no assurance as to the actual impact these laws and their implementing regulations or any other governmental program will have on the financial markets currently the frb fdic securities and exchange commission office of comptroller of the currency a bureau of the us treasury which regulates national banks and the us commodities futures trading commission which oversees commodity futures and option markets all play a role in the supervision of the financial markets recently passed legislation calls for swift government intervention which includes the creation of new federal agencies that will have a direct impact on the financial banking and insurance industries this new legislation includes the creation of a financial oversight council to advise the frb on the identification of firms who failure could pose a threat to financial stability due to their combination of size leverage and interconnectedness additionally these financial firms would be subject to increased scrutiny concerning their capital liquidity and risk management standards the statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks thrifts and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone substantial change in the recent past to a great extent these changes are embodied in the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  the resolution trust corporation refinancing restructuring and improvement act of  the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of  and the regulations promulgated under these laws in  the grammleachbliley act repealed most of the barriers set up by the  glasssteagall act which separated the banking insurance and securities industries banks and thrifts now face significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds credit unions mortgage banking companies and insurance companies banks insurance companies and securities firms can merge to form onestop financial conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors this legislation has resulted in increased merger activity and heightened competition among existing and new participants in the field efforts to expand the ability of federal thrifts to branch on an interstate basis have been initially successful through promulgation of regulations and legislation to liberalize interstate banking has been signed into law under the legislation banks are able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any state since mid banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into branches thus leading to continued consolidation the securities and exchange commission and the financial accounting standards board fasb require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring marktomarket accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts or available for sale adoption of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported health of the industry and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems accounting standards codification  fair value measurements and disclosures changed the requirements of marktomarket accounting and determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability has significantly decreased these changes and other potential changes in financial accounting rules and valuation techniques may have a significant impact on the banking and financial services industries in terms of accurately pricing assets or liabilities additional legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming for example the bank regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws rules and regulations and there can be no certainty as to the effect if any that such changes would have on the securities in a trusts portfolio in addition from time to time the deposit insurance system is reviewed by congress and federal regulators and proposed reforms of that system could among other things further restrict the ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks or change the dollar amount or number of deposits insured for any depositor on october   eesa increased the maximum amount of federal deposit insurance coverage payable as to any certificate of deposit from  to  per depositor the impact of this reform is unknown and could reduce profitability as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits the sponsor makes no prediction as to what if any manner of bank and thrift regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such actions might have on a trusts portfolio the federal bank holding company act of  bhc act generally prohibits a bank holding company from i acquiring directly or indirectly more than  of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company ii acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company iii acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank or iv merging or consolidating with another bank holding company without first obtaining frb approval in considering an application with respect to any such transaction the frb is required to consider a variety of factors including the potential anticompetitive effects of the transaction the financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting institutions the managerial resources of the resulting institution the convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve the record of performance of each combining organization under the community reinvestment act and the equal credit opportunity act and the prospective availability to the frb of information appropriate to determine ongoing regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws in addition the federal change in bank control act and various state laws impose limitations on the ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks or bank holding companies the frb has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies in which the frb expressed its view that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that would weaken its financial health such as by borrowing the frb also may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of certain applications including applications for approval of mergers and acquisitions the sponsor makes no prediction as to the effect if any such laws will have on the securities in a trust or whether such approvals if necessary will be obtained companies engaged in investment bankingbrokerage and investment management include brokerage firms brokerdealers investment banks finance companies and mutual fund companies earnings and share prices of companies in this industry are quite volatile and often exceed the volatility levels of the market as a whole negative economic events in the credit markets have led some firms to declare bankruptcy forced shortnotice sales to competing firms or required government intervention by the fdic or through an infusions of troubled asset relief program funds consolidation in the industry and the volatility in the stock market have negatively impacted investors additionally government intervention has required many financial institutions to become bank holding companies under the bhc act under the system of functional regulation established under the bhc act the frb supervises bank holding companies as an umbrella regulator the bhc act and regulations generally restrict bank holding companies from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities the frb and fdic have also issued substantial riskbased and leverage capital guidelines applicable to us banking organizations the guidelines define a threetier framework requiring depository institutions to maintain certain leverage ratios depending on the type of assets held if any depository institution controlled by a financial or bank holding company ceases to meet capital or management standards the frb may impose corrective capital andor managerial requirements on the company and place limitations on its ability to conduct broader financial activities furthermore proposed legislation will allow the treasury and the fdic to create a resolution regime to take over bank and financial holding companies the taking over would be based on whether the firm is in default or in danger of defaulting and whether such a default would have a serious adverse affect on the financial system or the economy this mechanism would only be used by the government in exceptional circumstances to mitigate these effects this type of intervention has unknown risks and costs associated with it which may cause unforeseeable harm in the industry companies involved in the insurance industry are engaged in underwriting reinsuring selling distributing or placing of property and casualty life or health insurance other growth areas within the insurance industry include brokerage reciprocals claims processors and multiline insurance companies interest rate levels general economic conditions and price and marketing competition affect insurance company profits property and casualty insurance profits may also be affected by weather catastrophes and other disasters life and health insurance profits may be affected by mortality and morbidity rates individual companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers insurance companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation including the imposition of maximum rate levels which may not be adequate for some lines of business proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies policy sales tax obligations and profitability in addition to the foregoing profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressures to compete globally in addition to the normal risks of business companies involved in the insurance industry are subject to significant risk factors including those applicable to regulated insurance companies such as i the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves particularly reserves for the cost of environmental asbestos and mass tort claims and the fact that ultimate losses could materially exceed established loss reserves which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition ii the fact that insurance companies have experienced and can be expected in the future to experience catastrophe losses which could have a material adverse impact on their financial condition results of operations and cash flow iii the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment patterns caused by new claims settlement practices iv the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus particularly in light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state insurance regulatory authorities and in order to maintain acceptable financial strength or claimspaying ability rating v the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies subsidiaries are subject various regulatory initiatives that may affect insurance companies and regulatory and other legal actions vi the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the value of an insurance companys investment portfolio and on the attractiveness of certain of its products vii the need to adjust the effective duration of the assets and liabilities of life insurance operations in order to meet the anticipated cash flow requirements of its policyholder obligations and viii the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables this enhanced oversight into the insurance industry may pose unknown risks to the sector as a whole the state insurance regulatory framework has during recent years come under increased federal scrutiny and certain state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that alter and in many cases increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company systems further the national association of insurance commissioners naic and state insurance regulators are reexamining existing laws and regulations specifically focusing on insurance companies interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws in addition congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the united states to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation the sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance industry or what effect if any such legislation would have on the industry all insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain investment categories failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause nonconforming investments to be treated as nonadmitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and in some instances would require divestiture environmental pollution cleanup is the subject of both federal and state regulation by some estimates there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to clean up the insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  superfund and comparable state statutes minisuperfund govern the cleanup and restoration by potentially responsible parties prps superfund and the minisuperfunds environmental cleanup laws or ecls establish a mechanism to pay for cleanup of waste sites if prps fail to do so and to assign liability to prps the extent of liability to be allocated to a prp is dependent on a variety of factors the extent of cleanup necessary and the assignment of liability has not been fully established the insurance industry is disputing many such claims key coverage issues include whether superfund response costs are considered damages under the policies when and how coverage is triggered applicability of pollution exclusions the potential for joint and several liability and definition of an occurrence similar coverage issues exist for clean up and waste sites not covered under superfund to date courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues an insurers exposure to liability with regard to its insureds which have been or may be named as prps is uncertain superfund reform proposals have been introduced in congress but none have been enacted there can be no assurance that any superfund reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair effective and costefficient system for settlement of superfund related claims while current federal income tax law permits the taxdeferred accumulation of earnings on the premiums paid by an annuity owner and holders of certain savingsoriented life insurance products no assurance can be given that future tax law will continue to allow such tax deferrals if such deferrals were not allowed consumer demand for the affected products would be substantially reduced in addition proposals to lower the federal income tax rates through a form of flat tax or otherwise could have if enacted a negative impact on the demand for such products major determinants of future earnings of companies in the financial services sector are the direction of the stock market investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of longterm and shortterm interest rates and the outlook for emerging markets negative trends in any of these earnings determinants could have a serious adverse effect on the financial stability as well as the stock prices of these companies furthermore there can be no assurance that the issuers of the securities included in the trust will be able to respond in a timely manner to compete in the rapidly developing marketplace in addition to the foregoing profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressures to compete globally foreign securities risk if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust or issuers of securities held by a trust may invest in foreign issuers and therefore an investment in such a trust involves some investment risks that are different in some respects from an investment in a trust that invests entirely in securities of domestic issuers those investment risks include future political and governmental restrictions which might adversely affect the payment or receipt of payment of dividends on the relevant securities currency exchange rate fluctuations exchange control policies and the limited liquidity and small market capitalization of such foreign countries securities markets in addition for foreign issuers that are not subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  there may be less publicly available information than is available from a domestic issuer also foreign issuers are not necessarily subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards practices and requirements comparable to those applicable to domestic issuers however due to the nature of the issuers of the securities included in the trust the sponsor believes that adequate information will be available to allow the sponsor to provide portfolio surveillance certain of the securities in the trust may be in adr or gdr form adrs american depositary receipts and gdrs global depositary receipts represent common stock deposited with a custodian in a depositary american depositary receipts and global depositary receipts collectively the depositary receipts are issued by a bank or trust company to evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation these instruments may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the securities into which they may be converted for purposes of the discussion herein the terms adr and gdr generally include american depositary shares and global depositary shares respectively depositary receipts may be sponsored or unsponsored in an unsponsored facility the depositary initiates and arranges the facility at the request of market makers and acts as agent for the depositary receipts holder while the company itself is not involved in the transaction in a sponsored facility the issuing company initiates the facility and agrees to pay certain administrative and shareholderrelated expenses sponsored facilities use a single depositary and entail a contractual relationship between the issuer the shareholder and the depositary unsponsored facilities involve several depositaries with no contractual relationship to the company the depositary bank that issues depositary receipts generally charges a fee based on the price of the depositary receipts upon issuance and cancellation of the depositary receipts this fee would be in addition to the brokerage commissions paid upon the acquisition or surrender of the security in addition the depositary bank incurs expenses in connection with the conversion of dividends or other cash distributions paid in local currency into us dollars and such expenses are deducted from the amount of the dividend or distribution paid to holders resulting in a lower payout per underlying shares represented by the depositary receipts than would be the case if the underlying share were held directly certain tax considerations including tax rate differentials and withholding requirements arising from the application of the tax laws of one nation to nationals of another and from certain practices in the depositary receipts market may also exist with respect to certain depositary receipts in varying degrees any or all of these factors may affect the value of the depositary receipts compared with the value of the underlying shares in the local market in addition the rights of holders of depositary receipts may be different than those of holders of the underlying shares and the market for depositary receipts may be less liquid than that for the underlying shares depositary receipts are registered securities pursuant to the securities act of  and may be subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  for the securities that are depositary receipts currency fluctuations will affect the united states dollar equivalent of the local currency price of the underlying domestic share and as a result are likely to affect the value of the depositary receipts and consequently the value of the securities the foreign issuers of securities that are depositary receipts may pay dividends in foreign currencies which must be converted into dollars most foreign currencies have fluctuated widely in value against the united states dollar for many reasons including supply and demand of the respective currency the soundness of the world economy and the strength of the respective economy as compared to the economies of the united states and other countries therefore for any securities of issuers whether or not they are in depositary receipt form whose earnings are stated in foreign currencies or which pay dividends in foreign currencies or which are traded in foreign currencies there is a risk that their united states dollar value will vary with fluctuations in the united states dollar foreign exchange rates for the relevant currencies on january   austria belgium finland france germany ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands portugal and spain eleven of the fifteen member states of the european union eu as of such date established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro on such date the euro became the official currency of these eleven countries the participating countries do not control their own monetary policies by directing independent interest rates for their currencies greece slovenia cyprus and malta have also adopted the euro as their official currency in these member states the authority to direct monetary policy including money supply and official interest rates for the euro is exercised by the european central bank the conversion of the national currencies of the participating countries to the euro could negatively impact the market rate of the exchange between such currencies or the euro and the us dollar as of january   there were  member states in the eu in addition european corporations and other entities with significant markets or operations in europe whether or not in the participating countries face strategic challenges as these entities adapt to a single transnational currency the euro conversion may have a material impact on revenues expenses or income from operations increase competition due to the increased price transparency of eu markets effect issuers currency exchange rate risk and derivatives exposure disrupt current contracts cause issuers to increase spending on information technology updates required for the conversion and result in potential adverse tax consequences the sponsor is unable to predict what impact if any the euro conversion will have on any of the issuers of securities contained in a trust preferred stock risks if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust or issuers of securities held by a trust may invest in preferred stock if this is the case an investment in units should be made with an understanding of the risks which an investment in preferred stocks entails including the risk that the financial condition of the issuers of the securities or the general condition of the preferred stock market may worsen and the value of the preferred stocks and therefore the value of the units may decline preferred stocks may be susceptible to general stock market movements and to volatile increases and decreases of value as market confidence in and perceptions of the issuers change these perceptions are based on unpredictable factors including expectations regarding government economic monetary and fiscal policies inflation and interest rates economic expansion or contraction market liquidity and global or regional political economic or banking crises preferred stocks are also vulnerable to congressional reductions in the dividendsreceived deduction which would adversely affect the aftertax return to the investors who can take advantage of the deduction such a reduction might adversely affect the value of preferred stocks in general holders of preferred stocks as owners of the entity have rights to receive payments from the issuers of those preferred stocks that are generally subordinate to those of creditors of or holders of debt obligations or in some cases other senior preferred stocks of such issuers preferred stocks do not represent an obligation of the issuer and therefore do not offer any assurance of income or provide the same degree of protection of capital as do debt securities the issuance of additional debt securities or senior preferred stocks will create prior claims for payment of principal and interest and senior dividends which could adversely affect the ability and inclination of the issuer to declare or pay dividends on its preferred stock or the rights of holders of preferred stock with respect to assets of the issuer upon liquidation or bankruptcy the value of preferred stocks is subject to market fluctuations for as long as the preferred stocks remain outstanding and thus the value of the securities may be expected to fluctuate over the life of the trust to values higher or lower than those prevailing on the initial date of deposit trust preferred securities risks if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust or issuers of securities held by a trust may invest in trust preferred securities holders of trust preferred securities incur risks in addition to or slightly different than the typical risks of holding preferred stocks trust preferred securities are limitedlife preferred securities that are typically issued by corporations generally in the form of interestbearing notes or preferred securities issued by corporations or by an affiliated business trust of a corporation generally in the form of beneficial interests in subordinated debentures issued by the corporation or similarly structured securities the maturity and dividend rate of the trust preferred securities are structured to match the maturity and coupon interest rate of the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures trust preferred securities usually mature on the stated maturity date of the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures and may be redeemed or liquidated prior to the stated maturity date of such instruments for any reason on or after their stated call date or upon the occurrence of certain circumstances at any time trust preferred securities generally have a yield advantage over traditional preferred stocks but unlike preferred stocks distributions on the trust preferred securities are generally treated as interest rather than dividends for federal income tax purposes unlike most preferred stocks distributions received from trust preferred securities are generally not eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction certain of the risks unique to trust preferred securities include i distributions on trust preferred securities will be made only if interest payments on the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures are made ii a corporation issuing the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures may defer interest payments on these instruments for up to  consecutive quarters and if such election is made distributions will not be made on the trust preferred securities during the deferral period iii certain tax or regulatory events may trigger the redemption of the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures by the issuing corporation and result in prepayment of the trust preferred securities prior to their stated maturity date iv future legislation may be proposed or enacted that may prohibit the corporation from deducting its interest payments on the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures for tax purposes making redemption of these instruments likely v a corporation may redeem the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures in whole at any time or in part from time to time on or after a stated call date vi trust preferred securities holders have very limited voting rights and vii payment of interest on the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures and therefore distributions on the trust preferred securities is dependent on the financial condition of the issuing corporation convertible securities risks if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust or issuers of securities held by a trust may invest in convertible securities convertible securities generally offer lower interest or dividend yields than nonconvertible fixedincome securities of similar credit quality because of the potential for capital appreciation the market values of convertible securities tend to decline as interest rates increase and conversely to increase as interest rates decline however a convertible securitys market value also tends to reflect the market price of the common stock of the issuing company particularly when the stock price is greater than the convertible securitys conversion price the conversion price is defined as the predetermined price or exchange ratio at which the convertible security can be converted or exchanged for the underlying common stock as the market price of the underlying common stock declines below the conversion price the price of the convertible security tends to be increasingly influenced more by the yield of the convertible security than by the market price of the underlying common stock thus it may not decline in price to the same extent as the underlying common stock and convertible securities generally have less potential for gain or loss than common stocks however mandatory convertible securities as discussed below generally do not limit the potential for loss to the same extent as securities convertible at the option of the holder in the event of a liquidation of the issuing company holders of convertible securities would be paid before that companys common stockholders consequently an issuers convertible securities generally entail less risk than its common stock however convertible securities fall below debt obligations of the same issuer in order of preference or priority in the event of a liquidation and are typically unrated or rated lower than such debt obligations in addition contingent payment convertible securities allow the issuer to claim deductions based on its nonconvertible cost of debt which generally will result in deduction in excess of the actual cash payments made on the securities and accordingly holders will recognize income in amounts in excess of the cash payments received mandatory convertible securities are distinguished as a subset of convertible securities because the conversion is not optional and the conversion price at maturity is based solely upon the market price of the underlying common stock which may be significantly less than par or the price above or below par paid for these reasons the risks associated with investing in mandatory convertible securities most closely resemble the risks inherent in common stocks mandatory convertible securities customarily pay a higher coupon yield to compensate for the potential risk of additional price volatility and loss upon conversion because the market price of a mandatory convertible security increasingly corresponds to the market price of its underlying common stock as the convertible security approaches its conversion date there can be no assurance that the higher coupon will compensate for the potential loss senior loan risks if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust or issuers of securities held by a trust may invest in senior loans senior loans in which a closedend fund or an etf may invest o generally are of below investmentgrade or junk credit quality o may be unrated at the time of investment o generally are not registered with the sec or any state securities commission and o generally are not listed on any securities exchange the amount of public information available on senior loans generally will be less extensive than that available for other types of assets no reliable active trading market currently exists for many senior loans although a secondary market for certain senior loans has developed over the past several years senior loans are thus relatively illiquid liquidity relates to the ability of a closedend fund or an etf to sell an investment in a timely manner at a price approximately equal to its value on the closedend funds or the etfs books the illiquidity of senior loans may impair a closedend funds or an etfs ability to realize the full value of its assets in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation of such assets because of the lack of an active trading market illiquid securities are also difficult to value and prices provided by external pricing services may not reflect the true value of the securities however many senior loans are of a large principal amount and are held by a large number of financial institutions to the extent that a secondary market does exist for certain senior loans the market may be subject to irregular trading activity wide bidask spreads and extended trade settlement periods the market for senior loans could be disrupted in the event of an economic downturn or a substantial increase or decrease in interest rates this could result in increased volatility in the market and in the trusts net asset value if legislation or state or federal regulators impose additional requirements or restrictions on the ability of financial institutions to make loans that are considered highly leveraged transactions the availability of senior loans for investment by the closedend funds or the etfs may be adversely affected in addition such requirements or restrictions could reduce or eliminate sources of financing for certain borrowers this would increase the risk of default if legislation or federal or state regulators require financial institutions to dispose of senior loans that are considered highly leveraged transactions or subject such senior loans to increased regulatory scrutiny financial institutions may determine to sell such senior loans such sales could result in depressed prices if a closedend fund or an etf attempts to sell a senior loan at a time when a financial institution is engaging in such a sale the price a closedend fund or an etf could get for the senior loan may be adversely affected some senior loans are subject to the risk that a court pursuant to fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws could subordinate the senior loans to presently existing or future indebtedness of the borrower or take other action detrimental to lenders such court action could under certain circumstances include invalidation of senior loans any lender which could include a closedend fund or an etf is subject to the risk that a court could find the lender liable for damages in a claim by a borrower arising under the common laws of tort or contracts or antifraud provisions of certain securities laws for actions taken or omitted to be taken by the lenders under the relevant terms of a loan agreement or in connection with actions with respect to the collateral underlying the senior loan floatingrate securities risk if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust or issuers of securities held by a trust may invest in floatingrate securities certain closedend funds or etfs held by the trust may invest in securities that are structured as floatingrate instruments in which the interest rate payable on the obligations fluctuates on a periodic basis based upon changes in a base lending rate as a result the yield on these securities will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment causing the closedend funds or etfs to experience a reduction in the income they receive from these securities a sudden and significant increase in market interest rates may increase the risk of payment defaults and cause a decline in the value of these investments and the value of the closedend funds or the etfs held by the trust smallcapitalization and midcapitalization stocks risk if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust may invest in smallcapitalization or midcapitalization stocks investing in smallcapitalization stocks or midcapitalization stocks may involve greater risk than investing in largecapitalization stocks since they can be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements many small market capitalization companies smallcap companies or middle market capitalization companies midcap companies will have had their securities publicly traded if at all for only a short period of time and will not have had the opportunity to establish a reliable trading pattern through economic cycles the price volatility of smallcap companies and midcap companies is relatively higher than larger older and more mature companies the greater price volatility of smallcap companies and midcap companies may result from the fact that there may be less market liquidity less information publicly available or fewer investors who monitor the activities of these companies in addition the market prices of these securities may exhibit more sensitivity to changes in industry or general economic conditions some smallcap companies or midcap companies will not have been in existence long enough to experience economic cycles or to demonstrate whether they are sufficiently well managed to survive downturns or inflationary periods further a variety of factors may affect the success of a companys business beyond the ability of its management to prepare or compensate for them including domestic and international political developments government trade and fiscal policies patterns of trade and war or other military conflict which may affect industries or markets or the economy generally administration of the trust distributions to unitholders income received by a trust is credited by the trustee to the income account of the trust other receipts are credited to the capital account of a trust income received by a trust will be distributed on or shortly after the distribution dates each year shown in the prospectus on a pro rata basis to unitholders of record as of the preceding record date shown in the prospectus however if set forth in part a of the prospectus that the trust will prorate distributions on an annual basis income averaging then income received by the trust will be distributed on a prorated basis of onetwelfth of the estimated annual income to the trust for the ensuing  months all distributions will be net of applicable expenses there is no assurance that any actual distributions will be made since all dividends received may be used to pay expenses in addition excess amounts from the capital account of a trust if any will be distributed at least annually to the unitholders then of record proceeds received from the disposition of any of the securities after a record date and prior to the following distribution date will be held in the capital account and not distributed until the next distribution date applicable to the capital account the trustee shall be required to make a distribution from the capital account if the cash balance on deposit therein available for distribution shall be sufficient to distribute at least  per  units the trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the capital or income accounts but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of such funds the trustee is authorized to reinvest any funds held in the capital or income accounts pending distribution in us treasury obligations which mature on or before the next applicable distribution date any obligations so acquired must be held until they mature and proceeds therefrom may not be reinvested the distribution to the unitholders as of each record date will be made on the following distribution date or shortly thereafter and shall consist of an amount substantially equal to such portion of the unitholders pro rata share of the dividend distributions then held in the income account after deducting estimated expenses because dividends are not received by a trust at a constant rate throughout the year such distributions to unitholders are expected to fluctuate however if the trust uses income averaging the trust prorates the income distribution on an annual basis and annual income distributions are expected to vary from year to year if the amount on deposit in the income account is insufficient for payment of the amount of income to be distributed on a monthly basis the trustee shall advance out of its own funds and cause to be deposited in and credited to such income account such amount as may be required to permit payment of the monthly income distribution the trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the trust without interest out of income received by the trust subsequent to the date of such advance and subject to the condition that any such reimbursement shall be made only if it will not reduce the funds in or available for the income account to an amount less than required for the next ensuing distribution persons who purchase units will commence receiving distributions only after such person becomes a record owner a person will become the owner of units and thereby a unitholder of record on the date of settlement provided payment has been received notification to the trustee of the transfer of units is the responsibility of the purchaser but in the normal course of business such notice is provided by the selling brokerdealer the trustee will periodically deduct from the income account of a trust and to the extent funds are not sufficient therein from the capital account of a trust amounts necessary to pay the expenses of a trust the trustee also may withdraw from said accounts such amounts if any as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of a trust amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a trusts assets until such time as the trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the appropriate accounts in addition the trustee may withdraw from the income and capital accounts of a trust such amounts as may be necessary to cover redemptions of units distribution reinvestment unitholders may elect to have distributions of capital including capital gains or dividends if any or both automatically invested into additional units of their trust without a sales fee your trust will pay any deferred sales fee per unit regardless of any sales fee discounts however if you elect to have distributions on your units reinvested into additional units of your trust you will be credited the amount of any remaining deferred sales charge on such additional units at the time of reinvestment unitholders who are receiving distributions in cash may elect to participate in distribution reinvestment by filing with the program agent an election to have such distributions reinvested without charge such election must be received by the program agent at least ten days prior to the record date applicable to any distribution in order to be in effect for such record date any such election shall remain in effect until a subsequent notice is received by the program agent the program agent is the bank of new york mellon all inquiries concerning participating in distribution reinvestment should be directed to the bank of new york mellon at its unit investment trust division office statements to unitholders with each distribution the trustee will furnish to each registered holder a statement of the amount of income and the amount of other receipts if any which are being distributed expressed in each case as a dollar amount per unit the accounts of a trust will not be audited annually unless the sponsor determines that such an audit would be in the best interest of the unitholders of the trust if an audit is conducted it will be done at the related trusts expense by independent public accountants designated by the sponsor the accountants report will be furnished by the trustee to any unitholder upon written request within a reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar year the trustee shall furnish to each person who at any time during the

unitholder will not operate to terminate a trust nor entitle legal representatives or heirs to claim an accounting or to bring any action or proceeding in any court for partition or winding up of a trust no unitholder shall have the right to control the operation and management of a trust in any manner except to vote with respect to the amendment of the trust agreement or termination of a trust amendment and termination the trust agreement may be amended by the trustee and the sponsor without the consent of any of the unitholders i to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision which may be defective or inconsistent ii to change any provision thereof as may be required by the securities and exchange commission or any successor governmental agency iii to make such provisions as shall not materially adversely affect the interests of the unitholders or iv to make such other amendments as may be necessary for a trust to qualify as a regulated investment company in the case of a trust which has elected to qualify as such the trust agreement with respect to any trust may also be amended in any respect by the sponsor and the trustee or any of the provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the holders of units representing   of the units then outstanding of the trust provided that no such amendment or waiver will reduce the interest of any unitholder thereof without the consent of such unitholder or reduce the percentage of units required to consent to any such amendment or waiver without the consent of all unitholders of the trust in no event shall the trust agreement be amended to increase the number of units of a trust issuable thereunder to permit the acquisition of any securities in addition to or in substitution for those initially deposited in the trust or to adversely affect the characterization of a trust as a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes except in accordance with the provisions of the trust agreement the trustee shall promptly notify unitholders of the substance of any such amendment the trust agreement provides that a trust shall terminate upon the liquidation redemption or other disposition of the last of the securities held in the trust but in no event is it to continue beyond the mandatory termination date set forth in part a of the prospectus if the value of a trust shall be less than the applicable minimum value stated in the prospectus the trustee may in its discretion and shall when so directed by the sponsor terminate the trust a trust may be terminated at any time by the holders of units representing   of the units thereof then outstanding in addition the sponsor may terminate a trust if it is based on a security index and the index is no longer maintained beginning nine business days prior to but no later than the mandatory termination date described in the prospectus the trustee may begin to sell all of the remaining underlying securities on behalf of unitholders in connection with the termination of the trust the sponsor may assist the trustee in these sales and receive compensation to the extent permitted by applicable law the sale proceeds will be net of any incidental expenses involved in the sales the trustee will attempt to sell the securities as quickly as it can during the termination proceedings without in its judgment materially adversely affecting the market price of the securities but it is expected that all of the securities will in any event be disposed of within a reasonable time after a trusts termination the sponsor does not anticipate that the period will be longer than one month and it could be as short as one day depending on the liquidity of the securities being sold the liquidity of any security depends on the daily trading volume of the security and the amount that the sponsor has available for sale on any particular day of course no assurances can be given that the market value of the securities will not be adversely affected during the termination proceedings within a reasonable period after termination the trustee will sell any securities remaining in a trust and after paying all expenses and charges incurred by the trust will distribute to unitholders thereof their pro rata share of the balances remaining in the income and capital accounts of the trust the sponsor currently intends but is not obligated to offer for sale units of a subsequent series of certain trusts at approximately one year after the inception date of such trusts if the sponsor does offer such units for sale unitholders may be given the opportunity to purchase such units at a public offering price which includes a reduced sales fee there is however no assurance that units of any new series of a trust

for assisting the sponsor in selecting the trusts portfolio and the initial fees and expenses of the trustee these costs will be deducted from a trust as of the end of the initial offering period or after six months at the discretion of the sponsor as indicated above the initial public offering price of the units was established by dividing the aggregate underlying value of the securities by the number of units outstanding such price determination as of the opening of business on the date a trust was created was made on the basis of an evaluation of the securities in the trust prepared by the evaluator after the opening of business on this date the evaluator will appraise or cause to be appraised daily the value of the underlying securities as of the close of the new york stock exchange on days the new york stock exchange is open and will adjust the public offering price of the units commensurate with such valuation such public offering price will be effective for all orders properly received at or prior to the close of trading on the new york stock exchange on each such day orders received by the trustee sponsor or any dealer for purchases sales or redemptions after that time or on a day when the new york stock exchange is closed will be held until the next determination of price the value of the securities is determined on each business day by the evaluator based on the closing sale prices on a national securities exchange or the nasdaq national market system or by taking into account the same factors referred to under computation of redemption price public distribution of units during the initial offering period units of a trust will be distributed to the public at the public offering price thereof upon the completion of the initial offering units which remain unsold or which may be acquired in the secondary market may be offered at the public offering price determined in the manner provided above the sponsor intends to qualify units of a trust for sale in a number of states units will be sold through dealers who are members of finra and through others brokerdealers and others will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with the distribution of units during the initial offering period as set forth in the prospectus certain commercial banks may be making units of a trust available to their customers on an agency basis furthermore as a result of certain legislative changes effective november  banks are no longer prohibited from certain affiliations with securities firms this new legislation grants banks new authority to conduct certain authorized activity such as sales of units through financial subsidiaries a portion of the sales charge discussed above is retained by or remitted to the banks or their financial subsidiaries for these agency and brokerage transactions the sponsor reserves the right to change the concessions or agency commissions set forth in the prospectus from time to time in addition to such concessions or agency commissions the sponsor may from time to time pay or allow additional concessions or agency commissions in the form of cash or other compensation to dealers employing registered representatives who sell during a specified time period a minimum dollar amount of units of unit investment trusts underwritten by the sponsor at various times the sponsor may implement programs under which the sales force of a broker or dealer may be eligible to win nominal awards for certain sales efforts or under which the sponsor will reallow to any such broker or dealer that sponsors sales contests or recognition programs conforming to criteria established by the sponsor or participates in sales programs sponsored by the sponsor an amount not exceeding the total applicable sales charges on the sales generated by such person at the public offering price during such programs also the sponsor in its discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective criteria established by the sponsor pay fees to qualifying brokers or dealers for certain services or activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of units of a trust such payments are made by the sponsor out of its own assets and not out of the assets of any trust these programs will not change the price unitholders pay for their units or the amount that a trust will receive from the units sold the difference between the discount and the sales charge will be retained by the sponsor the sponsor reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any order for the purchase of units sponsor profits the sponsor will receive gross sales fees equal to the percentage of the public offering price of the units of a trust described in the prospectus in addition the sponsor may realize a profit or sustain a loss as of the date a trust is created resulting from the difference between the purchase prices of the securities to the sponsor and the cost of such securities to the trust thereafter on subsequent deposits the sponsor may realize profits or sustain losses from such deposits the sponsor may realize additional profits or losses during the initial offering period on unsold units as a result of changes in the daily market value of the securities in the trust market for units after the initial offering period the sponsor may maintain a market for units of a trust offered hereby and continuously offer to purchase said units at prices determined by the evaluator based on the value of the underlying securities unitholders who wish to dispose of their units should inquire of their broker as to current market prices in order to determine whether there is in existence any price in excess of the redemption price and if so the amount thereof unitholders who sell or redeem units prior to such time as the entire deferred sales fee on such units has been collected will be assessed the amount of the remaining deferred sales fee at the time of such sale or redemption the offering price of any units resold by the sponsor will be in accord with that described in the currently effective prospectus describing such units any profit or loss resulting from the resale of such units will belong to the sponsor if the sponsor decides to maintain a secondary market it may suspend or discontinue purchases of units of the trust if the supply of units exceeds demand or for other

cash equivalent to the redemption price determined as set forth below under computation of redemption price as of the close of the new york stock exchange next following such tender multiplied by the number of units being redeemed any units redeemed shall be canceled and any undivided fractional interest in the related trust extinguished the price received upon redemption might be more or less than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of the securities in the trust at the time of redemption unitholders who sell or redeem units prior to such time as the entire deferred sales fee on such units has been collected will be assessed the amount of the remaining deferred sales fee at the time of such sale or redemption certain brokerdealers may charge a transaction fee for processing redemption requests under regulations issued by the internal revenue service the trustee is required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount of a unit redemption if the trustee has not been furnished the redeeming unitholders tax identification number in the manner required by such regulations any amount so withheld is transmitted to the internal revenue service and may be recovered by the unitholder only when filing a tax return under normal circumstances the trustee obtains the unitholders tax identification number from the selling broker however any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption such unitholder should make sure that the trustee has been provided a certified tax identification number in order to avoid this possible backup withholding in the event the trustee has not been previously provided such number one must be provided at the time redemption is requested any amounts paid on redemption representing unpaid dividends

the trust in book entry form to the account of the unitholders bank or brokerdealer at depository trust company the tendering unitholder shall be entitled to receive whole shares of each of the securities comprising the portfolio of the trust and cash from the capital account equal to the fractional shares to which the tendering unitholder is entitled the trustee shall make any adjustments

to cover the required cash distribution to the tendering unitholder the trustee may sell securities the inkind redemption option may be terminated by the sponsor at any time the trustee is empowered to sell securities in order to make funds available for the redemption of units to the extent that securities are sold or redeemed in kind the size of a trust will be and the diversity of a trust may be reduced but each remaining unit will continue to represent approximately the same proportional interest in each security sales may be required at a time when securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices than might otherwise be realized the price received upon redemption may be more or less than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of the securities

price per unit is the pro rata share of each unit in a trust determined generally on the basis of i the cash on hand in the trust or moneys in the process of being collected and ii the value of the securities in the trust less a amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges payable out of the trust b any amount owing to the trustee for its advances and c the accrued expenses or remaining deferred sales fees of the trust during the initial offering period the redemption price and the secondary market repurchase price will also include estimated organizational costs the evaluator may determine the value of the securities in the trust in the following manner if the securities are listed on a national or foreign securities exchange or the nasdaq national market system such evaluation shall generally be based on the last available sale price on or immediately prior to the evaluation time on the exchange or nasdaq national market system which is the principal market therefor which shall be deemed to be the new york stock exchange if the securities are listed thereon unless the evaluator deems such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation or if there is no such available sale price on such exchange at the last available bid prices offer prices for primary market purchases of the securities securities not listed on the new york stock exchange but principally traded on the nasdaq national market system will be valued at the nasdaq national market systems official closing price if the securities are not so listed or if so listed the principal market therefor is other than on such exchange or there is no such available sale price on such exchange such evaluation shall generally be based on the following methods or any combination thereof whichever the evaluator deems appropriate i on the basis of the current bid price offer prices for primary market purchases for comparable securities unless the evaluator deems such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation ii by determining the valuation of the securities on the bid side offer side for primary market purchases of the market by appraisal or iii by any combination of the above notwithstanding the foregoing the evaluator or its designee will generally value foreign securities primarily traded on foreign exchanges at their fair value which may be other than their market price if the trust holds securities denominated in a currency other than us dollars the evaluation of such security is based upon us dollars based on current bid side offer side for primary market purchases exchange rates unless the evaluator deems such prices inappropriate as a basis for valuation retirement plans a trust may be well suited for purchase by individual retirement accounts

the main us federal income tax consequences of owning units of the trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and opinion of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor assets of the trust the trust is expected to hold shares of stock in corporations the stocks that are treated as equity for federal income tax purposes it is possible that the trust will also hold other assets including assets that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those described above in which case you will have federal income tax consequences different from or in addition to those described in this section all of the assets held by the trust constitute the trust assets neither our counsel nor we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the trust assets and thus neither our counsel nor we have reached a conclusion regarding the federal income tax treatment of the trust assets trust status if your trust is at all times operated in accordance with the documents establishing the trust and certain requirements of federal income tax law are met the trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes as a unit owner you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of each of the trust assets and as such you will be considered to have received a pro rata share of income eg dividends and capital gains if any from each trust asset when such income would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned the trust assets this is true even if you elect to have your distributions reinvested into additional units in addition the income from trust assets that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or trust expenses under the health care and education reconciliation act of  income from the trust may also be subject to a new  medicare tax imposed for taxable years beginning after  this tax will generally apply to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts which are  in the case of married couples filing joint returns and  in the case of single individuals your tax basis and income or loss upon disposition if your trust disposes of trust assets you will generally recognize gain or loss if you dispose of your units or redeem your units for cash you will also generally recognize gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in the related trust assets from your share of the total amount received in the transaction you can generally determine your initial tax basis in each trust asset by apportioning the cost of your units including sales charges among the trust assets ratably according to their values on the date you acquire your units in certain circumstances however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you acquire your units for example in the case of certain dividends that exceed a corporations accumulated earnings and profits if you are an individual the maximum marginal stated federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  for taxpayers in the  tax bracket  for taxpayers in the    and  tax brackets and  for taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets capital gains may also be subject to the medicare tax described above net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code however treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations dividends from stocks certain dividends received with respect to the stocks may qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied dividends received deduction generally a domestic corporation owning units in a trust may be eligible for the dividends received deduction with respect to such unit owners pro rata portion of certain types of dividends received by the trust however a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received by the trust because the dividends received deduction is not available for dividends from most foreign corporations inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may request an inkind distribution of trust assets when you redeem your units at any time prior to  business days before your trusts termination however this ability to request an inkind distribution will terminate at any time that the number of outstanding units has been reduced to  or less of the highest number of units issued by the trust by electing to receive an inkind distribution you will receive trust assets plus possibly cash you will not recognize gain or loss if you only receive whole trust assets in exchange for the identical amount of your pro rata portion of the same trust assets held by your trust however if you also receive cash in exchange for a trust asset or a fractional portion of a trust asset you will generally recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the amount of cash you receive and your tax basis in such trust asset or fractional portion exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future series of the trust it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain and any loss will be treated as a capital loss however any loss you incur in connection with the exchange of your units of your trusts for units of the next series will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and subsequent deemed repurchase to the extent the two trusts have substantially identical trust assets under the wash sale provisions of the internal revenue code limitations on the deductibility of trust expenses generally for federal income tax purposes you must take into account your full pro rata share of your trusts income even if some of that income is used to pay trust expenses you may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your trust to the same extent as if you directly paid the expense you may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of your trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the extent they exceed  of adjusted gross income some individuals may also be subject to further limitations on the amount of their itemized deductions depending on their income foreign investors and taxes distributions by your trust that are treated as us source income eg dividends received on stocks of domestic corporations will generally be subject to us income taxation and withholding in the case of units held by nonresident alien individuals foreign corporations or other nonus persons subject to any applicable treaty if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes on some or all of the income from your trust or on any gain from the sale or redemption of your units provided that certain conditions are met you should consult your tax advisor with respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt for us tax purposes distributions in respect of units after june   may be subject to a us withholding tax of  in the case of distributions to i certain nonus financial institutions that have not entered into an agreement with the us treasury to collect and disclose certain information and are not resident in a jurisdiction that has entered into such an agreement with the us treasury and ii certain other nonus entities that do not provide certain certifications and information about the

thornton llp an independent registered public accounting firm as set forth in their report thereon appearing elsewhere herein and is included in reliance on such report given on the authority of such firm as experts in accounting and auditing description of ratings standard  poors issue credit ratings a standard  poors issue credit rating is a forwardlooking opinion about the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation a specific class of financial obligations or a specific financial program including ratings on mediumterm note programs and commercial paper programs it takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated the opinion reflects standard  poors view of the obligors capacity and willingness to meet its financial commitments as they come due and may assess terms such as collateral security and subordination which could affect ultimate payment in the event of default issue credit ratings can be either longterm or shortterm shortterm ratings are generally assigned to those obligations considered shortterm in the relevant market in the us for example that means obligations with an original maturity of no more than  days including commercial paper shortterm ratings are also used to indicate the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to put features on longterm obligations the result is a dual rating in which the shortterm rating addresses the put feature in addition to the usual longterm rating mediumterm notes are assigned longterm ratings the ratings and other credit related opinions of standard  poors and its affiliates are statements of opinion as of the date they are expressed and not statements of fact or recommendations to purchase hold or sell any securities or make any investment decisions standard  poors assumes no obligation to update any information following publication users of ratings and credit related opinions should not rely on them in making any investment decision standard  poors opinions and analyses do not address the suitability of any security standard  poors financial services llc does not act as a fiduciary or an investment advisor while standard  poors has obtained information from sources it believes to be reliable standard  poors does not perform an audit and undertakes no duty of due diligence or independent verification of any information it receives ratings and credit related opinions may be changed suspended or withdrawn at any time longterm issue credit ratings issue credit ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations o likelihood of paymentcapacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation o nature of and provisions of the obligation and o protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangement under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights issue ratings are an assessment of default risk but may incorporate an assessment of relative seniority or ultimate recovery in the event of default junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy as noted above such differentiation may apply when an entity has both senior and subordinated obligations secured and unsecured obligations or operating company and holding company obligations aaa an obligation rated aaa has the highest rating assigned by standard  poors the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong aa an obligation rated aa differs from the highestrated obligations only to a small degree the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong a an obligation rated a is somewhat susceptible to the adverse economic conditions and changes in circumstances bbb an obligation rated bbb exhibits adequate capacity to meet financial commitments but more subject to adverse economic condition bbb considered the lowest investmentgrade by market participants obligations rated bb b ccc cc and c are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics bb indicates the least degree of speculation and c the highest while such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions bb considered highest speculative grade by market participants bb an obligation rated bb is less vulnerable in the nearterm but faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial and economic conditions b an obligation rated b is more vulnerable to adverse business financial and economic conditions but currently has the capacity to meet financial commitments ccc an obligation rated ccc is currently vulnerable and dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions to meet its financial commitments cc an obligation rated cc is currently highly vulnerable c a c rating is assigned to obligations that are currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment obligations that have payment arrearages allowed by the terms of the documents or obligations of an issuer that is the subject of a bankruptcy petition or similar action which have not experienced a payment default among others the c rating may be assigned to subordinated debt preferred stock or other obligations on which cash payments have been suspended in accordance with the instruments terms or when preferred stock is the subject of a distressed exchange offer whereby some or all of the issue is either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other instruments having a total value that is less than par d an obligation rated d is in payment default the d rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired unless standard  poors believes that such payments will be made during such grace period the d rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on an obligation are jeopardized plus  or minus  the ratings from aa to ccc may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories nr this indicates that no rating has been requested that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating or that standard  poors does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy guggenheim defined portfolios guggenheim portfolio

seeks to provide current income and the potential for capital appreciation by investing in common shares of closedend investment companies closedend funds that are considered to be income funds what

include but are not limited to o highyield securities or junk bonds o convertible bonds o preferred securities o real estate investment trusts reits o corporate bonds o government bonds o international bonds and o equities principal investment strategy the trust will invest  of its assets in closedend funds that are considered to be income funds guggenheim funds through proprietary research and strategic alliances will strive to select closedend funds featuring the potential for current income diversification and overall liquidity see investment policies in part b of the prospectus for additional information security selection the sponsor has selected closedend funds for the portfolio believed to have the best potential to achieve the trusts investment objective the closedend funds portfolios consist primarily of incomeproducing securities including highyield securities or junk bonds convertible bonds preferred securities reits corporate bonds government bonds international bonds and equities when selecting closedend funds for inclusion in the portfolio the sponsor looks at numerous factors these factors include but are not limited to o investment objective the sponsor favors funds that have a clear investment objective in line with the trusts objective and based upon a review of publicly available information appear to be maintaining it o premiumdiscount the sponsor favors funds that are trading at a discount relative to their peers and relative to their longterm average o consistent dividend the sponsor favors funds that have a history of paying a consistent and competitive dividend o performance the sponsor favors funds that have a history of strong relative performance based on market price and net asset value when compared to their peers and an applicable index future trusts the sponsor intends to create future trusts that follow the same investment strategy one such trust is expected to be available

minimum investment all accounts  unit  principal risks as with all investments you may lose some or all of your investment in the trust no assurance can be given that the trusts investment objective will be achieved the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these o securities prices can be volatile the value of your investment may fall over time market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include stock market movements purchases or sales of securities by the trust government policies litigation and changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of the securities issuer or even perceptions of the issuer units of the trust are not deposits of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency o due to the current state of the economy the value of the securities held by the trust may be subject to steep declines or increased volatility due to changes in performance or perception of the issuers starting in december  economic activity declined across all sectors of the economy and the united states experienced increased unemployment the economic crisis affected the global economy with european and asian markets also suffering historic losses in addition standard  poors rating services lowered its longterm sovereign credit rating on the united states to aa from aaa effects of the economic crisis can still be felt in many countries around the world and may have an impact on the securities held by the trust o the trust includes closedend funds closedend funds are actively managed investment companies that invest in various types of securities closedend funds issue common shares that are traded on a securities exchange closedend funds are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the closedend funds investment objective and to manage the closedend funds portfolio during periods of market turmoil and as investors perceptions regarding closedend funds or their underlying investments change closedend funds are not redeemable at the option of the shareholder and they may trade in the market at a discount to their net asset value closedend funds may also employ the use of leverage which increases risk and volatility instability in the auction rate preferred shares market may affect the volatility of closedend funds that use such instruments to provide leverage o the closedend funds are subject to annual fees and expenses including a management fee unitholders of the trust will bear these fees in addition to the fees and expenses of the trust see fees and expenses for additional information o the value of the fixedincome securities in the closedend funds will generally fall if interest rates in general rise typically fixedincome securities with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes o a closedend fund or an issuer of securities held by a closedend fund may be unwilling or unable to make principal payments andor to declare distributions in the future may call a security before its stated maturity or may reduce the level of distributions declared this may result in a reduction in the value of your units o the financial condition of a closedend fund or an issuer of securities held by a closedend fund may worsen resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the primary offering period o certain closedend funds held by the trust invest in preferred securities preferred securities are typically subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a companys capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and therefore will be subject to greater credit risk than those debt instruments o certain closedend funds held by the trust invest in securities that are rated below investmentgrade and are considered to be junk securities below investmentgrade obligations are considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks and accordingly the risk of nonpayment or default is higher than with investmentgrade securities in addition such securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes and more likely to receive early returns of principal o certain closedend funds held by the trust may invest in securities that are rated as investmentgrade by only one rating agency as a result such splitrated securities may have more speculative characteristics and are subject to a greater risk of default than securities rated as investmentgrade by more than one rating agency o certain closedend funds held by the trust invest in convertible securities convertible securities generally offer lower interest or dividend yields than nonconvertible fixedincome securities of similar credit quality because of the potential for capital appreciation the market values of convertible securities tend to decline as interest rates increase and conversely to increase as interest rates decline however a convertible securitys market value also tends to reflect the market price of the common stock of the issuing company particularly when that stock price is greater than the convertible securitys conversion price convertible securities fall below debt obligations of the same issuer in order of preference or priority in the event of a liquidation and are typically unrated or rated lower than such debt obligations o certain closedend funds held by the trust invest in call options the call writing portion of the investment strategy of the closedend funds may not be successful in that the closedend funds may not realize the full appreciation of stocks on which the closedend funds have written call options the ability to successfully implement the closedend funds investment strategy depends on the closedend funds advisers ability to predict pertinent market movements which cannot be assured o the value of a call option held by a closedend fund may be adversely affected if the market for the option becomes less liquid or smaller the value of an option will be affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of the stock subject to the option an increase in interest rates a change in the actual and perceived volatility of the stock market and the common stock and the remaining time to expiration o certain closedend funds held by the trust invest in foreign securities investment in foreign securities presents additional risk foreign risk is the risk that foreign securities will be more volatile than us securities due to such factors as adverse economic currency political social or regulatory developments in a country including government seizure of assets excessive taxation limitations on the use or transfer of assets the lack of liquidity or regulatory controls with respect to certain industries or differing legal andor accounting standards o certain closedend funds held by the trust invest in securities issued by companies headquartered or incorporated in countries considered to be emerging markets emerging markets are generally defined as countries with low per capita income in the initial stages of their industrialization cycles risks of investing in developing or emerging countries include the possibility of investment and trading limitations liquidity concerns delays and disruptions in settlement transactions political uncertainties and dependence on international trade and development assistance companies headquartered in emerging market countries may be exposed to greater volatility and market risk o certain closedend funds held by the trust may invest in reits and other real estate securities reits may concentrate their investments in specific geographic areas or in specific property types such as hotels shopping malls residential complexes and office buildings the value of the reit and the ability of the reit to distribute income may be adversely affected by several factors including rising interest rates changes in the national state and local economic climate and real estate conditions perceptions of prospective tenants about the safety convenience and attractiveness of the properties the ability of the owner to provide adequate management maintenance and insurance the cost of complying with the americans with disabilities act increased competition from new properties the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws changes in real estate taxes and other operating expenses adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies adverse changes in zoning laws declines in the value of real estate the downturn in the subprime mortgage lending market and the real estate markets in the united states and other factors beyond the control of the issuer of the reit o certain closedend funds held by the trust invest in common stocks common stocks represent a proportional share of ownership in a company common stock prices fluctuate for several reasons including changes in investors perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer changes in the general condition of the relevant stock market such as the market volatility recently exhibited or when political or economic events affect the issuers common stock prices may also be particularly sensitive to rising interest rates as the cost of capital rises and borrowing costs increase o certain closedend funds held by the trust may invest in securities issued by smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies these securities customarily involve more investment risk than securities of largecapitalization companies smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments o certain closedend funds held by the trust may invest in senior loans borrowers under senior loans may default on their obligations to pay principal or interest when due this nonpayment would result in a reduction of income to the applicable closedend fund a reduction in the value of the senior loan experiencing nonpayment and a decrease in the net asset value of the closedend fund although senior loans in which the closedend funds invest may be secured by specific collateral there can be no assurance that liquidation of collateral would satisfy the borrowers obligation in the event of nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest or that such collateral could be readily liquidated senior loans in which the closedend funds invest  generally are of below investmentgrade credit quality  may be unrated at the time of investment  generally are not registered with the securities and exchange commission sec or any state securities commission and  generally are not listed on any securities exchange in addition the amount of public information available on senior loans generally is less extensive than that available for other types of assets o economic conditions may lead to limited liquidity and greater volatility the markets for fixedincome securities such as those held by certain closedend funds may experience periods of illiquidity and volatility general market uncertainty and consequent repricing risk have led to market imbalances of sellers and buyers which in turn have resulted in significant valuation uncertainties in a variety of fixedincome securities these conditions resulted and in many cases continue to result in greater volatility less liquidity widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency with many debt securities remaining illiquid and of uncertain value these market conditions may make valuation of some of the securities held by a closedend fund uncertain andor result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in its holdings o inflation may lead to a decrease in the value of assets or income from investments o the sponsor does not actively manage the portfolio the trust will generally hold and may when creating additional units continue to buy the same securities even though a securitys outlook market value or yield may have changed see investment risks in part a of the prospectus and risk factors in part b of the prospectus for additional information who should invest you should consider this investment if o you want current income and asset class diversification o the trust represents only a portion of your overall investment portfolio and o the trust is part of a longer term investment strategy that may include investment in subsequent trusts if available you should not consider this investment if o you are unwilling to accept the risks involved with owning closedend funds o you are uncomfortable with the risks of an unmanaged investment in securities o you are seeking capital preservation as a primary investment objective or o you are seeking a shortterm investment or an investment to be used as a trading vehicle fees and expenses the amounts below are estimates of the direct and indirect expenses that you may incur based on a  unit price actual expenses may vary percentage of public amount per offering  investor fees price  invested    initial sales fee paid on purchase    deferred sales fee    creation and development fee      maximum sales fees including creation and development fee     estimated organization costs amount per  units paid by the trust at the end of the initial offering period or after six months at the discretion of the sponsor   approximate annual fund  of public operating offering amount per expenses price   units    trustees fee    sponsors supervisory fee   evaluators fee   bookkeeping and administrative fee   estimated other trust operating expenses    estimated closedend fund expenses      total      the initial sales fee provided above is based on the unit price on the inception date because the initial sales fee equals the difference between the maximum sales fee and the sum of the remaining deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee cd fee as described below the percentage and dollar amount of the initial sales fee will vary as the unit price varies and after deferred fees begin despite the variability of the initial sales fee each investor is obligated to pay the entire applicable maximum sales fee  the deferred sales fee is fixed at  per unit and is deducted in monthly installments of  per unit on the last business day of february  and march  and  per unit on the last business day of april  the percentage provided is based on a  per unit public offering price as of the inception date and the percentage amount will vary over time if units are redeemed prior to the deferred sales fee period the entire deferred sales fee will be collected  the cd fee compensates the sponsor for creating and developing your trust the actual cd fee is  per unit and is paid to the sponsor at the close of the initial offering period which is expected to be approximately three months from the inception date the percentages provided are based on a  unit as of the inception date and the percentage amount will vary over time if the unit price exceeds  per unit the cd fee will be less than  of the public offering price if the unit price is less than  per unit the cd fee will exceed  of the public offering price however in no event will the maximum sales fee exceed  of a unitholders initial investment  based on  units with a  per unit public offering price as of the inception date  the estimated trust operating expenses are based upon an estimated trust size of approximately  million because certain of the operating expenses are fixed amounts if the trust does not reach such estimated size or falls below the estimated size over its life the actual amount of the operating expenses may exceed the amounts reflected in some cases the actual amount of the operating expenses may greatly exceed the amounts reflected other operating expenses do not include brokerage costs and other transactional fees  although not an actual trust operating expense the trust and therefore the unitholders of the trust will indirectly bear similar operating expenses of the closedend funds held by the trust in the estimated amount provided above estimated closedend fund expenses are based upon the net asset value of the number of closedend fund shares held by the trust per unit multiplied by the annual operating expenses of the closedend funds for the most recent fiscal year unitholders will therefore indirectly pay higher expenses than if the underlying closedend funds were held directly please note that the sponsor or an affiliate may be engaged as a service provider to certain closedend funds held by your trust and therefore certain fees paid by your trust to such closedend funds will be paid to the sponsor or an affiliate for its services to such closedend funds example this example helps you compare the costs of this trust with other unit trusts and mutual funds in the example we assume that you reinvest your investment in a new trust every year at a reduced sales charge the trusts operating expenses do not change and the trusts annual return is  your actual returns and expenses will vary based on these assumptions you would pay these expenses for every  you invest  year    years   years   years  these amounts are the same regardless of whether you sell your investment at the end of a period or continue to hold your investment the example does not consider any brokerage fees or transaction fees that brokerdealers may charge for processing redemption requests see expenses of the trust in part

see administration of the trust in part b of the prospectus for additional information investment risks all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of the securities in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest you could lose some or all of your investment in your trust recently equity markets have experienced significant volatility if the value of the closedend funds in your trust falls the value of your units will also fall we cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security in your trust the trust itself or securities in general may fall in value market value may be affected by a variety of factors including o general securities markets movements o changes in the financial condition of an issuer or a sector o changes in perceptions about an issuer or a sector o interest rates and inflation o governmental policies and litigation and o purchases and sales of securities by the trust even though we carefully supervise your portfolio you should remember that we do not manage your portfolio your trust will not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund current economic conditions risk the us economys recession began in december  this recession began with problems in the housing and credit markets many of which were caused by defaults on subprime mortgages and mortgagebacked securities eventually leading to the failures of some large financial institutions economic activity declined across all sectors of the economy and the united states experienced increased unemployment the economic crisis affected the global economy with european and asian markets also suffering historic losses in addition standard  poors rating services lowered its longterm sovereign credit rating on the united states to aa from aaa effects of the economic crisis can still be felt in many countries around the world and may have an impact on the securities held by the trust closedend fund risk the trust invests in closedend funds closedend funds are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the closedend funds investment objective and to manage the closedend funds portfolio during periods of market turmoil and as investors perceptions regarding closedend funds or their underlying investments change shares of closedend funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of closedend fund shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors certain closedend funds included in the may employ the use of leverage in their portfolios through the issuance of preferred stock while leverage often serves to increase the yield of a closedend fund this leverage also subjects the closedend fund to increased risks including the likelihood of increased volatility and the possibility that the closedend funds common share income will fall if the dividend rate on the preferred shares or the interest rate on any borrowings rises instability in the auction rate preferred shares market may affect the volatility of closedend funds that use such instruments to provide leverage in addition closedend funds are subject to their own annual fees and expenses including a management fee such fees reduce the potential benefits associated with owning a closedend fund and are in addition to your trusts expenses interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the value of securities held by a closedend fund in your trust will decline in value because of a rise in interest rates generally securities that pay fixed rates of return will increase in value when interest rates decline and decrease in value when interest rates rise typically securities that pay fixed rates of return with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes credit and dividend payment risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security or a closedend fund is unable or unwilling to make dividend andor principal payments highyield or junk securities that are rated below investmentgrade are generally more susceptible to this risk than investmentgrade securities call risk call risk is the risk that securities held by a closedend fund in your trust can be prepaid or called by the issuer before their stated maturity if securities are called your income will decline and you may not be able to reinvest the money you receive at as high a yield also an early call at par of a security trading at a premium will reduce your return securities held by your trust are more likely to be called when interest rates decline this would result in early returns of principal to the closedend funds in your trust the securities may also be subject to special or extraordinary call provisions and mandatory put features that may cause the securities to be removed from a fund prior to maturity or stated call dates highyield or junk securities that are rated below investmentgrade are generally more susceptible to this risk than investmentgrade securities security quality risk security quality risk is the risk that a reduction in a securitys rating may decrease its value the value of a closedend fund and the value of your investment in your trust securities ratings may be reduced at any time including during the primary offering period of your trust highyield securities risk certain closedend funds held by the trust invest in highyield securities highyield high risk securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher investment ratings the value of these securities will decline significantly with increases in interest rates not only because an increase in rates generally decreases values but also because increased rates may indicate an economic slowdown an economic slowdown or a reduction in an issuers creditworthiness may affect an issuers ability to make dividend payments highyield or junk securities the general names for securities rated below investmentgrade are frequently issued by corporations in the growth stage of their development or by established companies who are highly leveraged or whose operations or industries are depressed obligations rated below investmentgrade should be considered speculative as these ratings indicate a quality of less than investmentgrade because highyield securities are generally subordinated obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier than higher rated securities their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated securities and are affected by shortterm credit developments to a greater degree the market for highyield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investmentgrade securities highyield securities are generally not listed on a national securities exchange but trade in the overthecounter markets due to the smaller less liquid market for highyield securities the bidoffer spread on such securities is generally greater than it is for investmentgrade securities and the purchase or sale of such securities may take longer to complete splitratings risk splitrated securities are those securities that at the time of investment are rated below investmentgrade by one rating agency so long as at least one other rating agency rates such securities within the four highest grades ie investmentgrade quality this means that a splitrated security may be regarded by one rating agency as having predominately speculative characteristics with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal and accordingly subject to a greater risk of default the prices of splitrated securities in the view of one but not all rating agencies may be more sensitive than securities without a splitrating to negative developments such as a decline in the issuers revenues or a general economic downturn foreign securities risk certain closedend funds held by the trust invest in foreign securities securities of foreign issuers present risks beyond those of domestic securities the prices of foreign securities can be more volatile than us securities due to such factors as political social and economic developments abroad the differences between the regulations to which us and foreign issuers and markets are subject the seizure by the government of company assets excessive taxation withholding taxes on dividends and interest limitations on the use or transfer of portfolio assets and political or social instability other risks include the following o enforcing legal rights may be difficult costly and slow in foreign countries and there may be special problems enforcing claims against foreign governments o foreign issuers may not be subject to accounting standards or governmental supervision comparable to us issuers and there may be less public information about their operations o foreign markets may be less liquid and more volatile than us markets o foreign securities often trade in currencies other than the us dollar changes in currency exchange rates may affect a closedend funds net asset value the value of dividends and interest earned and gains and losses realized on the sale of securities an increase in the strength of the us dollar relative to these other currencies may cause the value of a closedend fund to decline certain foreign currencies may be particularly volatile and foreign governments may intervene in the currency markets causing a decline in value or liquidity in a closedend funds foreign security holdings o future political and governmental restrictions which might adversely affect the payment or receipt of income on the foreign securities emerging market risk certain closedend funds held by the trust invest in securities issued by companies headquartered or incorporated in countries considered to be emerging markets risks of investing in developing or emerging countries include the possibility of investment and trading limitations liquidity concerns delays and disruptions in settlement transactions political uncertainties and dependence on international trade and development assistance in addition emerging market countries may be subject to overburdened infrastructures obsolete financial systems and environmental problems for these reasons investments in emerging markets are often considered speculative convertible securities risk certain closedend funds held by the trust invest in convertible securities convertible securities generally offer lower interest or dividend yields than nonconvertible fixedincome securities of similar credit quality because of the potential for capital appreciation the market values of convertible securities tend to decline as interest rates increase and conversely to increase as interest rates decline however a convertible securitys market value also tends to reflect the market price of the common stock of the issuing company particularly when that stock price is greater than the convertible securitys conversion price the conversion price is defined as the predetermined price or exchange ratio at which the convertible security can be converted or exchanged for the underlying common stock as the market price of the underlying common stock declines below the conversion price the price of the convertible security tends to be increasingly influenced more by the yield of the convertible security thus it may not decline in price to the same extent as the underlying common stock in the event of a liquidation of the issuing company holders of convertible securities would be paid before that companys common stockholders consequently an issuers convertible securities generally entail less risk than its common stock however convertible securities fall below debt obligations of the same issuer in order of preference or priority in the event of a liquidation and are typically unrated or rated lower than such debt obligations mandatory convertible securities are distinguished as a subset of convertible securities because the conversion is not optional and the conversion price at maturity is based solely upon the market price of the underlying common stock which may be significantly less than par or the price above or below par paid for these reasons the risks associated with investing in mandatory convertible securities most closely resemble the risks inherent in common stocks mandatory convertible securities customarily pay a higher coupon yield to compensate for the potential risk of additional price volatility and loss upon conversion because the market price of a mandatory convertible security increasingly corresponds to the market price of its underlying common stock as the convertible security approaches its conversion date there can be no assurance that the higher coupon will compensate for a potential loss preferred securities risk certain closedend funds held by the trust invest in preferred securities such as preferred stock and trust preferred securities similar to bonds preferred stocks typically offer a fixed rate of return paid in the form of a dividend like common stock most preferred stocks are equity securities representing ownership in a company preferred stocks are generally considered senior securities and preferred stockholders enjoy preference over common stockholders with regard to dividends and liquidations for the prospect of a higher yield preferred stockholders may forfeit or at least be limited in their voting rights preferred stocks are generally traded on major stock exchanges preferred securities are typically subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a companys capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and therefore will be subject to greater credit risk than those debt instruments trust preferred securities are limitedlife securities typically issued by corporations generally in the form of interestbearing notes or preferred securities or by an affiliated business trust of a corporation generally in the form of beneficial interests in subordinated debentures issued by the corporation or similarly structured securities dividend payments of the trust preferred securities generally coincide with interest payments on the underlying obligations trust preferred securities and the underlying subordinated debentures typically rank senior to the companys common and preferred stock and junior to the companys senior debt subordinated debt and other indebtedness in addition to the risks set forth above these securities are also subject to the following risks o trust preferred securities are designed to create the same business risk for an investor as if the investor had bought the securities underlying the trust preferred securities a corporations ability to pay distributions on the trust preferred securities is generally dependent on whether the corporation issuing the securities is able to pay interest on the underlying securities o unitholders have no right to accelerate the trust preferred securities or the underlying securities for nonpayment o a corporation issuing the underlying securities may elect to defer interest payments on those securities at any time during the life of the trust preferred securities for up to  consecutive quarters if such an election is made distributions on the trust preferred securities will not be made during the deferral period during any deferral period investors may be taxed as if the trust had received current income in such a case unitholders will have income taxes due but will not have received income distributions to pay the taxes o tax or regulatory changes may change the tax characterization of the preferred securities or the underlying securities and as a result may effect the value of your units o preferred securities may be subject to redemption after a certain call date or as a result of certain tax or regulatory events this may occur prior to maturity options risk the value of an option held by certain closedend funds in the trust may be adversely affected if the market for the option becomes less liquid or smaller and will be affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of the stock subject to the option an increase in interest rates a change in the actual and perceived volatility of the stock market and the common stock and the remaining time to expiration additionally the value of an option does not increase or decrease at the same rate as the underlying stock although they generally move in the same direction however as an option approaches its expiration date its value increasingly moves with the price of the stock subject to an option the strike price for an option may be adjusted downward before an option expiration triggered by certain corporate events affecting that stock a downward adjustment to the strike price will have the effect of reducing the equity appreciation option strike prices may be adjusted to reflect certain corporate events such as extraordinary dividends stock splits merger or other extraordinary distributions or events if the value of the underlying stock exceeds the strike price of an option it is likely that the holder of that option will exercise their right to purchase the stock the call writing portion of the investment strategy of a closedend fund may not be successful in that the closedend fund may not realize the full appreciation of stocks on which such closedend fund has written call options many of the closedend funds held in your trust will invest using a covered call option strategy or similar incomeoriented investment strategies you should understand the risks of these strategies before you invest in employing a covered call strategy a closedend fund will generally write sell call options on a significant portion of the closedend funds managed assets these call options will give the option holder the right but not the obligation to purchase a security from the closedend fund at the strike price on or prior to the options expiration date the ability to successfully implement the closedend funds investment strategy depends on the closedend fund advisers ability to predict pertinent market movements which cannot be assured thus the use of options may require a closedend fund to sell portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices other than current market values may limit the amount of appreciation the closedend fund can realize on an investment or may cause the closedend fund to hold a security that it might otherwise sell the writer seller of an option has no control over the time when it may be required to fulfill its obligation as a writer seller of the option once an option writer seller has received an exercise notice it cannot effect a closing purchase transaction in order to terminate its obligation under the option and must deliver the underlying security at the exercise price as the writer seller of a covered call option a closedend fund forgoes during the options life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the security underlying the call option above the sum of the premium and the strike price of the call option but has retained the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security decline the value of the options written sold by a closedend fund which will be markedtomarket on a daily basis will be affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of the underlying securities an increase in interest rates changes in the actual or perceived volatility of securities markets and the underlying securities and the remaining time to the options expiration an option is generally considered covered if the closedend fund owns the security underlying the call option or has an absolute and immediate right to acquire that security without additional cash consideration or if required cash or other liquid assets are segregated by the fund upon conversion or exchange of other securities held by the closedend fund in certain cases a call option may also be considered covered if a closedend fund holds a call option on the same security as the call option written sold provided that certain conditions are met by writing selling covered call options a closedend fund generally seeks to generate income in the form of the premiums received for writing selling the call options investment income paid by a closedend fund to its shareholders such as the trust may be derived primarily from the premiums it receives from writing selling call options and to a lesser extent from the dividends and interest it receives from the equity securities or other investments held in the closedend funds portfolio and shortterm gains thereon premiums from writing selling call options and dividends and interest payments made by the securities in a closedend funds portfolio can vary widely over time reit risk certain closedend funds held by the trust may invest primarily in reits and other real estate securities reits may concentrate their investments in specific geographic areas or in specific property types such as hotels shopping malls residential complexes and office buildings the value of the reit and the ability of the reit to distribute income may be adversely affected by several factors including rising interest rates changes in the national state and local economic climate and real estate conditions perceptions of prospective tenants about the safety convenience and attractiveness of the properties the ability of the owner to provide adequate management maintenance and insurance increased competition from new properties the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws changes in real estate taxes and other operating expenses adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies adverse changes in zoning laws declines in the value of real estate and other factors beyond the control of the issuer of the reit the value of a reit may also be affected by the downturn in the subprime mortgage lending market in the united states subprime loans have higher defaults and losses than prime loans subprime loans also have higher serious delinquency rates than prime loans the downturn in the subprime mortgage lending market may have farreaching consequences into many aspects and geographic regions of the real estate business and consequently the value of the portfolio may decline in response to such developments limited liquidity and volatility risk the markets for fixedincome securities such as those held by certain closedend funds held by your trust may experience periods of illiquidity and volatility general market uncertainty and consequent repricing risk have led to market imbalances of sellers and buyers which in turn have resulted in significant valuation uncertainties in a variety of fixedincome securities these conditions resulted and in many cases continue to result in greater volatility less liquidity widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency with many debt securities remaining illiquid and of uncertain value these market conditions may make valuation of some of the securities held by a closedend fund uncertain andor result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in its holdings in addition illiquidity and volatility in the credit markets may directly and adversely affect the setting of dividend rates on the shares of the closedend funds senior loan risk certain closedend funds held by the trust may invest in senior loans senior loans in which the closedend funds invest o generally are of below investmentgrade credit quality o may be unrated at the time of investment o generally are not registered with the sec or any state securities commission and o generally are not listed on any securities exchange the amount of public information available on senior loans generally will be less extensive than that available for other types of assets no reliable active trading market currently exists for many senior loans although a secondary market for certain senior loans has developed over the past several years senior loans are thus relatively illiquid liquidity relates to the ability of a closedend fund to sell an investment in a timely manner at a price approximately equal to its value on the closedend funds books the illiquidity of senior loans may impair a closedend funds ability to realize the full value of its assets in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation of such assets because of the lack of an active trading market illiquid securities are also difficult to value and prices provided by external pricing services may not reflect the true value of the securities however many senior loans are of a large principal amount and are held by a large number of financial institutions to the extent that a secondary market does exist for certain senior loans the market may be subject to irregular trading activity wide bidask spreads and extended trade settlement periods the market for senior loans could be disrupted in the event of an economic downturn or a substantial increase or decrease in interest rates this could result in increased volatility in the market and in your trusts net asset value if legislation or state or federal regulators impose additional requirements or restrictions on the ability of financial institutions to make loans that are considered highly leveraged transactions the availability of senior loans for investment by the closedend funds may be adversely affected in addition such requirements or restrictions could reduce or eliminate sources of financing for certain borrowers this would increase the risk of default if legislation or federal or state regulators require financial institutions to dispose of senior loans that are considered highly leveraged transactions or subject such senior loans to increased regulatory scrutiny financial institutions may determine to sell such senior loans such sales could result in depressed prices if a closedend fund attempts to sell a senior loan at a time when a financial institution is engaging in such a sale the price a closedend fund could get for the senior loan may be adversely affected some senior loans are subject to the risk that a court pursuant to fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws could subordinate the senior loans to presently existing or future indebtedness of the borrower or take other action detrimental to lenders such court action could under certain circumstances include invalidation of senior loans any lender which could include a closedend fund is subject to the risk that a court could find the lender liable for damages in a claim by a borrower arising under the common laws of tort or contracts or antifraud provisions of certain securities laws for actions taken or omitted to be taken by the lenders under the relevant terms of a loan agreement or in connection with actions with respect to the collateral underlying the senior loan smallcapitalization and midcapitalization company risk certain closedend funds held by the trust may include securities issued by smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies these securities customarily involve more investment risk than largecapitalization companies these additional risks are due in part to the following factors smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies may o have limited product lines markets or financial resources o be new and developing companies which seek to develop and utilize new andor emerging technologies these technologies may be slow to develop or fail to develop altogether o have less publicly available information o lack management depth or experience o be less liquid o be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments and o be dependent upon products that were recently brought to market or key personnel o be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments and o be dependent upon products that were recently brought to market or key personnel litigation and legislation risk your trust is also subject to litigation and legislation risk from time to time various legislative initiatives are proposed in the united states and abroad which may have a negative impact on certain issuers represented in your trust in addition litigation regarding any of the issuers of the securities or of the sectors represented by these issuers may raise potential bankruptcy concerns and may negatively impact the share prices of these securities we cannot predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation or any bankruptcy concerns will have on the share prices of the securities inflation risk inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money significant unitholders risk there may be unitholders of the trust who hold a significant portion of the trust and as result a redemption by such significant holder may have a material impact on the size expenses and viability of the trust see risk factors in part b of the prospectus for additional information how the trust works your trust your trust is a unit investment trust registered under the investment company act of  and

trustee will vote the securities and will endeavor to vote the securities such that the securities are voted as closely as possible in the same manner and the same general proportion as are the securities held by owners other than your trust however the trustee may not be able to vote the securities in your trust that are traded on foreign exchanges your trust will generally reject any offer for securities or property other than cash in exchange for the securities in its portfolio however if a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger or acquisition has been announced

will distribute any cash proceeds to unitholders if your trust receives securities or property other than cash it may either hold the securities or property in its portfolio or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds for example this could happen in a merger or similar transaction only the trustee may vote the shares of the closedend funds held in your trust the trustee will vote the shares in the same general proportion as the shares held by other shareholders of each closedend fund we will increase the size of your trust as we sell units when we create additional units

invested at all times which may impact the trusts performance when your trust buys securities it will pay brokerage or other acquisition fees you could experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and fluctuations in security prices between the time we create units and the time your trust buys the securities when your trust buys or sells securities we may direct that it place orders with and pay brokerage commissions to brokers that sell units or are affiliated with your trust we will not select firms to handle these transactions on the basis of their sale of units of a

and pricing of units  taxes  experts  description of ratings  general information each trust is one of a series of separate unit investment trusts created under the name guggenheim defined portfolios and registered under the investment company act of  and the securities act of  each trust was created as a common law trust on the inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of new york each trust was created under a trust agreement among guggenheim funds distributors llc as sponsor evaluator and supervisor and the bank of new york mellon as trustee when your trust was created the sponsor delivered to the trustee securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the trust after your trust is created the sponsor may deposit additional securities in the trust contracts to purchase additional securities along with cash or a bank letter of credit in lieu of cash to pay for such contracted securities or cash including a letter of credit with instructions to purchase additional securities such additional deposits will be in amounts which will seek to replicate as closely as practicable the portfolio immediately prior to such deposits if the sponsor deposits cash existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust will pay the associated brokerage fees a trust consists of a the securities listed under trust portfolio in the prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust b any additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions of the trust agreement and c any cash held in the accounts of the trust neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of the securities however should any contract for the purchase of any of the securities initially deposited in a trust fail the sponsor will unless substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement refund the cash and sales charge attributable to such failed contract to all unitholders on the next distribution date investment policies the trust is a unit investment trust and is not an actively managed fund traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic financial and market analysis the portfolio of a trust however will not be actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio unitholders will not be able to dispose of or vote any of the securities in a trust as the holder of the securities the trustee will vote the securities and will endeavor to vote the securities such that the securities are voted as closely as possible in the same manner and the same general proportion as are the securities held by owners other than such trust however the trustee may not be able to vote the securities in a trust that are traded on foreign exchanges the trust agreement provides that the sponsor may but need not direct the trustee to dispose of a security in certain events such as the issuer having defaulted on the payment on any of its outstanding obligations the issuer having qualified as a passive foreign investment company under the internal revenue code or the price of a security has declined to such an extent or other such credit factors exist so that in the opinion of the sponsor the retention of such securities would be detrimental to the trust if a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger or acquisition has been announced affecting a security the trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer for cash if the supervisor determines that the sale or tender is in the best interest of unitholders the trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to unitholders pursuant to the trust agreement and with limited exceptions the trustee may sell any securities or other properties acquired in exchange for securities such as those acquired in connection with a merger or other transaction if offered such new or exchanged securities or property other than cash the trustee shall reject the offer however in the event such securities or property are nonetheless acquired by the trust they may be accepted for deposit in a trust and either sold by the trustee or held in a trust pursuant to the direction of the sponsor proceeds from the sale of securities or any securities or other property received by the trust in exchange for securities are credited to the capital account for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions except as stated in the trust agreement or in the prospectus the acquisition by the trust of any securities other than the portfolio securities is prohibited the trustee may sell securities designated by the sponsor from the trust for the purpose of redeeming units of a trust tendered for redemption and the payment of expenses and for such other purposes as permitted under the trust agreement notwithstanding the foregoing the trustee is authorized to reinvest any funds held in the capital or income accounts pending distribution in us treasury obligations which mature on or before the next applicable distribution date any obligations so acquired must be held until they mature and proceeds therefrom may not be reinvested proceeds from the sale of securities or any securities or other property received by a trust in exchange for securities are credited to the capital account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions except for failed securities and as provided in the prospectus or in the trust agreement the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the portfolio securities is prohibited the trustee may sell securities from a trust for limited purposes including redeeming units tendered for redemption and the payment of expenses risk factors stocks an investment in units of a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an investment in equity securities including the risk that the financial condition of issuers of the securities may become impaired or that the general condition of the stock market may worsen both of which may contribute directly to a decrease in the value of the securities and thus in the value of the units or the risk that holders of common stock have a right to receive payments from the issuers of those stocks that is generally inferior to that of creditors of or holders of debt obligations issued by the issuers and that the rights of holders of common stock generally rank inferior to the rights of holders of preferred stock you could lose some or all of your investment in the trust common stocks are especially susceptible to general stock market movements and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of the issuers change these perceptions are based on unpredictable factors including expectations regarding government economic monetary and fiscal policies inflation and interest rates economic expansion or contraction and global or regional political economic or banking crises holders of common stock incur more risk than the holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations because common stockholders as owners of the entity have generally inferior rights to receive payments from the issuer in comparison with the rights of creditors of or holders of debt obligations or preferred stock issued by the issuer holders of common stock of the type held by a trust have a right to receive dividends only when and if and in the amounts declared by the issuers board of directors and to participate in amounts available for distribution by the issuer only after all other claims on the issuer have been paid or provided for by contrast holders of preferred stock have the right to receive dividends at a fixed rate when and as declared by the issuers board of directors normally on a cumulative basis but do not participate in other amounts available for distribution by the issuing corporation cumulative preferred stock dividends must be paid before common stock dividends and any cumulative preferred stock dividend omitted is added to future dividends payable to the holders of cumulative preferred stock preferred stocks are also entitled to rights on liquidation which are senior to those of common stocks moreover common stocks do not represent an obligation of the issuer and therefore do not offer any assurance of income or provide the degree of protection of capital debt securities indeed the issuance of debt securities or even preferred stock will create prior claims for payment of principal interest liquidation preferences and dividends which could adversely affect the ability and inclination of the issuer to declare or pay dividends on its common stock or the rights of holders of common stock with respect to assets of the issuer upon liquidation or bankruptcy further unlike debt securities which typically have a stated principal amount payable at maturity whose value however will be subject to market fluctuations prior thereto common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity and have values which are subject to market fluctuations for as long as the stocks remain outstanding the value of the securities in a portfolio thus may be expected to fluctuate over the entire life of a trust to values higher or lower than those prevailing at the time of purchase the sponsors buying and selling of the securities especially during the initial offering of units of the trust or to satisfy redemptions of units may impact upon the value of the underlying securities and the units the publication of the list of the securities selected for the trust may also cause increased buying activity in certain of the stocks comprising the portfolio after such announcement investment advisory and brokerage clients of the sponsor and its affiliates may purchase individual securities appearing on the list during the course of the initial offering period or may purchase warrants issued by the sponsor or its affiliates which are based on the performance of the securities on the list the sponsor or its affiliates may also purchase securities as a hedge against its risk on the warrants although generally the sponsor and its affiliates will not purchase securities for their own account until after the trust portfolio has been acquired such buying activity in the stock of these companies or issuance of the warrants prior to the purchase of the securities by the trust may cause the trust to purchase stocks at a higher price than those buyers who effect purchases by the trust fixed portfolio investors should be aware that the trust is not managed and as a result the adverse financial condition of a company will not result in the elimination of its securities from the portfolio of the trust except under extraordinary circumstances investors should note in particular that the securities were selected on the basis of the criteria set forth in the prospectus and that the trust may continue to purchase or hold securities originally selected through this process even though the evaluation of the attractiveness of the securities may have changed a number of the securities in the trust may also be owned by other clients of the sponsor however because these clients may have differing investment objectives the sponsor may sell certain securities from those accounts in instances where a sale by the trust would be impermissible such as to maximize return by taking advantage of market fluctuations in the event a public tender offer is made for a security or a merger or acquisition is announced affecting a security the sponsor may instruct the trustee to tender or sell the security on the open market when in its opinion it is in the best interest of the unitholders of the unit to do so although the portfolio is regularly reviewed and evaluated and the sponsor may instruct the trustee to sell securities under certain limited circumstances securities will not be sold by the trust to take advantage of market fluctuations or changes in anticipated rates of appreciation as a result the amount realized upon the sale of the securities may not be the highest price attained by an individual security during the life of the trust the prices of single shares of each of the securities in the trust vary widely and the effect of a dollar of fluctuation either higher or lower in stock prices will be much greater as a percentage of the lowerprice stocks purchase price than as a percentage of the higherprice stocks purchase price closedend fund risks if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust may invest in the common stock of closedend funds closedend funds closedend funds are actively managed investment companies which invest in various types of securities closedend funds issue shares of common stock that are traded on a securities exchange closedend funds are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the closedend funds investment objective and to manage the closedend fund portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil and as investors perceptions regarding closedend funds or their underlying investments change shares of closedend funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of closedend fund shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors certain of the closedend funds included in a trust may employ the use of leverage in their portfolios through the issuance of preferred stock while leverage often serves to increase the yield of a closedend fund this leverage also subjects the closedend fund to increased risks including the likelihood of increased volatility and the possibility that the closedend funds common share income will fall if the dividend rate on the preferred shares or the interest rate on any borrowings rises market discounts or premiums certain of the securities may have been deposited at a market discount or premium principally because their dividend rates are lower or higher than prevailing rates on comparable securities the current returns of market discount securities are lower than comparably rated securities selling at par because discount securities tend to increase in market value as they approach maturity the current returns of market premium securities are higher than comparably rated securities selling at par because premium securities tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity because part of the purchase price is returned through current income payments and not at maturity an early redemption at par of a premium security will result in a reduction in yield to the trust market premium or discount attributable to dividend rate changes does not indicate market confidence or lack of confidence in the issue liquidity whether or not the securities are listed on a national securities exchange the principal trading market for the securities may be in the overthecounter market as a result the existence of a liquid trading market for the securities may depend on whether dealers will make a market in the securities there can be no assurance that a market will be made for any of the securities that any market for the securities will be maintained or of the liquidity of the securities in any markets made in addition a trust is restricted under the investment company act of  from selling securities to the sponsor the price at which the securities may be sold to meet redemptions and the value of a trust will be adversely affected if trading markets for the securities are limited or absent additional deposits the trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of additional securities or cash including a letter of credit with instructions to purchase additional securities in such trust and the issuance of a corresponding number of additional units if the sponsor deposits cash existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the securities and because a trust will pay the associated brokerage fees to minimize this effect the trusts will attempt to purchase the securities as close to the evaluation time or as close to the evaluation prices as possible some of the securities may have limited trading volume the trustee with directions from the sponsor will endeavor to purchase securities with deposited cash as soon as practicable reserving the right to purchase those securities over the  business days following each deposit in an effort to reduce the effect of these purchases on the market price of those stocks this could however result in the trusts failure to participate in any appreciation of those stocks before the cash is invested if any cash remains at the end of this period and such date is within the day period following the inception date and cannot be invested in one or more stocks at what the sponsor considers reasonable prices it intends to use that cash to purchase each of the other securities in the original proportionate relationship among those securities similarly at termination of the trust the sponsor reserves the right to sell securities over a period of up to nine business days to lessen the impact of its sales on the market price of the securities the proceeds received by unitholders following termination of the trust will reflect the actual sales proceeds received on the securities which will likely differ from the closing sale price on the termination date litigation and legislation at any time litigation may be initiated on a variety of grounds or legislation may be enacted with respect to the securities in a trust or the issuers of the securities there can be no assurance that future litigation or legislation will not have a material adverse effect on the trust or will not impair the ability of issuers to achieve their business goals financial sector risks if set forth in part a of the prospectus certain of the issuers of securities in a trust may be involved in the financial sector an investment in units of a trust containing securities of such issuers should be made with an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the financial sector in general banks thrifts and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets in commercial and residential real estate loans or any particular segment or industry and competition from new entrants in their fields of business banks and thrifts are highly dependent on net interest margin banks and thrifts traditionally receive a significant portion of their revenues from consumer mortgage fee income as a result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets as home purchasing and refinancing activity has subsided this revenue has diminished economic conditions in the real estate markets have deteriorated leading to asset writeoffs and decreased liquidity in the credit markets which can have a substantial negative effect upon banks and thrifts because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans secured by real estate difficulties in the mortgage and broader credit markets have resulted in decreases in the availability of funds financial performance of many banks and thrifts especially in securities collateralized by mortgage loans has deteriorated in response to recent market and economic conditions the united states government particularly the us department of the treasury us treasury the federal reserve board frb and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic have taken a variety of extraordinary measures including capital injections guarantees of bank liabilities and the acquisition of illiquid assets from banks designed to provide fiscal stimulus restore confidence in the financial markets and to strengthen financial institutions the emergency economic stabilization act of  eesa gave the us treasury  billion to purchase bad mortgagerelated securities that caused much of the difficulties experienced by financial institutions and the credit markets in general additionally the american recovery and reinvestment act of  arra was signed into law in february  the eesa and arra along with the us treasurys capital purchase program which provides for direct purchases by the us treasury of equity from financial institutions contain provisions limiting the way banks and their holding companies are able pay dividends purchase their own common stock and compensate officers furthermore participants have been subject to forward looking stress tests to determine if they have sufficient capital to withstand certain economic scenarios including situations more severe than the current recession as a result of these stress tests some financial institutions were required to increase their level of capital through a combination of asset sales additional equity offerings and the conversion of preferred shares into common stock the longterm effects of the eesa arra and the stress tests are not yet known and cannot be predicted this uncertainty may cause increased costs and risks for the firms associated with the respective programs banks thrifts and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and when such institutions are statechartered to state regulation as well such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks and thrifts may pursue furthermore bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund regulatory actions such as increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and thrifts and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the fdic can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a company to pay dividends neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental regulations however insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their holding companies or insures against any risk of investment in the securities issued by such institutions in light of the current credit market difficulties the us government is considering changes to the laws and regulatory structure new legislation and regulatory changes could cause business disruptions result in significant loss of revenue limit financial firms ability to pursue business opportunities impact the value of business assets and impose additional costs that may adversely affect business there can be no assurance as to the actual impact these laws and their implementing regulations or any other governmental program will have on the financial markets currently the frb fdic securities and exchange commission office of comptroller of the currency a bureau of the us treasury which regulates national banks and the us commodities futures trading commission which oversees commodity futures and option markets all play a role in the supervision of the financial markets recently passed legislation calls for swift government intervention which includes the creation of new federal agencies that will have a direct impact on the financial banking and insurance industries this new legislation includes the creation of a financial oversight council to advise the frb on the identification of firms who failure could pose a threat to financial stability due to their combination of size leverage and interconnectedness additionally these financial firms would be subject to increased scrutiny concerning their capital liquidity and risk management standards the statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks thrifts and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone substantial change in the recent past to a great extent these changes are embodied in the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  the resolution trust corporation refinancing restructuring and improvement act of  the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of  and the regulations promulgated under these laws in  the grammleachbliley act repealed most of the barriers set up by the  glasssteagall act which separated the banking insurance and securities industries banks and thrifts now face significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds credit unions mortgage banking companies and insurance companies banks insurance companies and securities firms can merge to form onestop financial conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors this legislation has resulted in increased merger activity and heightened competition among existing and new participants in the field efforts to expand the ability of federal thrifts to branch on an interstate basis have been initially successful through promulgation of regulations and legislation to liberalize interstate banking has been signed into law under the legislation banks are able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any state since mid banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into branches thus leading to continued consolidation the securities and exchange commission and the financial accounting standards board fasb require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring marktomarket accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts or available for sale adoption of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported health of the industry and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems accounting standards codification  fair value measurements and disclosures changed the requirements of marktomarket accounting and determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability has significantly decreased these changes and other potential changes in financial accounting rules and valuation techniques may have a significant impact on the banking and financial services industries in terms of accurately pricing assets or liabilities additional legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming for example the bank regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws rules and regulations and there can be no certainty as to the effect if any that such changes would have on the securities in a trusts portfolio in addition from time to time the deposit insurance system is reviewed by congress and federal regulators and proposed reforms of that system could among other things further restrict the ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks or change the dollar amount or number of deposits insured for any depositor on october   eesa increased the maximum amount of federal deposit insurance coverage payable as to any certificate of deposit from  to  per depositor the impact of this reform is unknown and could reduce profitability as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits the sponsor makes no prediction as to what if any manner of bank and thrift regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such actions might have on a trusts portfolio the federal bank holding company act of  bhc act generally prohibits a bank holding company from  acquiring directly or indirectly more than  of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company  acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company  acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank or  merging or consolidating with another bank holding company without first obtaining frb approval in considering an application with respect to any such transaction the frb is required to consider a variety of factors including the potential anticompetitive effects of the transaction the financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting institutions the managerial resources of the resulting institution the convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve the record of performance of each combining organization under the community reinvestment act and the equal credit opportunity act and the prospective availability to the frb of information appropriate to determine ongoing regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws in addition the federal change in bank control act and various state laws impose limitations on the ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks or bank holding companies the frb has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies in which the frb expressed its view that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that would weaken its financial health such as by borrowing the frb also may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of certain applications including applications for approval of mergers and acquisitions the sponsor makes no prediction as to the effect if any such laws will have on the securities in a trust or whether such approvals if necessary will be obtained companies engaged in investment bankingbrokerage and investment management include brokerage firms brokerdealers investment banks finance companies and mutual fund companies earnings and share prices of companies in this industry are quite volatile and often exceed the volatility levels of the market as a whole negative economic events in the credit markets have led some firms to declare bankruptcy forced shortnotice sales to competing firms or required government intervention by the fdic or through an infusions of troubled asset relief program funds consolidation in the industry and the volatility in the stock market have negatively impacted investors additionally government intervention has required many financial institutions to become bank holding companies under the bhc act under the system of functional regulation established under the bhc act the frb supervises bank holding companies as an umbrella regulator the bhc act and regulations generally restrict bank holding companies from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities the frb and fdic have also issued substantial riskbased and leverage capital guidelines applicable to us banking organizations the guidelines define a threetier framework requiring depository institutions to maintain certain leverage ratios depending on the type of assets held if any depository institution controlled by a financial or bank holding company ceases to meet capital or management standards the frb may impose corrective capital andor managerial requirements on the company and place limitations on its ability to conduct broader financial activities furthermore proposed legislation will allow the treasury and the fdic to create a resolution regime to take over bank and financial holding companies the taking over would be based on whether the firm is in default or in danger of defaulting and whether such a default would have a serious adverse effect on the financial system or the economy this mechanism would only be used by the government in exceptional circumstances to mitigate these effects this type of intervention has unknown risks and costs associated with it which may cause unforeseeable harm in the industry companies involved in the insurance industry are engaged in underwriting reinsuring selling distributing or placing of property and casualty life or health insurance other growth areas within the insurance industry include brokerage reciprocals claims processors and multiline insurance companies interest rate levels general economic conditions and price and marketing competition affect insurance company profits property and casualty insurance profits may also be affected by weather catastrophes and other disasters life and health insurance profits may be affected by mortality and morbidity rates individual companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers insurance companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation including the imposition of maximum rate levels which may not be adequate for some lines of business proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies policy sales tax obligations and profitability in addition to the foregoing profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressures to compete globally in addition to the normal risks of business companies involved in the insurance industry are subject to significant risk factors including those applicable to regulated insurance companies such as i the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves particularly reserves for the cost of environmental asbestos and mass tort claims and the fact that ultimate losses could materially exceed established loss reserves which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition ii the fact that insurance companies have experienced and can be expected in the future to experience catastrophe losses which could have a material adverse impact on their financial condition results of operations and cash flow iii the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment patterns caused by new claims settlement practices iv the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus particularly in light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state insurance regulatory authorities and in order to maintain acceptable financial strength or claimspaying ability rating v the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies subsidiaries are subject various regulatory initiatives that may affect insurance companies and regulatory and other legal actions vi the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the value of an insurance companys investment portfolio and on the attractiveness of certain of its products vii the need to adjust the effective duration of the assets and liabilities of life insurance operations in order to meet the anticipated cash flow requirements of its policyholder obligations and viii the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables this enhanced oversight into the insurance industry may pose unknown risks to the sector as a whole the state insurance regulatory framework has during recent years come under increased federal scrutiny and certain state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that alter and in many cases increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company systems further the national association of insurance commissioners naic and state insurance regulators are reexamining existing laws and regulations specifically focusing on insurance companies interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws in addition congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the united states to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation the sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance industry or what effect if any such legislation would have on the industry all insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain investment categories failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause nonconforming investments to be treated as nonadmitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and in some instances would require divestiture environmental pollution cleanup is the subject of both federal and state regulation by some estimates there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to clean up the insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  superfund and comparable state statutes minisuperfund govern the cleanup and restoration by potentially responsible parties prps superfund and the minisuperfunds environmental cleanup laws or ecls establish a mechanism to pay for cleanup of waste sites if prps fail to do so and to assign liability to prps the extent of liability to be allocated to a prp is dependent on a variety of factors the extent of cleanup necessary and the assignment of liability has not been fully established the insurance industry is disputing many such claims key coverage issues include whether superfund response costs are considered damages under the policies when and how coverage is triggered applicability of pollution exclusions the potential for joint and several liability and definition of an occurrence similar coverage issues exist for clean up and waste sites not covered under superfund to date courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues an insurers exposure to liability with regard to its insureds which have been or may be named as prps is uncertain superfund reform proposals have been introduced in congress but none have been enacted there can be no assurance that any superfund reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair effective and costefficient system for settlement of superfund related claims while current federal income tax law permits the taxdeferred accumulation of earnings on the premiums paid by an annuity owner and holders of certain savingsoriented life insurance products no assurance can be given that future tax law will continue to allow such tax deferrals if such deferrals were not allowed consumer demand for the affected products would be substantially reduced in addition proposals to lower the federal income tax rates through a form of flat tax or otherwise could have if enacted a negative impact on the demand for such products major determinants of future earnings of companies in the financial services sector are the direction of the stock market investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of longterm and shortterm interest rates and the outlook for emerging markets negative trends in any of these earnings determinants could have a serious adverse effect on the financial stability as well as the stock prices of these companies furthermore there can be no assurance that the issuers of the securities included in the trust will be able to respond in a timely manner to compete in the rapidly developing marketplace in addition to the foregoing profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressures to compete globally foreign securities risk if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust or issuers of securities held by a trust may invest in foreign issuers and therefore an investment in such a trust involves some investment risks that are different in some respects from an investment in a trust that invests entirely in securities of domestic issuers those investment risks include future political and governmental restrictions which might adversely affect the payment or receipt of payment of dividends on the relevant securities currency exchange rate fluctuations exchange control policies and the limited liquidity and small market capitalization of such foreign countries securities markets in addition for foreign issuers that are not subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  there may be less publicly available information than is available from a domestic issuer also foreign issuers are not necessarily subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards practices and requirements comparable to those applicable to domestic issuers however due to the nature of the issuers of the securities included in the trust the sponsor believes that adequate information will be available to allow the sponsor to provide portfolio surveillance certain of the securities in the trust may be in adr or gdr form adrs american depositary receipts and gdrs global depositary receipts represent common stock deposited with a custodian in a depositary american depositary receipts and global depositary receipts collectively the depositary receipts are issued by a bank or trust company to evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation these instruments may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the securities into which they may be converted for purposes of the discussion herein the terms adr and gdr generally include american depositary shares and global depositary shares respectively depositary receipts may be sponsored or unsponsored in an unsponsored facility the depositary initiates and arranges the facility at the request of market makers and acts as agent for the depositary receipts holder while the company itself is not involved in the transaction in a sponsored facility the issuing company initiates the facility and agrees to pay certain administrative and shareholderrelated expenses sponsored facilities use a single depositary and entail a contractual relationship between the issuer the shareholder and the depositary unsponsored facilities involve several depositaries with no contractual relationship to the company the depositary bank that issues depositary receipts generally charges a fee based on the price of the depositary receipts upon issuance and cancellation of the depositary receipts this fee would be in addition to the brokerage commissions paid upon the acquisition or surrender of the security in addition the depositary bank incurs expenses in connection with the conversion of dividends or other cash distributions paid in local currency into us dollars and such expenses are deducted from the amount of the dividend or distribution paid to holders resulting in a lower payout per underlying shares represented by the depositary receipts than would be the case if the underlying share were held directly certain tax considerations including tax rate differentials and withholding requirements arising from the application of the tax laws of one nation to nationals of another and from certain practices in the depositary receipts market may also exist with respect to certain depositary receipts in varying degrees any or all of these factors may affect the value of the depositary receipts compared with the value of the underlying shares in the local market in addition the rights of holders of depositary receipts may be different than those of holders of the underlying shares and the market for depositary receipts may be less liquid than that for the underlying shares depositary receipts are registered securities pursuant to the securities act of  and may be subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  for the securities that are depositary receipts currency fluctuations will affect the united states dollar equivalent of the local currency price of the underlying domestic share and as a result are likely to affect the value of the depositary receipts and consequently the value of the securities the foreign issuers of securities that are depositary receipts may pay dividends in foreign currencies which must be converted into dollars most foreign currencies have fluctuated widely in value against the united states dollar for many reasons including supply and demand of the respective currency the soundness of the world economy and the strength of the respective economy as compared to the economies of the united states and other countries therefore for any securities of issuers whether or not they are in depositary receipt form whose earnings are stated in foreign currencies or which pay dividends in foreign currencies or which are traded in foreign currencies there is a risk that their united states dollar value will vary with fluctuations in the united states dollar foreign exchange rates for the relevant currencies on january   austria belgium finland france germany ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands portugal and spain eleven of the fifteen member states of the european union eu as of such date established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro on such date the euro became the official currency of these eleven countries the participating countries do not control their own monetary policies by directing independent interest rates for their currencies greece slovenia cyprus and malta have also adopted the euro as their official currency in these member states the authority to direct monetary policy including money supply and official interest rates for the euro is exercised by the european central bank the conversion of the national currencies of the participating countries to the euro could negatively impact the market rate of the exchange between such currencies or the euro and the us dollar as of january   there were  member states in the eu in addition european corporations and other entities with significant markets or operations in europe whether or not in the participating countries face strategic challenges as these entities adapt to a single transnational currency the euro conversion may have a material impact on revenues expenses or income from operations increase competition due to the increased price transparency of eu markets effect issuers currency exchange rate risk and derivatives exposure disrupt current contracts cause issuers to increase spending on information technology updates required for the conversion and result in potential adverse tax consequences the sponsor is unable to predict what impact if any the euro conversion will have on any of the issuers of securities contained in a trust preferred stock risks if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust or issuers of securities held by a trust may invest in preferred stock if this is the case an investment in units should be made with an understanding of the risks which an investment in preferred stocks entails including the risk that the financial condition of the issuers of the securities or the general condition of the preferred stock market may worsen and the value of the preferred stocks and therefore the value of the units may decline preferred stocks may be susceptible to general stock market movements and to volatile increases and decreases of value as market confidence in and perceptions of the issuers change these perceptions are based on unpredictable factors including expectations regarding government economic monetary and fiscal policies inflation and interest rates economic expansion or contraction market liquidity and global or regional political economic or banking crises preferred stocks are also vulnerable to congressional reductions in the dividendsreceived deduction which would adversely affect the aftertax return to the investors who can take advantage of the deduction such a reduction might adversely affect the value of preferred stocks in general holders of preferred stocks as owners of the entity have rights to receive payments from the issuers of those preferred stocks that are generally subordinate to those of creditors of or holders of debt obligations or in some cases other senior preferred stocks of such issuers preferred stocks do not represent an obligation of the issuer and therefore do not offer any assurance of income or provide the same degree of protection of capital as do debt securities the issuance of additional debt securities or senior preferred stocks will create prior claims for payment of principal and interest and senior dividends which could adversely affect the ability and inclination of the issuer to declare or pay dividends on its preferred stock or the rights of holders of preferred stock with respect to assets of the issuer upon liquidation or bankruptcy the value of preferred stocks is subject to market fluctuations for as long as the preferred stocks remain outstanding and thus the value of the securities may be expected to fluctuate over the life of the trust to values higher or lower than those prevailing on the initial date of deposit trust preferred securities risks if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust or issuers of securities held by a trust may invest in trust preferred securities holders of trust preferred securities incur risks in addition to or slightly different than the typical risks of holding preferred stocks trust preferred securities are limitedlife preferred securities that are typically issued by corporations generally in the form of interestbearing notes or preferred securities issued by corporations or by an affiliated business trust of a corporation generally in the form of beneficial interests in subordinated debentures issued by the corporation or similarly structured securities the maturity and dividend rate of the trust preferred securities are structured to match the maturity and coupon interest rate of the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures trust preferred securities usually mature on the stated maturity date of the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures and may be redeemed or liquidated prior to the stated maturity date of such instruments for any reason on or after their stated call date or upon the occurrence of certain circumstances at any time trust preferred securities generally have a yield advantage over traditional preferred stocks but unlike preferred stocks distributions on the trust preferred securities are generally treated as interest rather than dividends for federal income tax purposes unlike most preferred stocks distributions received from trust preferred securities are generally not eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction certain of the risks unique to trust preferred securities include i distributions on trust preferred securities will be made only if interest payments on the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures are made ii a corporation issuing the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures may defer interest payments on these instruments for up to  consecutive quarters and if such election is made distributions will not be made on the trust preferred securities during the deferral period iii certain tax or regulatory events may trigger the redemption of the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures by the issuing corporation and result in prepayment of the trust preferred securities prior to their stated maturity date iv future legislation may be proposed or enacted that may prohibit the corporation from deducting its interest payments on the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures for tax purposes making redemption of these instruments likely v a corporation may redeem the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures in whole at any time or in part from time to time on or after a stated call date vi trust preferred securities holders have very limited voting rights and vii payment of interest on the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures and therefore distributions on the trust preferred securities is dependent on the financial condition of the issuing corporation convertible securities risks if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust or issuers of securities held by a trust may invest in convertible securities convertible securities generally offer lower interest or dividend yields than nonconvertible fixedincome securities of similar credit quality because of the potential for capital appreciation the market values of convertible securities tend to decline as interest rates increase and conversely to increase as interest rates decline however a convertible securitys market value also tends to reflect the market price of the common stock of the issuing company particularly when the stock price is greater than the convertible securitys conversion price the conversion price is defined as the predetermined price or exchange ratio at which the convertible security can be converted or exchanged for the underlying common stock as the market price of the underlying common stock declines below the conversion price the price of the convertible security tends to be increasingly influenced more by the yield of the convertible security than by the market price of the underlying common stock thus it may not decline in price to the same extent as the underlying common stock and convertible securities generally have less potential for gain or loss than common stocks however mandatory convertible securities as discussed below generally do not limit the potential for loss to the same extent as securities convertible at the option of the holder in the event of a liquidation of the issuing company holders of convertible securities would be paid before that companys common stockholders consequently an issuers convertible securities generally entail less risk than its common stock however convertible securities fall below debt obligations of the same issuer in order of preference or priority in the event of a liquidation and are typically unrated or rated lower than such debt obligations in addition contingent payment convertible securities allow the issuer to claim deductions based on its nonconvertible cost of debt which generally will result in deduction in excess of the actual cash payments made on the securities and accordingly holders will recognize income in amounts in excess of the cash payments received mandatory convertible securities are distinguished as a subset of convertible securities because the conversion is not optional and the conversion price at maturity is based solely upon the market price of the underlying common stock which may be significantly less than par or the price above or below par paid for these reasons the risks associated with investing in mandatory convertible securities most closely resemble the risks inherent in common stocks mandatory convertible securities customarily pay a higher coupon yield to compensate for the potential risk of additional price volatility and loss upon conversion because the market price of a mandatory convertible security increasingly corresponds to the market price of its underlying common stock as the convertible security approaches its conversion date there can be no assurance that the higher coupon will compensate for the potential loss senior loan risks if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust or issuers of securities held by a trust may invest in senior loans senior loans in which a closedend fund may invest o generally are of below investmentgrade credit quality o may be unrated at the time of investment o generally are not registered with the sec or any state securities commission and o generally are not listed on any securities exchange the amount of public information available on senior loans generally will be less extensive than that available for other types of assets no reliable active trading market currently exists for many senior loans although a secondary market for certain senior loans has developed over the past several years senior loans are thus relatively illiquid liquidity relates to the ability of a closedend fund to sell an investment in a timely manner at a price approximately equal to its value on the closedend funds books the illiquidity of senior loans may impair a closedend funds ability to realized the full value of its assets in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation of such assets because of the lack of an active trading market illiquid securities are also difficult to value and prices provided by external pricing services may not reflect the true value of the securities however many senior loans are of a large principal amount and are held by a large number of financial institutions to the extent that a secondary market does exist for certain senior loans the market may be subject to irregular trading activity wide bidask spreads and extended trade settlement periods the market for senior loans could be disrupted in the event of an economic downturn or a substantial increase or decrease in interest rates this could result in increased volatility in the market and in the trusts net asset value if legislation or state or federal regulators impose additional requirements or restrictions on the ability of financial institutions to make loans that are considered highly leveraged transactions the availability of senior loans for investment by the closedend funds may be adversely affected in addition such requirements or restrictions could reduce or eliminate sources of financing for certain borrowers this would increase the risk of default if legislation or federal or state regulators require financial institutions to dispose of senior loans that are considered highly leveraged transactions or subject such senior loans to increased regulatory scrutiny financial institutions may determine to sell such senior loans such sales could result in depressed prices if a closedend fund attempts to sell a senior loan at a time when a financial institution is engaging in such a sale the price a closedend fund could get for the senior loan may be adversely affected some senior loans are subject to the risk that a court pursuant to fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws could subordinate the senior loans to presently existing or future indebtedness of the borrower or take other action detrimental to lenders such court action could under certain circumstances include invalidation of senior loans any lender which could include a closedend fund is subject to the risk that a court could find the lender liable for damages in a claim by a borrower arising under the common laws of tort or contracts or antifraud provisions of certain securities laws for actions taken or omitted to be taken by the lenders under the relevant terms of a loan agreement or in connection with actions with respect to the collateral underlying the senior loan smallcapitalization and midcapitalization stocks risk if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust may invest in smallcapitalization or midcapitalization stocks investing in smallcapitalization stocks or midcapitalization stocks may involve greater risk than investing in largecapitalization stocks since they can be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements many small market capitalization companies smallcap companies or middle market capitalization companies midcap companies will have had their securities publicly traded if at all for only a short period of time and will not have had the opportunity to establish a reliable trading pattern through economic cycles the price volatility of smallcap companies and midcap companies is relatively higher than larger older and more mature companies the greater price volatility of smallcap companies and midcap companies may result from the fact that there may be less market liquidity less information publicly available or fewer investors who monitor the activities of these companies in addition the market prices of these securities may exhibit more sensitivity to changes in industry or general economic conditions some smallcap companies or midcap companies will not have been in existence long enough to experience economic cycles or to demonstrate whether they are sufficiently well managed to survive downturns or inflationary periods further a variety of factors may affect the success of a companys business beyond the ability of its management to prepare or compensate for them including domestic and international political developments government trade and fiscal policies patterns of trade and war or other military conflict which may affect industries or markets or the economy generally administration of the trust distributions to unitholders income received by a trust is credited by the trustee to the income account of the trust other receipts are credited to the capital account of a trust income received by a trust will be distributed on or shortly after the distribution dates each year shown in the prospectus on a pro rata basis to unitholders of record as of the preceding record date shown in the prospectus however if set forth in part a of the prospectus that the trust will prorate distributions on an annual basis income averaging then income received by the trust will be distributed on a prorated basis of onetwelfth of the estimated annual income to the trust for the ensuing  months all distributions will be net of applicable expenses there is no assurance that any actual distributions will be made since all dividends received may be used to pay expenses in addition excess amounts from the capital account of a trust if any will be distributed at least annually to the unitholders then of record proceeds received from the disposition of any of the securities after a record date and prior to the following distribution date will be held in the capital account and not distributed until the next distribution date applicable to the capital account the trustee shall be required to make a distribution from the capital account if the cash balance on deposit therein available for distribution shall be sufficient to distribute at least  per  units the trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the capital or income accounts but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of such funds the trustee is authorized to reinvest any funds held in the capital or income accounts pending distribution in us treasury obligations which mature on or before the next applicable distribution date any obligations so acquired must be held until they mature and proceeds therefrom may not be reinvested the distribution to the unitholders as of each record date will be made on the following distribution date or shortly thereafter and shall consist of an amount substantially equal to such portion of the unitholders pro rata share of the dividend distributions then held in the income account after deducting estimated expenses because dividends are not received by a trust at a constant rate throughout the year such distributions to unitholders are expected to fluctuate however if the trust uses income averaging the trust prorates the income distribution on an annual basis and annual income distributions are expected to vary from year to year if the amount on deposit in the income account is insufficient for payment of the amount of income to be distributed on a monthly basis the trustee shall advance out of its own funds and cause to be deposited in and credited to such income account such amount as may be required to permit payment of the monthly income distribution the trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the trust without interest out of income received by the trust subsequent to the date of such advance and subject to the condition that any such reimbursement shall be made only if it will not reduce the funds in or available for the income account to an amount less than required for the next ensuing distribution persons who purchase units will commence receiving distributions only after such person becomes a record owner a person will become the owner of units and thereby a unitholder of record on the date of settlement provided payment has been received notification to the trustee of the transfer of units is the responsibility of the purchaser but in the normal course of business such notice is provided by the selling brokerdealer the trustee will periodically deduct from the income account of a trust and to the extent funds are not sufficient therein from the capital account of a trust amounts necessary to pay the expenses of a trust the trustee also may withdraw from said accounts such amounts if any as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of a trust amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a trusts assets until such time as the trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the appropriate accounts in addition the trustee may withdraw from the income and capital accounts of a trust such amounts as may be necessary to cover redemptions of units distribution reinvestment unitholders may elect to have distributions of capital including capital gains or dividends if any or both automatically invested into additional units of their trust without a sales fee your trust will pay any deferred sales fee per unit regardless of any sales fee discounts however if you elect to have distributions on your units reinvested into additional units of your trust you will be credited the amount of any remaining deferred sales charge on such additional units at the time of reinvestment unitholders who are receiving distributions in cash may elect to participate in distribution reinvestment by filing with the program agent an election to have such distributions reinvested without charge such election must be received by the program agent at least ten days prior to the record date applicable to any distribution in order to be in effect for such record date any such election shall remain in effect until a subsequent notice is received by the program agent the program agent is the bank of new york mellon all inquiries concerning participating in distribution reinvestment should be directed to the bank of new york mellon at its unit investment trust division office statements to unitholders with each distribution the trustee will furnish to each registered holder a statement of the amount of income and the amount of other receipts if any which are being distributed expressed in each case as a dollar amount per unit the accounts of a trust will not be audited annually unless the sponsor determines that such an audit would be in the best interest of the unitholders of the trust if an audit is conducted it will be done at the related trusts expense by independent public accountants designated by the sponsor the accountants report will be furnished by the trustee to any unitholder upon written request within a reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar year the trustee shall furnish to each person who at any time during the calendar year was a unitholder of a trust a statement covering the calendar year generally setting forth for the trust a as to the income account  income received  deductions for applicable taxes and for fees and expenses of the trust and for redemptions of units if any and  the balance remaining after such distributions and deductions expressed in each case both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar amount representing the pro rata

appraise or cause to be appraised daily the value of the underlying securities as of the close of the new york stock exchange on days the new york stock exchange is open and will adjust the public offering price of the units commensurate with such valuation such public offering price will be effective for all orders properly received at or prior to the close of trading on the new york stock

determined by the evaluator based on the value of the underlying securities unitholders who wish to dispose of their units should inquire of their broker as to current market prices in order to determine whether there is in existence any price in excess of the redemption price and if so the amount thereof unitholders who sell or redeem units prior to such time as the entire deferred sales

unitholder only when filing a tax return under normal circumstances the trustee obtains the unitholders tax identification number from the selling broker however any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption such unitholder should make sure that the trustee has been provided a certified tax identification number in order to avoid this possible backup withholding in the event the trustee has not been previously provided such number one must be provided at the time redemption is requested any amounts paid on redemption representing unpaid dividends shall be withdrawn from the

owning units of the trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and opinion of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in your trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor assets of the trust the trust is expected to hold one or more of the following i shares of stock in corporations the stocks that are treated as equity for federal income tax purposes and ii shares the ric shares in funds qualifying as regulated investment companies rics that are treated as interests in regulated investment companies for federal income tax purposes it is possible that your trust will also hold other assets including assets that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those described above in which case you will have federal income tax consequences different from or in addition to those described in this section all of the assets held by the trust constitute the trust assets neither our counsel nor we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the trust assets and thus neither our counsel nor we have reached a conclusion regarding the federal income tax treatment of the trust assets trust status if your trust is at all times operated in accordance with the documents establishing the trust and certain requirements of federal income tax law are met the trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes as a unit owner you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of each of the trust assets and as such you will be considered to have received a pro rata share of income eg dividends and capital gains if any from each trust asset when such income would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned the trust assets this is true even if you elect to have your distributions reinvested into additional units in addition the income from trust assets that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or trust expenses under the health care and education reconciliation act of  income from a trust may also be subject to a new  medicare tax imposed for taxable years beginning after  this tax will generally apply to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts which are  in the case of married couples filing joint returns and  in the case of single individuals interest that is excluded from gross income including any exemptinterest dividends from the ric shares held by a trust are generally not included in your net investment income for purposes of this tax your tax basis and income or loss upon disposition if your trust disposes of trust assets you will generally recognize gain or loss if you dispose of your units or redeem your units for cash you will also generally recognize gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in the related trust assets from your share of the total amount received in the transaction you can generally determine your initial tax basis in each trust asset by apportioning the cost of your units including sales charges among the trust assets ratably according to their values on the date you acquire your units in certain circumstances however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you acquire your units for example in the case of certain dividends that exceed a corporations accumulated earnings and profits if you are an individual the maximum marginal stated federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  for taxpayers in the  tax bracket  for taxpayers in the    and  tax brackets and  for taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets capital gains may also be subject to the medicare tax described above net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code however treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations dividends from stocks certain dividends received with respect to the stocks may qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied dividends from ric shares some dividends on the ric shares may be reported by the ric as capital gain dividends generally taxable to you as longterm capital gains some capital gain dividends may be taxed at a maximum stated rate of  some dividends on the ric shares may qualify as exemptinterest dividends which generally are excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes some or all of the exemptinterest dividends however may be taken into account in determining your alternative minimum tax and may have other tax consequences eg they may affect the amount of your social security benefits that are taxed other dividends on the ric shares will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income certain ordinary income dividends from a ric may qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the ric itself rics are required to provide notice to their shareholders of the amount of any distribution that may be taken into account as a dividend that is eligible for the capital gains tax rates if you hold a unit for six months or less or if your trust holds a ric share for six months or less any loss incurred by you related to the disposition of such ric share will generally be disallowed to the extent of any exemptinterest dividends you received to the extent if any it is not disallowed it will be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent of any longterm capital gain distributions received or deemed to have been received with respect to such ric share distributions of income or capital gains declared on the ric shares in october november or december will be deemed to have been paid to you on december  of the year they are declared even when paid by the ric during the following january dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units will generally not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received by your trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for dividends from most foreign corporations or from rics however certain dividends on the ric shares that are attributable to dividends received by the ric itself from certain domestic corporations may be reported by the ric as being eligible for the dividends received deduction inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may request an inkind distribution of trust assets when you redeem your units at any time prior to  business days before your trusts termination however this ability to request an inkind distribution will terminate at any time that the number of outstanding units has been reduced to  or less of the highest number of units issued by the trust by electing to receive an inkind distribution you will receive trust assets plus possibly cash you will not recognize gain or loss if you only receive whole trust assets in exchange for the identical amount of your pro rata portion of the same trust assets held by your trust however if you also receive cash in exchange for a trust asset or a fractional portion of a trust asset you will generally recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the amount of cash you receive and your tax basis in such trust asset or fractional portion exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future series of the trust it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain and any loss will be treated as a capital loss however any loss you incur in connection with the exchange of your units of your trusts for units of the next series will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and subsequent deemed repurchase to the extent the two trusts have substantially identical trust assets under the wash sale provisions of the internal revenue code limitations on the deductibility of trust expenses generally for federal income tax purposes you must take into account your full pro rata share of your trusts income even if some of that income is used to pay trust expenses you may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your trust to the same extent as if you directly paid the expense you may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of your trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the extent they exceed  of adjusted gross income some individuals may also be subject to further limitations on the amount of their itemized deductions depending on their income because some of the rics may pay exemptinterest dividends which are treated as taxexempt interest for federal income tax purposes you may not be able to deduct some of your share of the trust expenses in addition you may not be able to deduct some of your interest expense for debt that you incur or continue to purchase or carry your units foreign investors taxes and investments distributions by your trust that are treated as us source income eg dividends received on stocks of domestic corporations will generally be subject to us income taxation and withholding in the case of units held by nonresident alien individuals foreign corporations or other nonus persons subject to any applicable treaty if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes on some or all of the income from your trust or on any gain from the sale or redemption of your units provided that certain conditions are met you should consult your tax advisor with respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt for us tax purposes distributions after june   may be subject to a us withholding tax of  in the case of distributions to i certain nonus financial institutions that have not entered into an agreement with the us treasury to collect and disclose certain information and are not resident in a jurisdiction that has entered into such an agreement with the us treasury and ii certain other nonus entities that do not provide certain certifications and information about the entitys us owners dispositions of units by such persons may be subject to such withholding after december   you should also consult your tax advisor with respect to other us tax withholding and reporting requirements some distributions by your trust may be subject to foreign withholding taxes any income withheld will still be treated as income to you under the grantor trust rules you are considered to have paid directly your share of any foreign taxes that are paid therefore for us tax purposes you may be entitled to a foreign tax credit or deduction for those foreign taxes under certain circumstances a ric may elect to pass through to its shareholders certain foreign taxes paid by the ric if the ric makes this election with respect to ric shares you must include in your income for federal income tax purposes your portion of such taxes and you may be entitled to a credit or deduction for such taxes if any us investor is treated as owning directly or indirectly  percent or more of the combined voting power of the stock of a foreign corporation and all us shareholders of that corporation collectively own more than  percent of the vote or value of the stock of that corporation the foreign corporation may be treated as a controlled foreign corporation a cfc if you own  percent or more of a cfc through your trust and in combination with your other investments or possibly if your trust owns  percent or more of a cfc you will be required to include certain types of the cfcs income in your taxable income for federal income tax purposes whether or not such income is distributed to your trust or to you a foreign corporation will generally be treated as a passive foreign investment company a pfic if  percent or more of its income is passive income or if  percent or more of its assets are held to produce passive income if your trust purchases shares in a pfic you may be subject to us federal income tax on a portion of certain distributions or on gains from the disposition of such shares at rates that were applicable in prior years and any gain may be recharacterized as ordinary income that is not eligible for the lower net capital gains tax rate additional charges in the nature of interest may also be imposed on you certain elections may be available with respect to pfics that would limit these consequences however these elections would require you to include certain income of the pfic in your taxable income even if not distributed to your trust or to you or require you to annually recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of the shares of the pfic thus requiring you to recognize income for federal income tax purposes in excess of your actual distributions from pfics and proceeds from dispositions of pfic stock during a particular year dividends paid by pfics are not eligible to be taxed at the net capital gains tax rate new york tax status based on the

registered public accounting firm as set forth in their report thereon appearing elsewhere herein and is included in reliance on such report given on the authority of such firm as experts in accounting and auditing description of ratings standard  poors issue credit ratings a standard  poors issue credit rating is a forwardlooking opinion about the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation a specific class of financial obligations or a specific financial program including ratings on mediumterm note programs and commercial paper programs it takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated the opinion reflects standard  poors view of the obligors capacity and willingness to meet its financial commitments as they come due and may assess terms such as collateral security and subordination which could affect ultimate payment in the event of default issue credit ratings can be either longterm or shortterm shortterm ratings are generally assigned to those obligations considered shortterm in the relevant market in the us for example that means obligations with an original maturity of no more than  days including commercial paper shortterm ratings are also used to indicate the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to put features on longterm obligations the result is a dual rating in which the shortterm rating addresses the put feature in addition to the usual longterm rating mediumterm notes are assigned longterm ratings the ratings and other credit related opinions of standard  poors and its affiliates are statements of opinion as of the date they are expressed and not statements of fact or recommendations to purchase hold or sell any securities or make any investment decisions standard  poors assumes no obligation to update any information following publication users of ratings and credit related opinions should not rely on them in making any investment decision standard  poors opinions and analyses do not address the suitability of any security standard  poors financial services llc does not act as a fiduciary or an investment advisor while standard  poors has obtained information from sources it believes to be reliable standard  poors does not perform an audit and undertakes no duty of due diligence or independent verification of any information it receives ratings and credit related opinions may be changed suspended or withdrawn at any time longterm issue credit ratings issue credit ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations o likelihood of paymentcapacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation o nature of and provisions of the obligation o protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangement under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights issue ratings are an assessment of default risk but may incorporate an assessment of relative seniority or ultimate recovery in the event of default junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy as noted above such differentiation may apply when an entity has both senior and subordinated obligations secured and unsecured obligations or operating company and holding company obligations aaa an obligation rated aaa has the highest rating assigned by standard  poors the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong aa an obligation rated aa differs from the highestrated obligations only to a small degree the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong a an obligation rated a is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higherrated categories however the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong bbb an obligation rated bbb exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation obligations rated bb b ccc cc and c are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics bb indicates the least degree of speculation and c the highest while such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions bb an obligation rated bb is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation b an obligation rated b is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated bb but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation adverse business financial or economic conditions will likely impair the obligors capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation ccc an obligation rated ccc is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation in the event of adverse business financial or economic conditions the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation cc an obligation rated cc is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment c a c rating is assigned to obligations that are currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment obligations that have payment arrearages allowed by the terms of the documents or obligations of an issuer that is the subject of a bankruptcy petition or similar action which have not experienced a payment default among others the c rating may be assigned to subordinated debt preferred stock or other obligations on which cash payments have been suspended in accordance with the instruments terms or when preferred stock is the subject of a distressed exchange offer whereby some or all of the issue is either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other instruments having a total value that is less than par d an obligation rated d is in payment default the d rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired unless standard  poors believes that such payments will be made during such grace period the d rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on an obligation are jeopardized plus  or minus  the ratings from aa to ccc may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories nr this indicates that no rating has been requested that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating or that standard  poors does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy guggenheim defined portfolios guggenheim portfolio prospectuspart b october   where to learn more you can contact us for free information about this and other investments visit us on

trust this opinion applies only to the trust holders of beneficial interests in the trust are referred to herein as the unitholders in this connection we have examined the registration statement and the prospectus for the fund the prospectus the indenture and such other instruments and documents as we have deemed pertinent the transaction documents for purposes of this opinion we are assuming that the trust will at all times be operated in accordance with the indenture and the prospectus and that the parties to the indenture will at all times fully comply with the terms of the indenture failure to operate the trust at all times in accordance with the indenture and the prospectus or failure to comply fully at all times with the terms of the indenture could result in tax treatment different from that described below you have informed us and we are assuming that the assets of the trust will consist of a portfolio as set forth in the prospectus all of the assets of the trust constitute the trust assets you have not requested us to examine and accordingly we have not examined any of the trust assets and express no opinion as to the federal income or state tax treatment thereof the transaction documents include certain representations by the depositor and the trustee with respect to which we have no independent knowledge and have done no independent investigation such representations include without limitation that i the trust will acquire and hold the trust assets solely for the account of the unitholders ii the activities of the trust will consist of the investment of funds in the trust assets the collection of the income and proceeds from such investments and the incidental replacement of trust assets and temporary reinvestment of proceeds under limited and specified circumstances and iii the trust has not and will not a establish an office b hire employees or c conduct any acts not permitted by the indenture based upon the foregoing and assuming the accuracy of the aforementioned representations and assumptions on the date hereof as well as continuing satisfaction of such representations and assumptions and based upon an investigation of such matters of law as we consider to be applicable i we are of the opinion that under existing united states federal income tax law the trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes but will be classified as a grantor trust and will be governed by the provisions of subpart e of part i of subchapter j relating to trusts of chapter  of the internal revenue code of  the code ii section  of the code provides that where a trust grantor is treated as the owner of any portion of a trust there shall then be included in computing the taxable income and credits of the grantor those items of income deductions and credits against tax of the trust which are attributable to that portion of the trust to the extent that such items would be taken into account under the code in computing taxable income or credits against the tax of an individual each unitholder is treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the trust under section  of the code therefore a unitholder will be considered as owning a pro rata share of each of the trust assets in the proportion that the number of units held by him or her bears to the total number of units outstanding we are of the opinion that under existing united states federal income tax law a under subpart e subchapter j of chapter  of the code income of the trust will be treated as income of each unitholder in the proportion described above and an item of trust income will have the same character in the hands of a unitholder as it would have if the unitholder directly owned a pro rata portion of the trusts assets and b each unitholder will be considered to have received his or her pro rata share of income derived from each trust asset when such income would be considered to be received by the unitholder if the unitholder directly owned a pro rata portion of the trusts assets iii although the discussion in the prospectus under the heading taxes does not purport to discuss
