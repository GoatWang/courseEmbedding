capital  wikipedia mezzanine capital from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search in finance mezzanine capital is any subordinated debt or preferred equity instrument that represents a claim on a companys assets which is senior only to that of the common shares mezzanine financings can be structured either as debt typically an unsecured and subordinated note or preferred stock mezzanine capital is often a more expensive financing source for a company than secured debt or senior debt the higher cost of capital associated with mezzanine financings is the result of its being an unsecured subordinated or junior obligation in a companys capital structure ie in the event of default the mezzanine financing is only repaid after all senior obligations have been satisfied additionally mezzanine financings which are usually private placements are often used by smaller companies and may involve greater overall levels of leverage than issues in the highyield market they thus involve additional risk in compensation for the increased risk mezzanine debt holders require a higher return for their investment than secured or more senior lenders contents  structure  uses of mezzanine capital  leveraged buyouts  real estate finance  see also  references  external links structureedit mezzanine financings can be completed through a variety of different structures based on the specific objectives of the transaction and the existing capital structure in place at the companycitation needed the basic forms used in most mezzanine financings are subordinated notes and preferred stock mezzanine lenders typically specialist mezzanine investment funds look for a certain rate of return which can come from each individual security can be made up of any of the following or a combination thereof cash interest a periodic payment of cash based on a percentage of the outstanding balance of the mezzanine financing the interest rate can be either fixed throughout the term of the loan or can fluctuate ie float along with libor or other base rates pik interest payable in kind interest is a periodic form of payment in which the interest payment is not paid in cash but rather by increasing the principal amount by the amount of the interest eg a  million bond with an  pik interest rate will have a balance of  million at the end of the period but will not pay any cash interest ownership along with the typical interest payment associated with debt mezzanine capital will often include an equity stake in the form of attached warrants or a conversion feature similar to that of a convertible bond the ownership component in mezzanine securities is almost always accompanied by either cash interest or pik interest and in many cases by both mezzanine lenders will also often charge an arrangement fee payable upfront at the closing of the transaction arrangement fees contribute the least return and their purposes are primarily to cover administrative costs or as an incentive to complete the transaction the following are illustrative examples of mezzanine financings  million of senior subordinated notes with warrants  cash interest  pik interest and warrants representing  of the fully diluted ownership of the company  million of redeemable preferred stock with warrants  cash interest  pik interest and warrants representing  of the fully diluted ownership

return of  to  this return must be achieved through means other than simple cash interest payments as a result by using equity ownership and pik interest the mezzanine lender effectively defers its compensation until the due date of the security or a change of control of the company mezzanine financings can be made at either the operating company level or at the level of a holding company also known as structural subordination in a holding company structure as there are no operations and hence no cash flows the structural subordination of the security and the reliance on cash dividends from the operating company introduces additional risk and typically higher cost this approach is taken most often as a result of the companys existing capital structure uses of mezzanine capitaledit leveraged buyoutsedit in leveraged buyouts mezzanine capital is used in conjunction with other securities to fund the purchase price of the company being acquired typically mezzanine capital will be used to fill a financing gap between less expensive forms of financing eg senior loans second lien loan high yield financings and equity often a financial sponsor will exhaust other sources of capital before turning to mezzanine capital financial sponsors will seek to use mezzanine capital in a leveraged buyout in order to reduce the amount of the capital invested by the private equity firm because mezzanine lenders typically have a lower target cost of capital than the private equity investor using mezzanine capital can potentially enhance the private equity firms investment returns
