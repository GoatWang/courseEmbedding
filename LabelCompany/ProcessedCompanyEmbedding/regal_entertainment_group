several navigations from movie ticket home page what has happened to aaa this used to be easy and worth the discount years ago comment by aaa hello colleen were sorry to hear youre having some difficulty locating our movie tickets all our available tickets are shown at httpsmidatlanticaaacomstoretravelmovie i will respond directly with direct links for your convenience as well thank you rating  regal movie pack the regal premiere movie tickets pack at  is actually more expensive for a senior than the ticket price at the theatre they are  at the theatre so would pay  more through aaa i take it aaa is making a profit on these comment by aaa hello jeff our movie packs typically provide savings on the adult box office rate we encourage you to check with your theater for senior matinee or other discounts to get the best value rating  ms very unhappy to find out that i could have purchased regal movie tickets cheaper via the aaa website than in person thats ridiculous last time i do this comment by aaa hello kelly i apologize there was a pricing difference between the aaa website and the store you visited pricing for our movie partners can vary by store location and market due to box office pricing differences rating  please add an option for a pack of tickets with our family of four we would love to have the option to purchase a pack of discounted movie tickets comment by aaa hi vanessa thanks for the suggestion on pack tickets to keep our prices low we currently offer just a pack online but keep in mind tickets can be purchased individually in our aaa store locations visit our store locator to find the store nearest you thanks for being a aaa member rating  hpm ticket areas are wrong the aaa site indicates that a number of theatres in the dc area require hpm tickets their list is incorrect according the regal site httpscorporateboxofficecomtermsconditions the only dc area theatres that require hpm tickets are regal laurel towne centre  and regal rockville center stadium  soon the remodeled theatre at ballston in va will probably be added i have used the regular tickets at all other regal theatres in the dc area most notably hyattsville and silver spring comment by aaa hi rodney thanks for bringing this to our attention while we work with regal to update our ticket availability based on regals recent changes we are offering our lowest priced premiere tickets which will work at all regal cinemas surcharge fees still apply to all imax rpx d dx films and premium or luxury seating locations should you need assistance with a recent order please contact us at aaamerchandiseordersaaamidatlanticcom rating  need to lower the price so we get a discount because of the increase we will see less movies there comment by aaa hello charles thanks for your recent review due to increases in box office prices we have also experienced an increase in the discounted pricing we are able to offer although the pricing has increased these discount tickets will still provide savings in most cases on regular adult box office rates rating  better than aarp the pk regal for  is a much better price than aarp prices where it is  and you have to fork over  rewards for goods points comment by aaa hi theresa we are happy we were able to provide savings to you on your regal movie tickets thanks for being a valued aaa member rating  question about regal tickets we used to be able to get regal cinema tickets on your website for ticket and were able to print them out at home what happened to that option comment by aaa hi lori we havent offered this option yet but we are looking to offer the option to print at home in the future in the meantime we encourage you to visit a aaa store if you are in need of tickets right away due to the increase in prices at the box office we have needed to adjust our prices accordingly  but you should still find a savings compared to the adult regular box office rates rating  regal movie tickets decent discount but regal oxford valley now tacks on  per ticket due to reclining seats in addition you cannot use these tickets to reserve seats beforehand so have to get to the theater early to get decent seats regalfandango should allow a way to enter ticket info online to reserve seats comment by aaa thanks for your feedback we hope the theater will offer this option in the future as well rating  regal movie tickets why are you not selling the restricted movie tickets we usually wait  weeks until we see a movie so those less expensive tickets suit us fine comment by aaa thank you for your review while we would like to continue to offer these tickets regal entertainment group has discontinued offering the vip restricted movie tickets as of august   and we have since run out of stock rating  aaa discount movie tickets good member benefit but not as good as costco where the same pk is available for  in store and even better costco also offers an instant downloadprint tickets at home option for  for a pk of tickets which is most appealing to those of us who usually make last minute plans to go to the movies comment by aaa thank you for your review we appreciate your feedback and are now offering our members the pack of movie tickets at better value keep in mind our convenient aaa retail store locations carry movie tickets in stock for those last minute occasions rating  regal movie tickets your prices are not a discount we can buy senior tickets for  each plus we get points toward free tickets comment by aaa thank you for your valuable feedback our tickets typically provide a generous discount off the standard adult box office rate in some instances a senior or matinee rate when eligible at the theater may be more beneficial to you we encourage
