home park fund it is very exciting to both have a few dozen accredited investors backing our partnership and coowning parks with us and to be able to reward them with such a strong initial acquisition the property’s occupancy increased during our closing period and we look forward to upgrading the quality of the mobile homes in the property we acquired desert trails httpwwwdeserttrailsmhpcom at a  cap rate and specialize in improving this type of commercial property we can’t make guarantees about profits but feel we will likely generate a better than  annual return this first year for our limited partners many of our investors are becoming increasingly nervous about valuations in the public markets and would prefer to invest in lower volatility real estate niches that still offer annual returns that are likely to be in the upper teens over a longterm holding period judging from some of the large manufactured housing reits we estimate manufactured housing communities have a beta of around  and we feel psp can generate consistent annual returns in the highteens for our early coinvestors also important to note is that this asset class is not correlated with stock markets or other real estate niches” said jefferson lilly cofounder of psp “park street partners is about more than just making money for our investors we are increasing the supply of affordable housing for american families we rehab and purchase mobile homes to fill vacancies while improving property operations through professional management” remarked brad johnson cofounder of psp “we were very happy
