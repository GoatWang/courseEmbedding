proceedings of the us and russia workshops are being published separately by wtec the panels conclusions include the following  in the synthesis and assembly area chapter  the us appears to be ahead with europe following and then japan  in the area of biological approaches and applications chapter  the us and europe appear to be rather on a par with japan following  in nanoscale dispersions and coatings chapter  the us and europe are again similar with japan following  for high surface area materials chapter  the us is clearly ahead of europe and then japan  in the nanodevices area chapter  japan seems to be leading quite strongly with europe and the us following in the area of consolidated materials chapter  japan is a clear leader with the us and europe following these and other

nanostructure science and technology r  d status and trends in nanoparticles nanostructured materials and nanodevices by r w siegel book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide timely information on scientific and engineering developments occurring in laboratories around the world provides critical input to maintaining the economic and technological strength of the united states moreover sharing this information quickly with other countries can greatly enhance the productivity of scientists and engineers these are some of the reasons why the national science foundation nsf has been involved in funding science and technology assessments comparing the united states and foreign countries since the early s a substantial number of these studies have been conducted by the world technology evaluation center wtec managed by loyola college through a cooperative agreement with nsf the national science and technology council nstc committee on technologys interagency working group on nanoscience engineering and technology ctiwgn worked with wtec to develop the scope of this nanostucture science and technology report in an effort to develop a baseline of understanding for how to strategically make federal nanoscale r  d investments in the coming years the purpose of the nstcwtec activity is to assess r  d efforts in other countries in specific areas of technology to compare these efforts and their results to us research in the same areas and to identify opportunities for international collaboration in precompetitive research many us organizations support substantial data gathering and analysis efforts focusing on nations such as japan but often the results of these studies are not widely available at the same time government and privately sponsored studies that are in the public domain tend to be input studies   more fewer audience level     kids general special   audience level  from  for

inflammation unit immunoregulation section click on caption richard siegel md phd chief immunoregulation section autoimmunity branch ab phone   fax   email siegelrmailnihgov research overview the goal of the immunoregulation group is to understand how alterations in regulatory signaling pathways in immune cells lead to abnormal immune responses chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases the tnf family of cytokines is the main focus of present work as these cytokines are critical in the pathogenesis and treatment of a number of different autoimmune and inflammatory diseases we are particularly interested in how membraneproximal events in receptor signal transduction can be influenced by environmental or other signals to alter cellular responses since understanding these principles may aid in designing more effective therapeutic strategies to modulate the effects of tnfreceptor family signaling in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases   the general strategy of the lab is to better understand basic mechanisms of transmembrane signal transduction by selected tnf family receptors using the both cell and molecular biology approaches we are also interested in studying the role of particular tnf family ligandreceptor systems in immune cells through mouse models recently the lab has focused on three members of the tnfreceptor superfamily fas and fas ligand the fas receptor has been shown to be important in immunoreceptormediated apoptosis of activated t and b lymphocytes both humans and mice with germ line mutations in the death receptor fas accumulate abnormal lymphocytes and develop systemic autoimmunity while most patients with nonfamilial autoimmune disease do not carry germ line fas mutations there is evidence that fasmediated apoptosis may be impaired in the milieu of chronic inflammation we have been investigating what signals regulate fasmediated apoptosis in t cells with the eventual aim of harnessing these discoveries to modulate fasinduced apoptosis for therapeutic goals in human disease we have recently identified the rac family of small gtpases as critical regulators of fasinduced apoptosis we are also studying the regulation of fasl trafficking and function and are studying the role of the wiskottaldrich syndrome protein wasp in this process tnf receptor  tnfr this receptor is critical for triggering inflammatory responses in myeloid cells of the immune system and other organ systems and has been successfully targeted by biologic therapeutics in rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases we are working with the genetics and genomics branch in niams to understand the pathophysiology of inflammation in patients with the tnf receptor associated periodic syndrome traps a genetic autoinflammatory disease associated with dominant mutations in tnfr we have recently discovered that tnfr mutant molecules associated with traps are misfolded and accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum we are characterizing the mechanisms by which these mutant receptors lead to hyperactivity of the innate immune system dr the function of this tnffamily receptor highly related to tnfr but expressed mainly on lymphocytes has not been well characterized we are investigating novel contributions of this receptor and its ligand tla to the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases selected publications klebanoff ca scott cd
