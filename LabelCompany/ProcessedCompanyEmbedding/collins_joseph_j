integrative and functional approach my practice encompasses adrenal thyroid and glycemic function as well as women’s hormone health and men’s hormone health through support of optimal cellular signaling which i support with foods nutrients phytotherapies essential fatty acids coenzymes adjuvant therapies and systemic enzyme therapy by training i am both a naturopathic physician and a registered nurse i am licensed as a naturopathic physician by the state of washington i graduated in  with a doctor of naturopathic medicine degree from the national college of naturopathic medicine in portland and have been licensed as a naturopathic doctor nd since while residing in the state of florida i use the designation “registered nurse naturopathic doctorate” because florida does not yet recognize naturopathic physicians in this state as a registered nurse in the state of florida i limit healthcare to that allowed by my license and use my naturopathic doctorate in an educational capacity i have been a licensed healthcare practitioner since  beginning as a nursein addition to my clinical experience i have had the honor of being a consultant advisor and educator in the nutritional and diagnostic industries beginning my work with hormone health and herbal medicinei became aware of the effects of poor hormone health while i was young i believe i was in junior high th to th grade when it was noticed that the front of my neck was swollen i was diagnosed with hashimotos hypothyroidism and started on thyroid replacement this resulted in a dramatic growth spurt over the summer as my body was catching up for delayed growth that was caused by the hypothyroidism the growth was so extreme that i developed osgoodschlatter disease which is a painful bump just below each knee and is most often seen in young adolescents i still recall clearly how when i went back to school in the fall all of my classmates had shrunken and they had to tilt there heads back to look up at me since both of my parents were registered nurses i had access to the merck manual and started reading about thyroid disease and other diseases before i started high school i was also fascinated by plants and herbal medicine and had a read a few herbals by the time i graduated from high school women and testosteronein  shortly after starting my practice as a naturopathic physician i quickly noted that salivary hormone tests for premenopausal and menopausal women only included estradiol and progesterone i remember reading somewhere that women has testosterone so i asked a lab in seattle to measured testosterone in women this eventually resulted in my working at the laboratory in  as director of technical services at national biotech laboratories i added testosterone assays to both menopause and female hormone profiles the validity was immediately recognized throughout the laboratory industry that it was quickly adopted by every other saliva testing laboratory lab tests advancesduring that time the phrase estrogen dominance was relatively new unfortunately it was being use to promote the use of progesterone i say unfortunately because lab tests saliva urine blood often showed that women actually had normal estrogen levels but were deficient is progesterone  at that time i defined what the proper relationship between progesterone and estradiol should be based on objective lab tests and added pe ratio analysis to menopause and female hormone profiles that advancement that was also adopted by every other saliva testing laboratory national biotech laboratories merged with gsdl now called genova labs and i moved to ashville for a few years to help with the transition and continued developmentmy work with integrative laboratories also involved the development of primary secondary and tertiary interpretive commentary this smart commentary replaced the cut and paste block text that was being used in the s now smart commentary is the gold standard to lab test interpretationsredefining menopausein my clinical practice based on my testing of estradiol progesterone  testosterone i noticed tremendous variability in how each woman experienced menopause because all three hormones were being tested it was pretty obvious that these significant variations in menopause was due to different patterns of estradiol progesterone  testosterone since i was measuring testosterone in women by  i had defined the twelve major menopause patterns based on the variations in estradiol progesterone  testosterone to my surprise a number of women actually had elevated testosterone levels while teaching these observations at a medical conferences with pharmacists and physicians a book company asked me to write a book on my findings the book was published as a hardback in  and then as the softback edition  discover your menopause type” in  changing how menopause was evaluatedalso in  i presented a paper and a presentation to am titled salivary hormone testing science benefits limitations  clinical applications that concepts which are discussed in that paper are is salient to day as they were in  while salivary hormone testing is a valuable diagnostic tool it must be used properly to get accurate results just as important we need to be open about its limitations so that we can use collection schedules that overcome these limitations  bioidentical hormone replacement therapyadvances in hormone health are also in a very large part due to the availability of customized dosages of bioidentical hormone replacement therapy bhrt this advance is safeguarded by the skills of compounding pharmacist unfortunately bhrt has unrightfully been maligned by opposing interests because of my extensive work with compounding pharmacists i have been published twice in the international journal of pharmaceutical compounding one of those articles is a polemic against the misinformation and propaganda attacks on bhrt that article is licensed to sharing in order to raise both professional and public awareness of our need to protect individualized care and of the many benefits of pharmaceutical compounding please take time to read it hormone therapy it’s time for a second opinion phytocrine™  phytocrinology™  phytocrinologist™ my work with hormone health also focused largely on the effect that specific plant extracts that could not only improve the function of glands and tissues that produce hormones but also specific plant extracts that could improve the function of tissues that respond to hormones i believed that by design we were given plants that could affect our hormone health far beyond the rudimentary ideas about “phytoestrogens” that limited our understanding of phytotherapeutic applications in endocrinology in  i created the phytocrine™ model of endocrine therapy based on a specialized field of science i call phytocrinology™ as a phytocrinologist™ i continue to scour through the scientific literature to continue to learn about the unique relationship that humans have with plants there are links below for newsletters i have written on phytotherapy phytotherapy formulationsmy clinical practice included extensive use of herbal therapies phytotherapy for endocrine disorders and i notice that specific herbs had different affinities for different hormones while it was pretty common knowledge that some herbs affected estrogens such as phytoestrogens and we were beginning to see that some herbs were more androgenic affecting testosterone i also found that others were more likely to affect progesterone function this is an important observation since menopause had different hormone patterns and the “onesizefitsall” herbal therapies that were widely available turned out to be just as inadequate as the “onesizefitsall” pharmaceutical hormones hormone specific™ formulationsrecognizing a need for more advanced herbal therapies that would address the specific hormone problem i developed the unique line of hormone specific formulations™ the formulations started with the first generation of estromend™ to specifically improve estrogens function and  progestomend™ to increase the production and function of progesterone they also included testogain™ to increase the production and function of testosterone the first generation of what has been upgraded to testoquench™ for women was also in the initial formulations to help those women who have androgen excess disorders such as pcospcolike syndrome as well as some menopause types® and some forms of pmspmdd over the years the formulations have been expanded to include testoquench™ for men for men with abnormal androgen metabolism such as those with prostate disorders estroquench™  which is used by both women and men was formulated to quench excessive production of estrogens by supporting endogenous aromatase inhibition functions without adversely depressing the production and function of testosterone or other androgens the thyromend™ was created to improve thyroid hormone function – which proved to be especially helpful in people who were not getting better even though they were on a good thyroid prescriptionthe adrenomend™ was added to address the complexities of what is popularly described as adrenal fatigue and adrenal dysfunction once you read the education module on adrenal health you will see that these fatigue disorders involve much more than the adrenal glands the hormone specific™ formulations also include endocrine complete™ to provide support of endogenous hormone production by the entire endocrine systemthese formulations are all manufactured and distributed by douglas laboratories the provider of the highest quality nutritional supplements  learn more about the hormone specific formulations™why i chose douglas laboratoriessince i have been a consultant to a number of nutritional supplement companies since the early ’s i have been aware of the benefits of choosing only high quality herbal and nutritional supplements consistent potency of product formulation ensures clinical success i learned that new innovations and experience both count when it comes to choosing nutritional supplementsdouglas laboratories has been in the nutraceutical industry for over  years they actually manufacture their own products using stateoftheart manufacturing and very stringent quality control measures including iso  certification and iso  accreditation of their laboratories cgmps current good manufacturing practices sops standard operating procedures and a vcp vendor certification program ensures raw material safety and quality they are in full compliance with the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of  assuring safety and uninterrupted flow of all raw materials they are also the industry’s first fully electronic bar code driven paperless manufacturing system to pass the fda’s rigorous audit with an exclusive verimatch labeling system to ensure verification prior to production and release of all products above that i find their staff and scientists to be very easy to work with and can always count on their support and advice since the hormone health formulations represent a significant part of my life’s work douglas laboratories is best choice for manufacturing and distributing the formulations i designed clinical educationover the years i have authored many articles newsletters clinical documents webinar and presentations and even a few posters for nutritional companies and diagnostic laboratories it is an honor to promote the growth of integrative medicine through continued writing as well as through clinical consultation lab test consultation conference lectures webinars and the development of this websites there are links below for some of the posters and newsletters that i have written while serving as an advisor for douglas laboratories like other integrative healthcare practitioners i realize that almost twothirds of people aged  and older are using some form of complementary and alternative medicine and that those of us who have been involved in integrative healthcare for decades can best serve society by sharing our experience with other practitioners as well as patients in fact this advancement of medical knowledge is part of the oath that healthcare professionals take in my role as an integrative healthcare consultant i advise and assist physicians pharmacists clinics  hospitals in integrating natural therapies such as nutraceuticals and herbals and bioidentical hormone replacement therapy into the care of the patients i have done over  hours of teaching at seminars and conferences and continue to educate and advise other integrative practitioners in the assessment and management of menopause pmspmdd thyroid and adrenal disorders as well as inflammatory diseases and celiac disease i hope that brief summary of my work with hormone health will give some insight into my work and interests here are links to some of the posters and newsletters i have written nutrinews letters published by douglas
