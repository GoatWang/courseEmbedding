understand conversations and case studies hes a wealth of knowledge in the more than ten years that my family and i have known the professionals at altfest personal wealth management we have always been impressed by their depth of knowledge and clientfirst approach their educational seminars have provided me with a deeper understanding of my financial planning needs and have helped me find my investing comfort zone i consider myself lucky to know karen and lewis altfest and to be able to seek advice from their impressive staff i am comfortable to say that i can place my utmost trust in their well researched approach to investing ive worked with lew and karen for the past  years they are recognized industry leaders who are as well respected as anyone in our industry besides being extremely smart they are very personable with a focus on how to help the clients their office is recognized year in and year out as being one of the best in the country as someone who works with

understandable plan of action my wife and i have been clients of altfest personal wealth management for over  years this firm has always put our financial health as their first priority they have protected us and managed to preserve our retirement savings through the dot com and deep recession eras when other advisers were being pressured by their clients to get them into dot com stocks altfests saw to it that we did not get into these risky investments likewise they had us hold tight in the recession and bought stocks when the market was very low suffice it to say we have fared extremely well now that we are in our retirement years we have a well diversified portfolio that includes stocks mutual funds real estate funds real estate and oil partnerships and municipal bonds also it is important to note that they carefully balance your mutual fund investments so there is minimal overlap in investment sectors and minimum costs and fees for each fund the best thing about the alfests is that they take a personal interest in each of their clients we are friends with a number of other clients who share this same experience as far as access is concerned we have always found the firm ready to answer our questions and meet with us at a moments notice on a personal note the alfests are the most ethical people we have ever met they are also very philanthropic karen
