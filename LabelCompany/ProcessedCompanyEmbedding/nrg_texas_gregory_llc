bankruptcy court over cogen plant issues nrg battles at sherwin alumina bankruptcy court over cogen plant issues nov   by barry cassell chief analyst nrg energys nyse nrg gregory power partners llc on nov  at the bankruptcy court for sherwin alumina co llc objected to the bankrupt companys nov  emergency motion to expedite the hearing and objection deadlines on its bankruptcy reorganization and asset sale plan sherwin alumina a maker of alumina a key ingredient in aluminum has been since jan  in chapter  protection at the us bankuptcy court for the southern district of texas gregory power partners gpp supplied the company with steam and some power from an onsite mw cogeneration plant the operation of that cogen plant is endangered by sherwin aluminas actions said nrg sherwin alumina is currently owned by international commodities trader glencore ltd which is now proposing to buy some assets out of the bankruptcy case sherwin alumina had gotten most of the raw bauxite for its facility from noranda with other bauxite supplied by glencore itself gpp said in its nov  objection that sherwin alumina is proposing to collapse the  day twostage process for approving a disclosure statement and confirming a reorganization plan into a truncated single hearing heard on an emergency basis said gpp the emergency motion to expedite is not supported by evidence because the timeline is driven exclusively by glencore’s desire to be finished with its bankruptcy case glencore put sherwin its whollyowned subsidiary into bankruptcy as part of a larger strategy to drive concessions from its supplier noranda its labor union environmental authorities and its powersteam provider gpp glencore’s grand strategy failed when noranda filed bankruptcy and eventually liquidated and now glencore is moving on to its backup plan by proposing to acquire sherwin’s desired assets through a credit bid while leaving behind the more environmentally contaminated assetsnative advertisement whether glencore succeeds will—and should—be examined by this court in the fullness of time what glencore proposes however is a classic strategy to jam all parties including the court by bending the rules to fit glencore’s timetable after nearly a year of incurring the expenses of chapter  the debtors claim they cannot afford the expenses associated with the traditional confirmation process in reality the debtors can control the majority of accruing administrative expenses including professional fees the sherwin facility has largely ceased operations there is no competing chapter  plan or other reason of judicial economy here that has in some cases justified a shortening of the confirmation periods mandated by bankruptcy rule b until sept  of this year sherwin alumina operated a plant in gregory texas that produced aluminum oxide or alumina which is the primary component of aluminum from bauxite sherwin alumina’s facility was historically capable of producing approximately  million metric tons of smelter grade alumina per year until sept  sherwin alumina operated one of the few alumina plants in the world that can refine jamaican bauxite which because of its low quality and cheaper price must be refined using higher temperatures and more energy than higher quality bauxite in  glencore ltd together with certain of its affiliates completed a series of transactions that resulted in glencore acquiring a  indirect equity interest in sherwin alumina  gpp historically provided steam and electricity to the main facility under an energy services agreement a longterm energy supply agreement originally executed in  the energy supply agreement was a longterm takeorpay agreement under which gpp provides steam and electricity necessary to operate the main facility to sherwin alumina gpp’s obligations under the energy supply agreement were guaranteed by equity sponsor nrg energy up to a cap of  million said sherwin aluminas nov  disclosure statement filed with the court the energy supply agreement required sherwin alumina to purchase steam on uneconomic and unreasonable terms the energy supply agreement also did not adequately compensate sherwin alumina for the diminished revenues and high equipment repair costs associated with the prolonged outages that regularly delayed production at the main facility said the disclosure statement upon consummation of the
