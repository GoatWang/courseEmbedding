simple and fast probate and trust inheritance cash advances for the sake of convenience are often referred to as “inheritance loans” “probate loans” “trust loans” or “estate loans” — often by the heirs who are applying for an advance on their inheritance these advances are in fact not loans but are cash advance assignments without interest rates or payment schedules likewise employment status income and credit history are not an issue when applying you are never liable to pay back the assignment advance therefore it is non recourse at the end of the estate or trust process — if funds are not available for repayment your advance will be on us or if it takes longer than we estimated for the probate court or trustee to pay the assignment back to our office — your cost will never increase  once our agreements are executed the numbers never change there are never any surprises because this is not a loan there is no risk of recourse from us for non payment once you receive your

trust fund loan or probate advance once i send in all my documents and estate paperwork it usually takes only a few days to receive your inheritance advance once our office has all your paperwork do i have any extra legal or processing fees to be concerned with when applying for an inheritance cash advance inheritance advance takes care of all processing expenses you are charged only one inheritance advance fee plus a legal fee in the state that your inheritance is based in if i refer an heir from the same estate that my inheritance advance is coming from do i receive a tellafriend fee if so how much do i get for one referral you will receive a tellafriend fee if you refer another heir and that heir is approved for an inheritance advance the amount you would receive is strictly based on the size of the inheritance advance that the other heir is set to receive are there taxes on a probate loan or trust fund inheritance advance there may be if there are federal inheritance taxes imposed the heir or the estate will be expected to pay any taxes associated with an inheritance or an inheritance cash advance or loan if i am receiving an inheritance loan are there ways i can avoid paying inheritance taxes possibly this is an issue your accountant or tax attorney can address with you it generally depends on the total value of the estate also if the deceased had been receiving an income from your inheritance assets if my father’s estate has some debt could this affect my inheritance advance probate loan or inheritance loan in any way if the deceased owed money to various creditors who show up to collect on these debts the debts may be paid out of the estate this could decrease the total inheritance that your father left you and therefore affect your inheritance advance can my husband and i receive my entire inheritance in advance before probate closes most inheritance advances are fifty to sixty percent of the total inheritance that is expected we can only provide you with an inheritance cash advance that is a percentage of the total inheritance you are expecting do you provide inheritance loans for trusts probate loans and hr trust fund loans and probate advances in every region in canada yes we provide probate loans and cash advances as well as trust fund loans and trust cash advances to all regions in canada i am expecting an inheritance from england will inheritance advance give me an inheritance loan we do not provide inheritance cash advances for heirs of estates in the uk the estate must be based in the usa or canada if i am approved for an inheritance cash advance or estate loan in a state where there are no taxes imposed on a person’s inheritance is it still necessary for me to pay taxes federal inheritance taxes may still be imposed will my credit union or local bank provide me with an estate loan even if it is a small advance no banks and credit unions consider inheritance cash advances and inheritance loans too much of a risk to make it a part of their business model traditional lenders will never provide an heir with an inheritance cash advance or inheritance loan of any size if my sisters and i are expecting a cash inheritance from house sale and there are no liquid assets in the estate can i get an inheritance loan for a probate or trust fund inheritance cash advance usually you can but it depends on the value of the property if the property is for sale and the overall saleability of the property my inheritance is in the form of a trust without liquid assets — the trust is based completely on real estate with a great deal of debt can i get approved for an inheritance advance most likely you will not be approved for an inheritance advance if probate has not been filed with the probate court but will be filed soon can i apply for an inheritance cash advance it would be too early to apply for an inheritance cash advance if you have not yet filed for probate however once probate is open it is likely we can help you with a probate loan or probate advance if i am expecting a large inheritance from my grandmother but we are not expecting to file for probate can i still apply for an inheritance advance if there are a good deal of liquid assets in the estate we can only furnish an heir with an inheritance cash advance or an inheritance loan if the estate in question is already in probate or in trust after probate has started if an heir belonging to the estate contests the will in some way does that prevent this heir from applying for a large estate loan or inheritance cash advance it really depends on what the specific will challenges are there is still a good chance this heir may be approved for an inheritance cash advance and that the inheritance advance in question will be the amount the heir wishes it to be can an executor who is also an heir apply for an inheritance cash advance an heir of the same estate who is also an executor can be approved for an inheritance advance contact us mailing address inheritance advance po box  laguna niguel ca   lavue laguna niguel ca  phone  fax  get your free no obligation quote to learn more
