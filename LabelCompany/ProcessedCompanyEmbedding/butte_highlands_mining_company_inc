encryption sequence is hacked all data that is protected by that sequence key is deciphered and stolen by the hacker added protection involves changing the key on static single key encryption however this change causes a large amount of overhead and slows the transmission time down significantly dynamic encryption  interloks patented encryption incorporates a unique encryption sequence that changes continuously so there is never a correlation between data sent and data received this creates minimal impact in time or complexity to the encryptiondecryption execution process keeping things
