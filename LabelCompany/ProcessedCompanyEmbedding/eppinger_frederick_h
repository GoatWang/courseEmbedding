stock drop from a high of  to  a share and its debt rating downgraded five notches below investment grade the outlook for the company was bleak allmerica’s directors looked to the local guy eppinger—a

and i care about the community” eppinger says under eppinger’s leadership allmerica now known as the hanover insurance group inc has set out to become a worldclass insurance institution the company has rebounded financially consistently beating its core earnings and generating top shareholder returns for publicly traded property and casualty companies but eppinger is quick to credit the
