community is aware of vldi run and designed by washed up cfo no facility to go to rd rated web site with crap documents recycled prs no android or ios community approval no company mentioning vldi and yet people talk about million end points some company in stealth integrating vldi washedup cfo bb has designed next cyber crown jewel well actually i have three associates who have seen tested and confirmed that vp works and two of them have had indirect contact with the sales and technical staff and a rd party has tested and verified every keystroke of the code and it passed with flying colors and vp was actually designed and perfected using some of the best software designers in the world people who are currently being used by msft apple google android blackberry sap and others bb has been the guiding force behind their efforts and his concepts have actually changed the way some of the largest software developers in the world are now writing their apps they have several facilities to go to depending upon the need but no walkin office for people to sneak around trying to find out their secrets abuse their employees and generally get in the way besides none of the things anyone would want to see are sitting around on the desks waiting for someone to steal them so it is a nonissue the actual software is under some of the tightest security measures i have ever heard of and for good reason the vp app is trying to stop some of the most dangerous criminal activities in the history of man activities that can literally destroy nations so no rational person would ever think that such information should be made available to anyone who shows up at the door the current website was designed a decade ago and has zero to do with the companys progress or their marketing efforts at this time since all prospects are given a comprehensive data and marketing pack tailored to their specific situation the new modern interactive site is being designed and will be uploaded the second it is actually needed no doubt about it some of the prs have been redundant as bruce has been bombarded by shareholders for information he has done less than a perfect job of keeping us informed about new things that can support the price i have told him that in nearly every conversation and he has made some significant effort to correct that as we have seen in the last four prs as for android ios and company announcements i have no doubt that they are coming tpp ihub newswire drill targets at red cloud mine and exploration upside at magellans arizona silver projectmage jul    pm pura pps and vol
