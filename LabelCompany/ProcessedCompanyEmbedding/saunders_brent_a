a higher valuation than they had before saunders said i remember thinking their logic was soundnegotiations ensued in the days ahead and the deal was announced two weeks later on july  with israelbased teva agreeing to pay  billion — the thlargest pharmaceutical transaction in history according to data provider dealogic long before saunders cemented his reputation as one of the biggest dealmakers in the pharmaceutical industry he was a yearold business owner cutting lawns in the south whitehall township neighborhood where he grew upss landscaping as it came to be known started off simply enough with saunders and his two business partners — his identical twin brother wayne and a neighbor — doing lawn chores for a few neighbors but the brothers always took it to the extremeon snowy days they traded their push mowers for snow shovels rising at  am to clear customers driveways eventually the business expanded into landscaping collecting a few employees fellow neighborhood boys and more than  clients along the way the business even had a company car a  chevy woodpaneled station wagon with  miles on itwith their earnings the brothers saved for college funded ski trips and even bought a trans am before college they flipped the business to a professional landscaper for a few thousand dollars photo gallery at  lehigh valley native brent saunders is one of biggest stars in the pharma industry i think success breeds future success said saunders a  parkland high school graduate who was inducted into the schools wall of honor in  its just something that you develop skills in terms of managing customers and leading people and taking great pride in what you donow  saunders is no longer pushing mowers in the lehigh valley he has rocketed to fame in the pharmaceutical industry through a string of blockbuster deals over the last  years selling two companies for a combined  billion and acquiring another for  billion and thats not including the teva dealsince  he has put together deals for a combined  billionwe applaud brent saunders who in less than six months as ceo has helped to bring about in my opinion one of the best pharma mergers in the last decade legendary investor carl icahn said in a statement following the  billion sale in  of one pharmaceutical company new yorkbased forest laboratoriesa february cover of forbes dubbed saunders wall streets drug dealer painting him as a leader who prioritizes shareholder value over inventing new drugsat allergan headquartered in dublin ireland for tax reasons but operating in parsippany nj saunders is transforming the company into a leader in what he calls growth pharma in the second quarter sales increased for  of the companys top  global brands which include antiwrinkle treatment botox chronic dry eye drug restasis and high blood pressure tablet bystolic the company expects revenues of about  billion this yearthe teva deal expected to close in the first quarter next year will reload allergans balance sheet and saunders soon will have the firepower for another big dealits likely he wont waste much time despite his eightfigure compensation last year he rarely goes on vacation and detests quiet time colleagues of past and present say his selfawareness drive and intelligence make him an effective leader — though saunders struggles to explain why hes drawn to such rolesi dont know i often think about that he said i tend to believe that if im going to be involved in something i want to give it my all  if im in im all in and if im all in i try to bring my best which in many cases winds up being the leader of the activityhes largely avoided controversy to this point though last year the new york attorney general filed suit against actavis later renamed allergan for its effort to convert patients from an older alzheimers drug to a newer pricier version before generic competition moved in after a federal judge ruled against the company it immediately appealed — ultimately to no availdespite saunders local ties his visibility on cable tv — hes a regular on cnbcs mad money — and stature in the pharmaceutical industry many lehigh valley business leaders have never heard of him while saunders is involved in supporting his familys charity work at st lukes university health network and allergan has a small sales office in center valley he lives and works in new jerseysometimes these type of folks fly under the radar said don cunningham president and ceo of the lehigh valley economic development corpin  years saunders has tackled overbilling

japanese family and immersed himself in the foreign lifestyleif youre going to do something you should go all in saunders said so i really wanted to try to have the deepest experience in understanding international culture and ultimately international businessafter receiving a law degree and mba from temple university in  saunders had an important decision to make continue as a lawyer and become a partner one day or do something radicalhe chose to separate from the packsaunders began his career in compliance in  for the thomas jefferson university health system in philadelphia where he had worked part time during law school at the time federal prosecutors had started investigating expenses at teaching hospitals a probe that would expand in the years ahead saunders worked with the federal government and instituted a compliance program which saved jefferson  million when its penalty was handed downin  saunders joined pricewaterhousecoopers focusing on compliance in health care and quickly rising to partner and head of the firms compliance business advisory services group while there he caught the attention of fred hassanhassan hired as ceo of kenilworth nj pharmaceutical company scheringplough in april  was tasked with turning around a company that saw its stock drop more than  percent in the prior two years the tumble came after it agreed to pay a  million fine from the us food and drug administration for repeated manufacturing lapses it also faced investigations into a kickback it paid to a health insurer and the marketing of its drugs for unapproved uses according to the us department of justiceso hassan looked for an outsider with a new mindset who would help clean up the situation he inheritedhe had three candidates saunders then  and two others with more experience hassan chose saunders and the company announced his appointment as senior vice president of global compliance and business practices oct  now as i reflect back ive not been  percent on my selections but that one was one of the best that i made at that time hassan said saunders just went on and on after thatit took a few years for saunders to resolve the legal issues that plagued the company negotiating at least  million in settlements with the federal government between july  and august  according to the justice departmentwith compliance now in good shape saunders career made its biggest shift he became president of consumer health care at scheringplough in mid now responsible for a business unit of products including coppertone dr scholls and claritinthat changed the trajectory or the focus of which way i was going to go careerwise said saunders who implemented a growth strategy in the business unit that included expansion into international marketslater in  his job took him to the netherlands hassan had tasked saunders with integrating dutch biotech group organon biosciences which scheringplough bought for  billion while it was a complicated task saunders successfully completed it and once again proved to his mentor he was ready for the next challengeso when merck  co bought scheringplough in  for  billion scheringplough chose saunders to lead its integration team tom colligan a scheringplough board member from  to  said organon and merck gave saunders a deep understanding of the work left after a megadeal is announced — a skill that would come in handy down the roadwhen he does deals he understands what happens the day after the deal is done said colligan who was vice chairman of pricewaterhousecoopers while saunders was therea star is bornit was saunders old boss hassan now at private equity firm warburg pincus who helped him land his first ceo gig in march  at eyehealth company bausch  lomb there saunders established himself as a rising star in the pharmaceutical industrywarburg pincus acquired bausch  lomb in  for about  billion after the fda reported the companys flagship contact lens solution caused eye infections saunders — as the companys third ceo in four years — was put in charge of a yearold company that hadnt grown in decadessaunders considers his first year at bausch  lomb the toughest job hes had so far in addition to the skepticism surrounding him as a firsttime ceo he said the company had lost its way with product innovation and its employees were demoralizedthere were plenty of people who stood up at a podium on their first day and said i have the plan to change this company only to not be there a year later saunders said and so what i quickly determined in my first  hours there was that no speech was going to change the course of this companydetermined to lead through action saunders spent a lot of time flying around the world to meet with customers as he tried to rebuild the companys team morale and strategy eighteenhour days were the norm during his first three months at bausch  lomb a work schedule that only calmed slightly in the months aheadit was a crazy year saunders saidby march  when bausch  lomb filed for an initial public offering the company under saunders leadership had introduced  new products since  had  products at various stages of development in its pipeline and grew sales at an annualized  percent for the two years ended december  according to documents filed with the us securities and exchange commissionduring the ipo roadshow in late may saunders had just fallen asleep in his new york hotel on the wednesday before memorial day weekend when he got a latenight call from j michael pearson ceo of canadabased valeant pharmaceuticals pearson was interested in buying bausch  lombsaunders canceled his memorial day weekend vacation plans and spent those days orchestrating the deal with valeant the  billion sale was announced days latersaunders — a guy who gets antsy after a day with nothing to do — was then left jobless and eager for his next postin september  he was named ceo of forest laboratories inc where hed been a director since august  he replaced howard solomon who had been the target of public criticism from billionaire icahn a major shareholder in forestin midjanuary  saunders and paul bisaro president and ceo of pharmaceutical company actavis discussed industry trends over dinner at a health care conference in san francisco before long the conversation shifted to each companys strengths and weaknesses and combining started to make more senseand feb   — about five months after saunders took the forest labs job — actavis said it was acquiring forest a deal that closed at  billionthe original plan was for bisaro to head the combined company but as he continued to work with saunders plans changedi now have the opportunity to land i would arguably say the best young ceo in the industry by far bisaro remembers thinking it just didnt make any sense to let him get awayin the actavis cafeteria bisaro offered saunders the ceo job saunders agreed but only if bisaro stayed with the company as executive chairman actavis made the appointments official july  saunders had no shortage of work actavis kept its eye on valeants hostiletakeover bid for botoxmaker allergan an attempt supported by hedge fund billionaire bill ackmanin the fall saunders called allergan ceo david pyott with whom he competed while at bausch  lomb as the takeover situation worsened the two ceos talked more and more if allergan needed a white knight saunders said actavis would listenactavis eventually beat out valeant in the bidding war for allergan in a transaction announced in november  which closed at  billion the years biggest pharmaceutical deal and among the five largest on recordwhile the allergan deal is saunders largest to date hes not ready to declare a victory as he believes a deals success is measured in years — not monthsi think it has all the makings of the most successful deal ive ever done six months into it and certainly the most valuecreating deal ive done six months into it but it would be a question id rather answer in two or three years from nowwhile actavis was widely viewed as the better option over valeant allergans southern california workforce was still hit hard as nearly  employees were laid off in irvine leaving  workers there in late june this year by which point actavis had adopted the allergan name saunders said the cuts were donein terms of consolidation saunders said theres pressure on the health care industry to contain costs and boost production and he expects the integrations to continue moving forwardi think the industry is in the third inning of a nineinning game in terms of consolidation he saidgrowth pharmaif the allergan deal hadnt already made it clear the company made its transformation into a branded growth pharma leader even more obvious with the blockbuster teva deal announced in julythe sale of its generic drug business gives allergan an opportunity to simplify its business and invest in its seven therapeutic areas including eye care aesthetics and womens healthin the teva announcement allergan said it would invest about  billion in research and development this year while saunders called drug discovery critical he said many drugs are discovered by small companies — not big pharma — and allergan needs to spend its money where it adds value we have almost  scientists in our company that work on drug development and so we want to be bestinclass developers saunders said but we dont necessarily have to be discoverersso allergan has been buying commercialready assets and ones that need further development just since its name change the company has announced several acquisitions depressiontreatment developer naurex for  million glaucoma treatment company aquesys for  million dryeye disease treatmentmaker oculeve for  million and kythera biopharmaceuticals for  billionkythera which developed a treatment for double chins will shed  employees at the companys westlake village calif headquarters come nov  as a result of the deal many of the workers saunders said opted for the rich severance packages kythera offered them and decided to find jobs elsewhereit was hard to keep people we did not want to fire that many people he saidin addition to building a deep pipeline saunders is trying to create the best company in our industry by using the skills he developed during his rapid rise to the top — removing excess middle managers getting to know frontline colleagues and surrounding himself with talentsaunders is trying to create an entrepreneurial culture encouraging employees to take risks and learn from their mistakeswhile saunders encourages employees to find their worklife balance he acknowledges hes not the example to follow his days start at  am and end at  pm and he boards an airplane three or four times weekly his schedule doesnt leave much time for hobbies of which he says he has three hanging out with his wife and two children playing golf not as much as wayne wants him to and squeezing in some pitt basketball gamesif he had  more minutes in the day saunders said he would spend it with frontline colleagues he hasnt turned on the imac in his parsippany office in at least a year preferring phone or facetoface contact for everything other than the quick email communication he does on his smartphonehes also determined to get close to his companys products at bausch  lomb he wore contact lenses made with no vision correction — he had laser eye surgery before joining the companysaunders is also a botox user in january after the allergan acquisition was announced and two months before the deal closed he received a fairly full treatment of botox on stage in front of  allergan sales repsmy wife thought i looked a little better he saidanalysts agree saunders is a wellspoken and humble leader who is very responsive and strategic in what hes building at allergan some say theres concern over how fast the transition is occurring but so far saunders has proved capablebut mostly theyre wondering when will saunders make his next blockbuster dealmorningstar analyst michael waterhouse said everyone has their speculations — such as allergans buying irish biopharmaceutical company shire or being scooped up by pfizer — but allergan has a knack for making moves nobody sees comingtheres going to be a lot of eyes on brent saunders to be sure waterhouse saidas for saunders theres no endgame in sight at least not one he will commit to yet money isnt the issue — just for the last six months of  he collected total compensation valued at  million according to sec filings he is trying to build something special at allergan and believes his best days and biggest successes have yet to comemy hope is that allergan is the last business card i have the last company that i work for on a fulltime basis saunders said but my hope is to be here about  years and try to retire when i get closer to he paused five seconds then said and by the

from to you have successfully emailed the post × heres what the head of botoxmaker allergan has to say about drug prices inversions and why carl icahn is not a threat to his longterm plans dan bobkoff jul    am  facebook linkedin twitter email print mike nudelman  business insider you could say it comes with the territory as ceo of allergan brent saunders once received botox injections onstage but at just  he already has fewer wrinkles than most leaders of pharmaceutical companies his fast rise has been driven by dealmaking and it was a deal by his previous company actavis to buy allergan the maker of botox and other drugs that many say saved the company from falling into the hands of the troubled pharmaceutical firm valeant for our series the price of profits we sat down with saunders at the business insider office this interview has been edited for length and clarity dan bobkoff allergan has grown a lot in the last few years through a number of mergers and acquisitions youre not calling allergan big pharma you have a different term for it brent saunders we like to think of ourselves as growth pharma and weve defined growth pharma as companies that invest in innovation but also have a strong topline sales growth profile and the reason thats important is that innovation is the lifeblood of our industry and i think to really have sustained leadership in any therapeutic area you have to continue to innovate thats what we do thats the core of our business growth on the other hand goes to culture and while many in our industry are focused on costcutting and downsizing we want to be a growthoriented company where we look to really drive leadership therapeutically leadership globally and invest in our brands whether that be in science or sales and marketing bobkoff if you were to compare your company to say merck — a big oldline company — how are you different saunders i think that were alike in many regards in that we have a deep respect for innovation and the role of rd i think we differ in how we approach it and we tend to be a little bit more streamlined and a little bit more scrappy we tend to be a little bit more actionoriented not operating with lots of committees or bureaucracy but more individual accountability with a bias to action bobkoff and you do more acquisition than inhouse development saunders well i dont think thats really the best way to think about it we acquire intellectual property or rd assets and then develop them inhouse we have about  people in rd we spend about a billion and a half dollars a year on rd what we dont have are discovery labs what i would tell you is the vast majority of the latestage pipeline of big pharma as we call it comes from external innovation they are sourcing most of those innovations from academia from startups from venturebacked companies and the like we do the same thing we just do it with the absence of being held to the capital structure of discovery laboratories but nonetheless innovation is the lifeblood of what we do samantha lee  business insider bobkoff typically at what point do you acquire the intellectual property how far along is it in the development saunders we tend to look at it across the entire continuum we tend to try to structure for risk so if its earlierstage development lets say preclinical we may do it in a partnership with a discoverybased company if its got proof of concept or early clinical results lets say from human testing we may structure it as an option agreement and allow the smaller more focused company to bring it to a later stage of development phase  or  where we really have strong conviction around the science and the program we will buy it outright and finish it ourselves the antivaleant bobkoff before you arrived valeant wanted to acquire allergan and they famously said that they wanted to slash all rd is it fair to say that the merger you were part of was in response to that saunders it was we at actavis were what was called by many a white knight we were a friendly solution for the old allergan management team in large part i guess because of the hostile attack from valeant and pershing squares bill ackman and so when we stepped in we looked at how we could actually support and grow the company and a good example is old allergan spent about  million in rd and we spent about a billion and a half  so weve actually increased rd expenditure  stakeholders versus shareholders bobkoff when you make decisions what are your priorities how do you decide which stakeholders to take into account and where to prioritize them saunders i really think about two or three constituents as the most important and i think they all kind of work in harmony one we have our shareholders and they have invested their capital in our company and we have to provide a return for them and hopefully above market above industry average returns we have patients where we invest to improve their lives either through treatments for their disease or cure for their illness and then we have our employees and communities that benefit when we do well by the other two constituents bobkoff so would you call yourself a more of a stakeholderview person versus the sort of shareholderfocused view saunders well i think theyre actually very consistent when we do well for patients when we come up with innovation for an unmet need when we can improve a patients life by one of our treatments our shareholders benefit so i dont really view any disconnect between the two if we do right by one the other will do well bobkoff in  george merck — then the head of merck  co — had this famous statement medicine is for the patient not for the profits the profits follow do you also abide by that saunders i think thats fair i think i would caveat that though and id say that doesnt mean you can spend money recklessly right and i think its — bobkoff whats recklessly saunders well i think that you have to make sure that youre investing the corporate resources in a significant way to support that goal for patients you can get distracted and build a big skyscrapertype headquarters a company i came from bausch  lomb did that in rochester and so i think that you have to always make sure that you think about the patient and the shareholder in the same context and if you do that and you stay tight and focused then they live in harmony but they could easily diverge under the name of were doing right by patients bobkoff i get the sense that theres almost nostalgia from some people for the days of the big old companies with massive research labs that would discover drugs and then one organization would bring it all the way to market through the fda are those days over saunders i do think theyre over but i think thats frankly a good thing given the time were in the science of human health has exploded in part because of the human genome in part because of biology and chemistry and how they play together and it is too expensive and too complicated for any one company to corner all the great ideas that lead to drug discovery and so the ecosystem if you will of inventors of scientists of academia and the like is far larger than one company could ever recreate wed rather support that ecosystem and encourage that ecosystem to take on the higherrisk early tough science and let us step in where we can really bring expertise as a pharmaceutical company and that can be in clinical development that could be in pharmaceutical science that could be in regulatory affairs and certainly commercial capabilities and really have a specialization of best interest to really make sure that those investments pay off so that more people want to go into science and invest in taking on those highrisk projects samantha lee  business insider botox bobkoff now before the mergers there was this idea that botox is your pipeline in a vial there are so many uses and more in development is that still the case saunders well yeah i do think botox is still a pipeline in a product is what i like to call it and if you think about it botox has been around for about  years — we have  approved indications we sell more botox for therapeutic indications like migraine or spasticity or oab overactive bladder than we do for wrinkles and were studying it for many other potential therapeutic benefits  potentially depression afib and a whole host of other ones and so were probably not even halfway through understanding the role that botox can play in therapeutic health as well as aesthetic medicine bobkoff how do you prepare for the day when at some point you will run out of uses for it saunders im not worried about it until we probably get to somewhere closer to  so we have plenty of time and i dont spend a ton of time worrying about that risk many other risks but not that one icahns influence bobkoff i was a little bit surprised to hear that you view your role as more of a stakeholder ceo you have the shareholders you have the workers you have the community now you have carl icahn as a big investor and if you look at what happened with apple he really pushed buybacks and then got out pretty quickly so how can you maintain that strategy that view when you have any kind of activist investor on board like that saunders yeah look i view carl as just one of many important shareholders at allergan we listen to all of our shareholders activist and passive and longterm and shortterm shareholders because again we dont have a monopoly on all the best thinking its always good to hear different points of view i think carls intention here is constructive he is an investor he is not looking to be an activist at allergan and so i welcome him and obviously he saw something i also saw which is that our stock was undervalued and thats why we have committed to a  billion share buyback at the close of our teva transaction because our stock is an overwhelmingly great investment in my humble opinion and carl i guess agrees billionaire activistinvestor carl icahn appearing on neil cavutos fox business network show in new york thomson reuters bobkoff what is your relationship with icahn saunders well you know i met carl by being in a slate of directors at first that were in opposition to his slate we met in a bit of a professional conflict but ultimately i became ceo of that company i worked very closely with him i think he was very constructive in advocating for succession planning and a few issues at forest labs and i think it worked out well for all stakeholders shareholders certainly did well — we were able to fund our pipeline in fact today we got one of the drugs approved from back in those days so i think patients ultimately won and employees are in a much stronger more vibrant company today than theyve ever been so i welcome carl and i think hell be a good longterm investor bobkoff icahns being friendly now things are good the stock is supposedly undervalued but if anything goes wrong cant you imagine a day when he becomes an activist isnt that who he is saunders well i think thats always something you worry about and certainly at the flip of a switch he could change his mind and become an activist — and so could many other shareholders or he could just enter or any other activist could enter the stock if something went wrong so i dont spend a lot of time worrying about that rather i stay focused on executing our strategy and making sure we operate our business to the best of our ability and from there you know good things generally do happen bobkoff so if in six months or a year carl icahn or somebody else comes to you and says you know what youre spending too much on rd give more to shareholders do a huge buyback will you say no saunders well id have to understand the facts the one thing ill say is that i would listen to them and ill listen to any shareholder not just carl but its unlikely that we would do that given where we sit today but if the circumstances were different id want to understand why they think that and id be openminded about it but were going to continue to invest in rd were going to continue to invest for innovation unless the system changes dramatically then well react to that bobkoff one of the refrains i hear is that investors have become increasingly shortterm focused pharma biotech are by their very nature a longterm play it takes roughly  years to develop a drug from start to finish so how do you as ceo balance those two things saunders yeah its an excellent point i think that one of the biggest changes in business since i started in this industry  years ago has been a change in view from shareholders around shorterterm performance and i think the way i reconciled it is you really cant focus on one versus the other you have to provide a little bit of something for everybody so you need to have good shortterm performance you have to have sound midterm strategy and performance and ultimately because of the product cycle and the way we innovate over the long term really have conviction around your longterm strategy and so i try to do it all it sounds complicated but its quite simple you need to execute against your business today and maximize all the opportunities that are available to you and your company you need to invest appropriately for the midterm and again really have a strong strategic vision where do you want to take your company long term so you can execute against that and if you do that you know frankly then you dont worry about the activism lydia ramsey  samantha lee  business insider bobkoff have you made any decisions lately where youve had to make a tough call between something that might hurt the share price short term but you know might pay off in say  saunders yeah absolutely we made a huge decision we decided to divest our global generics business to teva for  billion a highly dilutive transaction we really cut our earnings per share in a time when everyone was doing accretive transactions and i knew that that would create shortterm pain for our shareholders but i also realized that it was the right deal incredibly sound strategic and industrial logic and would allow allergan mid and long term to flourish so we did the deal i led the deal and were close to closing it and it should be a winwin teva should get a very strong strategic asset and well become a very strong strategic branded innovative pharmaceutical company why buybacks bobkoff stock buybacks are fascinating to me theyre very different than dividends but those are often lumped in together i believe you said that you are not a buyback ceo is that still what you believe saunders yeah its a little unnatural for me i think a lot of companies use buybacks to manage their earnings per share to essentially make the denominator smaller to thereby grow earnings we are a growthoriented company thats how we started the conversation we tend to really focus on driving sales growth which leads to earnings growth but in this case i think there are special circumstances where buybacks are appropriate and in this instance where theres in my belief a fundamental disconnect between our share price and our performance where we can take advantage of that and return some capital to our shareholders now we get roughly  billion from the teva deal were spending  of it on share repurchases i would not have been comfortable spending all  as a way of example so i think we did it in a balanced and smart and prudent way but its not a natural move for me to make bobkoff why not put that  billion into rd into paying more staff or hiring more people saunders well we will were going to take about  billion of or half of the proceeds and invest for growth its not easy finding quality investments to deploy capital against we happen to be quite good at it i believe well do it very carefully and thoughtfully but we have plenty of firepower to invest for innovation and growth bobkoff now the criticism i hear of buybacks in general is that as you said they are in some sense a sort of financial engineering a company is measured on earnings per share eps and if you can make the number of s go down then eps goes up and when you actually think about that at a very basic level it just seems like how is that a thing how is that something investors put up with saunders yeah i think thats right i dont think it should be a matteroffact move that just becomes part of the normal capital deployment of the company i think it has to be a special situation or a special event where you deploy a share buyback and thats what were doing here at allergan and thats what got me comfortable with doing something that frankly was a little uncomfortable for me but i think deploying it as just a de facto way of returning capital to shareholders i do think can damage longterm strategy how to price a drug bobkoff there are many companies that say we have to price drugs a certain amount to recoup rd and regulatory expenses and then they pay more than that to do a buyback so is that a little disingenuous do you think saunders well i dont know if its disingenuous you have to look at each situation and understand exactly whats happening and why but look i do think that drug discovery and drug development is an incredibly risky endeavor and i think what gets lost sometimes is that we look at the cost of developing a particular drug and try to then understand how it was priced rather than looking at all the drug development and trying to figure out if the company itself get a return for its investment remember as awful as it sounds to say the winners pay for the losers in drug development and there are more losers than winners and we want to as a society i think encourage companies to look for true opportunities to help people live their lives better whether that be a treatment or a cure and i think to be fair we should be incentivizing our industry to do more to find cures and not just treatments and really have a profound impact on peoples lives bobkoff if you have a drug that went all the way through the process went through regulatory its approved how then do you decide what to charge saunders well you tend to look at a variety of different factors and to be fair we dont just pick a price to set a drug we look at the impact it has on patients and the value of that impact to society we then go out and talk to customers namely managedcare and pharmacy benefit managers and try to understand what they believe that value equation is and how much would they be willing to spend on a drug for their members and we survey doctors and patient groups as well and when you look at all those inputs you then decide how to price a drug where you feel like you can earn a return for the investment youve made in rd but also honor the societal contract we have which is to price our drugs inline with the value they provide to society  ultimately at the end of the day we as a society should be figuring out ways to incentivize industry to come up with more cures for unmet need and really help patients bobkoff do we have those incentives saunders well i think they are questionable i think a lot of the incentives in the industry today are through no fault of anyone they are the way the system was designed is to really incentivize treating chronic treatment and so i think were going to have to wrestle with this issue as the science has really started to advance and we can start talking about cures were at the cusp of a lot of gene therapy moving into cures or potential cures how do we price those things and if we do it wrong we will disincentivize future scientists and investors from supporting early highrisk research to get the next one and so we have to be very sensitive to that a sample of botox seen at the long island plastic surgical group at the americana manhasset luxury shopping destination in manhasset thomson reuters bobkoff on average how much would you say your drug prices go up each year saunders i would say  mid to high single digits thats the gross price not the net price so you know its very complicated we tend to be very cautious about raising drug prices but people should also remember that we continue to invest in the drugs after their approval for example we have a new drug for schizophrenia and bipolar mania that was just approved we are now studying it for bipolar depression or major depressive disorder and negative symptoms which is the holy grail of unmet need in the

index and then i believe most of the other major pharma companies followed suit a few years later we have the prospect of another clinton in the white house and while there are a lot of reasons why merck did that one of them was i presume to avoid a crackdown on prices and i wonder what do you think about that strategy and whether it makes sense now saunders i understand why you would do it to be fair not all drugs are created equal some of these great immunooncology drugs that were just approved that are really changing the way cancer is treated — jimmy carter for example is alive in large part because of these developments when they were launched they were launched for very narrow indications because they were studied very narrowly should we not want them to continue investing to study

price and therefore potentially chill the study of these drugs after they were priced and that could be a mistake so i think we need to be always mindful of how we price drugs and make sure that we make them available for all patients with means or without with insurance or without but i think just taking a blanket approach like they did in the old days could stifle innovation and therefore potentially be dangerous martin shkreli former ceo of turing pharmaceuticals llc appearing before a hearing in washington thomson reuters bobkoff when the news about martin shkreli and turing came out what was your first reaction saunders i didnt have much of a reaction other than you know it was an egregious behavior and for me i think if theres a silver lining of this whole debacle its that the pbns and the insurance industry have closed perhaps a loophole where some of these smaller drugs could be priced without review and i think today its almost impossible for that to repeat itself not because of legislation or regulation but because the private market was so embarrassed by it and rightfully so basically clamped down on the ability for anybody to do that type of thing inversion bobkoff i want to talk about inversions for people who hear all the rhetoric about this for the company what are the advantages of being an irish company for tax purposes saunders i think the perverse nature of one of the issues with inversions is we can more freely invest in the united states as a foreign company than we can as a us company and what most people dont realize when they hear the sound bites that were avoiding paying taxes is its true were avoiding one particular tax which no one pays and that is repatriation and foreign earnings into the united states thats the tax thats being avoided however no one repatriates cash into the united states so thats why theres almost  trillion in us company cash sitting offshore why would you repatriate your cash at a  tax rate when you can borrow against it at  to  and so thats whats happening whether it be apple or it be pfizer or the like — thats the way the system moves because capital will always move efficiently and so the tax thats being avoided has not been paid and never will be paid that being said as a foreigndomiciled company we can use the profits we generate outside the us to invest in the us without borrowing which gives us much greater freedom and flexibility to invest wherever we see fit and the united states happens to be one of the best places to invest that capital so my sense is that if we ever as a country could solve that issue and do true corporate tax reform that  trillion would far and away come screaming back to invest in the united states and that would be a great thing for the economy bobkoff you actually had a little spat with your father about this saunders well it wasnt a spat he was arguing that much like the administration says inversions could be unpatriotic or i think the president called us unpatriotic capitalists and i was arguing that taxes arent a question of patriotism that even the most american companies have tax departments that do everything they possibly can to minimize their tax burden that most individuals will look and try to lower their tax burden to the lowest amount legally possible and its basically you pay what youre legally required to pay no more no less if youre patriotic why werent people just doubling their taxes and sending them in you can pay more the irs would be happy to have more than you owe but he kept insisting and ultimately i said he had moved to florida because it had zero state income tax and zero estate tax and i said look you did a personal inversion essentially left the northeast for florida as people have left california for texas or nevada to lower their tax burden and the unfortunate part of all this is that people will always move to minimize their tax burden however the more resourced wealthier an individual or company can do it better because some people cant afford to move and some companies cant accomplish an inversion and so it really is a system thats screaming for reform and i think corporate tax reform would be a huge boom to the us economy brenton saunders then ceo of actavis and thenallergan ceo david pyott on the floor of the new york stock exchange ahead of the acquisition thomson reuters bobkoff for a company like yours what does it actually mean to be based in ireland do you visit often is there a big office there saunders yeah we do we actually have a meaningful presence there we have a few thousand employees in ireland we make many of our drugs in ireland i visit ireland quite regularly we hold every board of directors meeting in ireland we make all of our strategic decision in ireland so its not just a po box or a mailbox but a meaningful presence for allergan in ireland a moral obligation bobkoff do you think that pharma companies and biotech companies are different than those in other industries is there a moral obligation thats not there for companies that make say cellphones saunders i do think that there is when you really look at the essence of our mission its to create a return for shareholders and to improve patients lives and both of those are important but what other industry can you work in where you come to work every day trying to solve really big important questions that have such a profound and meaningful impact on the people youre solving them for bobkoff what attracted you to healthcare because you dont have a background in it saunders no my first job while i was working through law school and in business school was in a hospital in philadelphia and the point i was just making about this correlation between being able to do interesting work and make a good living and you know in a leadership position return capital to shareholders or return to shareholders and doing really good things in the world i thought was just compelling and thats what attracted me to healthcare and kept me in healthcare bobkoff our series the price of profits chronicles a plusyear shift decades ago ibm and merck executives would talk about taking care of their communities and the workers then there was this shift where the only stakeholders who mattered were shareholders it was especially true in the s and s and i wonder what do you think about that and do you think things are changing saunders frankly things are changing i think they change for the better which is you cant worry about patients and the communities and employees unless youve done well by shareholders and so you know doing well by shareholders is kind of a ticket to play the game to do all the other great things you want to do and so that has caused us to operate our businesses sharper to make sure that were staying on our toes and being competitive and understanding the environment and making sure we make great decisions but it also then allows us to do the other things with greater confidence so you know i think there is no nirvana there is no perfect situation but overall we sit in a very enviable position in the business community to be able to do the things we do and still do great things bobkoff i would argue actually that the ceos of the s and s would have had it the other way around they would say that by taking care of your employees and treating them well and making great products having great customer service the profits come from that do you agree saunders well i think in part it does — theyre all connected in some way — but i do think we live in a different time where information flows so readily and so rapidly and all decisions are evaluated and second and tripleguessed and the like and so shareholders then react differently and theres money in hedge funds and shorterterm funds and thats just the reality so you have to manage your business given the reality that exists today and its not good or bad it just is what it is and i think its completely manageable you just have to have the right mindset and attitude to get through it deals and surprises bobkoff its a tough deal environment right now obviously the pfizer deal fell through what is your focus going forward are you going to do smaller deals and maybe skip some of the crossborder ones saunders were not focused on transformational ma were focused on investing for growth to really support our current business and thats both rd and intellectual property assets as well as growth concerns the one caveat is that whatever it is we buy has to support our agenda for growth and therapeutic area leadership and if they satisfy that strategically then its interesting bobkoff on a personal level what was the biggest surprise in your business career saunders the fact that we actavis could actually buy allergan i mean the old allergan was such a wellrun company with some bestinclass programs great rd capabilities and great people and expertise the fact that that would become available because of a hostile attack from valeant and we could step in as a white knight – i pinch myself and saying i cant believe that actually happened to such a great company but we are where we are and i think weve made it stronger and were very excited about our future more pharmaceuticals allergan bi interview price of profits

longterm plans dan bobkoff jul    am  facebook linkedin twitter email print mike nudelman  business insider you could say it comes with the territory as ceo of allergan brent saunders once received botox injections onstage but at just  he already has fewer wrinkles than most leaders of pharmaceutical companies his fast rise has been driven by dealmaking and it was a deal by his previous company actavis to buy allergan the maker of botox and other drugs that many say saved the company from falling into the hands of the troubled pharmaceutical firm valeant for our series the price of profits we sat down with saunders at the business insider office this interview has been edited for length and clarity dan bobkoff allergan has grown a lot in the last few years through a number of mergers and acquisitions youre not calling allergan big pharma you have a different term for it brent saunders we like to think of ourselves as growth pharma and weve defined growth pharma as companies that invest in innovation but also have a strong topline sales growth profile and the reason thats important is that innovation is the lifeblood of our industry and i think to really have sustained leadership in any therapeutic area you have to continue to innovate thats what we do thats the core of our business growth on the other hand goes to culture and while many in our industry are focused on costcutting and downsizing we want to be a growthoriented company where we look to really drive leadership therapeutically leadership globally and invest in our brands whether that be in science or sales and marketing bobkoff if you were to compare your company to say merck — a big oldline company — how are you different saunders i think that were alike in many regards in that we have a deep respect for innovation and the role of rd i think we differ in how we approach it and we tend to be a little bit more streamlined and a little bit more scrappy we tend to be a little bit more actionoriented not operating with lots of committees or bureaucracy but more individual accountability with a bias to action bobkoff and you do more acquisition than inhouse development saunders well i dont think thats really the best way to think about it we acquire intellectual property or rd assets and then develop them inhouse we have about  people in rd we spend about a billion and a half dollars a year on rd what we dont have are discovery labs what i would tell you is the vast majority of the latestage pipeline of big pharma as we call it comes from external innovation they are sourcing most of those innovations from academia from startups from venturebacked companies and the like we do the same thing we just do it with the absence of being held to the capital structure of discovery laboratories but nonetheless innovation is the lifeblood of what we do samantha lee  business insider bobkoff typically at what point do you acquire the intellectual property how far along is it in the development saunders we tend to look at it across the entire continuum we tend to try to structure for risk so if its earlierstage development lets say preclinical we may do it in a partnership with a discoverybased company if its got proof of concept or early clinical results lets say from human testing we may structure it as an option agreement and allow the smaller more focused company to bring it to a later stage of development phase  or  where we really have strong conviction around the science and the program we will buy it outright and finish it ourselves the antivaleant bobkoff before you arrived valeant wanted to acquire allergan and they famously said that they wanted to slash all rd is it fair to say that the merger you were part of was in response to that saunders it was we at actavis were what was called by many a white knight we were a friendly solution for the old allergan management team in large part i guess because of the hostile attack from valeant and pershing squares bill ackman and so when we stepped in we looked at how we could actually support and grow the company and a good example is old allergan spent about  million in rd and we spent about a billion and a half  so weve actually increased rd expenditure  stakeholders versus shareholders bobkoff when you make decisions what are your priorities how do you decide which stakeholders to take into account and where to prioritize them saunders i really think about two or three constituents as the most important and i think they all kind of work in harmony one we have our shareholders and they have invested their capital in our company and we have to provide a return for them and hopefully above market above industry average returns we have patients where we invest to improve their lives either through treatments for their disease or cure for their illness and then we have our employees and communities that benefit when we do well by the other two constituents bobkoff so would you call yourself a more of a stakeholderview person versus the sort of shareholderfocused view saunders well i think theyre actually very consistent when we do well for patients when we come up with innovation for an unmet need when we can improve a patients life by one of our treatments our shareholders benefit so i dont really view any disconnect between the two if we do right by one the other will do well bobkoff in  george merck — then the head of merck  co — had this famous statement medicine is for the patient not for the profits the profits follow do you also abide by that saunders i think thats fair i think i would caveat that though and id say that doesnt mean you can spend money recklessly right and i think its — bobkoff whats recklessly saunders well i think that you have to make sure that youre investing the corporate resources in a significant way to support that goal for patients you can get distracted and build a big skyscrapertype headquarters a company i came from bausch  lomb did that in rochester and so i think that you have to always make sure that you think about the patient and the shareholder in the same context and if you do that and you stay tight and focused then they live in harmony but they could easily diverge under the name of were doing right by patients bobkoff i get the sense that theres almost nostalgia from some people for the days of the big old companies with massive research labs that would discover drugs and then one organization would bring it all the way to market through the fda are those days over saunders i do think theyre over but i think thats frankly a good thing given the time were in the science of human health has exploded in part because of the human genome in part because of biology and chemistry and how they play together and it is too expensive and too complicated for any one company to corner all the great ideas that lead to drug discovery and so the ecosystem if you will of inventors of scientists of academia and the like is far larger than one company could ever recreate wed rather support that ecosystem and encourage that ecosystem to take on the higherrisk early tough science and let us step in where we can really bring expertise as a pharmaceutical company and that can be in clinical development that could be in pharmaceutical science that could be in regulatory affairs and certainly commercial capabilities and really have a specialization of best interest to really make sure that those investments pay off so that more people want to go into science and invest in taking on those highrisk projects samantha lee  business insider botox bobkoff now before the mergers there was this idea that botox is your pipeline in a vial there are so many uses and more in development is that still the case saunders well yeah i do think botox is still a pipeline in a product is what i like to call it and if you think about it botox has been around for about  years — we have  approved indications we sell more botox for therapeutic indications like migraine or spasticity or oab overactive bladder than we do for wrinkles and were studying it for many other potential therapeutic benefits  potentially depression afib and a whole host of other ones and so were probably not even halfway through understanding the role that botox can play in therapeutic health as well as aesthetic medicine bobkoff how do you prepare for the day when at some point you will run out of uses for it saunders im not worried about it until we probably get to somewhere closer to  so we have plenty of time and i dont spend a ton of time worrying about that risk many other risks but not that one icahns influence bobkoff i was a little bit surprised to hear that you view your role as more of a stakeholder ceo you have the shareholders you have the workers you have the community now you have carl icahn as a big investor and if you look at what happened with apple he really pushed buybacks and then got out pretty quickly so how can you maintain that strategy that view when you have any kind of activist investor on board like that saunders yeah look i view carl as just one of many important shareholders at allergan we listen to all of our shareholders activist and passive and longterm and shortterm shareholders because again we dont have a monopoly on all the best thinking its always good to hear different points of view i think carls intention here is constructive he is an investor he is not looking to be an activist at allergan and so i welcome him and obviously he saw something i also saw which is that our stock was undervalued and thats why we have committed to a  billion share buyback at the close of our teva transaction because our stock is an overwhelmingly great investment in my humble opinion and carl i guess agrees billionaire activistinvestor carl icahn appearing on neil cavutos fox business network show in new york thomson reuters bobkoff what is your relationship with icahn saunders well you know i met carl by being in a slate of directors at first that were in opposition to his slate we met in a bit of a professional conflict but ultimately i became ceo of that company i worked very closely with him i think he was very constructive in advocating for succession planning and a few issues at forest labs and i think it worked out well for all stakeholders shareholders certainly did well — we were able to fund our pipeline in fact today we got one of the drugs approved from back in those days so i think patients ultimately won and employees are in a much stronger more vibrant company today than theyve ever been so i welcome carl and i think hell be a good longterm investor bobkoff icahns being friendly now things are good the stock is supposedly undervalued but if anything goes wrong cant you imagine a day when he becomes an activist isnt that who he is saunders well i think thats always something you worry about and certainly at the flip of a switch he could change his mind and become an activist — and so could many other shareholders or he could just enter or any other activist could enter the stock if something went wrong so i dont spend a lot of time worrying about that rather i stay focused on executing our strategy and making sure we operate our business to the best of our ability and from there you know good things generally do happen bobkoff so if in six months or a year carl icahn or somebody else comes to you and says you know what youre spending too much on rd give more to shareholders do a huge buyback will you say no saunders well id have to understand the facts the one thing ill say is that i would listen to them and ill listen to any shareholder not just carl but its unlikely that we would do that given where we sit today but if the circumstances were different id want to understand why they think that and id be openminded about it but were going to continue to invest in rd were going to continue to invest for innovation unless the system changes dramatically then well react to that bobkoff one of the refrains i hear is that investors have become increasingly shortterm focused pharma biotech are by their very nature a longterm play it takes roughly  years to develop a drug from start to finish so how do you as ceo balance those two things saunders yeah its an excellent point i think that one of the biggest changes in business since i started in this industry  years ago has been a change in view from shareholders around shorterterm performance and i think the way i reconciled it is you really cant focus on one versus the other you have to provide a little bit of something for everybody so you need to have good shortterm performance you have to have sound midterm strategy and performance and ultimately because of the product cycle and the way we innovate over the long term really have conviction around your longterm strategy and so i try to do it all it sounds complicated but its quite simple you need to execute against your business today and maximize all the opportunities that are available to you and your company you need to invest appropriately for the midterm and again really have a strong strategic vision where do you want to take your company long term so you can execute against that and if you do that you know frankly then you dont worry about the activism lydia ramsey  samantha lee  business insider bobkoff have you made any decisions lately where youve had to make a tough call between something that might hurt the share price short term but you know might pay off in say  saunders yeah absolutely we made a huge decision we decided to divest our global generics business to teva for  billion a highly dilutive transaction we really cut our earnings per share in a time when everyone was doing accretive transactions and i knew that that would create shortterm pain for our shareholders but i also realized that it was the right deal incredibly sound strategic and industrial logic and would allow allergan mid and long term to flourish so we did the deal i led the deal and were close to closing it and it should be a winwin teva should get a very strong strategic asset and well become a very strong strategic branded innovative pharmaceutical company why buybacks bobkoff stock buybacks are fascinating to me theyre very different than dividends but those are often lumped in together i believe you said that you are not a buyback ceo is that still what you believe saunders yeah its a little unnatural for me i think a lot of companies use buybacks to manage their earnings per share to essentially make the denominator smaller to thereby grow earnings we are a growthoriented company thats how we started the conversation we tend to really focus on driving sales growth which leads to earnings growth but in this case i think there are special circumstances where buybacks are appropriate and in this instance where theres in my belief a fundamental disconnect between our share price and our performance where we can take advantage of that and return some capital to our shareholders now we get roughly  billion from the teva deal were spending  of it on share repurchases i would not have been comfortable spending all  as a way of example so i think we did it in a balanced and smart and prudent way but its not a natural move for me to make bobkoff why not put that  billion into rd into paying more staff or hiring more people saunders well we will were going to take about  billion of or half of the proceeds and invest for growth its not easy finding quality investments to deploy capital against we happen to be quite good at it i believe well do it very carefully and thoughtfully but we have plenty of firepower to invest for innovation and growth bobkoff now the criticism i hear of buybacks in general is that as you said they are in some sense a sort of financial engineering a company is measured on earnings per share eps and if you can make the number of s go down then eps goes up and when you actually think about that at a very basic level it just seems like how is that a thing how is that something investors put up with saunders yeah i think thats right i dont think it should be a matteroffact move that just becomes part of the normal capital deployment of the company i think it has to be a special situation or a special event where you deploy a share buyback and thats what were doing here at allergan and thats what got me comfortable with doing something that frankly was a little uncomfortable for me but i think deploying it as just a de facto way of returning capital to shareholders i do think can damage longterm strategy how to price a drug bobkoff there are many companies that say we have to price drugs a certain amount to recoup rd and regulatory expenses and then they pay more than that to do a buyback so is that a little disingenuous do you think saunders well i dont know if its disingenuous you have to look at each situation and understand exactly whats happening and why but look i do think that drug discovery and drug development is an incredibly risky endeavor and i think what gets lost sometimes is that we look at the cost of developing a particular drug and try to then understand how it was priced rather than looking at all the drug development and trying to figure out if the company itself get a return for its investment remember as awful as it sounds to say the winners pay for the losers in drug development and there are more losers than winners and we want to as a society i think encourage companies to look for true opportunities to help people live their lives better whether that be a treatment or a cure and i think to be fair we should be incentivizing our industry to do more to find cures and not just treatments and really have a profound impact on peoples lives bobkoff if you have a drug that went all the way through the process went through regulatory its approved how then do you decide what to charge saunders well you tend to look at a variety of different factors and to be fair we dont just pick a price to set a drug we look at the impact it has on patients and the value of that impact to society we then go out and talk to customers namely managedcare and pharmacy benefit managers and try to understand what they believe that value equation is and how much would they be willing to spend on a drug for their members and we survey doctors and patient groups as well and when you look at all those inputs you then decide how to price a drug where you feel like you can earn a return for the investment youve made in rd but also honor the societal contract we have which is to price our drugs inline with the value they provide to society  ultimately at the end of the day we as a society should be figuring out ways to incentivize industry to come up with more cures for unmet need and really help patients bobkoff do we have those incentives saunders well i think they are questionable i think a lot of the incentives in the industry today are through no fault of anyone they are the way the system was designed is to really incentivize treating chronic treatment and so i think were going to have to wrestle with this issue as the science has really started to advance and we can start talking about cures were at the cusp of a lot of gene therapy moving into cures or potential cures how do we price those things and if we do it wrong we will disincentivize future scientists and investors from supporting early highrisk research to get the next one and so we have to be very sensitive to that a sample of botox seen at the long island plastic surgical group at the americana

united states thats the tax thats being avoided however no one repatriates cash into the united states so thats why theres almost  trillion in us company cash sitting offshore why would you repatriate your cash at a  tax rate when you can borrow against it at  to  and so thats whats happening whether it be apple or it be pfizer or the like — thats the way the system moves because capital will always move efficiently and so the tax thats being avoided has not been paid and never will be paid that being said as a foreigndomiciled company we can use the profits we generate outside the us to invest in the us without borrowing which gives us much greater freedom and flexibility to invest wherever we see fit and the united states happens to be one of the best places to invest that capital so my sense is that if we ever as a country could solve that issue and do true corporate tax reform that  trillion would far and away come screaming back to invest in the united states and that would be a great thing for the economy bobkoff you actually had a little spat with your father about this saunders well it wasnt a spat he was arguing that much like the administration says inversions could be unpatriotic or i think the president called us unpatriotic capitalists and i was arguing that taxes arent a question of patriotism that even the most american companies have tax departments that do everything they possibly can to minimize their tax burden that most individuals will look and try to lower their tax burden to the lowest amount legally possible and its basically you pay what youre legally required to pay no more no less if youre patriotic why werent people just doubling their taxes and sending them in you can pay more the irs would be happy to have more than you owe but he kept insisting and ultimately i said he had moved to florida because it had zero state income tax and zero estate tax and i said look you did a personal inversion essentially left the northeast for florida as people have left california for texas or nevada to lower their tax burden and the unfortunate part of all this is that people will always move to minimize their tax burden however the more resourced wealthier an individual or company can do it better because some people cant afford to move and some companies cant accomplish an inversion and so it really is a system thats screaming for reform and i think corporate tax reform would be a huge boom to the us economy brenton saunders then ceo of actavis and thenallergan ceo david pyott on the floor of the new york stock exchange ahead of the acquisition thomson reuters bobkoff for a company like yours what does it actually mean to be based in ireland do you visit often is there a big office there saunders yeah we do we actually have a meaningful presence there we have a few thousand employees in ireland we make many of our drugs in ireland i visit ireland quite regularly we hold every board of directors meeting in ireland we make all of our strategic decision in ireland so its not just a po box or a mailbox but a meaningful presence for allergan in ireland a moral obligation bobkoff do you think that pharma companies and biotech companies are different than those in other industries is there a moral obligation thats not there for companies that make say cellphones saunders i do think that there is when you really look at the essence of our mission its to create a return for shareholders and to improve patients lives and both of those are important but what other industry can you work in where you come to work every day trying to solve really big important questions that have such a profound and meaningful impact on the people youre solving them for bobkoff what attracted you to healthcare because you dont have a background in it saunders no my first job while i was working through law school and in business school was in a hospital in philadelphia and the point i was just making about this correlation between being able to do interesting work and make a good living and you know in a leadership position return capital to shareholders or return to shareholders and doing really good things in the world i thought was just compelling and thats what attracted me to healthcare and kept me in healthcare bobkoff our series the price of profits chronicles a plusyear shift decades ago ibm and merck executives would talk about taking care of their communities and the workers then there was this shift where the only stakeholders who mattered were shareholders it was especially true in the s and s and i wonder what do you think about that and do you think things are changing saunders frankly things are changing i think they change for the better which is you cant worry about patients and the communities and employees unless youve done well by shareholders and so you know doing well by shareholders is kind of a ticket to play the game to do all the other great things you want to do and so that has caused us to operate our businesses sharper to make sure that were staying on our toes and being competitive and understanding the environment and making sure we make great decisions but it also then allows us to do the other things with greater confidence so you know i think there is no nirvana there is no perfect situation but overall we sit in a very enviable position in the business community to be able to do the things we do and still do great things bobkoff i would argue actually that the ceos of the s and s would have had it the other way around they would say that by taking care of your employees and treating them well and making great products having great customer service the profits come from that do you agree saunders well i think in part it does — theyre all connected in some way — but i do think we live in a different time where information flows so readily and so rapidly and all decisions are evaluated and second and tripleguessed and the like and so shareholders then react differently and theres money in hedge funds and shorterterm funds and thats just the reality so you have to manage your business given the reality that exists today and its not good or bad it just is what it is and i think its completely manageable you just have to have the right mindset and attitude to get through it deals and surprises bobkoff its a tough deal environment right now obviously the pfizer deal fell through what is your focus going forward are you going to do smaller deals and maybe skip some of the crossborder ones saunders were not focused on transformational ma were focused on investing for growth to really support our current business and thats both rd and intellectual property assets as well as growth concerns the one caveat is that whatever it is we buy has to support our agenda for growth and therapeutic area leadership and if they satisfy that strategically then its interesting bobkoff on a personal level what was the biggest surprise in your business career saunders the fact that we actavis could actually buy allergan i mean the old allergan was such a wellrun company with some bestinclass programs great rd capabilities and great people and expertise the fact that that would become available because of a hostile attack from valeant and we could step in as a white knight – i pinch myself and saying i cant believe that actually happened to such a great company but we are where we are and i think weve made it stronger and were very excited about our future more pharmaceuticals allergan bi interview price of profits
