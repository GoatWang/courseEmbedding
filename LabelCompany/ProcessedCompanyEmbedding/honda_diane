think theyre built well and will last a very long time you can also go through an automatic car wash with no issues it fits in the upper channel of the window and installation is easy but you do need

easily so you can restart if needed i would recommend also using some type of adhesive in addition because i have had deflectors fall out when the window was rolled down more than once thankfully the rear deflector fell into the vehicle each time so i was able to save it i have had to replace one of the front deflectors because it also fell out onto the highway after a slightly shaky road and was

grayenstanced demon camber you may know it as onicamber youve seen the look and whether you like it or not is totally beside the point the great thing about this stanced look is that it gets your attention from the interviews weve read with owners and drivers of these machines that is exactly what they are after theyve said that its all about being noticedcustom wheels and tires have been around for years and continue to be immensely popular but customizers are always looking for ways to be ahead of the game to be first with a trend it is no longer enough to have the most outrageous set of rims that look can be taken to the next level with stanced cars technically demon camber is extreme negative camber lets explain what negative camber is and how that effect is achievedcamber is one of the alignment specifications which affect the angle or tilt of the wheel compared to the vehicles body if you are looking directly at the front or rear of a car the angle of the tire relative to the ground is the camber look at the illustration below negative camber means that the tops of the tires lean in relative to the cars body zero camber means the tire is perfectly perpendicular to the ground positive camber means the tops of the tires are leaning outmarch  pickup truck cab and bed sizestimothy zahlamericans love to have choices buying a dress shirt decide solid or stripe short

think theyre built well and will last a very long time you can also go through an automatic car wash with no issues it fits in the upper channel of the window and installation is easy but you do need to be careful because it requires you to bend the deflectors slightly if done hastily or improperly they will break if you pull on the lower end of the front deflectors it will come out of the window easily so you can restart if needed i would recommend also using some type of adhesive in addition because i have had deflectors fall out when the window was rolled down more than once thankfully the rear deflector fell into the vehicle each time so i was able to save it i have had to replace one of the front deflectors because it also fell out onto the highway after a slightly shaky road and was

is httpwwwstatenhuscourtssupremehtm the supreme court of new hampshire  hillsboroughnorthern judicial district no  thomas leblanc v american honda motor co inc january   vincent c martina of amherst by brief and orally for the plaintiff shaheen cappiello stein  gordon pa of concord robert a stein and diane perin hock on the brief and mr stein orally for the defendant brock cj the defendant american honda motor co inc honda appeals the special jury verdict of the superior court conboy j holding honda liable for injuries caused by the defective design and failure to warn of the braking and steering properties of its product the honda odyssey for the reasons that follow we reverse and remand on january   the plaintiff thomas leblanc while riding on the back of a snowmobile driven by his friend was injured when the snowmobile collided with an offroad vehicle driven by stephen beaulieu and manufactured by honda the impact of the collision severely injured the plaintiffs leg the plaintiff sued beaulieu and honda alleging negligent operation of the odyssey by beaulieu and asserting a products liability claim against honda the jury rendered its verdict via a special verdict form that contained eight questions agreed to by the parties the jury found that the  honda odyssey contained a design defect which rendered it unreasonably dangerous that the design defect was a cause of the accident that the odyssey was unreasonably dangerous and defective due to hondas failure to adequately warn the driver beaulieu that the failure to warn beaulieu was a cause of the accident that the plaintiff proved all the elements of his negligence claim against beaulieu that negligence or misconduct by the plaintiff contributed to cause his injury that honda was  at fault beaulieu was  at fault and the plaintiff was  at fault and that the plaintiffs total damages were  the superior court ordered judgment against honda for  plus statutory interest and costs and against beaulieu for  plus statutory interest and costs on appeal honda argues  that the plaintiffs trial counsel vincent c martina made improper and inflammatory remarks during the trial and during closing arguments in an attempt to cultivate in the jury a racial and national bias against honda a subsidiary of a japanese corporation  that the trial court erred by admitting previously undisclosed testimony and by allowing a courtroom demonstration and  that the trial court erred by denying the defendants motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict honda first argues that certain remarks made by martina so tainted the proceedings as to deprive honda of a fair trial and that denial of its motion for a mistrial and motion for a new trial on this ground was reversible error we agree the trial court should grant a partys motion for a mistrial if it determines that some circumstance    indicates that justice may not be done if the trial continues to verdict to justify a mistrial remarks or the conduct must be more than merely inadmissible they must constitute an irreparable injustice that cannot be cured by jury instructions because the trial court is in the best position to gauge prejudicial impact it has broad discretion to determine whether a mistrial or other remedial action is necessarystate v martin  nh    ad    citations quotations and brackets omitted see walton v city of manchester  nh    ad    remedial action includes but is not limited to curative jury instructions which the jury is presumed to follow state v lemire  nh    ad    the defendant points to several statements made by martina as grounds for reversal the first directed at hondas vehicle design expert focused on the color scheme of the odyssey martina asked the expert if he knew the color of the japanese flag after honda objected martina explained that he was curious about how the machines color happened to be designed the court decided to give martina some latitude martina then questioned the expert about whether the expert had ever wondered why the odyssey is red white and blue the color of the american flag the second series of statements highlighted by honda occurred during the plaintiffs closing argument whats this case about its not about honda making great automobiles or sony making good walkmans but also its not about pearl harbor or the japanese prime minister saying americans are lazy and stupid     what this case is about is not american xenophobia its about corporate greedcounsel for honda again objected and at a bench conference moved for a mistrial at the bench conference martina explained that he was certain that the fact that the defendant is a foreign corporation had entered the minds of the jurors and he was trying to tell them that that was irrelevant to the case the court denied the motion for a mistrial but warned martina i am however mr martina cautioning you that theres a limit to how far argument can go and i think youre right at the wall on it so please back away from it and focus on the issues in the case the court did not strike the remarks or issue a curative instruction to the jury at the conclusion of the trial the court instructed the jury i try to be fair and impartial just as you are required to be    you must decide the case only on the basis of the evidence and the law as i give it to you you should keep in mind that all parties whether an individual or a corporation are equal before the law    and again you should decide this case without passion without prejudice and without sympathy it is your highest duty as officers of this court to conscientiously determine a fair and just result in this casesee walton  nh at   ad at  the court never instructed the jury specifically with regard to

direct or express annotation statement by counsel relating to race nationality or religion in civil action as prejudicial  alrd    is nonetheless an affront to the court see guerrero  swd at

passed through the courtroom one does not need a forceful reminder willey v ketterer  fd   st cir  honda invites us to declare appeals to racial bias per se incurable although we have considered seriously the adoption of a per se rule of reversal in such cases we believe it better at this time to leave these matters to the sound discretion of the trial court compare walton  nh at   ad at  with guerrero  swd at  such appeals although extremely unprofessional and deplorable must be considered in light of the circumstances of the particular case see lincoln v gupta  nwd   mich ct app

that martinas remarks calculated as they were to encourage the jury to make a decision based on    bias rather than reason and the presented evidence were so prejudicial as to require a new trial walton  nh at   ad at  quotation omitted see border brook terrace condo assoc v gladstone  nh    ad    honda argues that several other remarks made by martina during the trial would also independently mandate a new trial specifically it asserts that martina falsely implied that the odyssey had caused deaths that he wrongly implied that the defendant deprived the jury of valid evidence that he falsely implied that the plaintiff had sustained psychological injury and would only be able to walk with great difficulty and that he improperly expressed his personal opinion the trial court sustained objections immediately instructed the jury or cautioned martina in front of the jury at the time each of these statements was made see lemire  nh at   ad at  jury presumed to follow trial judges instructions because we assume that counsel for the plaintiff knowing that this conduct is inappropriate is unlikely to make the same mistakes on remand we decline to address hondas arguments honda next argues that the trial court erred in permitting the plaintiffs expert to testify regarding testing with a model vehicle the defendant asserts that the admission of previously undisclosed testimony and the courtroom demonstration unfairly surprised the defendant and substantially prejudiced its defense see super ct r  welch v gonic realty trust co  nh    ad    because the model and accompanying testimony will no longer be a surprise in the event of another trial we decline to address this issue next the defendant argues that the trial judge erred in denying its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence on the issues of design defect and causation and inadequate warning and causation we disagree the standard of review of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is well established a party is entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict only when the sole reasonable inference that may be drawn from the evidence which must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party is so overwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that no contrary verdict could stand the court cannot weigh the evidence or inquire into the credibility of the witnesses and if the evidence adduced at trial is conflicting or if several reasonable inferences may be drawn the motion should be deniedbroderick v watts  nh    ad    citations quotation and brackets omitted in this case the plaintiff sought to prove that the absence of a rearwheel differential on the odyssey amounted to a design defect and that the defect was a cause of the accident the plaintiff also sought to prove that honda failed adequately to warn the odysseys driver of the general operating characteristics of the vehicle on packed snow and that the failure to warn made the odyssey unreasonably dangerous to maintain a products liability claim based on defective design a plaintiff must prove  that the design of the product created a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user  that the condition existed when the product was sold by a seller in the business of selling such products  that the use of the product was reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer and  that the condition caused injury to the user or the users propertychellman v saabscania ab  nh    ad    an analysis of whether a product is unreasonably dangerous requires evaluating many possible factors including a products social utility balanced against the risk of danger the cost and practicality of reducing the risk of danger and the presence or absence and efficacy of a warning of hidden danger     if the design of a product makes a warning necessary to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm from a foreseeable use the lack of warning or an ineffective warning causes the product to be defective and unreasonably dangerousid at   ad at  see thibault v sears roebuck  co  nh   ad   the plaintiffs design defect and failure to warn claims are separate under the design defect claim the issue is whether the odyssey was defective in that it had a fixed rear axle and whether that defect made the product unreasonably dangerous the issue in the failure to warn claim in contrast is whether the danger inherent in the odyssey was or could have been made reasonable by the issuance of adequate warnings liability may attach if the manufacturer did not take available and reasonable steps to lessen or eliminate the danger of even a significantly useful and desirable product thibault  nh at   ad at  moreover when an unreasonable danger could have been eliminated without excessive cost or loss of product efficiency liability may attach even though the danger was obvious or there was adequate warning id at   ad at  in the end a court will rarely be able to say as a matter of law that a product has no social utility or that the purpose or manner of its use that caused the injury was not foreseeable the jury must decide whether the potentiality for harm is open and obvious reasonableness foreseeability utility and similar factors are questions of fact for jury determinationid at   ad at  citations omitted the existence of concurrent causes will not in and of itself vitiate a finding that one cause was a proximate cause of the injury reid v spadone mach co  nh    ad    overruled in part by daigle v city of portsmouth  nh   ad   see chellman  nh at   ad at  the plaintiff need not show that either design defect or failure to warn was the sole proximate cause of the accident see reid  nh at   ad at  here the plaintiffs automobile expert testified as to the handling behavior of vehicles lacking rearwheel differentials the rear wheels of such vehicles essentially are locked together  forced at all times to rotate at the same rate with the aid of a model the expert demonstrated that vehicles which combine conventional steering with fixed rear axles behave differently than vehicles which combine conventional steering with rear axles having differentials the expert testified that the class of vehicles lacking rearwheel differentials of which the odyssey is one have uncertain steering responses depending on whether the front wheels grip or the rear wheels grip in a turn the expert testified that in evasive maneuvers when turning to avoid something theres a tremendous risk that the back end will simply break away and youll spin sideways into something furthermore it was the experts opinion that the lack of a differential in the odyssey was a design defect and that the defect made the odyssey dangerous finally the expert testified that he could not see how honda could be unaware of the effect of the fixed axle and that it was foreseeable that this type of collision would occur in a deposition read into the record at trial the plaintiffs warnings expert stated that the odyssey was defective because it did not come with instructions and warnings regarding the special hazards involved with driving the odyssey on a frozen lake especially in light of the fact that the odyssey employs handoperated brakes he stated that the warnings that did come with the odyssey regarding safe operation of the vehicle were inadequate in his report he indicated that difficulties associated with handactuated controls have caused brake lockup and subsequent skids such as took place in this accident finally he stated that even assuming the driver did lock the brakes the skid could have been caused by oversteering or loss of traction on the surface beaulieu testified that he applied the odysseys brakes and turned hard right immediately prior to the moment of impact he also testified that he was probably traveling thirty to thirtyfive miles per hour  a speed at or above which according to the defendants own expert the odyssey reaches the limit of its frictional capabilities the jury explicitly found  that the odyssey contained a design defect which rendered it unreasonably dangerous and which was a cause of the accident and  that the odyssey was unreasonably dangerous and defective because of hondas failure adequately to warn the driver and that this failure to warn was a cause of the accident viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff we cannot say that the sole reasonable inference that could have been drawn therefrom is so overwhelmingly in favor of honda that no contrary verdict could stand broderick  nh at   ad at  accordingly we find that the trial judge properly denied the defendants motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict we decline to address the defendants remaining arguments either because the defendant failed to raise timely objections at trial or because it failed to include the issues in its notice of appeal see sup

concurred specially johnson j concurred batchelder j concurring specially because i would adopt a per se rule of reversal i concur only in the result reached in chief justice brocks opinion horton j dissenting the plurality correctly asserts that the plaintiffs arguments regarding the color of the honda odyssey and the need to ignore japanese transgressions in favor of attention to corporate greed were extremely unprofessional and deplorable but the plurality also correctly states that these arguments must be considered in light of the circumstances of the particular case the plurality further notes correctly that the decision whether to grant the mistrial motion or the motion for a new trial falls within the trial courts discretion the actual rule is because the trial court is in the best position to gauge prejudicial impact it has broad discretion to determine whether a mistrial or other remedial action is necessary state v martin  nh    ad    i would hold that the trial courts actions relative to these arguments were within its broad discretion neither comment was directly related to an issue in the case although completely uncalled for the arguments were at best a weak attempt to engender nationalistic rather than racial prejudice the former suggesting that it might be unfair for a japanese manufacturer to use the colors of the american flag and the latter pointing out albeit in the context of suggesting that the jury should not consider this fact that the japanese had bombed pearl harbor and criticized american workers these comments are so unrelated to the basis of the case and so lame in their obvious intent to move the jury to act on prejudice that the trial court could make a fair assessment that any prejudice would be cured by its general instructions in the words of the trial court the plaintiff raised irrelevant and potentially prejudicial issues    the court must evaluate the statements in the context of the entire trial and determine whether they    rendered the trial unfair the trial court specifically found that the jury followed the courts instructions and based its verdict on the evidence and the law a review of the record demonstrates that the verdict is in all other respects consistent with the evidence and the law there is no indication that the verdict was based on national prejudice i would affirm the verdict to reach this result i have reviewed the remaining issues preserved on appeal and not addressed in the plurality opinion this review leads me to the conclusion that the defendants claims of error are without merit i respectfully dissent thayer j joins in the dissent honda announces executive changes at its north american operations  hondacom   news  views news releaseshonda announces

grayenstanced demon camber you may know it as onicamber youve seen the look and whether you like it or not is totally beside the point the great thing about this stanced look is that it gets your attention from the interviews weve read with owners and drivers of these machines that is exactly what they are after theyve said that its all about being noticedcustom wheels and tires have been around for years and continue to be immensely popular but customizers are always looking for ways to be ahead of the game to be first with a trend it is no longer enough to have the most outrageous set of rims that look can be taken to the next level with stanced cars technically demon camber is extreme negative camber lets explain what negative camber is and how that effect is achievedcamber is one of the alignment specifications which affect the angle or tilt of the wheel compared to the vehicles body if you are looking directly at the front or rear of a car the angle of the tire relative to the ground is the camber look at the illustration below negative camber means that the tops of the tires lean in relative to the cars body zero camber means the tire is perfectly perpendicular to the ground positive camber means the tops of the tires are leaning outmarch  pickup truck cab and bed sizestimothy zahlamericans love to have choices buying a dress shirt decide solid or stripe short
