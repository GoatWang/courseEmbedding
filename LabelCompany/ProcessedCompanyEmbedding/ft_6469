those of a year ago and yearend levels despite the additional containerboard inventory requirements of our acquisitions” “looking ahead to the third quarter” mr kowlzan added “we expect to realize the vast majority of our previously announced packaging segment price increases and we expect higher containerboard and corrugated products shipments resulting from strong demand white paper sales volumes should be seasonally higher although price and mix should move lower we also anticipate continued price inflation in recycled fiber and certain chemicals higher freight costs and a higher tax rate
