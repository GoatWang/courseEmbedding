fully automated instrument that enhances the accuracy speed and efficiency of food safety testing through detection of molecular pathogens including listeria salmonella escherichia coli and other organisms commonly implicated in food contamination episodes the system is easy to use and incorporates many innovative features that minimize the complexity of testing processes it is powered by technologies that provide unparalleled scalability and reliability allowing your laboratory to meet the increasing demands of today’s testing environment as well as those of the future undefined system highlights the atlas system delivers value by providing the following essential benefits to your laboratory speed the system’s simplified sample and reagent loading procedure minimizes operator handson time utilizing the system’s highthroughput capacity a single operator can process and receive results for more than  samples in an hour shift or more than  results in  hours reduced enrichment times provide faster turnaround accuracy automated process controls help ensure consistency and quality liquid level sensing and reagent dispense verification eliminate the risk of pipetting errors that may compromise sample results internal control in every reaction ensures the integrity of every sample result system tracking and barcoding provide full sampletoresult traceability all samples fluids reagents and ancillary components are barcoded tracked and managed within the system automated inventory control eliminates the need for manual transcription efficiency flexible continuousaccess sample loading enables greater workflow customization and laboratory efficiency continuous access eliminates the need to batch samples removes labor bottlenecks and allows loading and unloading of samples and reagents while the instrument processes assays walkaway freedom increases overall lab productivity and efficiency full automation from sample purification to pathogen detection eliminates the need for manual sample processing the atlas system’s “samplein resultout” format provides maximum performance with minimal handson timethe system is costeffective allowing labs to increase workload without adding resources lean processing requires minimal labor with its greatly reduced operator intervention requirements the system creates an upstream and downstream workflow advantage the system requires minimal training and optimizes the use and efficiency of laboratory resources intuitive design makes it easy to use the system’s touchscreen user interface facilitates errorfree operation external indicators provide realtime status updates the “allinone” design saves valuable bench space eliminating the need for additional equipment eg heating and

before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a

transcriptionmediated amplification hybridization protection assay a fully automated sample purification process the major limitation of current nucleic acid amplification assays is the sample processing step which is usually complex timeconsuming and often can include interfering substances that can inhibit the amplification reaction                                powered by wistia     loading playing in p   ● auto ○ p ○ p   switch to flash   about wistia               target capture is a samplepreparation technology which concentrates and purifies target nucleic acids before the amplification process oligonucleotides bound to magnetic particles specifically capture the targeted nucleic acid magnetic particles with bound target are then pulled to the side of the tube by a magnet — and potential inhibitory substances are washed away before amplification target capture advantages increase in specificity and sensitivity virtual elimination of false negatives by washing away inhibitors increased sample diversity and specimen types allows for large sample volume simplifies sample processing with no centrifugation or transfers presents a concentrated and purified
