povertyprosperityorg facebook kiva loans linkedin twitter contact tweets by scottyincali povertyprosperityorg saabnetcom saab  sonett scott paterson online im scott paterson and i live in the san francisco bay area with my wife elle and daughter lily bee i have six sisters and one brother i grew up in rochester ny and went to dartmouth college in new hampshire who is this guy i was born in  the sixties and my first name is robert but i go by scott i was also given my grandmothers maiden name of vrooman hence my initials are rsvp i had a great childhood and started playing hockey when i was   i would later rediscover it in college and play through adulthood i started running in middle school competitively and after spending a year living in france with my mom and going to public school learning to speak in about  months i started high school and began running seriously as a senior i ran  miles in  and the mile in  later as a freshman at dartmouth college i improved on my mile by running a  after that i had a series of injuries back  stress fractures at once in my legs and my achilles blew out and i didnt get much further i tried running for a number of years but the injuries mounted and the miles dwindled to zero thats when i rediscovered my passion for ice hockey which i still play threefour times a week during college i bought my first saab  a   sedan i was on the internet we had hardwired connections in our dorm rooms looking for some advice on a leaking water pump and when i posted a question on recautos the responses i got where along the lines of you should have bought a bmw or a ford or whatever since that was decidedly unhelpful i decided to create a mailing list just for saab owners and in the fall of  i created the saab network in the first year there were about  users and the mailing list grew to about  when the web was born and i took the discussions and created saabnetcom  the first saab resource on the internet since then the site has had well over a million saab visitors with literally billions of hits and millions of pages accessed every single month the bandwidth was so demanding i had to have a t mbps installed at my house for something like  a month now it resides on a mbps connection that costs about  a month i created the saab network on my mac se which had a mb hard drive the first hard drive i ever owned  i actually started out with a mac ke and ive been producing the saab network site on macs ever since although the server has always run on linux currently red hat linux im a certified mac fanatic  our household of three also includes three iphones  macs an appletv and a few ipods after college i went directly to work for novell working on messaging software doing technical marketing mostly i wrote technical papers for endusers gave demonstrations worked trade shows did quite a bit of public speaking and generally became a know it all on our products unfortunately and sadly this became the story of my professional career novell was dominated by microsoft and while i gave up on the messaging i stayed a couple years longer working on serverbased tcpip internet services like ftp web telnet and others i generally had a good time at novell and when i went to my exit interview after i resigned i really didnt have anything to complain about other than the company going into a tailspin after that stint i joined be inc in  that was exciting be was working on a revolutionary new operating system designed for general user use on macs and later pcs but also specialized in optimized media performance the system was very impressive i did product marketing and again wrote quite a bit did a ton of public speaking mostly to user groups and any crowd that would gather for a demo  a lot of trips to college campuses  i even got to return to dartmouth to give a demo i think the thing that most impressed that audience was that an english major could be so technical i eventually graduated to director of marketing with a team of about  people reporting directly to me and i reported directly to the ceo none other than jeanlouis gasee himself former president of apple inc after sadly declining a m offer to be bought by apple by the way i love mac osx every day so having them buy next instead worked out in the end for me not so financially i admit i ran headlong into microsoft again we were selling a pc version of the os but we couldnt get any oem deals because microsoft threatened to revoke their licenses if they bundled any other operating system preinstalled so in  with a bleak outlook i resigned again but the good news is that saabnetcom was making a decent living for me so i got to take that up full time jump ahead to  and i discovered microlending i was so enthralled by my ability through kivaorg to make a  loan as part of a larger amount that was crowdsourced to someone in the third world who was poor and didnt have access to traditional credit but who wanted to lift themselves out of poverty by starting or continuing a business this was a way to give a helpout rather than a handout i was so excited that i wanted to do more than just my own personal lending so i went through the process to create an official c nonprofit organization called povertyprosperityorg that allowed corporations or individuals who didnt want to have to manage a microlending accountportfolio on their own to donate funds to be lent out perpetually we call it a perpetual fund the great news is that repayment rates to date are over  and our lending team has made over m in loans  just after i started that effort my daughter lily bee was born on june th kim shu was our nanny for about two and half years and that gave lily bee some extra attention while elle and i worked fulltime but since lily bee turned   and since i have a very flexible schedule ive been primarily taking care of lily before and after school it has been the most enjoyable few years and i get so much joy from all the time i get to spend with her shes the most amazing girl and i write about her all the time on my facebook timeline just like most parents do in  after doing some volunteer work in the area of addiction i created randomscreeningcom this site provides a service mostly aimed at home users for those that want to schedule random drug tests and receive notifications daily if it is time to take a test or not it allows families to take the bias out of determining when a drug test is to be taken nobody is telling anyone else that today they have to take a drug test for no reason or any reason the software simply says whether today is a test day or not based on the variables like percent chance for a test to happen on any given day that the users set i am also very interested in physics if you want to read a book that will totally change your view of our universe and give a good explanation why we live in a steadystate universe check out hidden in plain sight  the equation of the universe if you are a kindle user its just  cents after my socalled professional career was wellover i started my tattoo collection i now have nine tattoos all below my knees and a
