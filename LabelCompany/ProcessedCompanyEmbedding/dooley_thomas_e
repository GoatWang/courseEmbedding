dr america the lives of thomas a dooley     dr america the lives of thomas a dooley  by james t fisher university of massachusetts press   pages reviewed by james sullivan culture wars february  ractically everybody in my generation has a tom dooley anecdote my brotherinlaw for example told me that his decision to become a physician was greatly influenced by the jungle doctor whatever happened to him he added alluding to that brief period  when dooley became a legend in a corner of the world known as southeast asia and then seemed to disappear on june   dr tom dooley received an honorary doctorate from the university of notre dame upstaging such eminences on the podium as giovanni cardinal montini archbishop of milan three years away from becoming pope paul vi and president dwight d eisenhower wheres tom dooley said eisenhower to theodore hesburgh president of notre dame i want to talk to him they did talk all through lunch dooley told eisenhower about his medico operation in laos six months later on january   he would die in a hospital bed in new york city the victim of cancer kneeling alone by his bedside praying the rosary was teresa gallagher a girl from queens unmarried a secretary at metropolitan life insurance dooleys confidant and volunteer secretary my own remembrance of dooley was bound up with junior year of high school  i had just transferred to the catholic school in the city from the public school in the suburbs sister mary magdalene my homeroom teacher a tall woman lean and taught with high cheek bones and a reddened face that flashed out from her starched mantle adored tom dooley he was she told those of us in room  the catholic model whom we should emulate in my mind now its hard to separate dooley from sister mary magdalene her presentation of him to the class always had an underlying aspect of nervous anxiety this agitated enthusiasm made dooley difficult to approach giving him a higher than thou quality as i grew older and lived through the upheavals of post conciliar catholicism i looked back on those days in room  and wondered if the frenetic actionapostolate that sister mary magdalene espoused didnt also contain a certain disease a presentiment of trouble underneath dr america has helped to shed light on the cause of my vague feelings of disturbance in room  it has also revealed a great deal about tom dooley that very few of us could know in  things that would have rung with a hard dissonance when compared to the hagiographic portrait that was then drawn of the doctor in catholic circles this book also confirms his many admirable qualities ones that sister mary magdalene was not slow to point out to her charges in room  tom dooley was in the words of james t fisher a complex individual who persisted in the effort to reconcile wildly conflicting impulses for the sake of his audience as well as for himself he had a devotional side including frequent mass attendance recitation of the rosary and a devotion to the little flower on the other hand  he was an active homosexual who according to classmate michael harrington never attempted to hide his samesex orientation even after cancer surgery in  dooley resorted to the nd floor of bangkoks erawan hotel a central preserve of his gay life in southeast asia while his memory is enshrined at notre dame with a plaque of one of his letters to father hesburgh at the grotto he left the university without receiving a degree and was restive of school authority while there a charismatic speaker who could bring any audience to tears with his uncanny ability to portray the suffering vietnamese and laotian people he traveled firstclass and ran up a lavish tab at the waldorf when he was in town while dooley attained to an iconic status not only among american catholics but the wider society as well he was also an instrument in the hands of the so called vietnam lobby a group of public relations executives former socialists turned anti communist shadowy military figures and cia operatives these folks none of whom were catholic ardently desired a catholic figure who might be a bridge from american nonsectarian anticommunism to the fiercely catholic leader in south vietnam ngo dinh diem indeed if this book has a subplot it centers on the creation of dr tom dooley by a coalition of secular humanitarians and madison avenue types ivy leaguers to borrow a pejorative from senator mccarthy for the purpose of exporting a vision of a pluralistic democracy unfreighted with any religious baggage to a corner of the world known as indochina and if this subplot has an underlying theme it is that these same anti communist liberals were also an anticatholic elite who found themselves in the queer position of defending an intransigently catholic president in south vietnam while most of the radical liberals of the s the new left thought the vietnam war was a product of the machinations of the state department and cardinal spellman fisher shows how dooleys handlersrecondite names like leo cherne joseph buttinger harold oram and angier biddle dukewere themselves on the anticatholic side of the ethno religious wars of the late s dooley almost lost a medical career entirely graduating near the bottom of his class at st louis university medical school he was forced to repeat his senior year even worse he was deemed too immature to begin a residency and was required to extend his internship an additional six months impulsive and rebellious habitually late or absent from class tom was far likelier to be found at the bridlespur hunt club than in the amphitheater of the medical school horses not cadavers were what people remember about him during these years still through some powerful pleading from two st louis physicians tom obtained an appointment in april  to the navy medical college as a lieutenant he was about to walk on to the world stage dooleys assignment on the uss montague brought him to vietnam in the late summer of  the french had been defeated by the communist viet minh at the battle of dien bien phu earlier in the spring the protocols at geneva in july of  allowed the transfer of inhabitants of north and south vietnam who desired to relocate to one sector or the other this window would remain open until may of  thus commenced the flight of refugees from north vietnam to south vietnam known as operation passage to freedom arriving on the uss montague lieutenant dooley was assigned to act as an interpreter between the french on whose vessels the catholic and anticommunist refugees from the north were being delivered and the americans who were providing the lsms landing craft which would ferry the refugees to safe harbor in the south although the united states refused to sign the geneva accords of  there was a strong desire on the part of secretary of state john foster dulles to cooperate in the refugee effort and demonstrate to the world the resolve of america to stop the spread of communism in southeast asia although dooley was strongly anticommunist with a view that linked the political liberation of catholics in north vietnam with a catholic philosophy which saw the destructive implications of dialectical materialism he also realized the opportunities for selfpromotion which the refugee operation would afford him to fisher the dooley of operation passage to freedom was a person determined to recoup his reputation after the medical school debacle no sooner is he involved in boarding the refugees onto the lsms than he found time to send letters to the st louis globedemocrat recounting as newsworthy the refugee operation in letters home to his mother he also confides that he is an operative of the us navy sent to help set up an epidemiological laboratory for the study of various indigenous parasites and bacteria yet dooleys own efforts to enhance his image were outdone by others who found him terribly useful to their purposes there was lt col edward lansdale an iconoclast and a loner who was given a wide berth by cia regulars yet was specifically requested by allen dulles cia director to be the man on the ground who could help diem a former ad executive from san francisco lansdale was in south vietnam awaiting diems arrival yet he needed a way of making the authoritarian diem palatable to a stateside audience that had grown weary of the protracted involvement of america in the korean conflict in dr tom dooley lansdale found the kind of young gogetter who could be a conduit between the catholic refugees in the north and the wisecracking american journalists both in vietnam and back home who could see a human interest story when it came their way there also was the international rescue committee irc and the american friends of vietnam afv two organizations described by james fisher as made up of leftist entrepreneurs bent on expanding their markets abroad in the immediate postmccarthy era imbued with a messianic liberalism the two groups had interlocking memberships and were made up in many instances of former socialists who had shed their antifascist orientation and now turned anticommunist harold oram for example was head of the american friends of vietnam an organization that boasted john f kennedy and mike mansfield two notable catholic democrats yet oram did publicity work for planned parenthood and hired peter white grandson of the renowned new york architect stanford white to work on the diem account peter white and his wife both catholics had a large family and were part of the catholic intellectual revival of the post war years their friends included the writers sally and robert fitzgerald and edward rice founding editor of jubilee a catholic monthly of high church graphics and literary and theological brightness white also tried to deliver the liberals of commonweal to diems cause but many of them were in fullflight from the specter of joe mccarthy and his perceived american catholic power base writing in commonweal in  james ogara warned that the hard core of catholic support for mccarthyhas the same emotional roots as support for father coughlin in the thirties catholic liberals of the period were also alarmed about outbreaks of anti semitism coming from the right but fisher concludes that the mccarthyites reserved their greatest scorn not for jews but the anglo elitesthe east coast aristocrats who populated the irc according to fisher the culture wars of the period were fought primarily between catholics and a rather loosely defined coalition of liberal protestants jews and assorted secularists who saw the growing catholic population as a threat to their cherished notions about a wall separating church and state  since the church appeared monolithic in its authority catholicism was generally equated with what would only later be tagged the religious right in dooley leo cherne director of the irc and harold oram saw a catholic superstar who appeared to combine on the one hand a devotional catholicism which linked him to traditional sources of catholic piety yet also reflected a newer catholic internationalist spirit while anticommunist dooley would have the theological tint of a lowkey ecumenist who could speak across the cultural divide the refugee operation in vietnam was recounted in dooleys first book deliver us from evil in fishers view the book was nothing less than a propaganda piece pure and simple although there is evidence to show that the editors at readers digest condensed books sought to shape the book and operation passage to freedom as the story of one lone american doctor it is not clear who may have been directing the book deal initially lansdale had gotten the national order of vietnam for dooley presented to him by diem in may of  and lansdales friend william lederer coauthor ofthe ugly american received a note from dewitt wallace thanking him for steering dooley to the digest even at the time of the books publication however fbi files disclose that individuals who had worked with dooley complained that he had minimized the help that the french had given in the operation and that the book was a product of selfaggrandizement dooleys navy career came to an end on march   under investigation for homosexual activity by the office of naval intelligence oni he was forced to resign reports of his homosexuality had been circulating since the summer of  it was rumored that he had seduced the son of an admiral during a stay at yokosuka japan just before shipping out to vietnam the oni probe began in january  by march of that year they had compiled a convincing dossier on dooley including sex acts with informants and were about to proceed against him when he abruptly resigned admirers of dooley have suggested that he may have had tendencies yet sought to live chastely even randy shilts who outed dooley in a book in  on homosexuals in the military believed that dooley led a deliberately closeted life because he adhered strictly to the teachings of the church yet both of these views are wrong fisher states he dooley was in fact an extraordinarily active gay man who was considered one of the great sex symbols of his era — a figure wellknown in sophisticated gay circles as farflung as hollywood washington dc and the capitals of southeast asia working in bethesda maryland as a hospital intern in  dooley was picked up by a german airline steward who took him to the home of one of the leading washington homosexuals dooley quickly became a favorite of the group which included theater people and musicians rock hudsons future manager was among them dooley was described within gay circles as mesmerizing and one of the most charming people you would ever want to meet the topic of dooleys homosexuality remained hidden from public scrutiny this was the mid s after all yet fisher quotes one unnamed source as saying that dooley told him that the catholic churchs teaching on homosexuality was simply wrong another source revealed that dooley regarded his homosexuality as a gift that homosexual relations were for him a way to elevate the gray existence of those not so blessed with charm and good looks toward the end of his life dooleys appeals for support in his clinics in laos contained what fisher calls a homoeroticized mysticism and the doctors recruitment of young men especially at notre dame make us wonder about the roots of what will later be termed the homosexual network in the catholic church in america the topic of dooleys homosexuality remained hidden from public scrutiny this was the mid s after all yet fisher quotes one unnamed source as saying that dooley told him that the catholic churchs teaching on homosexuality was simply wrong as dooleys naval career was selfdestructing his new role of jungle doctor was about to take off the presses were rolling out the pages of deliver us from evil just as the oni was tightening its investigation within three weeks after his resignation from the navy dooley announced to a reporter who had questioned him about his navy status next september under the auspices of the international rescue committee im returning for six months to laoswalt disney has given me a little movie projectorwere going to take lots of white sailor hats baseballs ballpoint pens and sears roebuck catalogs to show these people a little bit of what america is like leo cherne admired dooley unlike william j casey chernes irish catholic protege dooley had a cosmopolitan flair cherne and dooley had classical music in common dooley could entertain on the pianoa poor mans george shearingand weave popular melodies and classical motifs together his suits were european cut cherne told casey biographer joseph e persico that his understudy was to the right of attila the hunone hundred per cent for franco and one hundred per cent against the loyalists to understand this you had to understand his catholicism in dooley cherne found no vestiges of the ethnoreligious conflicts of the s that sometimes marked relations between the irish and the jews in new york dooley was a new kind of catholic and not unlike cherne looking to win acclaim with cultural and political elites both men felt themselves to be deserving of insider status cherne would accomplish this as a seasoned pro within the sector of humanitarian aid projects while dooley would do this by his pretty brilliance as catholic folk hero dooleys homosexuality was known to the irc angier biddle duke had been informed by admiral burke about the oni investigation but was assured that it wont be a problem for you based on dooleys habits one wonders why the admiral had such confidence nevertheless other things worried duke in particular dooleys spending habits and carelessness with receipts when duke attempted to caution tom about the need to curtail excessive spending which would threaten the taxexempt status of the irc dooley retorted with chickenshit yet among catholics who had been inspired by deliver us from evil dooleys charismatic power was intense sixth graders at our lady of victory academy in tarrytown new york wrote to dooley to tell him that they were going to adopt a child from southeast asia and name him thomas anthony a third grader penned simply you are just like jesus placing his life within a gospel context a nun from tulsa oklahoma said that you can be certain that when you reach the end of the road you will hear the words of welcome from our divine savior himself come you blessed one and possess the kingdom of heaven sister m madeleva wolff of saint marys at notre dame wrote to teresa gallagher to say that dooley had spent his finest hours by bearing the suffering in his members referring to the cancer which finally killed him from  through  the irc funded medico dooleys clinic operations in laos medico was never simply dooleys private apostolate through its board and its connections with washington foreign aid sources and later with the cia it was bigger than dooley yet it also relied on dooleys starpower during sorties back to the states he undertook fabulously successful fundraising events in boston billy sullivan new owner of the fledgling patriots football club presented dooley with a sterling silver tray lets fill it he challenged the audience and people rushed up to litter the tray with bills of large denominations on november   dooley gave a memorable address at hollywood high school sponsored by immaculate heart college in los angeles the audience was overwhelmingly catholic including the actresses jeannette macdonald and eleanor powell both known for their commitment to catholic causes we are not interested in conversions said dooley casting an eye toward the president of ihm i have no desire dear sister to make any of my happy little buddhist monks into mackerelsnapping irish catholics the audience roared in shock and delight evidently aware as fisher correctly observes that they were also praying at the end of mass for the conversion of russia and the pagans in communist dominated countries in asia dooleys ability to combine cold war piety yet also catch the wave of what would become postconciliar religious indifferentism was a highwire act in  at the outset of the address at hollywood high school he had begun with imprecations to the glory of god and st therese yet as fisher suggests his audience was also ready for another message one that would be fixed on his starpower while putting in lowkey any missiological responsibilities to the nonchristian world here dooley presages a theme which would recur throughout the s and s in catholic circles the triumph of an active life unhinged from doctrinal and spiritual fonts surely dooley could not be labelled an activist apostate as many of his coreligionists would be in the late s his faith although warring was not yet his persona as a celebrity quite possibly served to fill a vacuum where the security of belief ought to have been in  dooley underwent surgery for malignant melanoma a mole had been removed from his chest in  but by  the cancer had metastasized by this time the irc had decided to part company with medico a decision motivated as much by internal problems within its membership as by dooleys unpredictability yet toms faithful led by teresa gallagher now being paid by met life to be dooleys secretary and paul hellmuth a catholic and boston lawyer from the prestigious firm of hale and doer sought to help him to continue the work relying on providence and the charisma of the nowailing doctor dooley died on january   at memorial hospital in new york cardinal spellman had visited him the day before leaving with tears in his eyes kennedy would shortly sound the call for the peace corps and invoke dooleys memory in  a priest began a movement to press for his canonization it never achieved lift off no doubt it would have given work to any number of devils advocates of course the stalled canonization movement was in many respects a tribute to the church that in the matter of saintmaking things proceed quietly not by the engine of madison avenue not that this dead end would itself deny the good that dr tom dooley did he was genuinely loved by the laotian people who dubbed him thanh mo america dr america and this love was definitely returned by dooley for all his vainglory and selfcenteredness he did set personal high standards for medico physicians and sought to make of his operation laos a people to people project he serves in a strange way as a morality tale about the catholic selfpromoter having given a thousand performances before audiences all over the world he died having failed to achieve any lasting personal intimacy with others his iconic role was a substitute for the homelier task of real friendship today we see many lesser catholic selfpromoters who can only dream about the corridors of power that dooley travelled presidents future popes and premiers wanted to talk to tom dooley yet if the jungle doctor is today reduced to the marginalia of history not to slight this excellent biography where will those lesser promoters be remembered the book sheds much light on the interstices between the humanitarian lobbyists and their organizations and the state department and foreign service professionals that dooley reserved his special ire fisher provides some needed revisionist history on the origins of us involvement in south vietnam and the sponsorship of ngo dinh diem taking issue with the new left variant that the war was the product of the machinations of cardinal spellman and the us foreign policy elites fisher reveals the web of old left anticommunists themselves anti catholic in many respects who attempted to build an ecumenical coalition to support the catholic president of what they hoped would become a secular pluralist democracy in southeast asia the question in all of this remains were catholics duped by the anti communist agenda of people like leo cherne and angier biddle duke was vietnam a staging ground not for a christian confrontation with communism but for the implementation of a pluralist democracy by foreign aid elites with impeccable liberal and socialist pedigrees in fishers telling it what might be called the catholic interest was bent to serve the coalition of new leadertype liberals dooleys nondenominational appeal was central in advancing this agenda since the kind of power base that leo cherne wanted to establish would hardly have occurred if a markedly catholic presence obtained reviewed in culture wars february  by james sullivan requiem for a whale rider by e michael jones seaworld trainer dawn brancheau died after the
