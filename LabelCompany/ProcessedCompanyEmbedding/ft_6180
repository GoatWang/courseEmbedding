report  us geological survey  p reenactments of historical pioneer emigrations have increased in popularity since the celebration of these events during the united states bicentennial in  from  to  approximately  mormon trekkers traveled the mormon pioneer national historic trail hereinafter referred to as the trail segment between sixth crossing and rock creek hollow in fremont county wyoming recent elevated levels of use have raised concerns over potential recreationrelated damage to this particularly scenic segment of the trail in  the bureau of land management blm contracted the us geological survey usgs to conduct an aerialphotographic assessment of the condition of the trail between sixth crossing and rock creek hollow specifically the usgs was to assess trail conditions for this segment as influenced by handcart use low medium and high intensity of use and concentrated activities associated with trekking toilet rest and camp sites based on these results there are identifiable management considerations toilet and rest sites need to be carefully located relative to where sensitive vegetation or soils occur the analyses presented here indicate that limiting motorized vehicle use needs to be a priority over that of adjusting the number of trekkers additionally monitoring of the trail from sixth crossing to rock creek hollow segment needs to consider explicit management targets such as minimum acceptable levels of bare ground or trail width and the establishment of permanent monitoring plots to evaluate targets and measure responses to altered
