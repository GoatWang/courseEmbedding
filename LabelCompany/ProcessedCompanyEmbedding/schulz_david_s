latercitation needed military service and postwar jobsedit in february  schulzs mother dena died after a long illness at the time of her death he had only recently been made aware that she suffered from cancer schulz had by all accounts been very close to his mother and her death made a strong impression on him around the same time schulz was drafted into the united states army he served as a staff sergeant with the th armored division in europe as a squad leader on a  caliber machine gun team his unit saw combat only at the very end of the war schulz said that he only had one opportunity to fire his machine gun but forgot to load it fortunately he said the german soldier he could have fired at willingly surrendered years later schulz proudly spoke of his wartime service after being discharged in late  schulz returned to minneapolis he did lettering for a roman catholic comic magazine timeless topix and then in july  took a job at art instruction inc reviewing and grading lessons submitted by students schulz himself had been a student of the school taking a correspondence course from it before he was drafted he worked at the school for a number of years while he developed his career as a comic creator until he was making enough money from comics to be able to do that fulltime careeredit schulzs first group of regular cartoons a weekly series of onepanel jokes entitled lil folks was published from june  to january  in the st paul pioneer press with schulz usually doing four onepanel drawings per issue it was in lil folks that schulz first used the name charlie brown for a character although he applied the name in four gags to three different boys as well as one buried in sand the series also had a dog that looked much like snoopy in may  schulz sold his first onepanel drawing to the saturday evening post within the next two years a total of  untitled drawings by schulz were published in the post simultaneously with his work for st paul pioneer press around the same time he tried to have lil folks syndicated through the newspaper enterprise association schulz would have been an independent contractor for the syndicate unheard of in the s but the deal fell through lil folks was dropped from the pioneer press in january  later that year schulz approached the united feature syndicate with the onepanel series lil folks and the syndicate became interested however by that time schulz had also developed a comic strip using normally four panels rather than one and reportedly to schulzs delight the syndicate preferred this version peanuts made its first appearance on october   in seven newspapers the weekly sundaypage debuted on january   after a somewhat slow beginning peanuts eventually became one of the most popular comic strips of all time as well as one of the most influential schulz also had a shortlived sportsoriented comic strip called its only a game – but he abandoned it due to the demands of the successful peanuts from  to  he contributed a singlepanel strip young pillars featuring teenagers to youth a publication associated with the church of god in  and  he illustrated two volumes of art linkletters kids say the darndest things and in  a collection of letters dear president johnson by bill adler peanutsedit main article peanuts at its height peanuts was published daily in  papers in  countries in  languages over the nearly  years that peanuts was published schulz drew nearly  strips the strips themselves plus merchandise and product endorsements produced revenues of more than  billion per year with schulz earning an estimated  million to  million annually during the life of the strip schulz took only one vacation a fiveweek break in late  to celebrate his th birthday reruns of the strip ran during his vacation the only time reruns occurred while schulz was alive the first book collection of peanuts strips was published in july  by rinehart  company many more books followed and these collections greatly contributed to the increasing popularity of the strip in  fantagraphics began their complete peanuts series peanuts also proved popular in other media the first animated tv special a charlie brown christmas aired in december  and won an emmy award numerous tv specials were to follow the latest being happiness is a warm blanket charlie brown in  until his death schulz wrote or cowrote the tv specials and carefully oversaw production of them schulz receiving his star on the hollywood walk of fame at knotts berry farm in june  charlie brown the principal character for peanuts was named after a coworker at the art instruction inc schulz drew much more inspiration than this from his own life some examples being like charlie browns parents schulzs father was a barber and his mother a housewife schulz admitted in interviews that like charlie brown he had often felt shy and withdrawn in his life in an interview with charlie rose in may  schulz observed i suppose there’s a melancholy feeling in a lot of cartoonists because cartooning like all other humor comes from bad things happening schulz reportedly had an intelligent dog when he was a boy although this dog was a pointer and not a beagle as was snoopy family photos of the dog confirm a certain physical resemblance references to snoopys brother spike living outside of needles california were likely influenced by the few years – that the schulz family lived there they had moved to needles to join other family members who had relocated from minnesota to tend to an ill cousin schulzs inspiration for charlie browns unrequited love to the little redhaired girl was donna mae johnson an art instruction inc accountant with whom he fell in love when schulz finally proposed to her in june  shortly after he had made his first contract with his syndicate she turned him down and married another man linus and shermy were named for his good friends linus maurer and sherman plepler respectively peppermint patty was inspired by patricia swanson one of his cousins on his mothers side schulz devised the characters name when he saw peppermint candies in his house influencesedit the charles m schulz museum counts milton caniff terry and the pirates and bill mauldin as key influences on schulzs work in his own strip schulz regularly described snoopys annual veterans day visits with mauldin including mention of mauldins world war ii cartoons schulz and critics also credited george herriman krazy kat roy crane wash tubbs elzie c segar thimble theatre and percy crosby skippy among his influences in a  address to fellow cartoonists schulz discussed several of his influences his biographer rheta grimsley johnson said however it would be impossible to narrow down three or two or even one direct influence on schulzs personal drawing style the uniqueness of peanuts has set it apart for years that oneofkind quality permeates every aspect of the strip and very clearly extends to the drawing it is purely his with no clear forerunners and no subsequent pretenders the charles m schulz museum and research center has stated that schulz watched the movie citizen kane   times the character lucy van pelt also expresses a fondness for the film and in one strip she cruelly spoils the ending for her younger brother personal lifeedit in april  schulz married joyce halverson no relation to schulzs mother dena halverson schulz later in the same year schulz and joyce moved to colorado springs colorado their first child a son named monte was born in february  and three further children were born later in

rented office room it was here that schulz was interviewed for the unaired television documentary a boy named charlie brown some of the footage was eventually used in a later documentary charlie brown and charles schulz schulzs father died while visiting him in  the same year schulzs sebastopol studio burned down by  schulz had moved to santa rosa california where he lived and worked until his death while briefly living in colorado springs schulz painted a mural on the bedroom wall of his adopted daughter meredith hodges featuring patty with a balloon charlie brown jumping over a candlestick and snoopy playing on all fours the wall was removed in  donated and relocated to the charles m schulz museum in santa rosa california by thanksgiving  it was clear that schulzs first marriage was in trouble he was having an affair with a yearold woman named tracey claudius the schulzes divorced in  and in september  he married jean forsyth clyde whom he had first met when she brought her daughter to his hockey rink they remained married for  years until schulzs death in  schulz in  kidnapping attemptedit on sunday may   two gunmen wearing ski masks entered the cartoonists home through an unlocked door planning to kidnap jean schulz but the attempt failed when schulzs daughter jill drove up to the house prompting the wouldbe kidnappers to flee she saw what was happening and called the police from a neighbors house sonoma county sheriff dick michaelsen said it was obviously an attempted kidnapransom this was a targeted criminal act they knew exactly who the victims

reportedly brahms declining health and retirementedit in july  schulz underwent heart bypass surgery during his hospital stay president ronald reagan phoned to wish him a quick recovery in the s schulz complained that sometimes my hand shakes so much i have to hold my wrist to draw this led to the erroneous assumption that schulz had parkinsons disease however according to a letter from his physician placed in the archives of the charles m schulz museum by his widow schulz had essential tremor a condition alleviated by beta blockers despite this schulz insisted on writing and drawing the strip by himself charles schulzs star on the hollywood walk of fame in november  schulz suffered several small strokes along with a blocked aorta and later it was discovered that he had colon cancer that had metastasized because of the chemotherapy and the fact that he could not see clearly he announced his retirement on december   this was difficult for schulz who was quoted as telling al roker on the today show i never dreamed that this was what would happen to me i always had the feeling that i would probably stay with the strip until i was in my early eighties but all of a sudden its gone its been taken away from me i did not take this away from me schulz was asked if for his final peanuts strip charlie brown would finally get to kick that certain football after so many decades one of the many recurring themes in peanuts was charlie browns attempts to kick a football while lucy was holding it only to have lucy pull it back at the last moment causing charlie brown to fall on his back his response oh no definitely not i couldnt have charlie brown kick that football that would be a terrible disservice to him after nearly half a century yet in a december  interview holding back tears he recounted the moment when he signed the panel of his final strip saying “all of a sudden i thought you know that poor poor kid he never even got to kick the football what a dirty trick — he never had a chance to kick the football” deathedit schulz died in his sleep at home on february   at around  pm from colon cancer the last original peanuts strip was published the very next day on sunday february  schulz had previously predicted that the strip would outlive him with his reason being that his comic strips were usually drawn weeks before their publication schulz was buried at pleasant hills cemetery in sebastopol california as part of his contract with the syndicate schulz requested that no other artist be allowed to draw the peanuts comic strip united features had legal ownership of the strip but honored his wishes instead syndicating reruns of the strip to newspapers new television specials have also been produced since schulzs death however the stories are based on previous strips and schulz always stated that peanuts tv shows were entirely separate from the strip new stories have also been produced for publication as licensed comic books schulz was honored on

held at the baltimore comic convention in baltimore maryland biographiesedit multiple biographies have been written about schulz including rheta grimsley johnsons good grief the story of charles m schulz  which schulz authorized the lengthiest biography schulz and peanuts a biography  by david michaelis has been heavily criticized by the schulz family schulzs son monte stated it has a number of factual errors throughout  including factual errors of interpretation and extensively documents these errors in a number of essays however michaelis maintains that there is no question his work is accurate although cartoonist bill watterson creator of calvin and hobbes feels the biography does justice to schulzs legacy while giving insight into the emotional impetus of the creation of the strips cartoonist and critic rc harvey regards the book as falling short both in describing schulz as a cartoonist and in fulfilling michaelis stated aim of understanding how charles schulz knew the world harvey feels the biography bends the facts to a thesis rather than evoking a thesis from the facts dan shanahans review in the american book review vol  no  of michaelis biography faults the biography not for factual errors but for a predisposition to finding problems in schulzs life to explain his art regardless of how little the material lends itself to michaelis interpretations shanahan cites in particular such things as michaelis crude characterizations of schulzs mothers family and an almost voyeuristic quality to the hundred pages devoted to the breakup of schulzs first marriage in light of michaelis biography and the controversy surrounding his interpretation of the personality who was charles schulz responses from schulzs family reveal some intimate knowledge about the schulzs persona beyond that of mere artist legacyedit on july   camp snoopy opened at knotts berry farm a forested mountain theme area featuring the peanuts characters it has rides designed for younger children and is one of the most popular areas of the amusement park when the mall of america in bloomington minnesota opened in  the amusement park in the center of the mall was themed around

st paul in  there was charlie brown around town  brought looking for lucy in  along came linus blankets st paul ending in  with snoopy lying on his doghouse the statues were auctioned off at the end of each summer so some remain around the city but others have been relocated the auction proceeds were used for artists scholarships and for permanent bronze statues of the peanuts characters these bronze statues are in landmark plaza and rice park in downtown st paul the charles m schulz museum and research center in santa rosa opened on august   two blocks away from his former studio

thirdhighest earning deceased celebrity as he had earned  million in the previous year in  he was ranked sixth according to tod benoit in his book where are they buried how did they die charles m schulzs income during his lifetime totaled more than  billion calvin and hobbes creator bill watterson wrote in  peanuts pretty much defines the modern comic strip so even now its hard to see it with fresh eyes the clean minimalist drawings the sarcastic humor the unflinching emotional honesty the inner thoughts of a household pet the serious treatment of children the wild fantasies the merchandising on an enormous scale—in countless ways schulz blazed the wide trail that most every cartoonist since has tried to follow religionedit according to a  spiritual biography schulzs faith was complex and personal he often touched on religious themes in his work including the classic television cartoon a charlie brown christmas  which features the character linus van pelt quoting the king james version of the bible luke – to explain what christmas is all about in personal interviews schulz mentioned that linus represented his spiritual side but the spiritual biography points out a much wider array of religious references from schulz than just what linus spoke schulz reared in a nominally lutheran family had been active in the church of god anderson indiana as a young adult and then later taught sunday school at a united methodist church in the s robert l short interpreted certain themes and conversations in peanuts as being consistent with parts of christian theology and used them as illustrations during his lectures about the gospel as he explained in his bestselling paperback book the gospel according to peanuts the first of several books he wrote on religion and peanuts and other popular culture items from the late s schulz said in interviews that some people had described him as a secular humanist though he didnt know one way or another i do not go to church anymore i guess you might say ive come around to secular humanism an obligation i believe all humans have to others and the world we live in in  schulzs widow said about his religious views i think that he was a deeply thoughtful and spiritual man sparky was not the sort of person who would say oh thats gods will or god will take care of it i think to him that was an easy statement and he thought that god was much more complicated when he came back from the army he was very lonely his mother had died and he was invited to church by a pastor who had prepared his mothers service from the church of god sparkys father was worried about him and was talking to the pastor and so the pastor invited sparky to come to church so sparky went to church joined the youth group and for a good – years he went to bible study and went to church  times a week  bible studies  service he said he had read the bible through three times and taught sunday school he was always looking for what those passages really might have meant some of his discussions with priests and ministers were so interesting because he wanted to find out what these people who he thought were more educated than he thought when he taught sunday school he would never tell people what to believe god was very important to him but in a very deep way in a very mysterious way notesedit  charles m schulz

hunting dog that eats pins tacks and razor blades is owned by c f schulz st paul minn and drawn by sparky cf was his father carl fred schulz schulz attended richards gordon elementary school in saint paul where he skipped two halfgrades he became a shy timid teenager perhaps as a result of being the youngest in his class at central high school one wellknown episode in his high school life was the rejection of his drawings by his high school yearbook which he referred to in peanuts where lucy asks charlie brown to sign a picture he drew of a horseonly to say it was a prank a fivefoottall statue of snoopy was placed in the schools main office  years latercitation needed military service and postwar jobsedit in february  schulzs mother dena died after a long illness at the time of her death he had only recently been made aware that she suffered from cancer schulz had by all accounts been very close to his mother and her death made a strong impression on him around the same time schulz was drafted into the united states army he served as a staff sergeant with the th armored division in europe as a squad leader on a  caliber machine gun team his unit saw combat only at the very end of the war schulz said that he only had one opportunity to fire his machine gun but forgot to load it fortunately he said the german soldier he could have fired at willingly surrendered years later schulz proudly spoke of his wartime service after being discharged in late  schulz returned to minneapolis he did lettering for a roman catholic comic magazine timeless topix and then in july  took a job at art instruction inc reviewing and grading lessons submitted by students schulz himself had been a student of the school taking a correspondence course from it before he was drafted he worked at the school for a number of years while he developed his career as a comic creator until he was making enough money from comics to be able to do that fulltime careeredit schulzs first group of regular cartoons a weekly series of onepanel jokes entitled lil folks was published from june  to january  in the st paul pioneer press with schulz usually doing four onepanel drawings per issue it was in lil folks that schulz first used the name charlie brown for a character although he applied the name in four gags to three different boys as well as one buried in sand the series also had a dog that looked much like snoopy in may  schulz sold his first onepanel drawing to the saturday evening post within the next two years a total of  untitled drawings by schulz were published in the post simultaneously with his work for st paul pioneer press around the same time he tried to have lil folks syndicated through the newspaper enterprise association schulz would have been an independent contractor for the syndicate unheard of in the s but the deal fell through lil folks was dropped from the pioneer press in january  later that year schulz approached the united feature syndicate with the onepanel series lil folks and the syndicate became interested however by that time schulz had also developed a comic strip using normally four panels rather than one and reportedly to schulzs delight the syndicate preferred this version peanuts made its first appearance on october   in seven newspapers the weekly sundaypage debuted on january   after a somewhat slow beginning peanuts eventually became one of the most popular comic strips of all time as well as one of the most influential schulz also had a shortlived sportsoriented comic strip called its only a game – but he abandoned it due to the demands of the successful peanuts from  to  he contributed a singlepanel strip young pillars featuring teenagers to youth a publication associated with the church of god in  and  he illustrated two volumes of art linkletters kids say the darndest things and in  a collection of letters dear president johnson by bill adler peanutsedit main article peanuts at its height peanuts was published daily in  papers in  countries in  languages over the nearly  years that peanuts was published schulz drew nearly  strips the strips themselves plus merchandise and product endorsements produced revenues of more than  billion per year with schulz earning an estimated  million to  million annually during the life of the strip schulz took only one vacation a fiveweek break in late  to celebrate his th birthday reruns of the strip ran during his vacation the only time reruns occurred while schulz was alive the first book collection of peanuts strips was published in july  by rinehart  company many more books followed and these collections greatly contributed to the increasing popularity of the strip in  fantagraphics began their complete peanuts series peanuts also proved popular in other media the first animated tv special a charlie brown christmas aired in december  and won an emmy award numerous tv specials were to follow the latest being happiness is a warm blanket charlie brown in  until his death schulz wrote or cowrote the tv specials and carefully oversaw production of them schulz receiving his star on the hollywood walk of fame at knotts berry farm in june  charlie brown the principal character for peanuts was named after a coworker at the art instruction inc schulz drew much more inspiration than this from his own life some examples being like charlie browns parents schulzs father was a barber and his mother a housewife schulz admitted in interviews that like charlie brown he had often felt shy and withdrawn in his life in an interview with charlie rose in may  schulz observed i suppose there’s a melancholy feeling in a lot of cartoonists because cartooning like all other humor comes from bad things happening schulz reportedly had an intelligent dog when he was a boy although this dog was a pointer and not a beagle as was snoopy family photos of the dog confirm a certain physical resemblance references to snoopys brother spike living outside of needles california were likely influenced by the few years – that the schulz family lived there they had moved to needles to join other family members who had relocated from minnesota to tend to an ill cousin schulzs inspiration for charlie browns unrequited love to the little redhaired girl was donna mae johnson an art instruction inc accountant with whom he fell in love when schulz finally proposed to her in june  shortly after he had made his first contract with his syndicate she turned him down and married another man linus and shermy were named for his good friends linus maurer and sherman plepler respectively peppermint patty was inspired by patricia swanson one of his cousins on his mothers side schulz devised the characters name when he saw peppermint candies in his house influencesedit the charles m schulz museum counts milton caniff terry and the pirates and bill mauldin as key influences on schulzs work in his own strip schulz regularly described snoopys annual veterans day visits with mauldin including mention of mauldins world war ii cartoons schulz and critics also credited george herriman krazy kat roy crane wash tubbs elzie c segar thimble theatre and percy crosby skippy among his influences in a  address to fellow cartoonists schulz discussed several of his influences his biographer rheta grimsley johnson said however it would be impossible to narrow down three or two or even one direct influence on schulzs personal drawing style the uniqueness of peanuts has set it apart for years that oneofkind quality permeates every aspect of the strip and very clearly extends to the drawing it is purely his with no clear forerunners and no subsequent pretenders the charles m schulz museum and research center has stated that schulz watched the movie citizen kane   times the character lucy van pelt also expresses a fondness for the film and in one strip she cruelly spoils the ending for her younger brother personal lifeedit in april  schulz married joyce halverson no relation to schulzs mother dena halverson schulz later in the same year schulz and joyce moved to colorado springs colorado their first child a son named monte was born in february  and three further children were born later in minnesota schulz and his family returned to minneapolis and stayed until  they then moved to sebastopol california where schulz built his first studio until then hed worked at home or in a small rented office room it was here that schulz was interviewed for the unaired television documentary a boy named charlie brown some of the footage was eventually used in a later documentary charlie brown and charles schulz schulzs father died while visiting him in  the same year schulzs sebastopol studio burned down by  schulz had moved to santa rosa california where he lived and worked until his death while briefly living in colorado springs schulz painted a mural on the bedroom wall of his adopted daughter meredith hodges featuring patty with a balloon charlie brown jumping over a candlestick and snoopy playing on all fours the wall was removed in  donated and relocated to the charles m schulz museum in santa rosa california by thanksgiving  it was clear that schulzs first marriage was in trouble he was having an affair with a yearold woman named tracey claudius the schulzes divorced in  and in september  he married jean forsyth clyde whom he had first met when she brought her daughter to his hockey rink they remained married for  years until schulzs death in  schulz in  kidnapping attemptedit on sunday may   two gunmen wearing ski masks entered the cartoonists home through an unlocked door planning to kidnap jean schulz but the attempt failed when schulzs daughter jill drove up to the house prompting the wouldbe kidnappers to flee she saw what was happening and called the police from a neighbors house sonoma county sheriff dick michaelsen said it was obviously an attempted kidnapransom this was a targeted criminal act they knew exactly who the victims were neither schulz nor his wife was hurt during the incident sportsedit charles m schulz highland arena on snelling avenue and ford parkway in saint paul minnesota schulz had a long association with ice sports and both figure skating and ice hockey featured prominently in his cartoons in santa rosa he owned the redwood empire ice

peanuts adored beethoven schulzs personal favorite composer was reportedly brahms declining health and retirementedit in july  schulz underwent heart bypass surgery during his hospital stay president ronald reagan phoned to wish him a quick recovery in the s schulz complained that sometimes my hand shakes so much i have to hold my wrist to draw this led to the erroneous assumption that schulz had parkinsons disease however according to a letter from his physician placed in the archives of the charles m schulz museum by his widow schulz had essential tremor a condition alleviated by beta blockers despite this schulz insisted on writing and drawing the strip by himself charles schulzs star on the hollywood walk of fame in november  schulz suffered several small strokes along with a blocked aorta and later it was discovered that he had colon cancer that had metastasized because of the chemotherapy and the fact that he could not see clearly he announced his retirement on december   this was difficult for schulz who was quoted as telling al roker on the today show i never dreamed that this was what would happen to me i always had the feeling that i would probably stay with the strip until i was in my early eighties but all of a sudden its gone its been taken away from me i did not take this away from me schulz was asked if for his final peanuts strip charlie brown would finally get to kick that certain football after so many decades one of the many recurring themes in peanuts was charlie browns attempts to kick a football while lucy was holding it only to have lucy pull it back at the last moment causing charlie brown to fall on his back his response oh no definitely not i couldnt have charlie brown kick that football that would be a terrible disservice to him after nearly half a century yet in a december  interview holding back tears he recounted the moment when he signed the panel of his final strip saying “all of a sudden i thought you know that poor poor kid he never even got to kick the football what a dirty trick — he never had a chance to kick the football” deathedit schulz died in his sleep at home on february   at around  pm from colon cancer the last original peanuts strip was published the very next day on sunday february  schulz had previously predicted that the strip would outlive him with his reason being that his comic strips were usually drawn weeks before their publication schulz was buried at pleasant hills cemetery in sebastopol california as part of his contract with the syndicate schulz requested that no other artist be allowed to draw the peanuts comic strip united features had legal ownership of the strip but honored his wishes instead syndicating reruns of the strip to newspapers new television specials have also been produced since schulzs death however the stories are based on previous strips and schulz always stated that peanuts tv shows were entirely separate from the strip new stories have also been

johnson director of the charles m schulz museum at the  harvey awards held at the baltimore comic convention in baltimore maryland biographiesedit multiple biographies have been written about schulz including rheta grimsley johnsons good grief the story of charles m schulz  which schulz authorized the lengthiest biography schulz and peanuts a biography  by david michaelis has been heavily criticized by the schulz family schulzs son monte stated it has a number of factual errors throughout  including factual errors of interpretation and extensively documents these errors in a number of essays however michaelis maintains that there is no question his work is accurate although cartoonist bill watterson creator of calvin and hobbes feels the biography does justice to schulzs legacy while giving insight into the emotional impetus of the creation of the strips cartoonist and critic rc harvey regards the book as falling short both in describing schulz as a cartoonist and in fulfilling michaelis stated aim of understanding how charles schulz knew the world harvey feels the biography bends the facts to a thesis rather than evoking a thesis from the facts dan shanahans review in the american book review vol  no  of michaelis biography faults the biography not for factual errors but for a predisposition to finding problems in schulzs life to explain his art regardless of how little the material lends itself to michaelis interpretations shanahan cites in particular such things as michaelis crude characterizations of schulzs mothers family and an almost voyeuristic quality to the hundred pages devoted to the breakup of schulzs first marriage in light of michaelis biography and the controversy surrounding his interpretation of the personality who was charles schulz responses from schulzs family reveal some intimate knowledge about the schulzs persona beyond that of mere artist legacyedit on july   camp snoopy opened at knotts berry farm a forested mountain theme area featuring the peanuts characters it has rides designed for younger children and is one of the most popular areas of the amusement park when the mall of america in bloomington minnesota opened in  the amusement park in the center of the mall was themed around schulzs peanuts characters until the mall lost the rights to use the brand in  the jean and charles schulz

the following four years statues of a different peanuts character were placed on the sidewalks of st paul in  there was charlie brown around town  brought looking for lucy in  along came linus blankets st paul ending in  with snoopy lying on his doghouse the statues were auctioned off at the end of each summer so some remain around the city but others have been relocated the auction

he was ranked sixth according to tod benoit in his book where are they buried how did they die charles m schulzs income during his lifetime totaled more than  billion calvin and hobbes creator bill watterson wrote in  peanuts pretty much defines the modern comic strip so even now its hard to see it with fresh eyes the clean minimalist drawings the sarcastic humor the unflinching emotional honesty the inner thoughts of a household pet the serious treatment of children the wild fantasies the merchandising on an enormous scale—in countless ways schulz blazed the wide trail that most every cartoonist since has tried to follow religionedit according to a  spiritual biography schulzs faith was complex and personal he often touched on religious themes in his work including the classic television cartoon a charlie brown christmas  which features the character linus van pelt quoting the king james version of the bible luke – to explain what christmas is all about in personal interviews schulz mentioned that linus represented his spiritual side but the spiritual biography points out a much wider array of religious references from schulz than just what linus spoke schulz reared in a nominally lutheran family had been active in the church of god anderson indiana as a young adult and then later taught sunday school at a united methodist church in the s robert l short interpreted certain themes and conversations in peanuts as being consistent with parts of christian theology and used them as illustrations during his lectures about the gospel as he explained in his bestselling paperback book the gospel according to peanuts the first of several books he wrote on religion and peanuts and other popular culture items from the late s schulz said in interviews that some people had described him as a secular humanist though he didnt know one way or another i do not go to church anymore i guess you might say ive come around to secular humanism an obligation i believe all humans have to others and the world we live in in  schulzs widow said about his religious views i think that he was a deeply thoughtful and spiritual man sparky was not the sort of person who would say oh thats gods will or god will take care of it i think to him that was an easy statement and he thought that god was much more complicated when he came back from the army he was very lonely his mother had died and he was invited to church by a pastor who had prepared his mothers service from the church of god sparkys father was worried about him and was talking to the pastor and so the pastor invited sparky to come to church so sparky went to church joined the youth group and for a good – years he went to bible study and went to church  times a week  bible studies  service he said he had read the bible through three times and taught sunday school he was always looking for what those passages really might have meant some of his discussions with priests and ministers were so interesting because he wanted to find out what these people who he thought were more educated than he thought when he taught sunday school he would never tell people what to believe god was very important to him but in a very deep way in a very mysterious way notesedit  charles m schulz familysearchcom united states social security death index february   retrieved march     a b boxer sarah

uncle called him sparky after the horse spark plug in billy debecks comic strip barney google schulz loved drawing and sometimes drew his family dog spike who ate unusual things such as pins and tacks in  schulz drew a picture of spike and sent it to ripleys believe it or not his drawing appeared in robert ripleys syndicated panel captioned a hunting dog that eats pins tacks and razor blades is owned by c f schulz st paul minn and drawn by sparky cf was his father carl fred schulz schulz attended richards gordon elementary school in saint paul where he skipped two halfgrades he became a shy timid teenager perhaps as a result of being the youngest in his class at central high school one wellknown episode in his high school life was the rejection of his drawings by his high school yearbook which he referred to in peanuts where lucy asks charlie brown to sign a picture he drew of a horseonly to say it was a prank a fivefoottall statue of snoopy was placed in the schools main office  years latercitation needed military service and postwar jobsedit in february  schulzs mother dena died after a long illness at the time of her death he had only recently been made aware that she suffered from cancer schulz had by all accounts been very close to his mother and her death made a strong impression on him around the same time schulz was drafted into the united states army he served as a staff sergeant with the th armored division in europe as a squad leader on a  caliber machine gun team his unit saw combat only at the very end of the war schulz said that he only had one opportunity to fire his machine gun but forgot to load it fortunately he said the german soldier he could have fired at willingly surrendered years later schulz proudly spoke of his wartime service after being discharged in late  schulz returned to minneapolis he did lettering for a roman catholic comic magazine timeless topix and then in july  took a job at art instruction inc reviewing and grading lessons submitted by students schulz himself had been a student of the school taking a correspondence course from it before he was drafted he worked at the school for a number of years while he developed his career as a comic creator until he was making enough money from comics to be able to do that fulltime careeredit schulzs first group of regular cartoons a weekly series of onepanel jokes entitled lil folks was published from june  to january  in the st paul pioneer press with schulz usually doing four onepanel drawings per issue it was in lil folks that schulz first used the name charlie brown for a character although he applied the name in four gags to three different boys as well as one buried in sand the series also had a dog that looked much like snoopy in may  schulz sold his first onepanel drawing to the saturday evening post within the next two years a total of  untitled drawings by schulz were published in the post simultaneously with his work for st paul pioneer press around the same time he tried to have lil folks syndicated through the newspaper enterprise association schulz would have been an independent contractor for the syndicate unheard of in the s but the deal fell through lil folks was dropped from the pioneer press in january  later that year schulz approached the united feature syndicate with the onepanel series lil folks and the syndicate became interested however by that time schulz had also developed a comic strip using normally four panels rather than one and reportedly to schulzs delight the syndicate preferred this version peanuts made its first appearance on october   in seven newspapers the weekly sundaypage debuted on january   after a somewhat slow beginning peanuts eventually became one of the most popular comic strips of all time as well as one of the most influential schulz also had a shortlived sportsoriented comic strip called its only a game – but he abandoned it due to the demands of the successful peanuts from  to  he contributed a singlepanel strip young pillars featuring teenagers to youth a publication associated with the church of god in  and  he illustrated two volumes of art linkletters kids say the darndest things and in  a collection of letters dear president johnson by bill adler peanutsedit main article peanuts at its height peanuts was published daily in  papers in  countries in  languages over the nearly  years that peanuts was published schulz drew nearly  strips the strips themselves plus merchandise and product endorsements produced revenues of more than  billion per year with schulz earning an estimated  million to  million annually during the life of the strip schulz took only one vacation a fiveweek break in late  to celebrate his th birthday reruns of the strip ran during his vacation the only time reruns occurred while schulz was alive the first book collection of peanuts strips was published in july  by rinehart  company many more books followed and these collections greatly contributed to the increasing popularity of the strip in  fantagraphics began their complete peanuts series peanuts also proved popular in other media the first animated tv special a charlie brown christmas aired in december  and won an emmy award numerous tv specials were to follow the latest being happiness is a warm blanket charlie brown in  until his death schulz wrote or cowrote the tv specials and carefully oversaw production of them schulz receiving his star on the hollywood walk of fame at knotts berry farm in june  charlie brown the principal character for peanuts was named after a coworker at the art instruction inc schulz drew much more inspiration than this from his own life some examples being like charlie browns parents schulzs father was a barber and his mother a housewife schulz admitted in interviews that like charlie brown he had often felt shy and withdrawn in his life in an interview with charlie rose in may  schulz observed i suppose there’s a melancholy feeling in a lot of cartoonists because cartooning like all other humor comes from bad things happening schulz reportedly had an intelligent dog when he was a boy although this dog was a pointer and not a beagle as was snoopy family photos of the dog confirm a certain physical resemblance references to snoopys brother spike living outside of needles california were likely influenced by the few years – that the schulz family lived there they had moved to needles to join other family members who had relocated from minnesota to tend to an ill cousin schulzs inspiration for charlie browns unrequited love to the little redhaired girl was donna mae johnson an art instruction inc accountant with whom he fell in love when schulz finally proposed to her in june  shortly after he had made his first contract with his syndicate she turned him down and married another man linus and shermy were named for his good friends linus maurer and sherman plepler respectively peppermint patty was inspired by patricia swanson one of his cousins on his mothers side schulz devised the characters name when he saw peppermint candies in his house influencesedit the charles m schulz museum counts milton caniff terry and the pirates and bill mauldin as key influences on schulzs work in his own strip schulz regularly described snoopys annual veterans day visits with mauldin including mention of mauldins world war ii cartoons schulz and critics also credited george herriman krazy kat roy crane wash tubbs elzie c segar thimble theatre and percy crosby skippy among his influences in a  address to fellow cartoonists schulz discussed several of his influences his biographer rheta grimsley johnson said however it would be impossible to narrow down three or two or even one direct influence on schulzs personal drawing style the uniqueness of peanuts has set it apart for years that oneofkind quality permeates every aspect of the strip and very clearly extends to the drawing it is purely his with no clear forerunners and no subsequent pretenders the charles m schulz museum and research center has stated that schulz watched the movie citizen kane   times the character lucy van pelt also expresses a fondness for the film and in one strip she cruelly spoils the ending for her younger brother personal lifeedit in april  schulz married joyce halverson no relation to schulzs mother dena halverson schulz later in the same year schulz and joyce moved to colorado springs colorado their first child a son named monte was born in february  and three further children were born later in minnesota schulz and his family returned to minneapolis and stayed until  they then moved to sebastopol california where schulz built his first studio until then hed worked at home or in a small rented office room it was here that schulz was interviewed for the unaired television documentary a boy named charlie brown some of the footage was eventually used in a later documentary charlie brown and charles schulz schulzs father died while visiting him in  the same year schulzs sebastopol studio burned down by  schulz had moved to santa rosa california where he lived and worked until his death while briefly living in colorado springs schulz painted a mural on the bedroom wall of his adopted daughter meredith hodges featuring patty with a balloon charlie brown jumping over a candlestick and snoopy playing on all fours the wall was removed in  donated and relocated to the charles m schulz museum in santa rosa california by thanksgiving  it was clear that schulzs first marriage was in trouble he was having an affair with a yearold woman named tracey claudius the schulzes divorced in  and in september  he married jean forsyth clyde whom he had first met when she brought her daughter to his hockey rink they remained married for  years until schulzs death in  schulz in  kidnapping attemptedit on sunday may   two gunmen wearing ski masks entered the cartoonists home through an unlocked door planning to kidnap jean schulz but the attempt failed when schulzs daughter jill drove up to the house prompting the wouldbe kidnappers to flee she saw what was happening and called the police from a neighbors house sonoma county sheriff dick michaelsen said it was obviously an attempted kidnapransom this was a targeted criminal act they knew exactly who the victims were neither schulz nor his wife was hurt during the incident sportsedit charles m schulz highland arena on snelling avenue and ford parkway in saint paul minnesota schulz had a long association with ice sports and both figure skating and ice hockey featured prominently in his cartoons in santa rosa he owned the redwood empire ice arena which opened in  and featured a

artist in his later years was andrew wyeth as a young adult schulz also developed a great passion for classical music although the character schroeder in peanuts adored beethoven schulzs personal favorite composer was reportedly brahms declining health and retirementedit in july  schulz underwent heart bypass surgery during his hospital stay president ronald reagan phoned to wish him a quick recovery in the s schulz complained that sometimes my hand shakes so much i have to hold my wrist to draw this led to the erroneous assumption that schulz had parkinsons disease however according to a letter from his physician placed in the archives of the charles m schulz museum by his widow schulz had essential tremor a condition alleviated by beta blockers despite this schulz insisted on writing and drawing the strip by himself charles schulzs star on the hollywood walk of fame in november  schulz suffered several small strokes along with a blocked aorta and later it was discovered that he had colon cancer that had metastasized because of the chemotherapy and the fact that he could not see clearly he announced his retirement on december   this was difficult for schulz who was quoted as telling al roker on the today show i never dreamed that this was what would happen to me i always had the feeling that i would probably stay with the strip until i was in my early eighties but all of a sudden its gone its been taken away from me i did not take this away from me schulz was asked if for his final peanuts strip charlie brown would finally get to kick that certain football after so many decades one of the many recurring themes in peanuts was charlie browns attempts to kick a football while lucy was holding it only to have lucy pull it back at the last moment causing charlie brown to fall on his back his response oh no definitely not i couldnt have charlie brown kick that football that would be a terrible disservice to him after nearly half a century yet in a december  interview holding back tears he recounted the moment when he signed the panel of his final strip saying “all of a sudden i thought you know that poor poor kid he never even got to kick the football what a dirty trick — he never had a chance to kick the football” deathedit schulz died in his sleep at home on february   at around  pm from colon cancer the last original peanuts strip was published the very next day on sunday february  schulz had previously predicted that the strip would outlive him with his reason being that his comic strips were usually drawn weeks before their publication schulz was buried at pleasant hills cemetery in sebastopol california as part of his contract with the syndicate schulz requested that no other artist be allowed to draw the peanuts comic strip united features had legal ownership of the strip but honored his wishes instead syndicating reruns of the strip to newspapers new television specials have also been produced since schulzs death however the stories are based on previous strips and schulz always stated that peanuts tv shows were entirely separate from the strip new stories have also been produced for publication as licensed comic books

harvey awards held at the baltimore comic convention in baltimore maryland biographiesedit multiple biographies have been written about schulz including rheta grimsley johnsons good grief the story of charles m schulz  which schulz authorized the lengthiest biography schulz and peanuts a biography  by david michaelis has been heavily criticized by the schulz family schulzs son monte stated it has a number of factual errors throughout  including factual errors of interpretation and extensively documents these errors in a number of essays however michaelis maintains that there is no question his work is accurate although cartoonist bill watterson creator of calvin and hobbes feels the biography does justice to schulzs legacy while giving insight into the emotional impetus of the creation of the strips cartoonist and critic rc harvey regards the book as falling short both in describing schulz as a cartoonist and in fulfilling michaelis stated aim of understanding how charles schulz knew the world harvey feels the biography bends the facts to a thesis rather than evoking a thesis from the facts dan shanahans review in the american book review vol  no  of michaelis biography faults the biography not for factual errors but for a predisposition to finding problems in schulzs life to explain his art regardless of how little the material lends itself to michaelis interpretations shanahan cites in particular such things as michaelis crude characterizations of schulzs mothers family and an almost voyeuristic quality to the hundred pages devoted to the breakup of schulzs first marriage in light of michaelis biography and the controversy surrounding his interpretation of the personality who was charles schulz responses from schulzs family reveal some intimate knowledge about the schulzs persona beyond that of mere artist legacyedit on july   camp snoopy opened at knotts berry farm a forested mountain theme area featuring the peanuts characters it has rides designed for younger children and is one of the most popular areas of the amusement park when the mall of america in bloomington minnesota opened in  the amusement park in the center of the mall was themed around

in  with the placing of  foottall  m statues of snoopy throughout the city of st paul every summer for the following four years statues of a different peanuts character were placed on the sidewalks of st paul in  there was charlie brown around town  brought looking for lucy in  along came linus blankets st paul ending in  with snoopy lying on his doghouse the statues were auctioned off at the end of each summer so some remain around the city but others have been relocated the auction proceeds were used for artists scholarships and for permanent bronze statues of the peanuts characters these bronze statues are in landmark plaza and rice park in downtown st paul the charles m schulz museum and research center in santa rosa opened on august   two blocks away from his former studio

thirdhighest earning deceased celebrity as he had earned  million in the previous year in  he was ranked sixth according to tod benoit in his book where are they buried how did they die charles m schulzs income during his lifetime totaled more than  billion calvin and hobbes creator bill watterson wrote in  peanuts pretty much defines the modern comic strip so even now its hard to see it with fresh eyes the clean minimalist drawings the sarcastic humor the unflinching emotional honesty the inner thoughts of a household pet the serious treatment of children the wild fantasies the merchandising on an enormous scale—in countless ways schulz blazed the wide trail that most every cartoonist since has tried to follow religionedit according to a  spiritual biography schulzs faith was complex and personal he often touched on religious themes in his work including the classic television cartoon a charlie brown christmas  which features the character linus van pelt quoting the king james version of the bible luke – to explain what christmas is all about in personal interviews schulz mentioned that linus represented his spiritual side but the spiritual biography points out a much wider array of religious references from schulz than just what linus spoke schulz reared in a nominally lutheran family had been active in the church of god anderson indiana as a young adult and then later taught sunday school at a united methodist church in the s robert l short interpreted certain themes and conversations in peanuts as being consistent with parts of christian theology and used them as illustrations during his lectures about the gospel as he explained in his bestselling paperback book the gospel according to peanuts the first of several books he wrote on religion and peanuts and other popular culture items from the late s schulz said in interviews that some people had described him as a secular humanist though he didnt know one way or another i do not go to church anymore i guess you might say ive come around to secular humanism an obligation i believe all humans have to others and the world we live in in  schulzs widow said about his religious views i think that he was a deeply thoughtful and spiritual man sparky was not the sort of person who would say oh thats gods will or god will take care of it i think to him that was an easy statement and he thought that god was much more complicated when he came back from the army he was very lonely his mother had died and he was invited to church by a pastor who had prepared his mothers service from the church of god sparkys father was worried about him and was talking to the pastor and so the pastor invited sparky to come to church so sparky went to church joined the youth group and for a good – years he went to bible study and went to church  times a week  bible studies  service he said he had read the bible through three times and taught sunday school he was always looking for what those passages really might have meant some of his discussions with priests and ministers were so interesting because he wanted to find out what these people who he thought were more educated than he thought when he taught sunday school he would never tell people what to believe god was very important to him but in a very deep way in a very mysterious way notesedit  charles m schulz

postwar jobsedit in february  schulzs mother dena died after a long illness at the time of her death he had only recently been made aware that she suffered from cancer schulz had by all accounts been very close to his mother and her death made a strong impression on him around the same time schulz was drafted into the united states army he served as a staff sergeant with the th armored division in europe as a squad leader on a  caliber machine gun team his unit saw combat only at the very end of the war schulz said that he only had one opportunity to fire his machine gun but forgot to load it

minneapolis he did lettering for a roman catholic comic magazine timeless topix and then in july  took a job at art instruction inc reviewing and grading lessons submitted by students schulz himself had been a student of the school taking a correspondence course from it before he was drafted he worked at the school for a number of years while he developed his career as a comic creator until he was making enough money from comics to be able to do that fulltime careeredit schulzs first group of regular cartoons a weekly series of onepanel jokes entitled lil folks was published from june  to january  in the st paul pioneer press with schulz usually doing four onepanel drawings per issue it was in lil folks that schulz first used the name charlie brown for a character although he applied the name in four gags to three different boys as well as one buried in sand the series also had a dog that looked much like snoopy in may  schulz sold his first onepanel drawing to the saturday evening post within the next two years a total of  untitled drawings by schulz were published in the post simultaneously with his work for st paul pioneer press around the same time he tried to have lil folks syndicated through the newspaper enterprise association schulz would have been an independent contractor for the syndicate unheard of in the s but the deal fell through lil folks was dropped from the pioneer press in january  later that year schulz approached the united feature syndicate with the onepanel series lil folks and the syndicate became interested however by that time schulz had also developed a comic strip using normally four panels rather than one and reportedly to schulzs delight the syndicate preferred this version peanuts made its first appearance on october   in seven newspapers the weekly sundaypage debuted on january   after a somewhat slow beginning peanuts eventually became one of the most popular comic strips of all time as well as one of the most influential schulz also had a shortlived sportsoriented comic strip called its only a game – but he abandoned it due to the demands of the successful peanuts from  to  he contributed a singlepanel strip young pillars featuring teenagers to youth a publication associated with the church of god in  and  he illustrated two volumes of art linkletters kids say the darndest things and in  a collection of letters dear president johnson by bill adler peanutsedit main article peanuts at its height peanuts was published daily in  papers in  countries in  languages over the nearly  years that peanuts was published schulz drew nearly  strips the strips themselves plus merchandise and product endorsements produced revenues of more than  billion per year with schulz earning an estimated  million to  million annually during the life of the strip schulz took only one vacation a fiveweek break in late  to celebrate his th birthday reruns of the strip ran during his vacation the only time reruns occurred while schulz was alive the first book collection of peanuts strips was published in july  by rinehart  company many more books followed and these collections greatly contributed to the increasing popularity of the strip in  fantagraphics began their complete peanuts series peanuts also proved popular in other media the first animated tv special a charlie brown christmas aired in december  and won an emmy award numerous tv specials were to follow the latest being happiness is a warm blanket charlie brown in  until his death schulz wrote or cowrote the tv specials and carefully oversaw production of them schulz receiving his star on the hollywood walk of fame at knotts berry farm in june  charlie brown the principal character for peanuts was named after a coworker at the art instruction inc schulz drew much more inspiration than this from his own life some examples being like charlie browns parents schulzs father was a barber and his mother a housewife schulz admitted in interviews that like charlie brown he had often felt shy and withdrawn in his life in an interview with charlie rose in may  schulz observed i suppose there’s a melancholy feeling in a lot of cartoonists because cartooning like all other humor comes from bad things happening schulz reportedly had an intelligent dog when he was a boy although this dog was a pointer and not a beagle as was snoopy family photos of the dog confirm a certain physical resemblance references to snoopys brother spike living outside of needles california were likely influenced by the few years – that the schulz family lived there they had moved to needles to join other family members who had relocated from minnesota to tend to an ill cousin schulzs inspiration for charlie browns unrequited love to the little redhaired girl was donna mae johnson an art instruction inc accountant with whom he fell in love when schulz finally proposed to her in june  shortly after he had made his first contract with his syndicate she turned him down and married another man linus and shermy were named for his good friends linus maurer and sherman plepler respectively peppermint patty was inspired by patricia swanson one of his cousins on his mothers side schulz devised the characters name when he saw peppermint candies in his house influencesedit the charles m schulz museum counts milton caniff terry and the pirates and bill mauldin as key influences on schulzs work in his own strip schulz regularly described snoopys annual veterans day visits with mauldin including mention of mauldins world war ii cartoons schulz and critics also credited george herriman krazy kat roy crane wash tubbs elzie c segar thimble theatre and percy crosby skippy among his influences in a  address to fellow cartoonists schulz discussed several of his influences his biographer rheta grimsley johnson said however it would be impossible to narrow down three or two or even one direct influence on schulzs personal drawing style the uniqueness of peanuts has set it apart for years that oneofkind quality permeates every aspect of the strip and very clearly extends to the drawing it is purely his with no clear forerunners and no subsequent pretenders the charles m schulz museum and research center has stated that schulz watched the movie citizen kane   times the character lucy van pelt also expresses a fondness for the film and in one strip she cruelly spoils the ending for her younger brother personal lifeedit in april  schulz married joyce halverson no relation to schulzs mother dena halverson schulz later in the same year schulz and joyce moved to colorado springs colorado their first child a son named monte was born in february  and three further children were born later in minnesota

health and retirementedit in july  schulz underwent heart bypass surgery during his hospital stay president ronald reagan phoned to wish him a quick recovery in the s schulz complained that sometimes my hand shakes so much i have to hold my wrist to draw this led to the erroneous assumption that schulz had parkinsons disease however according to a letter from his physician placed in the archives of the charles m schulz museum by his widow schulz had essential tremor a condition alleviated by beta blockers despite this schulz insisted on writing and drawing the strip by himself charles schulzs star on the hollywood walk of fame in november  schulz suffered several small strokes along with a blocked aorta and later it was discovered that he had colon cancer that had metastasized because of the chemotherapy and the fact that he could not see clearly he announced his retirement on december   this was difficult for schulz who was quoted as telling al roker on the today show i never dreamed that this was what would happen to me i always had the feeling that i would probably stay with the strip until i was in my early eighties but all of a sudden its gone its been taken away from me i did not take this away from me schulz was asked if for his final peanuts strip charlie brown would finally get to kick that certain football after so many decades one of the many recurring themes in peanuts was charlie browns attempts to kick a football while lucy was holding it only to have lucy pull it back at the last moment causing charlie brown to fall on his back his response oh no definitely not i couldnt have charlie brown kick that football that would be a terrible disservice to him after nearly half a century yet in a december  interview holding back tears he recounted the moment when he signed the panel of his final strip saying “all of a sudden i thought you know that poor poor kid he never even got to kick the football what a dirty trick — he never had a chance to kick the football” deathedit schulz died in his sleep at home on february   at around  pm from colon cancer the last original peanuts strip was published the very next day on sunday february  schulz had previously predicted that the strip would outlive him with his reason being that his comic strips were usually drawn weeks before their publication schulz was buried at pleasant hills cemetery in sebastopol california as part of his contract with the syndicate schulz requested that no other artist be allowed to draw the peanuts comic strip united features had legal ownership of the strip but honored his wishes instead syndicating reruns of the strip to newspapers new television specials have also been produced since schulzs death however the stories are based on previous strips and schulz

convention in baltimore maryland biographiesedit multiple biographies have been written about schulz including rheta grimsley johnsons good grief the story of charles m schulz  which schulz authorized the lengthiest biography schulz and peanuts a biography  by david michaelis has been heavily criticized by the schulz family schulzs son monte stated it has a number of factual errors throughout  including factual errors of interpretation and extensively documents these errors in a number of essays however michaelis maintains that there is no question his work is accurate although cartoonist bill watterson creator of calvin and hobbes feels the biography does justice to schulzs legacy while giving insight into the emotional impetus of the creation of the strips cartoonist and critic rc harvey regards the book as falling short both in describing schulz as a cartoonist and in fulfilling michaelis stated aim of understanding how charles schulz knew the world harvey feels the biography bends the facts to a thesis rather than evoking a thesis from the facts dan shanahans review in the american book review vol  no  of michaelis biography faults the biography not for factual errors but for a predisposition to finding problems in schulzs life to explain his art regardless of how little the material lends itself to michaelis interpretations shanahan cites in particular such things as michaelis crude characterizations of schulzs mothers family and an almost voyeuristic quality to the hundred pages devoted to the breakup of schulzs first marriage in light of michaelis biography and the controversy surrounding his interpretation of the personality who was charles schulz responses from schulzs family reveal some intimate knowledge about the schulzs persona beyond that of mere artist legacyedit on july   camp snoopy opened at knotts berry farm a forested mountain theme area featuring the peanuts characters it has rides designed for younger children and is one of the most popular areas of the amusement park when the mall of america in bloomington minnesota opened in  the amusement park in the center of the mall was themed around schulzs peanuts characters until the

charlie brown around town  brought looking for lucy in  along came linus blankets st paul ending in  with snoopy lying on his doghouse the statues were auctioned off at the end of each summer so some remain around the city but others have been relocated the auction proceeds were used for artists scholarships and for permanent bronze statues of the peanuts characters these bronze statues are in

deceased celebrity as he had earned  million in the previous year in  he was ranked sixth according to tod benoit in his book where are they buried how did they die charles m schulzs income during his lifetime totaled more than  billion calvin and hobbes creator bill watterson wrote in  peanuts pretty much defines the modern comic strip so even now its hard to see it with fresh eyes the clean minimalist drawings the sarcastic humor the unflinching emotional honesty the inner thoughts of a household pet the serious treatment of children the wild fantasies the merchandising on an enormous scale—in countless ways schulz blazed the wide trail that most every cartoonist since has tried to follow religionedit according to a  spiritual biography schulzs faith was complex and personal he often touched on religious themes in his work including the classic television cartoon a charlie brown christmas  which features the character linus van pelt quoting the king james version of the bible luke – to explain what christmas is all about in personal interviews schulz mentioned that linus represented his spiritual side but the spiritual biography points out a much wider array of religious references from schulz than just what linus spoke schulz reared in a nominally lutheran family had been active in the church of god anderson indiana as a young adult and then later taught sunday school at a united methodist church in the s robert l short interpreted certain themes and conversations in peanuts as being consistent with parts of christian theology and used them as illustrations during his lectures about the gospel as he explained in his bestselling paperback book the gospel according to peanuts the first of several books he wrote on religion and peanuts and other popular culture items from the late s schulz said in interviews that some people had described him as a secular humanist though he didnt know one way or another i do not go to church anymore i guess you might say ive come around to secular humanism an obligation i believe all humans have to others and the world we live in in  schulzs widow said about his religious views i think that he was a deeply thoughtful and spiritual man sparky was not the sort of person who would say oh thats gods will or god will take care of it i think to him that was an easy statement and he thought that god was much more complicated when he came back from the army he was very lonely his mother had died and he was invited to church by a pastor who had prepared his mothers service from the church of god sparkys father was worried about him and was talking to the pastor and so the pastor invited sparky to come to church so sparky went to church joined the youth group and for a good – years he went to bible study and went to church  times a week  bible studies  service he said he had read the bible through three times and taught sunday school he was always looking for what those passages really might have meant some of his discussions with priests and ministers were so interesting because he wanted to find out what these people who he thought were more educated than he thought when he taught sunday school he would never tell people what to believe god was very important to him but in a very deep way in a very mysterious way notesedit  charles m schulz familysearchcom united states social

hunting dog that eats pins tacks and razor blades is owned by c f schulz st paul minn and drawn by sparky cf was his father carl fred schulz schulz attended richards gordon elementary school in saint paul where he skipped two halfgrades he became a shy timid teenager perhaps as a result of being the youngest in his class at central high school one wellknown episode in his high school life was the rejection of his drawings by his high school yearbook which he referred to in peanuts where lucy asks charlie brown to sign a picture he drew of a horseonly to say it was a prank a fivefoottall statue of snoopy was placed in the schools main office  years latercitation needed military service and postwar jobsedit in february  schulzs mother dena died after a long illness at the time of her death he had only recently been made aware that she suffered from cancer schulz had by all accounts been very close to his mother and her death made a strong impression on him around the same time schulz was drafted into the united states army he served as a staff sergeant with the th armored division in europe as a squad leader on a  caliber machine gun team his unit saw combat only at the very end of the war schulz said that he only had one opportunity to fire his machine gun but forgot to load it fortunately he said the german soldier he could have fired at willingly surrendered years later schulz proudly spoke of his wartime service after being discharged in late  schulz returned to minneapolis he did lettering for a roman catholic comic magazine timeless topix and then in july  took a job at art instruction inc reviewing and grading lessons submitted by students schulz himself had been a student of the school taking a correspondence course from it before he was drafted he worked at the school for a number of years while he developed his career as a comic creator until he was making enough money from comics to be able to do that fulltime careeredit schulzs first group of regular cartoons a weekly series of onepanel jokes entitled lil folks was published from june  to january  in the st paul pioneer press with schulz usually doing four onepanel drawings per issue it was in lil folks that schulz first used the name charlie brown for a character although he applied the name in four gags to three different boys as well as one buried in sand the series also had a dog that looked much like snoopy in may  schulz sold his first onepanel drawing to the saturday evening post within the next two years a total of  untitled drawings by schulz were published in the post simultaneously with his work for st paul pioneer press around the same time he tried to have lil folks syndicated through the newspaper enterprise association schulz would have been an independent contractor for the syndicate unheard of in the s but the deal fell through lil folks was dropped from the pioneer press in january  later that year schulz approached the united feature syndicate with the onepanel series lil folks and the syndicate became interested however by that time schulz had also developed a comic strip using normally four panels rather than one and reportedly to schulzs delight the syndicate preferred this version peanuts made its first appearance on october   in seven newspapers the weekly sundaypage debuted on january   after a somewhat slow beginning peanuts eventually became one of the most popular comic strips of all time as well as one of the most influential schulz also had a shortlived sportsoriented comic strip called its only a game – but he abandoned it due to the demands of the successful peanuts from  to  he contributed a singlepanel strip young pillars featuring teenagers to youth a publication associated with the church of god in  and  he illustrated two volumes of art linkletters kids say the darndest things and in  a collection of letters dear president johnson by bill adler peanutsedit main article peanuts at its height peanuts was published daily in  papers in  countries in  languages over the nearly  years that peanuts was published schulz drew nearly  strips the strips themselves plus merchandise and product endorsements produced revenues of more than  billion per year with schulz earning an estimated  million to  million annually during the life of the strip schulz took only one vacation a fiveweek break in late  to celebrate his th birthday reruns of the strip ran during his vacation the only time reruns occurred while schulz was alive the first book collection of peanuts strips was published in july  by rinehart  company many more books followed and these collections greatly contributed to the increasing popularity of the strip in  fantagraphics began their complete peanuts series peanuts also proved popular in other media the first animated tv special a charlie brown christmas aired in december  and won an emmy award numerous tv specials were to follow the latest being happiness is a warm blanket charlie brown in  until his death schulz wrote or cowrote the tv specials and carefully oversaw production of them schulz receiving his star on the hollywood walk of fame at knotts berry farm in june  charlie brown the principal character for peanuts was named after a coworker at the art instruction inc schulz drew much more inspiration than this from his own life some examples being like charlie browns parents schulzs father was a barber and his mother a housewife schulz admitted in interviews that like charlie brown he had often felt shy and withdrawn in his life in an interview with charlie rose in may  schulz observed i suppose there’s a melancholy feeling in a lot of cartoonists because cartooning like all other humor comes from bad things happening schulz reportedly had an intelligent dog when he was a boy although this dog was a pointer and not a beagle as was snoopy family photos of the dog confirm a certain physical resemblance references to snoopys brother spike living outside of needles california were likely influenced by the few years – that the schulz family lived there they had moved to needles to join other family members who had relocated from minnesota to tend to an ill cousin schulzs inspiration for charlie browns unrequited love to the little redhaired girl was donna mae johnson an art instruction inc accountant with whom he fell in love when schulz finally proposed to her in june  shortly after he had made his first contract with his syndicate she turned him down and married another man linus and shermy were named for his good friends linus maurer and sherman plepler respectively peppermint patty was inspired by patricia swanson one of his cousins on his mothers side schulz devised the characters name when he saw peppermint candies in his house influencesedit the charles m schulz museum counts milton caniff terry and the pirates and bill mauldin as key influences on schulzs work in his own strip schulz regularly described snoopys annual veterans day visits with mauldin including mention of mauldins world war ii cartoons schulz and critics also credited george herriman krazy kat roy crane wash tubbs elzie c segar thimble theatre and percy crosby skippy among his influences in a  address to fellow cartoonists schulz discussed several of his influences his biographer rheta grimsley johnson said however it would be impossible to narrow down three or two or even one direct influence on schulzs personal drawing style the uniqueness of peanuts has set it apart for years that oneofkind quality permeates every aspect of the strip and very clearly extends to the drawing it is purely his with no clear forerunners and no subsequent pretenders the charles m schulz museum and research center has stated that schulz watched the movie citizen kane   times the character lucy van pelt also expresses a fondness for the film and in one strip she cruelly spoils the ending for her younger brother personal lifeedit in april  schulz married joyce halverson no relation to schulzs mother dena halverson schulz later in the same year schulz and joyce moved to colorado springs colorado their first child a son named monte was born in february  and three further children were born later in minnesota schulz and his family returned to minneapolis and stayed until  they then moved to sebastopol california where schulz built his first studio until then hed worked at home or in a small rented office room it was here that schulz was interviewed for the unaired television documentary a boy named charlie brown some of the footage was eventually used in a later documentary charlie brown and charles schulz schulzs father died while visiting him in  the same year schulzs sebastopol studio burned down by  schulz had moved to santa rosa california where he lived and worked until his death while briefly living in colorado springs schulz painted a mural on the bedroom wall of his adopted daughter meredith hodges featuring patty with a balloon charlie brown jumping over a candlestick and snoopy playing on all fours the wall was removed in  donated and relocated to the charles m schulz museum in santa rosa california by thanksgiving  it was clear that schulzs first marriage was in trouble he was having an affair with a yearold woman named tracey claudius the schulzes divorced in  and in september  he married jean forsyth clyde whom he had first met when she brought her daughter to his hockey rink they remained married for  years until schulzs death in  schulz in  kidnapping attemptedit on sunday may   two gunmen wearing ski masks entered the cartoonists home through an unlocked door planning to kidnap jean schulz but the attempt failed when schulzs daughter jill drove up to the house prompting the wouldbe kidnappers to flee she saw what was happening and called the police from a neighbors house sonoma county sheriff dick michaelsen said it was obviously an attempted kidnapransom this was a targeted criminal act they knew exactly who the victims were neither schulz nor his wife was hurt during the incident sportsedit charles m schulz highland arena on snelling avenue and ford parkway in saint paul minnesota schulz had a long association with ice sports and both figure skating and ice hockey featured prominently in his cartoons in santa rosa he owned the redwood empire ice

peanuts adored beethoven schulzs personal favorite composer was reportedly brahms declining health and retirementedit in july  schulz underwent heart bypass surgery during his hospital stay president ronald reagan phoned to wish him a quick recovery in the s schulz complained that sometimes my hand shakes so much i have to hold my wrist to draw this led to the erroneous assumption that schulz had parkinsons disease however according to a letter from his physician placed in the archives of the charles m schulz museum by his widow schulz had essential tremor a condition alleviated by beta blockers despite this schulz insisted on writing and drawing the strip by himself charles schulzs star on the hollywood walk of fame in november  schulz suffered several small strokes along with a blocked aorta and later it was discovered that he had colon cancer that had metastasized because of the chemotherapy and the fact that he could not see clearly he announced his retirement on december   this was difficult for schulz who was quoted as telling al roker on the today show i never dreamed that this was what would happen to me i always had the feeling that i would probably stay with the strip until i was in my early eighties but all of a sudden its gone its been taken away from me i did not take this away from me schulz was asked if for his final peanuts strip charlie brown would finally get to kick that certain football after so many decades one of the many recurring themes in peanuts was charlie browns attempts to kick a football while lucy was holding it only to have lucy pull it back at the last moment causing charlie brown to fall on his back his response oh no definitely not i couldnt have charlie brown kick that football that would be a terrible disservice to him after nearly half a century yet in a december  interview holding back tears he recounted the moment when he signed the panel of his final strip saying “all of a sudden i thought you know that poor poor kid he never even got to kick the football what a dirty trick — he never had a chance to kick the football” deathedit schulz died in his sleep at home on february   at around  pm from colon cancer the last original peanuts strip was published the very next day on sunday february  schulz had previously predicted that the strip would outlive him with his reason being that his comic strips were usually drawn weeks before their publication schulz was buried at pleasant hills cemetery in sebastopol california as part of his contract with the syndicate schulz requested that no other artist be allowed to draw the peanuts comic strip united features had legal ownership of the strip but honored his wishes instead syndicating reruns of the strip to newspapers new television specials have also been produced since schulzs death however the stories are based on previous strips and schulz always stated that peanuts tv shows were entirely separate from the strip new stories have also been

johnson director of the charles m schulz museum at the  harvey awards held at the baltimore comic convention in baltimore maryland biographiesedit multiple biographies have been written about schulz including rheta grimsley johnsons good grief the story of charles m schulz  which schulz authorized the lengthiest biography schulz and peanuts a biography  by david michaelis has been heavily criticized by the schulz family schulzs son monte stated it has a number of factual errors throughout  including factual errors of interpretation and extensively documents these errors in a number of essays however michaelis maintains that there is no question his work is accurate although cartoonist bill watterson creator of calvin and hobbes feels the biography does justice to schulzs legacy while giving insight into the emotional impetus of the creation of the strips cartoonist and critic rc harvey regards the book as falling short both in describing schulz as a cartoonist and in fulfilling michaelis stated aim of understanding how charles schulz knew the world harvey feels the biography bends the facts to a thesis rather than evoking a thesis from the facts dan shanahans review in the american book review vol  no  of michaelis biography faults the biography not for factual errors but for a predisposition to finding problems in schulzs life to explain his art regardless of how little the material lends itself to michaelis interpretations shanahan cites in particular such things as michaelis crude characterizations of schulzs mothers family and an almost voyeuristic quality to the hundred pages devoted to the breakup of schulzs first marriage in light of michaelis biography and the controversy surrounding his interpretation of the personality who was charles schulz responses from schulzs family reveal some intimate knowledge about the schulzs persona beyond that of mere artist legacyedit on july   camp snoopy opened at knotts berry farm a forested mountain theme area featuring the peanuts characters it has rides designed for younger children and is one of the most popular areas of the amusement park when the mall of america in bloomington minnesota opened in  the amusement park in the center of the mall was themed around schulzs peanuts characters until the mall lost the rights to use the brand in  the jean and charles schulz

the following four years statues of a different peanuts character were placed on the sidewalks of st paul in  there was charlie brown around town  brought looking for lucy in  along came linus blankets st paul ending in  with snoopy lying on his doghouse the statues were auctioned off at the end of each summer so some remain around the city but others have been relocated the auction

he was ranked sixth according to tod benoit in his book where are they buried how did they die charles m schulzs income during his lifetime totaled more than  billion calvin and hobbes creator bill watterson wrote in  peanuts pretty much defines the modern comic strip so even now its hard to see it with fresh eyes the clean minimalist drawings the sarcastic humor the unflinching emotional honesty the inner thoughts of a household pet the serious treatment of children the wild fantasies the merchandising on an enormous scale—in countless ways schulz blazed the wide trail that most every cartoonist since has tried to follow religionedit according to a  spiritual biography schulzs faith was complex and personal he often touched on religious themes in his work including the classic television cartoon a charlie brown christmas  which features the character linus van pelt quoting the king james version of the bible luke – to explain what christmas is all about in personal interviews schulz mentioned that linus represented his spiritual side but the spiritual biography points out a much wider array of religious references from schulz than just what linus spoke schulz reared in a nominally lutheran family had been active in the church of god anderson indiana as a young adult and then later taught sunday school at a united methodist church in the s robert l short interpreted certain themes and conversations in peanuts as being consistent with parts of christian theology and used them as illustrations during his lectures about the gospel as he explained in his bestselling paperback book the gospel according to peanuts the first of several books he wrote on religion and peanuts and other popular culture items from the late s schulz said in interviews that some people had described him as a secular humanist though he didnt know one way or another i do not go to church anymore i guess you might say ive come around to secular humanism an obligation i believe all humans have to others and the world we live in in  schulzs widow said about his religious views i think that he was a deeply thoughtful and spiritual man sparky was not the sort of person who would say oh thats gods will or god will take care of it i think to him that was an easy statement and he thought that god was much more complicated when he came back from the army he was very lonely his mother had died and he was invited to church by a pastor who had prepared his mothers service from the church of god sparkys father was worried about him and was talking to the pastor and so the pastor invited sparky to come to church so sparky went to church joined the youth group and for a good – years he went to bible study and went to church  times a week  bible studies  service he said he had read the bible through three times and taught sunday school he was always looking for what those passages really might have meant some of his discussions with priests and ministers were so interesting because he wanted to find out what these people who he thought were more educated than he thought when he taught sunday school he would never tell people what to believe god was very important to him but in a very deep way in a very mysterious way notesedit  charles m schulz familysearchcom united states social security death index february   retrieved march     a b boxer sarah
