medicine particularly reconstructive surgery and burn treatment since it began in the early s techniques developed by this field’s early pioneers such as gail k naughton have made incredible procedures possible that earlier generations could have barely foreseen  as a result thousands of patients worldwide now have less painful more powerful treatment options for a range of afflictions from heart disease to diabetes to severe burns and torn ligaments new york native naughton earned a bs in biology in  from st francis college in brooklyn she went on to earn an ms degree in histology from new york university nyu medical center in  and a phd in hematology in  while at nyu medical center naughton also served as an assistant professor of research an instructor with the department of biology and from  to  as a supervisor in the clinical immunofluorescence lab she also served as an assistant professor with the department of biology at queensborough community college part of the city university of new york cuny from  to  she held the post of visiting professor with the department of pediatric hematology at mt sinai medical center in new york from  to   while pursuing postdoctoral studies in the department of dermatology at nyu medical center naughton made her first in what would become a long list of significant discoveries at that time around  scientists who wished to grow cells in a lab for experimentation grew them in a growth medium on a flat surface such as in a petri dish however while she was involved in a study to observe the effects of certain drugs on tumors it became clear to naughton that the cells behaved differently in this environment than they would behave in their typical environment inside the human body she began working on a threedimensional framework that would mimic the reallife conditions of cells as they grew inside the human body the framework could be manipulated to simulate a variety of conditions and types of cells  it also used bioreactors to “trick” cells into responding as if they were actually inside the body growing tissue was pulled and stretched in the way that it would be if it were inside a human being so that proteins could be secreted to make sections of the tissue stronger the way a heart valve is stressed inside a human heart or a ligament is pulled inside a foot or hand naughton’s technique proved successful and was able to generate complex tissues that were virtually indistinguishable from those found in nature however at the time of her discovery little work had been done in this area and many of her ideas were met with skepticism as a result she became skillful at presenting her research in a way that would garner further funding and support this helped her develop entrepreneurial skills that would later land her in a variety of executive roles with major biotechnology companies including her own in  she founded advanced tissue sciences in new york she later moved the company to la jolla calif to take advantage of the biotech community that was beginning to develop in and around san diego the company went public in  and naughton received a patent for her matrix technology in  she has held a variety of posts with the advanced tissue sciences such as executive vice president and coo  president and coo  and president  in  she was named vice chairman of the board of directors meanwhile naughton developed a variety of other novel treatments and tissue engineering processes of particular note through a joint venture with smith  nephew advanced tissue sciences brought several successful skin grafting products to market the firm’s transcyte product for instance was used to treat second and thirddegree burn patients the temporary synthetic skin product covers wounds more effectively than other dressings with a low rate of rejection by the human body it may be used to cover burn wounds while a patient’s body recovers enough to begin regenerating new skin on its own a second product dermagraft is used to repair skin wounds as well but it grafts itself to the patient’s own tissue and becomes part of the person’s body it is used extensively to treat patients with diabetic foot ulcers naughton’s work has formed the basis for a wide and growing range of treatments and studies for nerve regeneration periodontal surgery bone healing cartilage repair antiaging cosmetics liver and other organ constructs and more her numerous honors and awards for this work include the  intellectual property owners associations national inventor of the year award and the  lindberghcarrel prize from the charles and anne lindbergh foundation and the alexis carrel foundation in  naughton completed an executive mba with the anderson school at the university of california los angeles since august of   she serves as the dean of the college of business administration at san diego state university naughton is currently the founder

naughton advances in tissue engineering november   dr gail k naughton advances in tissue engineeringby lilly manske medtech staffgail k naughton phd president and chief operating officer of advanced tissue sciences has been awarded the th annual national inventor of the year by the intellectual property owners association ipo in honor of her pioneering work in the field of tissue engineeringas the first individual woman to earn this award dr naughton is being honored for the process she invented to produce human tissues and organs outside of the human body her invention utilizes stromal cells which are the cells that form the surrounding matrix of a tissue these cells are seeded onto threedimensional scaffolding and placed into specially designed bioreactors to simulate the body there the cells multiply in layers secreting proteins and numerous cellular factors ultimately forming a tissue matrix tissuespecific cells are then seeded onto the matrix to form a living tissue equivalent that can be used to repair or replace a patients own damaged tissue her company advanced tissue sciences entered into a joint venture with smith and nephew to apply tissue engineering technology to create products to treat wounds such as burns and diabetic foot uclers dr naughton’s pioneering work in tissue engineering has helped define a new industry dedicated to helping the millions of people who suffer tissue loss or endstage organ failuremedtech what is your focus in the area of tissue engineeringdr naughton the company’s original focus was on structural tissues we started with skin and the first product being transcyte™ a temporary skin replacement that addresses severe and partial thickness burns the fda us food and drug administration approved this product and we are now heading forward with dermagraft™ permanent dermal replacement skin product for which the premarket approval application to the fda is currently under review if approved this product will treat severe wounds such as diabetic skin ulcers which affect many many patients with diabetes and can often lead to surgical revisions and amputationsmedtech what was the inspiration for your inventiondr naughton while studying different types of tumors and how they can react to vaccines it became evident that cells grown on a flat dish acted very differently than threedimensional cells as they grow in the body our invention simply mimics what nature does by giving the cells a threedimensional framework on which to grow that became the crux of this entire invention which has led to therapeutic products in not only skin but in cartilage and cardiovascular treatments as wellmedtech what is the biggest challenge when you are trying to replicate nature or trying to create a process that imitates naturedr naughton you really have to understand not only the mechanical forces that the tissue or organ is seeing during the development but all the chemical signaling that takes place between the cells and between the cells and the proteins that they secrete it is a matter of working in parallel with outside research as we learn more about new growth factors and cells’ conditions we adapt those to our systems so our approach of growing the tissues is unique in that we not only put human cells on scaffolds so that it is a completely human tissue but we have these proprietary bioreactors that closely mimic the conditions of the body for example we grow heart valves by opening and closing the growing heart valve during the manufacturing period so that the cells actually see the mechanical forces they would unless inside the heart this forms a more physiological or more normally functional tissue that not only looks like a heart valve but is mechanically as strong as a native heart valvemedtech how will tissue engineering benefit the publicdr naughton i hope that advanced tissue sciences will redefine how transplantation is done so that in the nottoodistantfuture no patients will have to die because they are on a transplant list and there are not enough organs to go aroundmedtech what kinds of tissues have you recreated to datedr naughton in addition to the skin products cartilage bone blood vessels and heart valves we have been successful in animal studies for liver implant for pancreatic islet transplants to be able to eventually cure diabetes and with other structures such as the partial intestinal replacements trachea replacements and replacements of cranial facial bone and cartilagemedtech how do you think this invention benefits the scientific communitydr naughton there are two points here the whole field of tissue engineering is unique in a couple of ways first it forces the integration of a number of scientific disciplines that in the past did not work together there are cell biologists who need to say what growth factors the cells are making and what they need to make there are biochemists that need to work closely to look at the different types of matrix proteins and collagen that the cells are laying down and how they influence the cells’ growth the transplant surgeons are not only looking for an improvement over what they currently can do they need to make sure that the patient will not reject the products biomedical engineers look at how to test the strength of the tissue and how to better improve the bioreactors to mimic the conditions of the body finally you have polymer chemists these threedimensional scaffolds need to mimic the three dimensionality of the tissue or organ that we are trying to grow and they need to be controlled so that they dissolve as the cells themselves are laying down a tissue there is a diverse group of scientists working closely together for the first timethe second point is one of those rare occasions where the science and product development did not go along the normal path of first being discovered in the university then being funded by the government or seeking seed capital to take the product through preclinical studies the invention was the first in the whole field of tissue engineering it was born through others in the field as well in the mid s there was no grant support by the government for this field because the field was so new those in tissue engineering jumped straight from concept into public companies what is so terrific is that the nih and the others are giving significant grants to us and to other companies in the field so we are working almost a little backward in this stage where we are starting collaborations with a number of key universities using federal funds to take the next level of products forwardmedtech what does this mean for a person today who is in need of tissue transplantationdr naughton what this means for a burn victim today is that instead of having to go through painful painful dressing changes three times a daythat require morphine and a hospital stay of a couple of weeksthey can get a tissue engineered product in our case it is called trancytes it not only helps reduce the pain immediately but it also allows hospital discharge in a day or two and much more rapid healing it is affecting many many patients today with burns particularly children there is longterm trauma involved with the tremendous pain that burn patients have to endure while in the hospitalfor patients with severe wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers it means having the likelihood of having your ulcer heal and moving away from needing a partial or full amputation in the near future patients with joint degeneration and with coronary artery disease should be able to have tissueengineered products not only replace their own tissue but in the case of coronary disease help their own body to regenerate new blood vessels in their damaged heart this way they can go forward without having the pain and the debilitating changes in their conditions that occur when they do not have enough oxygen delivered to their heart musclesmedtech does the development of your invention depend on the funding you receivedr naughton we have funding from the outsidefrom the public marketbut we also have a number of key government grants that are helping us take our longerterm products forward for example we just received a  million grant from nist national institute of standards and technology to further develop a tissueengineered product that induces new bloodvessel formation in the heart we share a million nih grant with university of washington to actually grow pieces of heart muscle for heart transplantation we also received an  nih award to grow replacement cartilage discs for patients with tmj disease which affects the jaw the company received all of these grants this yearthat is just a small list of some of the outside funding plus it helps us to develop the science and collaborate with outside universities in doing so endorsement by the government for our approach to tissue engineering reinforces the tremendous potential this technology has to impact healthcare and provide tissueengineered products to the patients who need themmedtech how long have you been working on this inventiondr naughton it started in  the company raised funding and then went public in  when we started in  the goal was to grow bone marrow outside the body however very quickly we saw that this technology had applications to other tissues and organs such as skin cartilage and cardiovascular tissuemedtech what is your personal hope with this invention and where do think it will take you in your studiesdr naughton my sincere hope what fuels me everyday is being able to make sure that not one patient ever dies waiting for a transplant even more importantly my hope is that patients get their transplants earlier before they become so ill that their quality of life suffers so just to be able to improve the quality of life for patients with damaged tissue and organs and make sure that everyone who needs products such as these gets them it is very easy to be inspired and difficult not to be all you need is a couple of parents to come to you and say “thank you so much for helping my child” or have a few little twoyear olds run into your arms and give you a hug that really does it for me last updated nov       hero archives   dr wayne caputo revolutionizing treatment of ulcers dr
