tax rates rise and as baby boomers continue their march into retirement expect investments in noload variable annuities to grow alan lavine   may   as more wirehouse registered reps join rias or start their own as income tax rates rise and as baby boomers continue their march into retirement expect investments in noload variable annuities to grow over the past five years ending in  sales of noload variable annuities totaled  billion representing about  percent of total deferred variable annuity sales according to morningstar some believe that the amount invested in noload variable annuities could double over the next five years in fact a number of insurance companies have lately been launching inexpensive noload annuities targeted at the wave of registered reps becoming ria adviser reps jefferson national rolled out its first flatfee annuity in  but over the last couple of years fidelity ameritas insurance pacific life metlife prudential and nationwide financial have rolled out their own versions of this product too “brokerdealers are demanding noload variable annuities and insurance companies are meeting the demand” says tamiko toland editor of annuity insight ” insurers are aggressively pursuing the noload market with new product designs” advisors now have  noload or lowcost variable annuities to pick from according to morningstar the average brokersold variable annuity has backend surrender charges and annual costs as high as  basis points including fund management fees mortality and expense charges and principal guarantees surrender periods can last up to seven years the noload annuities in contrast are low cost and have simplified features and no surrender charges toland says the costs on these newer products which include mortality and expenses charges fund management fees and guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit fees tend to run at about  basis points annually for example jefferson national’s “monument advisor” is a commissionfree and surrender feefree variable annuity the product has no death benefit guarantee and no living benefit guarantee instead the insurer charges a flat  monthly fee regardless of the annuity’s size jefferson national’s product provides over  investment options including rydex and pro funds which offer alternative assets and bull and bear market funds “tactical asset allocation is playing a bigger role in asset management strategies” says jefferson national president larry greenberg since the noload annuity was launched in   million has flowed into it the average policyholder is in his or her s and invests  the cost on that  is just  basis points in insurance charges mutual fund management fees average about  basis points “we stripped out the costs and pulled out the riders” greenberg said “we streamlined the product as a taxdeferred investment our product provides four times the taxdeferral… of a typical variable annuity” fidelity investments also offers a stripped down noload product on its advisor platform the fidelity personal retirement annuity with  million in assets charges just  basis points advisors have  funds to pick from with an average cost of about  basis points the annuity does not offer death or living benefit guarantees “we are seeing more interest in our annuity and i expect to see greater interest in the future” says john danahy senior vice president at fidelity investments life insurance company boston “the focus of advisors is around taxes because their highnetworth clients are going through a period of tax increases” simplified products he says appeal to ria adviser reps because they understand the impact of tax deferral particularly on fixed income investments of course the lowcost products of jefferson national and fidelity investments aren’t for everyone they are best suited for those who want to invest large sums and are not concerned about a principal guarantee but there also are noload variable annuities that offer the popular guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits for about an extra  basis points annually fund fees range from  basis points to about  basis points annually as with the jefferson and fidelity products there are no backend surrender charges at ameritas life insurance co lincoln ne investment advisors deal directly with ameritas or go through pershing securities says patricia reiners ameritas assistant vice president the insurer has  million in its two noload variable annuity products for investment advisors the “ameritas advisor noload variable annuity” is a multimanager annuity with funds by vanguard pimco fidelity and pro funds the product comes with individual and spousal guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits for annual fees of  and  basis points respectively mortality and expense charges are just  basis points and fund management fees range from about  to  basis points last november ameritas began offering the “ameritas advisor select variable annuity” which offers  pro funds mutual funds for active money managers who want to invest in alternative asset classes “investment advisors who favor tactical asset allocation use this annuity because the pro funds are designed for up and down markets” other noload variable annuities which may be available on brokerdealer platforms include pacific life’s pacific odyssey variable annuity and prudential’s advisor choice variable annuity nationwide financial also has a noload variable annuity available through charles schwab and bank of america if your clients want to deal directly with noload investment companies lowcost choices include vanguard’s “variable annuity” the product comes with a death benefit guarantee but no living benefit protection total costs run about  to  basis points annually including its mutual funds last november fidelity teamed up with metlife to offer “the metlife growth and guaranteed income” variable annuity this noload variable annuity is exclusively distributed by fidelity total annual charges range from  to  basis points annually as with anything there is no free lunch with noload variable annuities “they turn capital gains and dividends into ordinary income” warns harold evensky a coral gables flabased ria financial research by william reichenstein professor of investment management at baylor university shows that investment advisors can do just as well after taxes by using tax efficient strategies in taxable accounts nevertheless a noload variable annuity can be an attractive option for a client who needs to unload a highcost brokersold product but still wants a lifetime withdrawal benefit rh “rick” carey president of rise enterprises inc roswell ga based consulting firm recommends that advisors do a costbenefit analysis before investing in even a lowcost variable annuity with a lifetime withdrawal benefit “i don’t think there will be a stampede on the part of feeonly advisors to recommend even the lower cost guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits” he says ”pure income annuities will buy more income from fewer invested capital assets” tags research wealth planning news  comments hide comments comment  more information about text formats text format
