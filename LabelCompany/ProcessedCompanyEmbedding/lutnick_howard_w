invention means an embodiment of the invention unless expressly specified otherwisea reference to “another embodiment” in describing an embodiment does not imply that the referenced embodiment is mutually exclusive with another embodiment eg an embodiment described before the referenced embodiment unless expressly specified otherwisethe terms “including” “comprising” and variations thereof mean “including but not limited to” unless expressly specified otherwisethe terms “a” “an” and “the” mean “one or more” unless expressly specified otherwisethe term “plurality” means “two or more” unless expressly specified otherwisethe term “herein” means “in the present application including anything which may be incorporated by reference” unless expressly specified otherwisethe phrase “at least one of” when such phrase modifies a plurality of things such as an enumerated list of things means any combination of one or more of those things unless expressly specified otherwise for example the phrase “at least one of a widget a car and a wheel” means either i a widget ii a car iii a wheel iv a widget and a car v a widget and a wheel vi a car and a wheel or vii a widget a car and a wheel the phrase “at least one of” when such phrase modifies a plurality of things does not mean “one of each of” the plurality of thingsnumerical terms such as “one” “two” etc when used as cardinal numbers to indicate quantity of something eg one widget two widgets mean the quantity indicated by that numerical term but do not mean at least the quantity indicated by that numerical term for example the phrase “one widget” does not mean “at least one widget” and therefore the phrase “one widget” does not cover eg two widgetsthe phrase “based on” does not mean “based only on” unless expressly specified otherwise in other words the phrase “based on” describes both “based only on” and “based at least on” the phrase “based at least on” is equivalent to the phrase “based at least in part on”the term “represent” and like terms are not exclusive unless expressly specified otherwise for example the term “represents” do not mean “represents only” unless expressly specified otherwise in other words the phrase “the data represents a credit card number” describes both “the data represents only a credit card number” and “the data represents a credit card number and the data also represents something else”the term “whereby” is used herein only to precede a clause or other set of words that express only the intended result objective or consequence of something that is previously and explicitly recited thus when the term “whereby” is used in a claim the clause or other words that the term “whereby” modifies do not establish specific further limitations of the claim or otherwise restricts the meaning or scope of the claimthe term “eg” and like terms mean “for example” and thus does not limit the term or phrase it explains for example in the sentence “the computer sends data eg instructions a data structure over the internet” the term “eg” explains that “instructions” are an example of “data” that the computer may send over the internet and also explains that “a data structure” is an example of “data” that the computer may send over the internet however both “instructions” and “a data structure” are merely examples of “data” and other things besides “instructions” and “a data structure” can be “data”the term “respective” and like terms mean “taken individually” thus if two or more things have “respective” characteristics then each such thing has its own characteristic and these characteristics can be different from each other but need not be for example the phrase “each of two machines has a respective function” means that the first such machine has a function and the second such machine has a function as well the function of the first machine may or may not be the same as the function of the second machinethe term “ie” and like terms mean “that is” and thus limits the term or phrase it explains for example in the sentence “the computer sends data ie instructions over the internet” the term “ie” explains that “instructions” are the “data” that the computer sends over the internetany given numerical range shall include whole and fractions of numbers within the range for example the range “ to ” shall be interpreted to specifically include whole numbers between  and  eg         and nonwhole numbers eg      where two or more terms or phrases are synonymous eg because of an explicit statement that the terms or phrases are synonymous instances of one such termphrase does not mean instances of another such termphrase must have a different meaning for example where a statement renders the meaning of “including” to be synonymous with “including but not limited to” the mere usage of the phrase “including but not limited to” does not mean that the term “including” means something other than “including but not limited to”the term “facilitating” and like terms may include any action or set of actions which help to bring about a result throughout this disclosure examples of facilitation may be given such examples should be interpreted as nonlimiting examples onlyan order query should be understood to include information that when interpreted by a computer module identifies an order for which a trade related action is desired such information may be interpreted by the computer module for use in querying stored information such as a database of stored order informationa computer modules should be understood to include any combination of hardware andor softwarea firm order should be understood to include an order for a financial instrument for which a system will execute a trade with a matching order without additional intervening authorization from an originator of the firm ordera financial instrument should be understood to include an instrument that evinces ownership of dept or equity andor any derivative thereof including equities stocks fixed income instruments bonds debentures certificates of interest or deposit warrants options futures forwards swaps or generally any securityalthough some embodiments are described with reference to order management systems which are understood in the art it should be understood that other embodiments may include an order information system an order information system should be understood any system through which information about orders to purchase andor sell financial instruments is stored including for example order management systemstwo things should be understood to match if they share one or more properties the exact properties shared may be different among various embodiments some example properties may include a type of financial instrument eg industry capitalization risk etc a security identifier eg stock symbol etc an amount of shares a price etca representation of a thing includes any indication from which a part of an underlying thing may be derivedenabling should be understood to include allowing an action to occur an action may be enabled by for example providingactivating a mechanism eg a button or other control through which the action may be performed eg by clicking a button or otherwise activating another controlbinding acceptance of an order should be understood to include an acceptance of a trade fulfilling at least part of the order that does not allow for further intervention in the execution of the trade and without the ability to revoke the acceptance eg without the ability to revoke the acceptance in any way without the ability to revoke the acceptance without a penaltysuppressing evidence should be understood to include attempting to prevent others from discovering evidence suppressing evidence of a situation or action may include not disseminating information about the situation or action disseminating false or misleading information about the situation or action disseminating false or mislead information at other times to obscure the dissemination of information about the situation or action andor any other desired actionsfacilitating execution of a trade should be understood to include performing any actions that help to bring about the execution of a trade the actions may include for example actually executing the trade transmitting a request for the execution of the trade transmitting any information that helps to bring about the trade andor any other actionsa marketplace should be understood to include a platform through which at least the following actions are performed order execution is facilitated indications of orders are accepted and matches for the orders are soughtapplying a filter to a set of things should be understood to include generating a subset of the set of things in which each thing in the subset has one or more desired propertiesa trade should be understood to fulfill part of an order for one or more things if the trade includes transfers of ownership of at least a portion of the one of more thing in accordance with the ordera participant system should be understood to include any system that allows an order management system to interface with a marketplaceii determiningthe term “determining” and grammatical variants thereof eg to determine a price determining a value determine an object which meets a certain criterion is used in an extremely broad sense the term “determining” encompasses a wide variety of actions and therefore “determining” can include calculating computing processing deriving investigating looking up eg looking up in a table a database or another data structure ascertaining and the like also “determining” can include receiving eg receiving information accessing eg accessing data in a memory and the like also “determining” can include resolving selecting choosing establishing and the likethe term “determining” does not imply certainty or absolute precision and therefore “determining” can include estimating extrapolating predicting guessing and the likethe term “determining” does not imply that mathematical processing must be performed and does not imply that numerical methods must be used and does not imply that an algorithm or process is usedthe term “determining” does not imply that any particular device must be used for example a computer need not necessarily perform the determiningiii forms of sentenceswhere a limitation of a first claim would cover one of a feature as well as more than one of a feature eg a limitation such as “at least one widget” covers one widget as well as more than one widget and where in a second claim that depends on the first claim the second claim uses a definite article “the” to refer to the limitation eg “the widget” this does not imply that the first claim covers only one of the feature and this does not imply that the second claim covers only one of the feature eg “the widget” can cover both one widget and more than one widgetwhen an ordinal number such as “first” “second” “third” and so on is used as an adjective before a term that ordinal number is used unless expressly specified otherwise merely to indicate a particular feature such as to distinguish that particular feature from another feature that is described by the same term or by a similar term for example a “first widget” may be so named merely to distinguish it from eg a “second widget” thus the mere usage of the ordinal numbers “first” and “second” before the term “widget” does not indicate any other relationship between the two widgets and likewise does not indicate any other characteristics of either or both widgets for example the mere usage of the ordinal numbers “first” and “second” before the term “widget”  does not indicate that either widget comes before or after any other in order or location  does not indicate that either widget occurs or acts before or after any other in time and  does not indicate that either widget ranks above or below any other as in importance or quality in addition the mere usage of ordinal numbers does not define a numerical limit to the features identified with the ordinal numbers for example the mere usage of the ordinal numbers “first” and “second” before the term “widget” does not indicate that there must be no more than two widgetswhen a single device article or other product is described herein more than one devicearticle whether or not they cooperate may alternatively be used in place of the single devicearticle that is described

history of the present application but not to the prosecution history of any other patent or patent application regardless of whether there are other patent applications that are considered related to the present application and regardless of whether there are other patent applications that share a claim of priority with the present applicationxi sample embodimentsinformation about orders for good or service may be tracked by an order management system oms an order management system may include data regarding desired contemplated open completed considered ongoing andor other order one typical order management system used in securities trading includes the fidessa order management system although this order management system and embodiments below focus largely on the trading of securities eg stocks bonds futures options derivatives etc it should be recognized that other embodiments may be used in connection with the trading of any goods andor services whether tangible eg food oil collectibles etc or intangible intellectual property rights contract performance etcinformation that is stored by an oms may identify a specific security that is desired eg by a user of the oms by a client of the user of the oms etc a type or class of security that is desired an amount or range of amounts of a security that is desired a desired price price range andor pricing method to be used to buy the security a limit on a desired price associated with a limit order for the security a security to be sold a price price range andor pricing method to be used to sell a security a security desired or available to be sold eg long andor short sale an amount of a security to be sold contingent buying andor selling information eg information identifying a purchase to be made if some contingent event occurs information setting amounts based on a contingent price etc andor any other informationpricing policies may include any desired pricing policy supported by a trading system in some embodiments such a pricing policy may include for example midpoint pricing in which prices are based on a midpoint between a national best offer and national best bid limit pricing in which a maximum or minimum price level cannot be passed midpoint pricing subject to such a limit volume weighted average pricing in which the weighted average price over a trading period is the bases of the price any other methods or combinations of pricing policies may be usedmarket liquidity a measure a securities ability to be bought andor sold readily through a market is recognized as a factor that may affect prices at which securities are traded for example one may have a more difficult time selling an illiquid security because potential buyers may fear they will be unable to resell the security after purchase such fear may artificially lower the price of the sale of the security from the true market value of the security to help alleviate the fears of such potential buyers accordingly a more liquid market may facilitate trading of securities at their fair market values or closer to their fair market values than they would be traded at in a less liquid marketin some markets information identifying orders eg bids offers etc that is stored by order management systems or otherwise stored internally by a trading organization or trader have not traditionally been thought of as liquidity available to the market rather such orders typically add to the liquidity of those markets only when they are made public to the market so other traders in the market may act against those orders such secret orders may be referred to as “dark pools” or “dark books” of liquidity because they remain unseen by such marketsit is recognized that enabling trading to take place using such orders may improve the liquidity of a market and thereby allow more trades to occur through a market andor allow trades to occur at a price closer to or at a fair market valueit is recognized that one problem that may be associated with using such orders in a market includes a potential that information associated with the existence of otherwise secret orders may be used to influence a market andor to diminish an advantage attributable to the originator of the information eg some insight knowledge trading algorithm etc in typical markets when bids and offers match a negotiation may take place between a buyer and a seller before any transaction is finalized such negotiations typically include revealing the existence of a matching party information about a matching order associated with the matching party andor the identity of the matching party to both parties involved in the negotiation by revealing this information the potential to “game the market” eg artificially affect a market using knowledge of the existence of orders of other people is increased and the possibly secret knowledge embodied by the orders may be made public for example a trader may end a negotiation by refusing an order in a negotiation the trader may subsequently use the knowledge that the matching party is interested in a transaction related to the security to increase or decrease the price of the security by entering one or more other orders at higher or lower prices andor use the knowledge embodied by the order to adjust otherwise adjust a trading strategyit is recognized that as the size of orders increases the chances that a trader associated with such orders is trying to game the market may decrease accordingly it is recognized that trading large blocks of liquidity may decrease the probability that gaming is occurring it is also recognized that if a trader agrees to have an order executed without a negotiation without receiving notification before the execution andor otherwise automatically the chance that the trader is trying to game the market is also decrease furthermore it is recognized that if anonymity of trading partners is maintained for part or all of a trading exchange the chances of gaming the market are also reduced accordingly participants in securities markets such as buy andor sell side participants may be more willing to participate in markets with one or more such characteristics further such participants may be more willing to allow orders present in oms to add liquidity to such markets markets with such characteristics may for example allow large blocks of securities to be moved relatively quietly compared to traditional trading mechanismsit is recognized that in some markets such as typical securities markets participants exist in an asymmetrical relationship for example participants known as sell side firms in securities markets generally act as retail brokers and researchers for investors participants known as buy side firms in securities markets generally include investment institutions that tend to buy andor sell large amounts of securities for moneymanagement purposes and keep information about their trading intentions secret accordingly the desires of these participants may not be identical some embodiments may be configured to treat differently participants with different characteristics in an attempt to balance desires of the different participantssome embodiments of a trading system may allow access to what might be traditionally untapped pools of liquidity eg orders in oms systems such systems may provide asymmetric access rules to such information to accommodate desires andor preferences of market participants such systems may include anonymity policies order size restrictions incentives filtering policies andor automatic execution of types of orders to encourage participationsome embodiments may read information from an oms or other source of orders associated with a buy side market participant information regarding such orders may be used to match information from other market participants with one or more element of anonymity automatic order execution andor order size policy implementations in some embodiments the information may be narrowcast to potential counter parties for matching with orders associated with the oms of those parties accordingly market participants such as sell side participants and buy side participants can submit orders both firm orders and oms orders that add liquidity to a market with a degree of privacy andor a security that the market is not being gamed by other participantsin some embodiments firm orders ie orders for which participants agree to automatic order execution with matching orders may be viewed anonymously by those unlikely to abuse the information andor by nobody at all in some implementations such participants may include buy side participants who may view information about firm orders if a matching order exists in an oms associated with a respective buy side participant in some implementations such participants may include participants for which matching firm orders exist eg have been submitted to a trading system by limiting the viewing of such information trading of high quality block liquidity using pools of liquidity currently not available may be encouragedin some embodiments control over one or more aspects of disclosing information about orders in an oms may reside with buy side originators of the orders in some embodiments sell side participants or other buy side participants that enter a firm order matching an order in a buy side participants oms may only be notified of the existence of such a matching order if the buy side participant with the order in its oms agrees to such notification andor agrees to an execution of a trade in some embodiments the sell side participants or other buy side participants may not be notified of the identity of the buy side participant at all but rather only be notified that some matching order was found andor executedexample structuresfig  illustrates one example trading system configured to perform one or more trades as illustrated the trading system may include a plurality of computer systems at one or more locations the illustrated embodiment includes a central system

remote computer systems some other embodiments may include a more distributed or fully distributed system such as one without any central system or with a limited central systemthe central system  or a place at which orders are executed may be called a “marketplace” in some embodiments various actions such as firm order querying firm order matching providing indications of firm ordersfirm order

queries to one or more participants andor perform any desired actions associated with oms orders in some embodiments the central system may include a regulation nms system such a system may interface with one or more other securities markets to find better pricing options for an order such action may be required in some embodiments because of securities regulationsin some embodiments the central system may be coupled to one or more remote systems by a communication network  the communication network  may include the internet one or more local area networks andor any other desired communication medium the communication network  may allow the central system to transmit andor receive information to andor from remote systems such as computer systems associated with market participants in some embodiments communication between systems modules processes andor programs may include the use of financial information exchange messaging such messaging may be encrypted or not as desired in some embodiments one or more firewalls or other security device may be included in the communication network in some embodiments system  may include one or more sell side computer systems each indicated by  the sell side systems  may include one or more trading computers configured to accept information regarding security offers eg firm orders to buy andor sell securities the sell side systems  may be configured to receive send andor processes information in some embodiments the sell side systems  may be configured to transmit one or more indications of such orders to the central system  over the communication network  in some distributed embodiments the sell side systems  may be configure to transfer information to one or more other sell side systems  andor buy side systems  in some embodiments the sell side systems  may be configured to receive information identifying a completed order execution eg from the central system  and may provide an indication of such an indication to a user eg through a trading interface in some embodiments the sell side systems  may be configured to interact with the central system  or an otherwise distributed system in some embodiments a separate computer system may act as an interface between the central system  or otherwise distributed system and the rest of the sell side system  although the sell side systems  are shown as a single system it should be recognized that any number of computers may be used to perform any desired functions of a sell side systemsome embodiments may include one or more buy side systems each indicated at  in some embodiments all or part of the buy side systems  may be located with a buy side market participant in some embodiments all or part of the buy side systems  may be distributed or located at a central location such as with central system in some embodiments the buy side systems  may include one or more trader systems each indicated at block  the trader systems  may provide an interface to one or more traders through which information may be obtained or provided traders for example may enter order information andor receive indications associated with orders through a trader systems in some embodiments the buy side systems  may include one or more oms systems  the oms systems  may perform one or more functions typically performed by an oms such functions may include storing order information providing order information to trader computers andor any other desired functions as mentioned above one example oms system includes the fidessa oms systemin some embodiments the buy side systems  may include one or more participant systems  in some embodiments the participant systems  may act as an interface between the central system  or an otherwise distributed system and the rest of the buy side system  in some embodiments the participant system may perform function related to trading such as storing order information receiving firm order queries executing orders facilitating execution of orders clearing orders facilitating clearing of orders transmitting order information determining if matching orders exist providing indication regarding order queries searching existing orders determining if an order is a firm order or a oms order andor any other desired functions participant systems may enhance the functionality of traditional oms systems by allowing otherwise unavailable pools of liquidity to become available to a marketin some embodiments participant systems  may query eg periodically randomly etc oms systems  to generate a copy of an oms database in some embodiments the oms systems  may send information to the participant systems  in response to such queries andor without any querying taking place such information may include indications of orders in the oms database eg updates of prior orders changes to orders deletions of orders new orders complete database copies etc in some embodiments a participant system  may directly access the oms database eg without the need to make a copy of the oms system  such as by querying the database in still other embodiments the oms system and participant system may be a single system and such distinctions may not be relevantin some embodiments buy side order information may be maintained in confidence on buy side systems which may be located on respective buy side participants premises by so maintaining the information buy side participants may feel more secure about the use of such information for trading and be less worried about potential information leakagein some embodiments one or more software modules may act as part of an oms system  to provide some or all buy side functionality such modules may exist in addition to andor as an alternative to the participant system  for example the module may include an update to an oms software or a companion program to an oms software programalthough fig  shows oms systems participant systems and trading systems as separate systems it should be understood that any configuration of systems may be used for example a single system may operate as all or part of any other systems eg a single system may act as an oms system and a participant system etc furthermore various systems may share information andor distribute the performance of functions for example an oms system may maintain an order database that may be read by one or more or a trading system a participant system andor any other desired systemin some embodiments one or more of the buy side or sell side systems may include mobile devices such mobile devices may include laptop computers pdas cellular telephones andor any other desired mobile devicein some embodiments one or more software modules may act as companions andor replacements to trading interface software andor oms software such companion or replacement software may include additional andor different options from traditional interface andor oms softwarealthough fig  shows buy side systems  and sell side systems  as connected to separate parts of communication network  it should be understood that such systems may be connected to a same network such as the internet or any other communication networkexample system processesfig  illustrates an example process  that may begin at block  in some embodiments process  may be performed by the central system  in other embodiments process  may be performed by one or more distributed computer systemsas indicated at block  process  may include receiving an indication of a firm order in some embodiments such an indication may be considered a binding indication on the part of the firm order submitter for example central system  may receive an indication of such an order from a buy side system eg  andor a sell side system eg  such orders may be entered for example by a trader using a trading interface at a buy or sell side firm the indication of the firm order may identify that an originator of the order is committed to a transaction eg a bid offer etc in some embodiments an indication of an order may indicate an amount of a security to buy or sell a time for a firm order to remain open a price at or around which to buy the security a limit price a pricing method an order identifier andor any other informationas indicated at block  process  may include determining if any matching firm orders are available a matching order may include an order that includes complementary terms to the firm order such terms may include a security an amount a price a time frame andor any other desired information for example the firm order may indicate that  shares of espeed stock should be purchased at an average price of  per share a prior firm order may have been received that indicates  shares of espeed stock should be sold at an average price of  per share the prior espeed order may be determined to match the later espeed order in such a situation in some embodiments orders within a price range below a maximum price above a minimum price andor matching in any other desired ways may also be determined to be matching in some embodiments orders for a larger number of smaller number of shares may be determined to be matching in some embodiments an indication of a firm order may identify a minimum andor maximum order sizepercentages for which other firm orders may be determined to be matchingin some embodiments multiple orders may be determined to be matching according to some priority mechanism so that a total number of shares of all matching orders sums to at least as much as a number indicated by the firm order indication in some embodiments in which multiple orders are determined to be matching a priority may be assigned to some of the orders based one or more characteristics of the orders an originator of the orders andor any other characteristicin some embodiments a matching firm order may have been received from a buy or sell side system such a matching order may have been stored on a machine readable medium eg a disk drive of the central system  determining if a matching firm order has previously been received may include searching a database or other listing of previously received firm orders such a database may be keyed to allow quick lookup such as by security identifier eg stock symbolsome embodiments may include maintaining a listing of firm orders such a listing may include a database maintaining the listing may include adding newly received firm orders to the listing deleting fulfilled firm orders from the listing deleting expired firm orders from the listing andor any other desired actionsas indicated at block  if one or more matching firm order is determined to exist the execution of some or all of those matching firm orders may be facilitated to fulfill the received firm order each such matching orders may fully or partially fulfill the received firm order facilitating the execution may include performing an exchange of money for a security clearing such an exchange transmitting information to a remote execution andor clearing service notifying participants andor any other desired actionin some embodiments in which multiple matching orders exist the matching orders may be matched to the received firm order based on any desired prioritizing mechanism such prioritizing mechanism may include prioritizing based on price of security first come first serve priority given to older andor most active originators of orders large orders may be matched first priority given to closest match in price andor size a round robin system andor any other desired prioritizing method in some embodiments multiple orders may be combined together to fully fulfill as many existing offers as possible in some embodiments part of each matching order may be fulfilled the part may correspond to some characteristic of the order or order originator such as order size loyalty of originator activeness of originator actual price compared to desired price etcin some embodiments process  may end at block  if a matching firm order is found in some embodiments if one or more matching firm orders exist but do not completely fulfill the received firm order execution of the matching firm order may be facilitated and a remaining balance of the firm order may be treated as if no matching firm order had been found eg may continue as described below with a firm order that includes only the left over order amountin some embodiments as indicated at block  process  may include querying one or more participants to find a matching order in some embodiments querying the participants may include transmitting one or more requests from a central system eg  to a buy side system eg  in other embodiments querying the participants may include transmitting requests from a computer of a distributed system to another computer of the distributed system such as from one buy side participant to another or one sell side participant to a buy side participant etc in some embodiments such querying may continue from one participant to another participant in a tree like fashion in which one or more participants queries one or more further participants which may themselves continue querying further participants and so on such action may be taken if no matching firm order was found or an incomplete set of matching firm orders was previously found as described above in still other embodiments querying may include transmitting requests to other processes threads memory locations portion of a computer program etc executing by a single system such as central system  or multiple systems such as a distributed systemsystems associated with market participants eg buy side system  participant systems   may be configured to accept requests and determine if matching oms orders exist in some situations which are discussed in more detail below some such systems may respond to a query indicating that a match exists in some implementations such a response may include an indication that the trade has already been executed andor cleared eg by a remote system to which a request was transmitted some other system etcin some embodiments the act of querying andor some or all response that may be received may be concealed andor otherwise suppressed from an originator of the firm order andor any other individual for example if a negative response is received such a response may not be revealed to the originator of the firm order in some embodiments as discussed below only a positive response may be revealed in some embodiments negative response may be eliminated or otherwise suppressed by limiting responses actions may be kept secret from originators of the order and the participants may be granted an additional level of anonymity thereby encouraging them to participate in the trading system because the opportunity andor chances to game the market may be reducedas indicated at block  process  may include receiving additional firm orders from various other firm order sources such as buy side andor sell side participants such receipt of new firm orders may occur substantially simultaneously as the querying of participants such new firm orders may be compared with the received firm order from block  to determine if they are matching similar to the description above with respect to block as indicated at block  process  may include determining if a matching order is found finding a matching order may include receiving a new firm order from another source andor receiving a response from a participant that a matching order existsif no matching order is determined to exist process  may loop back to block  in various embodiments the participants may be queried periodically the period may be any length such as  seconds  minutes a random length a length based on some characteristic of a trader andor order etc in various embodiments participants may be queried until either a match is found a matching firm order is received a time period associated with the firm order expires the firm order is revoked andor any other desired length of timeif one or more matching orders is determined to exist process  may include facilitating execution of a trade fulfilling the firm order and the one or more matching orders as indicated at block  in some embodiments facilitating may include executing a trade clearing a trade transmitting indications that execution or clearing of a trade should be performed by a remote system andor any other desired actions in some embodiments execution of the trade may occur at a remote server such as one or more servers at which a firm order match is found eg a buy side system etc andor a central system such as central system in some embodiments a matching order may not fulfill a whole firm order in such situations process  may continue to search for matching orders eg by querying remote servers and awaiting new firm orders in a loop to block in some embodiments multiple matching orders may be found within a relatively short period of time for example multiple firm orders may be received andor multiple oms orders may be found at participants within a relatively short period of time such a time period may be any amount of time desired such as  second  minute etcin various embodiments order execution with such matching orders found within such a short period of time may be based on some desired set of priorities in such embodiments matching orders found with in the short period of time may be treated as if they were found simultaneously and executed based on some other priority mechanism for example firm orders may be executed first or orders found through querying participants may be executed first first entered orders may be executed first larger orders may be executed first smaller orders may be executed first older orders may be executed first newer orders may be executed first best customers may have their orders executed first highest ranked customers may have their orders executed first customers willing to be charged a fee may have their orders executed first andor any other method may be used to determine execution order in other embodiments order execution may be based strictly on the order in which the matching order is foundprocess  may end at block  after facilitation of the execution of the orders is complete in some embodiments one or more participants such as originators of the orders may be notified of execution in some embodiments the order of acts may not be the same is indicated in process  in some embodiments process  may include additional actions fewer actions andor different actions process  or a similar process may be performed by any computer system or systems in a centralized andor distributed mannerexample participant processesfig  illustrates an example process  that begins at block  and that may be performed by a participant eg by buy side system  in other embodiments some or all of process  may be performed at a centralized location such as by central system  or a distributed location such as by sell side systems or buy side systems process  may in part be performed to facilitate responses to queries andor to provide indications of firm orders as those described above with respect to process  in some embodiments process  may be performed by an oms system a separate participant system a buy side or sell side traders computer or any other computer system such as one configured to receive and process ordersas indicated at block  process  may include receiving an indication of an order such an indication may be received for example from a trader entering information about desired trades through a trading interface the indication may include an identification of a price an amount of a security to buy or sell a time for an order to remain open a price at or around which to buy the security a limit price a pricing method an order identifier andor any other informationas indicated at block  process  may include determining if the order is a firm order a firm order as described above may indicate that an order should be executed substantially automatically a oms order may indicate that the information about the order is to remain secret from other market participants andor should not be automatically executed against some embodiments may not include a separate act of determining a type of order for example in some embodiments different processes threads andor systems may receive the different types of orders so that the act of receiving the order itself identifies the type of order for example a trader may use one interface to submit an oms order eg to an oms system to a participant system etc and use a different interface to submit a firm order eg to a central system etc in some embodiments a single program may be used to submit the different order types and the program may make the determination eg based on different buttons pressed based on different checkboxes selected etcas indicated at block  if the order is a firm order process  may include providing the indication of the order for firm order execution such providing may include transmitting information about the order to the central system  or a distributed system such an order may be received by such system which may attempt to execute the order substantially automatically eg using a process similar to process  in some embodiments such providing may include providing the information to a processing thread or program executed by one or more computing devices process  may end at block  if the order is a firm order in other embodiments process  may continue to provide updated information about the execution of the firm order such as through an interface of a trading computeras indicated at block  if the order is not a firm order process  may include an act of storing information about the order storing the information may include storing the information on a machine readable medium such as in ram on a hard disk etc the medium may be part ofassociated with one or more of an oms system andor a participant system the information may be stored in one or more database tables configured to store information about orders such a database table may be arranged for easy searching of orders to determining if an incoming order request matches any of the ordered stored in the database for example in some embodiments the database may be keyed by a name of a securitysome embodiments may include maintaining stored information such information may be maintained similar to the maintenance of order information in a typical oms system in some embodiments maintenance may include the actions of an oms andor a participant system maintenance may include updating orders executed in connection with matching firm order queries for example order information may be removedupdated when an order is fully or partially fulfilled an order expires an order is explicitly removed or updated by a trader andor for any other desired reasonas indicated at block  process  may include receive incoming firm order queries an incoming firm order query may indicate an identification of a price an amount of a security to buy or sell a time for an order to remain open a price at or around which to buy the security a limit price a pricing method an order identifier andor any other information in some embodiments such firm order queries may be received from one or more computer systems performing a process similar to that shown in process  in some embodiments the firm order queries may include orders that would fulfill part or all of the oms order such queries may be received at a participant system an oms system configured to perform some or all of the action of process  andor any other desired locationas indicated at block  process  may include determining that a firm order query matches the order for example a result from a database query that includes terms identified by the firm order query eg security identifier price quantity etc may return a positive resultas indicated at block  process  may include attempting to facilitate execution of a trade with the matching firm order query facilitating execution of a trade may include for example displaying an indication of the firm order to a trader through one or more trading interfaces as discussed in more detail below raising an alarm or other audible alert for such a trader andor any other desired action in some such embodiments the trader may be asked to accept the matching order or reject the matching order if the trader in some embodiments acceptance of the order the system may execute a trade forward information for the trade to be executed andor cleared by another system andor perform any other desired action to further facilitate execution of the tradein some embodiments by keeping the oms orders secret from other trading participants a trading system performing process  may encourage traders to allow pools of liquidity that would typically remain inaccessible such as orders in oms systems to be used to match against firm orders this encouragement may be particularly important to buy side participants who may typically be protective of their order information such use of oms orders may increase liquidity in a market using such a processprocess  may end at block  after facilitating execution of the trade in some embodiments one or more participants such as originators of the orders may be notified of execution in some embodiments stored information regarding the orders may be updated to reflect the order execution in some embodiments in which only part of the oms order is fulfilled by the matching firm order process  may include receiving additional firm order queries and facilitating execution of those ordersin some embodiments the order of acts in process  may not be the same is indicated in fig  in some embodiments process  may include additional actions fewer actions andor different actions process  or a similar process may be performed by any computer system or systems in a centralized andor distributed manner for example process  may be performed by the participant systems   by an oms system configured to perform one or more parts of process  andor by any other system in some embodiments process  may be performed only in connection with a buy side participantexample querying processesfig  illustrates an example process  that begins at block  and may be used in some embodiments to perform in part querying of participants as indicated by block  of process  above process  may be performed by a central computer system to query participants for matching orders may be performed in a distributed fashion by a plurality of computer systems andor may be performed by any other computer systems in some embodiments such a process may be performed in part or in whole in a tree like distributed fashion in which some participants may query one or more child participants to search for matching ordersas indicated at block  process  may include identifying one or more participants participants may include one or more remote servers one or more computer processes threads or programs for example in some embodiments participants may include buy side systems in other embodiments participants may include sell side systems andor other systems identifying participants may include querying potential participants in a list of participants eg pinging ip addresses making function calls etc in some embodiments identifying participants may include placing one or more items in a predefined memory location querying a predefined memory location for information about participants accessing a database or other listing of participants receiving an indication that a participant exists eg from the participant from an administrator etc andor any other actions desired in some embodiments the identified participants may include child participants of a treelike participant structureas indicated at block  process  may include receiving an indication of a firm order such a firm order may be substantially similar to the firm order received at block  in process as indicated at block  process  may include transmitting requests to the identified servers such requests may be substantially similar to those discussed above with respect to block  in process  in some embodiments as discussed above with respect to process  the received firm orders may be matched against other locally stored firm orders instead of or in addition to querying of participants as discussed with respect to process in some embodiments participants may be arranged in a distributed fashion for example in one embodiment participants may be arranged in a treelike fashion in such an embodiment a first participant may query one or more other participants the other participants may determine if matches exist locally if matches exist the participants may return a positive indication eg to the originating participant the originator of the firm order a marketplace etc if no match is found locally the further participants may query additional participants the order of querying may be established based on any desired priority mechanism eg largest customers are queried first premium customers queried first highest ranked customers queried first etc in some embodiments a participant may query additional participants regardless of whether a match is found locallyas indicated at block  process  may include determining if a response was received from a queried participant in some embodiments determining if a response was received may include querying a port or socket through which communication may be received from a communication network in other embodiments determining if a response is received may include querying a register memory location process thread program function andor any other actionin some embodiments if no responses is received process  may loop back to block  to send one or more additional requests any number of requests may be sent any number of times any period of time may pass between transmission of requests random periodic etc process  may continue to loop until a response is received a matching firm order is found otherwise a time period expires andor any other event occursin some embodiments the participants queried at each loop may be the same or different for example in some embodiments an initial group of participants may be queried first eg a premium group of participants a group of good customers a group of high volume customers etc and then after some period of time a second group of participants may be queried any number of such subgroups may be queried in such orderas indicated at block  process  may include facilitating execution of a trade fulfilling a matching order in the response facilitating may include executing a trade clearing a trade forwarding information requests andor any other desired action in other embodiments a response may indicate that a trade has been or will be executed andor cleared eg by a remote systemin some embodiments a response may only be received if a match exists andor a trader desires to execute a trade limiting response to positive responses may encourage participation because less information is revealed from the participants this may incentivize participants to make orders available to a market to a great extent than in traditional markets thereby increasing the liquidity of the marketother embodiments may include receiving negative response when no matching order exists andor a trader does not desire to execute a tradein some embodiments a response may be received for a trade that does not completely fulfill the firm order in some implementations after execution of such an order process  may loop back to block  to query participants again future queries of participants may include an updated order with a requested amount decreased by the previous order in other embodiments such facilitation of order execution may be limited to complete orders eg based on preferences indicated by an originator of the order based on preferences of a trading system etcin some embodiments multiple responses may be received at the same time or within a relatively short time period orders received as such may be treated as if they were received at the same time a priority mechanism may be used to determine which of such orders is to be executed first for example an order associated with a high volume customer a premium customer a long term customer or a customer with any other desired characteristic may be given higher or lower priority compared with other orders in some embodiments largest or smallest orders may be given priority in other embodiments any desired priority mechanism may be usedin some embodiments process  may end at block  in some embodiments process  may include notifying one or more traders of the execution in some embodiments process  may include additional actions fewer actions andor different actions process  or a similar process may be performed by any computer system or systems in a centralized andor distributed mannerexample passive order processesprocess  of fig  which begins at block  illustrates an example process that may be performed by one or more participants process  may include actions similar to process  described above in some embodiments process  may be performed only by one or more buy side participantsas indicated at block  process  may include receiving one or more indication of one or more orders such orders may include oms orders as discussed above with respect to process  the orders may be stored accordingly as discussed with respect to block  so that queries may be matched against themas indicated at block  process  may include receiving an indication of one or more firm order queries such firm order queries may be transmitted for example by an entity performing a process similar to process  andor process  as discussed aboveas indicated at block  process  may include filtering firm order queries firm order queries may be filtered based on characteristics of the order eg price security amount eg minimum amount maximum amount etc characteristics of the originator of the order eg a rating of the originator a type of the originator specific originators etc andor orders queries may be filtered according to any other desired characteristics in some embodiments different filters may be applied to different types of securities for example large capitalization securities may have one set of filters applied and small capitalization securities may have a different set of filters applied in some embodiments specific securities eg identified by stock symbol may be filtered out or have a specific set of filters appliedin some embodiments filtering may allow a participant to filter queries received from or sent to other participants filtering may be performed based on any desired characteristics such characteristics may include characteristics that make the order less likely to be an order associated with gaming of the market for example in one implementations a filter may block firm orders that do not meet a minimum size requirement a minimum total dollar amount requirement andor any other desired characteristicsin some embodiments as another example a participant may only desire to consider orders associated with originators with certain characteristics such characteristics may include characteristics that make an order less likely to be an order associated with gaming of the market for example in one implementations a filter may block orders that are from a particular class of traders eg hedge funds etc that are associated with a particular trader that has been identified by the participant as being involved with gaming the market that are not from a particular trusted set of participants a from a set of participants that were rated poorly by other participants are from a participant without a history of trading etcsome embodiments may include receiving an indication of desired filters the indication may be received from one or more traders participant systems or any other desired source the indication may identify any desired characteristics combination of characteristics exceptions to filters andor any other information related to the filtersthe filters may be applied in a centralized fashions andor a distributed fashion for example in some implementations filters may be applied before requests are transmitted eg by a central system by a distributed system etc applying the filters before transmitting requests may decrease the amount of traffic associated with performing process  conversely performing such filtering before transmitting may increase the amount of processing performed before transmitting and may involve a participant revealing filtering preference they may not desire to reveal to anyone even a trading system administrator in other embodiments filtering may occur locally to a participant by performing such filtering locally more traffic may be generated by a trading system more processing may take place at participants and filtering options may remain privatein some embodiments participants may be filtered from receiving requests based on the desires of a firm order submitter eg by a central system or other participant submitting queries etc such participants may be filtered by identity order availability andor any other desired characteristic such filtering may occur for example by the participants themselves eg by a participant system configured to perform such filtering in addition to before or otherwise in connection with other participant functions by a central system by a submitting system andor by any other desired system in some embodiments for example a participant may not be provided with a query if they do not have a matching firm order to fulfill a minimum percentage of a firm order in other embodiments such information may not be known until after a query is sent and in such embodiments a match may only be determined to exist if the match meets the minimum percentage filtering before transmitting queries may decrease an amount of traffic eg tcpip packets transmitted which may be snooped to reveal trading information however a malicious user may snoop such queries in an attempt to determine a filter settingin some embodiments participant systems may transmit filtering information to a central system such information may be used to perform the filtering at the central system such information may also be used to provide information to users entering firm orders as described belowa trading system that allows such filtering may enable a participant to open traditionally untapped pools of liquidity only to a certain subset of traders by allowing such limitations the participant opening that pool of liquidity eg a set of orders in an oms may be more confident that the traders gaining access to those pools are not going to use the pools of liquidity for malicious purposes eg gaming the marketas indicated at block  process  may include determining if a matching order for the firm order query exists such determination may include searching one or more database or other listings of oms orders the determination may be made at a same or different location as the filtering determining may include searching a listing of orders in an oms of a buy side participant such a listing may include all listed orders a subset of listed orders identified as searchable by a trader andor any other ordersas indicated at block  and  process  may end if it is determined that no matching order exists some embodiments may end without providing any indication that no order exists by not providing specifically identifying that no order exists others eg other traders participants people snooping packets etc may be unable to determine if no order exists or no such response was sent for some other reason eg because a trader indicated that no trader should occur as discussed below because a trade was filtered out as discussed above etc in some embodiments no indication that the query was received may be presented to a trader or trading system associated with the participant that received the query by keeping such information secret receivers of queries may be prevented from using the information that the firm order exists to game the marketas indicated at blocks  and  if a firm order is determined to exist process  may include providing an indication that a firm order has been received providing such an indication may include transmitting information over one or more networks from one computer system to another computer system providing such an indication may include presenting a user eg a buy side trader associated with the oms order matched with one or more interfaces or icon identifying the firm order such an interface may include options to accept a firm order reject a firm order ignore a firm order ignore all firm orders eg for a desire period of time andor any other desired options such an indication may be considered a nonbinding indication from the point of view of the participant associated with the oms in so much as a recipient eg a participant associated with the matching oms order is not bound to fulfill any order based on the indication however an originator of the firm order may still be bound to fulfill the order if the recipient of the indication chooses to accept the orderin some embodiments ignoring a firm order may result in a participant opting out of receivingmatching using firm order queries for a minimum amount of time such an opt out time may encourage participants to accept firm order queries the time may vary based on characteristics of the order andor participantsin some embodiments a user may select various options regarding ignoring future indications for example a user may select that indications should be ignored unless a price associated with the firm order is at a certain level a firm order has some desired characteristic ignore until a certain time ignore for a certain amount of time ignore until the end of the day etcin some embodiments evidence that a user has selected to ignore an indication may be suppressed for example the information may maintained in confidence at a participant system may be kept in confidence at a central system or may otherwise be kept secret in implementations where different options for ignoring an indication may selected evidence regarding some or all of the information regarding the options may also be suppressedas indicated at block  process  may include awaiting a response from such an indication some implementations may include receiving a response and determining if the response is a positive or negative response in other implementations a response may not be received or may only be received if the response is a positive response in some embodiments the amount of time to be awaited may be indicated to a trader in some embodiments the amount of time may vary based on one or more desired characteristics of a security a participant an originator andor other desired entityas indicated at block  process  may include determining if a positive response is received determining if a response is a positive response may include determining which if any mouse buttons were pressed which if any keyboard buttons were pressed which interface control if any was selected andor any other determination of a possible entry of intent if anyas indicated in block  process  may end if a positive response is not received in some embodiments after a period of awaiting a presumptive default response may be entered in some implementations such a default response may include a negative response in some embodiments an operator of an interface eg a trader an administrator etc may determine the appropriate amount of time andor the appropriate default commandas indicated at block  if a positive response is received process  may include facilitating a trade fulfilling at least part of the matching order and at least part of the firm order facilitating the trade may include executing the trade clear the trade transmitting information so that the trade is executed and cleared remotely andor any other desired actions in some implementations facilitating may include providing a positive response eg to a central server to a buy side andor sell side participant etc the recipient of the positive response may further facilitate the execution of the trade if a trade fulfilling the firm order has not already been executed transmission of a positive response may be considered a binding indication of a trade in so much as the participant associated with the oms order may be bound to fulfill the matching firm order by the indication in some embodiments the binding may be conditioned on the firm order not having been fulfilled previously not on actions of the participantin some implementations process  may include receiving an update regarding the facilitation of the execution such an update may include receiving an indication that the execution was completed or that the execution was not completed in some implementations a trade may be partially completed and an update may indicate that the trade was partially completed for example a trade may be partially completed if when the positive response is received only part of the firm order is still awaiting execution and the oms order includes a larger volume for trade in such a situation a trade may be cancelled in some embodiments in other embodiments a the oms order may be executed to the extent that the firm order remains and in indication to that extent may be transmitted to the participants in still other embodiments an originator of the oms order may be contacted with the updated firm order information andor any other action may be takenprocess  may end at block  process  may include notifying one or more participants of a result of the facilitation of the

indication of each such matching order may be provided in some embodiments the indications may be ordered according to a preference mechanism such preference mechanism may include ordering based on preferences of an order originator an indication receiver a computer system administrator andor any other preferences of any individual regarding any characteristics of an order computer system trade etc in some implementations rather than providing separate indications indications may be pooled into a single indication such pooling may include combining multiple firm orders according to some preference mechanism so that the firm orders fulfill the matching order if additional firm orders exist some implementations may separately provide information about such firm orders in some implementations even if indications are pooled an interface may be provided that allows a user to access information and enter information eg acceptance of orders about individual ordersin some embodiments process  may include additional actions fewer actions andor different actions process  or a similar process may be performed by any computer system or systems in a centralized andor distributed manner process  may be performed by one or more computer systems in a centralized andor distributed fashion in some embodiments only buy side participants may receive firm order queries for matching against oms ordersprocesses  and  are arranged to provide convenient illustration of concepts disclosed herein it should be recognized that no such processes need be performed at allencryptionin various embodiments some or all communication may be encrypted in various embodiments some or all information stored in various media may be encrypted in some embodiments comparisons among information may be made in an encrypted form in other embodiments encrypted data may be unencrypted before a comparison occursin some embodiments an encryption algorithm such as the wellknown pgp rsa encryption method may be used for communication among participants computer systems etc advances in quantum computing may make such encryption less secure in the future some embodiments therefore may include use of quantum key encryption algorithms designed to overcome such vulnerability and or other future proof encryption algorithmsuser typesin some embodiments different users of a system eg central system buy side system sell side system trader computer etc may have access to different options because a market may be asymmetrical providing asymmetrical options to such user types may best capture a dynamic of the market for example in a security trading market participants may be divided into four example categories which may include hedge funds investors brokers and verified naturals it should be recognized that other embodiments may include different additional alternative fewer andor no categories of usersreferring to the example four category embodiment investors may include traders that trade on behalf of their own accounts eg individuals hedge funds may include organizations exempt from standard securities regulation that typically seek high returns for accredited investors brokers may include originations that may trade on behalf of others as regulated by standard securities laws verified naturals may include brokers that are not acting one behalf of their own proprietary accounts to become a verified natural a broker may be required to provide proof that they are not trading on behalf of their own proprietary accounts in some implementations a single user may act as more than one type of user at various times for example a broker may act as a broker in some situations and a verified natural in other situations options and treatment given to such different categories may reflect a likelihood that the participants may be gaming the marketin some embodiments information provided to users may depend upon a category or type of user for example users may be limited to receiving certain firm order queries accepting certain firm order matches etc based on their category in one implementation for example only buy side participants only may receive firm order queries in such situations information about possible trade executions with oms orders may not be provided to sell side participants until and unless a trade is accepted by a buy side participant andor executedin some embodiments as discussed above rebates and charges may be given in some embodiments such rebates andor charges may depend on a category of participant for example in some implementations investors may be given a rebate for submitting firm orders in other implementations anyone submitting a firm order may be given a rebate in some implementations brokers may be charged a fee for each time a oms order matches a firm order query in some implementations brokers can opt out of having their firm orders matched against other brokers firm orders because of pricing rebate that allows brokers to be paid for submitting firm ordersin some embodiments size or other characteristics of a participant may affect a participants options some implementations for example may be limited to large participants others to small participants others may allow all sized participantspossible negotiationalthough some embodiments described above execute trades without a negotiation between participants in the trade eg with only a buy or rejectignore option presented to participants with matching oms orders some embodiments may include a negotiation such negotiation may be limited in some embodiments to preserve anonymity encourage entering of oms orders andor limit the possibility of gaming the marketin some embodiments for example where there are multiple matching orders a negotiation to determine the counter party that is willing to adjust their offer the most may be performedin some embodiments if user accepts a matching firm order found from a query the user andor the originator of the firm order may be presented with an option to trade more of the security by selecting a control in an interface that activates such an option a negotiation may begin between the two participants such a negotiation may include asking if the other party agrees to trade more the terms of such a trade etc such negotiation may limit the probability of gaming the market since the participants may already be aware of each other from the prior traderebatesome embodiments may include providing rebates or charging fees to trade participants such fees andor rebates may be arranged to incentivize participation in certain aspects of a trading system for example in some embodiments when an order is executed based on a firm order matched with a oms order the participant that submitted the firm order may receive a rebate and the participant associated with the oms order may be charged a feetypes of tradessome embodiments may support various types of trades such trades may include buying securities selling securities short selling securities andor any other desired types of trades in some embodiments in which a short sell of a security is performed a location of a purchasedborrowed security may be required before a short sell order may be completedtracking userssome embodiments may include tracking information about one or more participants for example a trade history a number of trades a type of trades characteristics of trades etc may be tracked for buy andor sell side participants in some information a participant may view some or all of such information about itself andor about other participants in some embodiments such information may be used to generate a rating of a participant such a rating may be used for example as a filter of participants querying a participant serverit should be recognized that while embodiments described herein generally included a computerhuman interactions eg

disclosure of relevant material and should not be interpreted to limit any prior disclosuresalthough computers are heavily used to facilitate trading of securities manual intervention is still required at certain steps in the trading process for example most traders at institutional investment management firms record their orders to purchase or sell securities in computerized order management systems omss however one or more traders at each firm must manually review the orders in the oms and attempt to fill the orders by contacting one or more market intermediaries typically the traders transmit the orders in the oms by telephone or separate data entry links to registered brokerdealers for the securities to electronic marketplaces that trade the securities or to other market intermediaries accordingly manual effort is required to actually execute the orders in the omsone problem arising from this manual effort is that institutional traders cannot execute trades involving large quantities of securities without adversely affecting the market price of the securities for example institutional traders often need to trade large quantities of securities due to the continuing need of investment managers to respond to changes in market conditions by altering the contents of their investment portfolios as these portfolios increase in size due to increased investor activity the corresponding quantity of securities to be traded in order to achieve a similar portfolio balance also increases market impact costs or adverse costs resulting from the institutional traders activities rise in such circumstances because locating parties with whom to trade such large quantities of securities becomes more difficult for the market intermediariesmoreover if the market intermediaries become aware that an institutional firm wants to say sell a large block of a particular equity security this awareness is likely to lower the sale price that the institutional firm can obtain due to the normal processes of supply and demand the effect is also likely to be exacerbated by speculation from others with knowledge of the order as to why the particular investor wishes to sell such a large quantity of the security similarly if market intermediaries become aware of the fact than an institutional firm wants to buy a large block of a particular equity security this awareness will likely increase the purchase price that the institutional firm will have to pay this adverse effect on price is further exacerbated by the fact that traditional market intermediaries trade for their own accountsone strategy commonly employed by institutional traders to offset market impact costs is to spread out trade orders for a large quantity of a security into small orders each handled by a different market intermediary sometimes over several trading days of course this strategy brings about its own problems in that the market price can change significantly during this extended trading period due to the unforeseeable activities of othersanother strategy that may be employed is to spread the orders for the security among one or more electronic marketplaces however the traders must manually transmit each order to the electronic marketplaces using a telephone or a separate data entry link the fact that the traders need to perform these extra steps which include duplicate entry of basic order data already recorded in the oms causes many traders to use these electronic marketplaces infrequently and to supply the marketplaces with only a small subset of the total orders as a result these electronic marketplaces often lack the liquidity required by a trader to timely execute ordersthe lack of integration between the oms and the electronic marketplaces also poses problems when an institutional trader wishes to trade a particular security simultaneously within an electronic marketplace and for example over the telephone with a traditional broker for example some electronic marketplaces attempt to find matches at only specific time intervals if a trader wishes to buy  shares of ibm and has placed an order for half that amount in an electronic marketplace the trader will not know how much if any ibm stock was purchased until after the next scheduled match attempt in the meantime the trader potentially could have purchased more than  shares from a broker over the phone at a better pricetherefore there is a need in the art for an electronic trading marketplace that does not require any manual intervention by traders or other parties offers anonymity and offers a high amount of liquiditythe present invention addresses the above need by providing for the automated transmission of orders ie without manual trader intervention from the various order management systems omss used by investment management firms or other entities having trading systems to an electronic trading marketplace etm a firm with a trading system stores information about orders in an oms to manage its order flow to monitor the initiation placement and execution of orders and for related purposes software providing the functionality of an oms is well known in the artoms interfacing modules oims at the firms automatically transmit orders from the omss to the etm and preferably update the omss in response to orders executed at the etm traders can communicate with the etm to anonymously negotiate trades of securities as used herein a “security” is an ownership or creditorship interest such as a stock certificate bond or any other financial instrument contract or transaction such as a forward futures option put call collar swap or currency contract on any security this description uses the term “security” for convenience but it should be understood that the term covers financial instruments generallythe etm includes an oms data integration module odim for receiving and processing data representative of orders received from the oims in a preferred embodiment the data from the oims are provided to the etm in a standardized format that requires little processing by the odim the orders processed by the odim are stored in an etm databasea negotiation module in the etm supports negotiations between traders in one embodiment an indications module transmits orders received by the etm among the traders based upon filtering criteria established by the traders andor the etm these orders are transmitted among the traders in the form of nonbinding indications based upon these indications traders at one institution can enter into negotiations with traders at other institutions through the negotiation module of the etm in one embodiment at least parts of the negotiations are conducted anonymouslya trader authentication module authorizes and authenticates traders who log into the etm in order to perform trading negotiations andor other functions a transaction history module records transactions performed by the etm in the etm database the transaction history module also preferably records other data processed by the etm including for example the orders received from and sent to the trading systems and the conducted negotiationsa typical trading system at an investment management firm or other entity at which trading is performed includes a number of workstations coupled to an oms server via a network with a trader at each workstation each workstation preferably executes a trader oms interaction module toim for facilitating interactions between the traders workstation and the oms server in one embodiment of the present invention the toim allows a trader to add delete or modify open or contemplated orders stored in the oms database the oms which includes the oms server oms database and toim is typically provided by an oms vendor though some firms have developed their own omssin connection with the present invention each workstation also preferably executes an etm interaction module eim for facilitating interactions with the etm the eim allows a trader to send information to the etm and view and respond to information received from the etm typically this information includes information about the traders indications information about other traders indications and orders transmitted to and received by a trader during a negotiationthe oms database holds data representative of open contemplated or completed orders to buy andor sell securities by traders using the trading system the oim is in communication with the oms database and the etm an oms database integration module in the oim reads data records stored in the oms database and in a preferred embodiment also creates and modifies data records stored in the oms database upon execution of a trade through the etm in one embodiment the oms database interaction module directly accesses the oms database and in another embodiment it sends commands to an application programming interface api in the oms for accessing the databasethe oim also includes an etm communication module for communicating with the etm in one embodiment the etm communication module provides selected data records in the oms database to the etm and in a preferred embodiment receives data andor instructions from the etm regarding changes to make to the oms database in addition the oim preferably includes a data record conversion module for modifying the format of data records sent to the etm andor received from the etm the oim also preferably includes a filtering module for filtering out specified orders by security type security name order type order price order quantity or other category so that those orders are not transmitted to the etmpreferably the oim transmits to the etm data records in the oms database relating to a traders orders when the trader logs on to the etm once the oim determines that the trader has logged on to the etm the oim retrieves data records about that traders orders suitable for transmission to the etm from the oms database in one embodiment the oim converts the data records retrieved from the oms database into a standardized format understood by the etm in another embodiment this functionality is part of the etmafter a trader has logged on to the etm the oim determines whether the contents of the oms database have changed if the oms database has changed the oim determines whether the change should be transmitted to the etm in one embodiment the oim continues to determine whether the contents of the oms database have changed between the time that a trader logs on to the etm and the time that the etm commences trading in another embodiment the oim does not commence making this determination until the time that the etm commences tradingbecause typical omss are complex and multifeatured and because securities of types not handled by the etm may be traded using the oms some changes to the oms database do not necessitate a transmission of updated data to the etm the oim preferably transmits changes to the database to the etm if the changes represent new or modified ordersthe oim preferably updates the database in response to information received from the etm indicating executed trades or other information in a preferred embodiment if an execution occurred in the etm involving an order in the oms associated with the oim the oim receives information from the etm describing the execution this information includes for example the type amount and price of securities traded the time of execution andor information identifying the original order in the oms database on which the execution was based the oim converts the received information about the execution into the format used by the oms and updates the oms database accordingly as a result of these steps the oms is updated automatically and transparently to reflect executions performed at the etm the executions appear to the oms as typical trades conducted at another broker so no special functionality needs to be added to the oms in order to interact with the etm beyond that functionality described hereinfig  is a highlevel block diagram illustrating an electronic trading marketplace

illustrated embodiments of the present invention can have many more or fewer trading systems  in communication with the etm  fig  illustrates only three trading systems  in order to enhance the clarity of this descriptionthe trading systems are used by investment management firms or other entities that have established a relationship with the etm  the trading systems  communicate with the etm  to facilitate the trading of securities as used herein a “security” is any ownership or creditorship interest such as a stock certificate or bond or any other financial instrument contract or transaction such as a forward futures option put call collar swap or currency contract this definition includes for example any note stock bond debenture certificate of interest or participation in any profitsharing agreement or in any oil gas or other mineral royalty or lease any collateral trust certificate investment contract votingtrust certificate certificate of deposit any put call straddle option or privilege on any of the foregoing or group or index of securities including any interest therein or based on the value thereof this list is not allinclusive for purposes of clarity this description will describe the trading of stockwithin each trading system  is a database a b c associated with an order management system oms each oms database  holds data representative of open contemplated or completed orders to buy andor sell securities collectively referred to herein as “orders for securities” by traders using the trading system  for example assume that the database a of trading system a contains orders to sell  shares of dell and  shares of msft and orders to buy  shares of cpq and  shares of ibm also assume that the database b of trading system b contains orders to sell  shares of cpq and buy  shares of tthe orders in the oms databases  are automatically transmitted to the etm  likewise any changes in the orders such as modifications andor withdrawals are automatically transmitted to the etm  as used herein the term “automatically” means that the associated action is performed without any human or manual intervention thus there is no need for traders to specifically request that individual orders in the oms databases  are transmitted to the etm  orders in the databases are sent to the etm  without the traders input subject to filtering criteriapreferably the etm  anonymously transmits information about a traders orders to other traders using the etm subject to filtering in accordance with filtering criteria established by the traders andor the etm moreover the etm  preferably manages anonymous negotiations between traders using the trading systems  for the purpose of executing the orders and sends data about the completed trades to the omss of the traders involved in the transactionthus one embodiment of the present invention selectively broadcasts information about the orders received by the etm  from the database a of trading system a to the other trading systems b c likewise the etm  selectively broadcasts information about the orders received from the database b of trading system b to the other trading systems a c if the traders desire such a trade the etm  will facilitate the anonymous negotiation and sale of  shares of cpq from a trader using trading system b to a trader using trading system adata is communicated between the trading systems  and the etm  using interfacing links a b c any known interfacing technologies can be used to effectuate these links including but not limited to transmission control protocolinternet protocol tcpip satellite cellular andor radio frequency rf links or some combination thereof the links may pass through one or more intermediate data processing systems such as telephone switches or internet servers before reaching the etm  or a trading system  in embodiments where data travels over shared links such as embodiments where data travels over the public internet the data is preferably encrypted using a secure protocol such as the secure sockets layer sslfig  is a highlevel block diagram illustrating more details of the etm  those of skill in the art will recognize that fig  illustrates only one possible embodiment of the etm  obviously different combinations of hardware and software can be used to provide the functionality of the etm  described hereindata received by the etm  from the trading systems  over the interfacing links  are received by a firewall  as is known in the art the firewall  preferably prevents unauthorized users from gaining access to the rest of the etm  and monitors transfers of data to and from the networkdata that pass through the firewall  are received by one or more modules that perform the functionality of the etm  as used herein the term “module” refers to machineexecutable code andor data but may also include associated circuitry such as processing circuitry as well as data storage areas andor any other software or hardware thus it will be appreciated that one or a combination of hardware and software such as a computer system executing software for performing the functionality of the modules may implement each of the modules shown in fig  it will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the etm  may comprise one or more other types of modules circuitry etc not shown in fig  in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring understanding of the invention for instance the etm  may include one or more microprocessors network connection circuitry andor data storage areas such as readonly memory rom randomaccess memory ram cdrom dvd tape drive hard disk hd andor other types of storage areas it will also be appreciated that the functionality of multiple modules described herein can be combined into a single module and the functionality of a single module can be split or shared among multiple modules moreover alternative embodiments of the present invention can lack one or more of the modules described herein andor have modules not described hereinthe etm  preferably includes an oms data integration module odim  the odim  receives and processes data representative of orders received from the oms databases  in the trading systems  in a preferred embodiment the data from the oms databases  are provided to the etm  in a standardized format that requires little processing by the odim  in an alternative embodiment the data from the oms databases  are provided to the etm  in one or more different formats depending upon factors such as the type of oms used by the trading systems  the types of interfacing links supplying the data to the etm the type of security or orders to which the data pertains and the like in this latter embodiment the odim  preferably converts the data into a standardized format for use by other modules in the etm the orders processed by the odim  are stored in an etm database  data in the database  are preferably accessible to the other modules in the etm  in addition the other modules in the etm  can store other data in the illustrated database  or other databases as may be required during normal operationin a preferred embodiment an indications module  transmits information about orders received by the etm  among the various traders based upon filtering criteria established by the traders andor the etm this information is transmitted among the traders in the form of nonbinding indicationsbased upon these indications traders can enter into negotiations with other traders through a negotiation module  the negotiation module  facilitates negotiations between traders using trading systems and having contra interests in one embodiment at least parts of the negotiations are conducted anonymously in order to limit the spread of information about the traders activitiesa market data module  receives realtime and other market data from an input  the market data module  provides the market data to the negotiation module  and to the traders the traders preferably use the market data during the negotiations to determining market prices for the securitiesa transaction history module  records transactions performed by the etm  in the database  the transaction history module  also preferably records other data processed by the etm  including for example information about orders received from and sent to the trading systems  and the negotiations conducted successful or not this module  is preferably used to audit the transactions conducted on the etm a trader authentication module  authorizes and authenticates traders who log into the etm  in order to perform trading negotiations andor other functions in one embodiment the trader authentication module  stores authentication information such as a login idpassword pair in the database  the trader authentication module  also preferably stores profiles for the registered tradersother modules that may be present in the etm  include load monitoring modules for monitoring the load on various servers comprising the etm fault tolerance modules for providing fault tolerance to the etm security modules for preventing and detecting security violations on the etm and back office modules for providing back office functionality these modules are not shown in fig  in order to avoid unnecessarily complicating the figurefig  is a lowerlevel block diagram illustrating a trading system  like those illustrated in fig  those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that fig  illustrates only one possible embodiment of a trading system  and alternative embodiments of the trading system exist fig  illustrates three workstations a b c coupled to an oms server  via a network  the workstations  are preferably general or specificpurpose computer systems executing specialized software for facilitating trading of securities although only three workstations  are illustrated a trading system  can have any practical number of workstationsin a typical trading system that interacts with the etm  each workstation  executes a trader oms interaction module  toim for facilitating interactions with the oms server  in this typical trading system the toim  allows a trader to add delete or modify open or contemplated orders stored in the oms database  contemplated orders may be stored in the oms database  for example because the trader intends to execute certain transactions in stages or because the contemplated transactions are desirable only if the market prices of the securities to be traded are within a certain range eg limit orders therefore such orders serve as placeholders indicating the total quantity of a security that a trader wishes to transact and conditions for transacting other orders other data in the database  indicate the quantity of the security that has been transacted to dateeach workstation  executes an etm interaction module  eim for facilitating interactions with the etm  in alternative embodiments of the present invention the eim  is incorporated into the toim  or other modules on the workstation  the eim  allows a trader to send information to the etm  and view and respond to information received from the etm  typically the received information includes information about orders through the indications module  and orders through the negotiation module  that the etm  receives from other traders or trading institutions the trader uses the eim  to enter into and transact negotiations to buy andor sell securities through the etm the network  connects the workstations  to the oms  and to external networks such as the network in communication with the etm  the network  can utilize any networking technology that supports bidirectional transfer of data among the oms  workstations  and external networks in a typical embodiment the network  is a private local area network lan installed at a financial institution and interfacing with one or more external gateways in alternate embodiments the network may be wireless connect devices over a wide area andor at least partially carry data over a public network such as the internet other network components such as a firewall may also be present those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many different types of networks can perform the functionality described hereinthe oms  is preferably comprised of one or more computer systems for executing and maintaining an order management system the oms  receives instructions from the workstations to create modify andor delete orders and updates the database  accordingly software providing the functionality of the oms  is well known in the art commercial oms software packages are available from the macgregor group eze castle software advent software and decalog to name but a few in addition some trading institutions utilize custom oms softwareas described above the database  holds data representative of open contemplated or completed orders to buy andor sell securities fig  is a diagram illustrating a data record  stored in the database  to identify an order according to one embodiment of the present invention different oms systems utilize different order data records and therefore it should be understood that fig  illustrates only one possible data record however many oms systems store the same general information and the illustrated order data record  is intended to represent a typical order data record for an oms systemthe order data record  has multiple fields each field holding different information about an order the order id field  preferably holds a value uniquely identifying the order associated with the data record  similarly the trader id field  preferably holds a value uniquely identifying the trader or other person who placed the order the order status field  identifies whether the order is open contemplated completed canceled or any other possible status the next field order last update time  preferably holds a timestamp that identifies the last time that the data record  was modified in any way this field  is useful for determining whether the most recent version of the data record  has been consideredthe transaction type field  preferably indicates whether the data record  corresponds to an order to buy or sell a security the security symbol field  preferably uniquely identifies the security to be transacted the security symbol field  can hold for example a committee on uniform securities identification procedures cusip number a ticker symbol or any other identifier of the security the security type field  is preferably used to interpret the other data in the data record  according to the given security type for example treasury bills are priced in terms of a discount to face value inherent in the pricing formula is the yield that would be obtained if the bill were held to maturity in contrast equity securities are priced in actual pershare values the information in the security type field  can also be used to filter out certain types of securitiesthe order type field  preferably indicates whether the order is a market or a limit order although the field can also indicate other order types if the order is a limit order the limit price field  preferably identifies the price set by the traderthe total order size field  preferably identifies the actual number of shares that the trader desires to transact the quantity placed elsewhere field  is a value either equal to or less than the value in the total order size field  in an embodiment of the present invention the etm  uses the values of these two fields   to determine a quantity of a security if any that are available to be transacted by the etmpreferably the oms  allows for the possibility that trading a large quantity of a given security may occur over several days at several different venues for example to fill an order to buy  shares of ibm a trader may need to place an order for  shares with one broker and record numerous executions of portions thereof until the full  shares placed with that broker are purchased if the broker cannot provide additional shares at a suitable price the trader may then place an additional quantity up to the  shares remaining to be purchased via another broker electronic marketplace or other venue preferably the broker enters a placement record into the oms database  to indicate that the trader anticipates executing a portion of the order through the second venue this second venue may also fill the quantity it was asked to provide in several executions thus an order can have one or more placements and each placement can have one or more executions associated with itfig  is a diagram illustrating a placement record  preferably stored in the oms database  to indicate a placement of an order at a particular venue the order id field  preferably holds a value that uniquely identifies the order associated with the placement the order id field  ties the placement information to the overall order thus all placements for the same order preferably have the same value in this field  the broker field  preferably contains an alphanumeric value identifying the venue associated with the placement record lastly the quantity placed with broker field  preferably lists the portion of the total order size that is placed for fulfillment through the venuewhen a transaction is executed in a specified venue such as the etm  a corresponding execution record is preferably stored in the oms database  fig  is a diagram illustrating an execution record  according to an embodiment of the present invention an execution id field  preferably holds a value identifying the particular execution as before the order id field  preferably holds a value that uniquely identifies the order associated with the execution and all executions for the same order preferably have the same value in this field  the broker field  preferably contains an alphanumeric value identifying the venue that performed the execution the quantity executed field  preferably specifies the number of securities transacted in this execution while the price field  specifies the price at which the securities were executed the timestamp field  preferably records the time at which the execution took placethe oms interfacing module oim  is in communication with the oms database  via the network  or a direct connection in alternative embodiments the oim  is in communication with the oms  andor the workstations  the oim  is also in communication with the etm  via an external gateway or some other form of network connection in another alternative embodiment the oim  is integrated into the etm  and is remote from the oms  although some functionality is present at the oms in order to provide oms data to the oimin a preferred embodiment the oim  includes a computer system storing and executing software for performing the functionality described herein in an alternative embodiment the oim  executes on the same computer system as the oms  in one embodiment the oim  includes an oms database interaction module  for interacting with the oms database  the oms database interaction module  reads records stored in the oms database  and in a preferred embodiment creates and modifies data records stored in the oms database  in one embodiment the oms database interaction module  directly accesses the oms database  and in another embodiment it sends commands to an applications programming interface api in the oms  for accessing the databasethe oim  also preferably includes an etm communication module  for communicating with the etm  in one embodiment the etm communication module  automatically provides selected data records in the oms database  to the etm  and in a preferred embodiment receives data andor instructions from the etm in addition the oim  also preferably includes a data record conversion module  for modifying the format of the data records sent to andor received from the etm  and a filtering module  for filtering out specified orders by security type security name order type order quantity order price or some other factor or category so that filtered orders are not transmitted to the etmfig  is a flow diagram illustrating actions performed by an embodiment of the present invention when a trader logs on to the etm  although the actions of fig  and subsequent figures are attributed herein to the oim  one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that all or some of the actions can be carried out by other entitiespreferably the oim  waits  until a trader logs on to the oms  before transmitting data records for that trader to the etm  in one embodiment the etm  sends a message to the oim  when a trader at the institution in which the oim  resides logs into the etm the oim  interprets this message as a sign to commence receiving orders in other embodiments of the present invention the oim  uses other techniques such as querying the oms database  for specific entries listening for an interprocess message sent by the oms  polling individual trader workstations  or implementing a timerbased algorithm to determine that a trader has logged on to the oms once a determination  is made that a trader has logged on to the oms  the oim  retrieves  data records about orders suitable for transmission to the etm from the oms database  in one embodiment of the present invention all open orders are suitable for transmission to the etm  in other embodiments of the present invention the oim  through the filtering module  makes the determination of suitable orders based on other criteria such as the security type eg stock or bond security name eg ibm or t order type eg market or limit order order quantity andor order priceif necessary the data record conversion module  within the oim  preferably converts  the data records retrieved from the oms database  into a standardized format understood by the etm  as described above the functionality of the data record conversion module  can also be performed by the odim  in the etm  alternative embodiments of the present invention may send the data records individually or in multiple batches the data transmitted to the etm  depend on factors such as the types of securities being traded andor the fields required in order to accurately trade such securitiesfig  is a flow diagram illustrating the actions performed by an embodiment of the present invention after a trader has logged on to the oms during the trading day the actions of fig  are preferably automatically performed multiple times during the trading day initially the oim  determines  whether the contents of the oms database  have changed the oim  can perform this step by for example polling the database  at regular nearrealtime intervals querying the database for contents of specified fields such as timestamps andor listening for network or specific interprocess communication message trafficif the database has changed the oim  preferably determines whether the change should be transmitted to the etm  because typical omss are complex and multifeatured and because securities of types not handled by the etm  may be traded using the oms  some changes to the oms database  do not necessitate a transmission of updated data to the etm  thus the oim  determines  whether the change to the database  reflects a new order of a type that is traded in the etm  if so then the oim  retrieves  the pertinent data for the order from the database  if the change does not reflect a new order then the oim  preferably determines  whether the database change pertains to a modification of an existing order that has already been sent to the etm  if so the oim  retrieves  the data records corresponding to the modified order from the database  once the appropriate data records if any are retrieved from the database the oim  preferably converts  the data records into the appropriate format and transmits the records to the etm  as described above with respect to fig fig  is a flow diagram illustrating the actions performed by an embodiment of the present invention when the oms database  is updated in response to a trade executed by the etm  the illustrated steps can be performed each time a trade is executed or in batch however the steps are preferably performed frequently enough so that the oms database  is updated in substantially realtimethe oim  initially determines  whether an execution occurred in the etm  involving an order in the oms  associated with the oim the step may be performed for example by receiving a message from the etm  identifying a particular execution that occurred at the etm by filtering a list of all executions or other data from the etm for executions listed in the oms  or by periodically polling the etm for performed executionsif an execution occurred in the etm  involving an order in the oms  associated with the oim  the oim receives  information from the etm describing the execution this information includes for example the type amount and price of securities traded the time of execution andor information identifying the original order in the oms database  on which the execution was based the oim  converts  the received information about the execution into the format used by the oms  then the oim  updates  the oms database  with the converted execution data as a result of these steps the oms  is updated automatically and transparently to reflect executions performed at the etm  the executions appear to the oms  as typical trades conducted at another brokerin summary the present invention includes an electronic trading marketplace that generates liquidity at least in part by receiving order information directly from the databases of oms systems at trading institutions since orders are extracted from the oms databases automatically and information about executed orders is inserted into the databases automatically the oms databases “see” the marketplace as “just another market intermediary” moreover traders are able to conduct trades in the electronic marketplace without any duplicative manual effortsthe above description is included to illustrate the operation of the preferred embodiments and is not meant to limit the scope of the invention the scope of the invention is to be limited only by the following claims from the above discussion many variations will be apparent to one skilled in the relevant art that would yet be encompassed by the spirit and scope of the invention   previous patent auction for financially settled contractsnext patent method and apparatus for prime brokering financial transactions home

embodiment does not imply that the referenced embodiment is mutually exclusive with another embodiment eg an embodiment described before the referenced embodiment unless expressly specified otherwise the term “product” means any machine manufacture andor composition of matter unless expressly specified otherwise the term “process” means any process algorithm method or the like unless expressly specified otherwise each process whether called a method algorithm or otherwise inherently includes one or more steps and therefore all references to a “step” or “steps” of a process have an inherent antecedent basis in the mere recitation of the term ‘process’ or a like term accordingly any reference in a claim to a ‘step’ or ‘steps’ of a process has sufficient antecedent basis the term “invention” and the like mean “the one or more inventions disclosed in this application” unless expressly specified otherwise the term “variation” of an invention means an embodiment of the invention unless expressly specified otherwisethe terms “including” “comprising” “having” “containing” “involving” and variations thereof mean “including but not limited to” unless expressly specified otherwise the terms “a” “an” and “the” mean “one or more” unless expressly specified otherwise the term “plurality” means “two or more” unless expressly specified otherwise the term “herein” means “in the present application including anything which may be incorporated by reference” unless expressly specified otherwisethe phrase “at least one of” when such phrase modifies a plurality of things such as an enumerated list of things means any combination of one or more of those things unless expressly specified otherwise for example the phrase “at least one of a widget a car and a wheel” means either i a widget ii a car iii a wheel iv a widget and a car v a widget and a wheel vi a car and a wheel or vii a widget a car and a wheelthe phrase “based on” does not mean “based only on” unless expressly specified otherwise in other words the phrase “based on” describes both “based only on” and “based at least on” similarly the phrase “based on” does not mean “based on the entirety of” “based on all of” or variations thereon unless expressly specified otherwisethe term “eg” and like terms mean “for example” and thus does not limit the term or phrase it explains for example in the sentence “the computer sends data eg instructions a data structure over the internet” the term “eg” explains that “instructions” are an example of “data” that the computer may send over the internet and also explains that “a data structure” is an example of “data” that the computer may send over the internet however both “instructions” and “a data structure” are merely examples of “data” and other things besides “instructions” and “a data structure” can be “data”the term “calculating” and grammatical variants thereof eg to calculating a price calculating a value is used in an extremely broad sense the term “calculating” encompasses a wide variety of actions and therefore “calculating” can include computing processing deriving investigating looking up eg looking up in a table a database or another data structure ascertaining and the like also “calculating” can include receiving eg receiving information accessing eg accessing data in a memory and the like also “calculating” can include resolving selecting choosing establishing and the likethe term “calculating” does not imply certainty or absolute precision and therefore “calculating” can include estimating predicting guessing and the like the term “calculating” does not imply that mathematical processing must be performed and does not imply that numerical methods must be used and does not imply that an algorithm or process is used the term “calculating” does not imply that any particular device must be used for example a computer need not necessarily perform the calculatingsimilarly the term “determining” is used in an extremely broad sense the term “determining” should be understood to be at least as broad as the term “calculating”the terms “an embodiment” “embodiment” “embodiments” “the embodiment” “the embodiments” “one or more embodiments” “some embodiments” “certain embodiments” “one embodiment” “another embodiment” and the like mean “one or more but not all embodiments of the present invention” unless expressly specified otherwisethe term “electronic message” and variations thereof used herein should be understood to mean any electronic representation of information for example an http message an xmlhttp request an sms message an mms message a database message eg sql message or any other series of electrical signals that represent information may be considered an electronic message an electronic message does not include information identifying a source andor destination such as the information typically present in a tcpip packet header rather the electronic message should be considered the bodycontent of such a packetthe terms “representation” and “indication” of a thing and variations thereof used herein in reference to a thing should be understood to refer to any indication of at least a portion andor characteristic of the thing an indication of information for example may include any indication of at least a portion of the information in some embodiments the information may be determined by a person or computing device from the indication of the information in some example implementations an indication may include a copy of the information in any of a variety of formats compressions andor encryptions in another example implementation an indication may include an index or other identifier such as a position in a list an id number or a database key an indication of a thing may be in the same or different medium as an original thing for example a number “” may indicate a sound a color a menu item or any other thing depending eg on the configuration of a computing system configured to interpret the number in some implementations an indication may be divided into a plurality of portions such as a plurality of electronic messages being transmitted from one location to another in some implementations multiple indications may be combined into a single messageforms of sentenceswhere a limitation of a first claim would cover one of a feature as well as more than one of a feature eg a limitation such as “at least one widget” covers one widget as well as more than one widget and where in a second claim that depends on the first claim the second claim uses a definite article “the” to refer to the limitation eg “the widget” this does not imply that the first claim covers only one of the feature and this does not imply that the second claim covers only one of the feature eg “the widget” can cover both one widget and more than one widgetwhen an ordinal number such as “first” “second” “third” and so on is used as an adjective before a term that ordinal number is used unless expressly specified otherwise merely to indicate a particular feature such as to distinguish that particular feature from another feature that is described by the same term or by a similar term for example a “first widget” may be so named merely to distinguish it from eg a “second widget” thus the mere usage of the ordinal numbers “first” and “second” before the term “widget” does not indicate any other relationship between the two widgets and likewise does not indicate any other characteristics of either or both widgets for example the mere usage of the ordinal numbers “first” and “second” before the term “widget”  does not indicate that either widget comes before or after any other in order or location  does not indicate that either widget occurs or acts before or after any other in time and  does not indicate that either widget ranks above or below any other as in importance or quality in addition the mere usage of ordinal numbers does not define a numerical limit to the features identified with the ordinal numbers eg “a plurality of first widgets” indicates two or more widgets that are distinct from other widgets for example the mere usage of the ordinal numbers “first” and “second” before the term “widget” does not indicate that there must be no more than two widgetswhen a single device or article is described herein more than one devicearticle whether or not they cooperate may alternatively be used in place of the single devicearticle that is described accordingly the functionality that is described as being possessed by a device may alternatively be possessed by more than one devicearticle whether or not they cooperatesimilarly where more than one device or article is described herein whether or not they cooperate a single devicearticle may alternatively be used in place of the more than one device or article that is described for example a plurality of computerbased devices may be substituted with a single computerbased device accordingly the various functionality that is described as being possessed by more than one device or article may alternatively be possessed by a single devicearticlethe functionality andor the features of a single device that is described may be alternatively embodied by one or more other devices which are described but are not explicitly described as having such functionalityfeatures thus other embodiments need not include the described device itself but rather can include the one or more other devices which would in those other embodiments have such

implementations include the lender and borrower with most similar information in some implementations a representation of one or more lenders may be provided to a borrower the representation may include for example a user interface through which the borrower may view information about available loans from the one or more lenders andor may select one or more of the matched one or more lenders from the representation to accept a loan or loans in some implementations such matches may be ordered based on similarity of informationin some implementations facilitating may include providing a representation of one or more borrowers to one or more lenders the representation may include for example a user interface through which the one or more lenders may view information regarding the one or more borrowers in some implementations the representation may include a sorted list of borrowers according to closeness of matchin some implementations information may be exchanged withprovided to respective borrowers andor lenders so that a loan may be established between them in other implementations a loan may automatically be established if information regarding a lender and a borrower matches to a sufficient degree in still other implementations a loan may be established if one or both parties verifies their desire for a loan eg through a web page or other user interface by signing a loan document electronically or by hand etcas indicated at block  process  may include determining at least a portion of a payment associated with the one or more loans to allocate to the at least one referrer in various embodiments such a portion may be determined for all loans given to a referred borrower andor by a referred lender in some implementations such a portion may include a portion
