function as “molecular switches” which “turn on” tumorsuppressor genes and “turn off” oncogenes preclinical studies have indicated the regulatory properties of anp therapy in relation to the proliferation pathways of the ras akt mycc and tgfβ genes and the tumorsuppressor pathways of the p p pten ini and mad genes hence the anticancer action of anp therapy may restore cell cycle control

burzynski clinic is a medical clinic in texas united states founded in  and offering unproven cancer treatment it is best known for the controversial antineoplaston therapy a chemotherapy using compounds it calls antineoplastons devised by the clinics founder stanislaw burzynski in the s there is no accepted scientific evidence of benefit from antineoplaston combinations for various diseases the clinic has been the focus of criticism primarily due to the way its antineoplaston therapy is promoted the costs for people with cancer participating in trials of antineoplastons problems with the way these trials are run and legal cases brought as a result of the sale of the therapy without state board approval contents  stanislaw burzynski  antineoplaston therapy  clinical trials  efficacy  cost  legal issues  fda warnings  texas medical board  lawsuits  legal threats to online critics  media and commentary  references  further reading  external links stanislaw burzynski burzynski was born on january   in lublin poland he graduated from the medical academy in lublin the following year he earned a phd in biochemistry burzynski moved to the united states in  working at baylor college until  when he established the burzynski research laboratory where he administered antineoplaston therapy initially to  patients but then more widely as experimental treatment this opened him up to charges of unethical conduct and to the suspicion he had become a merchant of false hope which led to several instances of media controversy burzynski founded the burzynski research institute in  his scientific papers have caused academic controversy with reviewers disputing the design of the trials and scientific validity of the published results in february  following lengthy hearings the texas medical board recommended burzynskis medical license be revoked with the revocation suspended and a fine of  for billing irregularities and other violations antineoplaston therapy antineoplaston is a name coined by burzynski for a group of peptides peptide derivatives and mixtures that he uses as an alternative cancer treatment the word is derived from neoplasm antineoplaston therapy has been offered in the us since  but is not approved for general use the compounds are not licensed as drugs but are instead sold and administered as part of clinical trials at the burzynski clinic and the burzynski research institute burzynski stated that he began investigating the use of antineoplastons after detecting what he considered significant differences in the presence of peptides between the blood of cancer patients and a control group he first identified antineoplastons from human blood since similar peptides had been isolated from urine early batches of burzynskis treatment were isolated from urine burzynski has since produced the compounds synthetically the first active peptide fraction identified was called antineoplaston a phenylacetylaminopiperidinedione from a antineoplaston as was derived – a  mixture of phenylacetic acid and phenylacetylglutamine the burzynski clinic website states that the active ingredient of antineoplaston ai is phenylacetylglutamine since  the clinic has marketed itself as offering personalized genetargeted cancer therapy which has stirred further controversy as the treatment bears no relationship to genetargeted therapy and only superficially incorporates elements of personalized medicine the clinics version of personalized medicine bears little resemblance to targeted cancer therapy as the clinic includes chemotherapy drugs and antineoplastons are part of this treatment clinical trials for definitions of clinical trial phases see clinical trial according to the national cancer institute as of april  no phase iii randomized controlled trials of antineoplastons as a treatment for cancer have been conducted publications have taken the form of case reports phase i clinical trials toxicity studies and phase ii clinical trials and for the most part these publications have been authored by the developer of the therapy dr burzynski in conjunction with his associates at the burzynski clinic although these studies often report remissions other investigators have not been successful in duplicating these results from  to  the nci initiated multiple phase ii trials of antineoplastons in  after over  million had been spent on these trials they were stopped before the effectiveness of antineoplastons could be determined since the mids burzynski registered some sixty clinical trials of antineoplastons and in december  a phase iii trial which did not open for patient recruitment burzynski has not published full results for any of these according to his lawyer richard jaffe  burzynski personally put together seventytwo protocols to treat every type of cancer the clinic had treated and everything burzynski wanted to treat in the future  we heard that the fda had to put together a fiftyperson task force to review all of the protocols burzynski submitted all trials were paused no new patients allowed following a  fda inspections which found for the third consecutive time significant issues with his institutional review board and according to papers published in november  substantial issues with the conduct of both the clinic and burzynski as principal investigator efficacy although burzynski and his associates claim success in the use of antineoplaston combinations for the treatment of various diseases and some of the clinics patients say they have been helped there is no evidence of the clinical efficacy of these methods the consensus among the professional community as represented by the american cancer society and cancer research uk among others is that antineoplaston therapy is unproven and the overall probability of the treatment turning out to be as claimed is low due to lack of credible mechanisms and the poor state of research after more than  years of investigation while the antineoplaston therapy is marketed as a nontoxic alternative to chemotherapy it is a form of chemotherapy with significant known side effects including severe neurotoxicity independent scientists have been unable to reproduce the positive results reported in burzynskis studies nci observed that researchers other than burzynski and his associates have not been successful in duplicating his results and cancer research uk states that available scientific evidence does not support claims that antineoplaston therapy is effective in treating or preventing cancer there is no convincing evidence from randomized controlled trials in the scientific literature that antineoplastons are useful treatments of cancer and the us food and drug administration fda has not approved these products for the treatment of any disease the american cancer society has stated since  that there is no evidence that antineoplastons have any beneficial effects in cancer and recommended that people do not buy these products since there could be serious health consequences a  medical review described antineoplaston treatment as a disproven therapy in  three oncologists were enlisted by the weekly washington newsletter the cancer letter to conduct independent reviews of burzynskis clinical trial research on antineoplastons they concluded that the studies were poorly designed not interpretable and so flawed that it cannot be determined whether it really works one of them characterized the research as scientific nonsense in addition to questioning burzynskis research methods the oncologists found significant and possibly lifethreatening toxicity in some patients treated with antineoplastons the memorial sloankettering cancer center has stated bottom line there is no clear evidence to support the anticancer effects of antineoplastons in humans cost according to the american cancer society treatment can cost from  to  per month or more depending on the type of treatment number of consultations and the need for surgery to implant a catheter for drug delivery available information suggests that health insurance plans often do not reimburse costs linked to this treatment as of march  the burzynski clinic required patients to provide a deposit before treatment starts and their website informed patients that since we are classified as out of network we are unable to accept medicare medicaid and any hmo insurance legal issues fda warnings burzynskis use and advertising of antineoplastons as an unapproved cancer therapy were deemed to be unlawful by the us fda and the texas attorney general and limits on the sale and advertising of the treatment were imposed as a result in  the fda issued a warning letter to the burzynski research institute stating that an investigation had determined the burzynski institutional review board irb did not adhere to the applicable statutory requirements and fda regulations governing the protection of human subjects it identified a number of specific findings among them that the irb had approved research without ensuring risk to patients was minimized had failed to prepare required written procedures or retain required documentation and had failed to conduct required continuing reviews for studies among others the institute was given fifteen days to identify the steps it would take to prevent future violations another warning issued in october  notes that the burzynski clinic is advertising investigational drugs as being safe and effective noting promotion of an investigational new drug is prohibited under fda regulations at  cfr a which states a sponsor or investigator or any person acting on behalf of a  sponsor or investigator shall not represent in a promotional context that an investigational new drug is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is under investigation or otherwise promote the drug this provision is not intended to restrict the full exchange of scientific information concerning the drug including dissemination of scientific findings in scientific or lay media rather its intent is to restrict promotional claims of safety or effectiveness of the drug for a use for which it is under investigation and to preclude commercialization of the drug before it is approved for commercial distribution the websites including the posted press releases and embedded videos contain claims such as the following that promote antineoplastons as safe andor effective for the purposes for which they are being investigated or otherwise promote the drugs  since antineoplastons are investigational new drugs the products indications warnings precautions adverse reactions and dosage and administration have not been established and are unknown at this time promoting antineoplastons as safe and effective for the purposes for which they are under investigation by making representations such as those noted above is in violation of  cfr a — fda enforcement letter original the letter requires cessation of noncompliant promotional activities including use of testimonials and promotional interviews with burzynski himself in june  antineoplaston trials were paused following the death of a child patient in january and february  the fda inspected burzynski and his irb in houston in december  the fda issued its findings in warning letters to burzynski expressing concerns about subject safety and data integrity as well as concerns about the adequacy of safeguards in place at your site to protect patients in november  the fda released the observational notes from an inspection of burzynski as a principal investigator that took place between january and march  among the findings were “failure to comply with protocol requirements related to the primary outcome therapeutic response  for  of study subjects reviewed during the inspection” admitting patients who failed to meet inclusion criteria failing to stop treatment when patients had severe toxic reactions to antineoplastons and failure to report all adverse events further the fda told burzynski you failed to protect the rights safety and welfare of subjects under your care fortyeight  subjects experienced  investigational overdoses between january   and february    there is no documentation to show that you have implemented corrective actions during this time period to ensure the safety and welfare of subjects” the fda also observed that burzynski had denied patients informed consent by not informing them of extra costs that they might incur during treatment and that he could not account for his stock of the investigational drug lastly the fda observed your  tumor measurements initially recorded on worksheets at baseline and onstudy treatment  studies for all study subjects were destroyed and are not available for fda inspectional review meaning that there was no way for the fda to verify either initial tumor sizes or effects that the antineoplastons may have had in burzynskis written response to the  fda investigation he states that the investigators complied with all criteria for evaluation of response and made accurate assessments for tumor response in december  the fda issued two warning letters one to the burzynski institutional review board and one to burzynski the subjects of the investigations in february the fda found that burzynski and the irb had largely failed to address the concerns identified in the initial observation reports the letter to burzynski noted serious problems with patient medical files with respect to a pediatric patient who died while treated by burzynski and whose death apparently initiated the investigation on march   usa today reported that the fda had decided to permit a handful of cancer patients to receive burzynskis treatment provided that the patients did not receive the treatment directly from him david gorski wrote in  that over four decades the fda and state medical boards have been unable to shut down burzynkskis business selling unproven treatments – these organizations are supposed to protect the public from practitioners like burzynski but all too often they fail at their charges in this case spectacularly the burzynski clinic has also made use of compassionate use exemptions according to an investigative report by stat news published in august  the clinic has benefited by political lobbying of burzynskis supporters including the families of patients with terminal diagnoses according to fda documents obtained by stat from  to   members of congress wrote to the fda about burzynski … most of the lawmakers asked the agency to grant constituents compassionate use exemptions so that they could try his unapproved drugs or to allow his clinical trials to proceed according to burzynski interventions by lawmakers were helpful however appeals to the fda compassionate use exemptions are not always successful in one case burzynski said he used a texas state law to circumvent the agency and start treatment critics state that the congressional advocacy risks giving the terminally ill and their families a false sense of hope while also conferring a measure of legitimacy on him that many believe he does not deserve texas medical board in december  the use of chemotherapeutic agents by the clinic has been characterized as random and their use of unapproved combinations with no known benefits but clear harms by the texas medical board which regulates and licenses physicians in the state of texas led to a case against burzynski by that board burzynski was acquitted because he had not personally written the prescriptions in july  the board filed a page complaint against burzynski to the texas state office of administrative hearings the complaint addressed allegations by the board including misleading patients into paying exorbitant charges misrepresenting unlicensed persons to patients as licensed medical doctors––– and misleading patients into accepting care from providers without significant education or training related to cancer treatment citing examples of problems with  patients which were listed in the document the board said that unapproved combinations of highly toxic chemotherapy were prescribed in ways that caused harm to several patients in july  burzynskis counsel richard jaffe withdrew from the case citing a potential conflict of interest a result of jaffe pursuing actions against burzynski in bankruptcy court with the addition of replacement counsel the hearing was set to begin in november  in november  the texas medical board took burzynski to court in houston texas burzynski was accused of baitandswitch tactics improperly charging patients not informing patients that he owns the pharmacy they were required to use to fill their medications and of offlabel prescribing of drugs burzynskis former attorney richard jaffe has filed suit in federal court claiming unpaid legal fees of over  burzynski through his current attorney denied all charges on march   the texas medical board sanctioned burzynski placing him on probation and fining him  staff recommendations had been more punitive probation terms included additional medical training disclosure of the boards ruling to patients and medical facilities and monitoring of his patient records lawsuits in  a court found against burzynski in a case of insurance fraud according to the smu law review burzynski was found to have defrauded an erisa health insurance fund by billing it for unapproved treatment with antineoplastons in violation of the terms of the health plan it covered in december  the texas state board of medical examiners filed a multicount complaint against burzynski for failure to meet state medical standards this suit was eventually withdrawn in november  after the judge allowed burzynski to repudiate responsibility for the actions of staff at the clinic an appeal against the advertising restrictions on the grounds of free speech was denied on the basis that this was commercial speech promoting an unlawful activity in january  lola quinlan an elderly stage iv cancer patient sued burzynski for using false and misleading tactics to swindle her out of  she also sued his companies the burzynski clinic the burzynski research institute and southern family pharmacy in harris county court she sued for negligence negligent misrepresentation fraud deceptive trade and conspiracy legal threats to online critics in november  a music writer and editor for the british newspaper the observer sought help raising £ to have his yearold niece who was diagnosed with glioma treated at the burzynski clinic several bloggers reported other cases of patients who had spent similar amounts of money on the treatment and had died and challenged the validity of burzynskis treatments marc stephens identifying himself as a representative of the burzynski clinic sent emails accusing them of libel and demanding that coverage of burzynski be removed from their sites one of the bloggers who received threatening emails from stephens was rhys morgan a yearold sixthform student from cardiff wales at the time previously noted for exposing the miracle mineral supplement another was andy lewis a skeptic and publisher of the quackometer blog following the publicity fallout resulting from the legal threats made by stephens against the bloggers the burzynski clinic issued a press release on november   confirming that the clinic had hired stephens to provide web optimization services and to attempt to stop the dissemination of false and inaccurate information concerning dr burzynski and the clinic apologizing for comments made by stephens to bloggers and for the posting of personal information and announcing that stephens no longer has a professional relationship with the burzynski clinic the story including the threats against the bloggers was covered by the bmj formerly the british medical journal the chief clinician at cancer research uk expressed his concern at the treatment offered and andy lewis of quackometer and science writer simon singh who had previously been sued by the british chiropractic association said that english libel law harms public discussion of science and medicine and thus public health in an article in skeptical inquirer published in march  skeptic robert blaskiewicz chronicled the activities by skeptics to investigate and challenge burzynskis claim of cancer treatments he claimed aggressive actions by burzynskis supporters toward the critics including contacting their employers lodging complaints to state licensing boards and defamation blaskiewicz pointedly indicated that although burzynski had dismissed marc stephens his clinic has not retracted the warnings of the possibility of lawsuits against critics that it is a threat that hangs over all of these activists every day media and commentary in  eric merola an art director of television commercials released a film titled burzynski cancer is serious business that promotes the clinics claims and describes burzynskis use of antineoplastons and his legal clashes with

for the award the high cost of antineoplaston treatments the lack of controlled trials demonstrating efficacy the lack of fda approval on the treatments the lack of published final results of any

burzynski research institute inc jump to navigation search the burzynski clinic is a medical clinic in texas united states founded in  and offering unproven cancer treatment it is best known for the controversial antineoplaston therapy a chemotherapy using compounds it calls antineoplastons devised by the clinics founder stanislaw burzynski in the s there is no accepted scientific evidence of benefit from antineoplaston combinations for various diseases the clinic has been the focus of criticism primarily due to the way its antineoplaston therapy is promoted the costs for people with cancer participating in trials of antineoplastons problems with the way these trials are run and legal cases brought as a result of the sale of the therapy without state board approval contents  stanislaw burzynski  antineoplaston therapy  clinical trials  efficacy  cost  legal issues  fda warnings  texas medical board  lawsuits  legal threats to online critics  media and commentary  references  further reading  external links stanislaw burzynski burzynski was born on january   in lublin poland he graduated from the medical academy in lublin the following year he earned a phd in biochemistry burzynski moved to the united states in  working at baylor college until  when he established the burzynski research laboratory where he administered antineoplaston therapy initially to  patients but then more widely as experimental treatment this opened him up to charges of unethical conduct and to the suspicion he had become a merchant of false hope which led to several instances of media controversy burzynski founded the burzynski research institute in  his scientific papers have caused academic controversy with reviewers disputing the design of the trials and scientific validity of the published results in february  following lengthy hearings the texas medical board recommended burzynskis medical license be revoked with the revocation suspended and a fine of  for billing irregularities and other violations antineoplaston therapy antineoplaston is a name coined by burzynski for a group of peptides peptide derivatives and mixtures that he uses as an alternative cancer treatment the word is derived from neoplasm antineoplaston therapy has been offered in the us since  but is not approved for general use the compounds are not licensed as drugs but are instead sold and administered as part of clinical trials at the burzynski clinic and the burzynski research institute burzynski stated that he began investigating the use of antineoplastons after detecting what he considered significant differences in the presence of peptides between the blood of cancer patients and a control group he first identified antineoplastons from human blood since similar peptides had been isolated from urine early batches of burzynskis treatment were isolated from urine burzynski has since produced the compounds synthetically the first active peptide fraction identified was called antineoplaston a phenylacetylaminopiperidinedione from a antineoplaston as was derived – a  mixture of phenylacetic acid and phenylacetylglutamine the burzynski clinic website states that the active ingredient of antineoplaston ai is phenylacetylglutamine since  the clinic has marketed itself as offering personalized genetargeted cancer therapy which has stirred further controversy as the treatment bears no relationship to genetargeted therapy and only superficially incorporates elements of personalized medicine the clinics version of personalized medicine bears little resemblance to targeted cancer therapy as the clinic includes chemotherapy drugs and antineoplastons are part of this treatment clinical trials for definitions of clinical trial phases see clinical trial according to the national cancer institute as of april  no phase iii randomized controlled trials of antineoplastons as a treatment for cancer have been conducted publications have taken the form of case reports phase i clinical trials toxicity studies and phase ii clinical trials and for the most part these publications have been authored by the developer of the therapy dr burzynski in conjunction with his associates at the burzynski clinic although these studies often report remissions other investigators have not been successful in duplicating these results from  to  the nci initiated multiple phase ii trials of antineoplastons in  after over  million had been spent on these trials they were stopped before the effectiveness of antineoplastons could be determined since the mids burzynski registered some sixty clinical trials of antineoplastons and in december  a phase iii trial which did not open for patient recruitment burzynski has not published full results for any of these according to his lawyer richard jaffe  burzynski personally put together seventytwo protocols to treat every type of cancer the clinic had treated and everything burzynski wanted to treat in the future  we heard that the fda had to put together a fiftyperson task force to review all of the protocols burzynski submitted all trials were paused no new patients allowed following a  fda inspections which found for the third consecutive time significant issues with his institutional review board and according to papers published in november  substantial issues with the conduct of both the clinic and burzynski as principal investigator efficacy although burzynski and his associates claim success in the use of antineoplaston combinations for the treatment of various diseases and some of the clinics patients say they have been helped there is no evidence of the clinical efficacy of these methods the consensus among the professional community as represented by the american cancer society and cancer research uk among others is that antineoplaston therapy is unproven and the overall probability of the treatment turning out to be as claimed is low due to lack of credible mechanisms and the poor state of research after more than  years of investigation while the antineoplaston therapy is marketed as a nontoxic alternative to chemotherapy it is a form of chemotherapy with significant known side effects including severe neurotoxicity independent scientists have been unable to reproduce the positive results reported in burzynskis studies nci observed that researchers other than burzynski and his associates have not been successful in duplicating his results and cancer research uk states that available scientific evidence does not support claims that antineoplaston therapy is effective in treating or preventing cancer there is no convincing evidence from randomized controlled trials in the scientific literature that antineoplastons are useful treatments of cancer and the us food and drug administration fda has not approved these products for the treatment of any disease the american cancer society has stated since  that there is no evidence that antineoplastons have any beneficial effects in cancer and recommended that people do not buy these products since there could be serious health consequences a  medical review described antineoplaston treatment as a disproven therapy in  three oncologists were enlisted by the weekly washington newsletter the cancer letter to conduct independent reviews of burzynskis clinical trial research on antineoplastons they concluded that the studies were poorly designed not interpretable and so flawed that it cannot be determined whether it really works one of them characterized the research as scientific nonsense in addition to questioning burzynskis research methods the oncologists found significant and possibly lifethreatening toxicity in some patients treated with antineoplastons the memorial sloankettering cancer center has stated bottom line there is no clear evidence to support the anticancer effects of antineoplastons in humans cost according to the american cancer society treatment can cost from  to  per month or more depending on the type of treatment number of consultations and the need for surgery to implant a catheter for drug delivery available information suggests that health insurance plans often do not reimburse costs linked to this treatment as of march  the burzynski clinic required patients to provide a deposit before treatment starts and their website informed patients that since we are classified as out of network we are unable to accept medicare medicaid and any hmo insurance legal issues fda warnings burzynskis use and advertising of antineoplastons as an unapproved cancer therapy were deemed to be unlawful by the us fda and the texas attorney general and limits on the sale and advertising of the treatment were imposed as a result in  the fda issued a warning letter to the burzynski research institute stating that an investigation had determined the burzynski institutional review board irb did not adhere to the applicable statutory requirements and fda regulations governing the protection of human subjects it identified a number of specific findings among them that the irb had approved research without ensuring risk to patients was minimized had failed to prepare required written procedures or retain required documentation and had failed to conduct required continuing reviews for studies among others the institute was given fifteen days to identify the steps it would take to prevent future violations another warning issued in october  notes that the burzynski clinic is advertising investigational drugs as being safe and effective noting promotion of an investigational new drug is prohibited under fda regulations at  cfr a which states a sponsor or investigator or any person acting on behalf of a  sponsor or investigator shall not represent in a promotional context that an investigational new drug is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is under investigation or otherwise promote the drug this provision is not intended to restrict the full exchange of scientific information concerning the drug including dissemination of scientific findings in scientific or lay media rather its intent is to restrict promotional claims of safety or effectiveness of the drug for a use for which it is under investigation and to preclude commercialization of the drug before it is approved for commercial distribution the websites including the posted press releases and embedded videos contain claims such as the following that promote antineoplastons as safe andor effective for the purposes for which they are being investigated or otherwise promote the drugs  since antineoplastons are investigational new drugs the products indications warnings precautions adverse reactions and dosage and administration have not been established and are unknown at this time promoting antineoplastons as safe and effective for the purposes for which they are under investigation by making representations such as those noted above is in violation of  cfr a — fda enforcement letter original the letter requires cessation of noncompliant promotional activities including use of testimonials and promotional interviews with burzynski himself in june  antineoplaston trials were paused following the death of a child patient in january and february  the fda inspected burzynski and his irb in houston in december  the fda issued its findings in warning letters to burzynski expressing concerns about subject safety and data integrity as well as concerns about the adequacy of safeguards in place at your site to protect patients in november  the fda released the observational notes from an inspection of burzynski as a principal investigator that took place between january and march  among the findings were “failure to comply with protocol requirements related to the primary outcome therapeutic response  for  of study subjects reviewed during the inspection” admitting patients who failed to meet inclusion criteria failing to stop treatment when patients had severe toxic reactions to antineoplastons and failure to report all adverse events further the fda told burzynski you failed to protect the rights safety and welfare of subjects under your care fortyeight  subjects experienced  investigational overdoses between january   and february    there is no documentation to show that you have implemented corrective actions during this time period to ensure the safety and welfare of subjects” the fda also observed that burzynski had denied patients informed consent by not informing them of extra costs that they might incur during treatment and that he could not account for his stock of the investigational drug lastly the fda observed your  tumor measurements initially recorded on worksheets at baseline and onstudy treatment  studies for all study subjects were destroyed and are not available for fda inspectional review meaning that there was no way for the fda to verify either initial tumor sizes or effects that the antineoplastons may have had in burzynskis written response to the  fda investigation he states that the investigators complied with all criteria for evaluation of response and made accurate assessments for tumor response in december  the fda issued two warning letters one to the burzynski institutional review board and one to burzynski the subjects of the investigations in february the fda found that burzynski and the irb had largely failed to address the concerns identified in the initial observation reports the letter to burzynski noted serious problems with patient medical files with respect to a pediatric patient who died while treated by burzynski and whose death apparently initiated the investigation on march   usa today reported that the fda had decided to permit a handful of cancer patients to receive burzynskis treatment provided that the patients did not receive the treatment directly from him david gorski wrote in  that over four decades the fda and state medical boards have been unable to shut down burzynkskis business selling unproven treatments – these organizations are supposed to protect the public from practitioners like burzynski but all too often they fail at their charges in this case spectacularly the burzynski clinic has also made use of compassionate use exemptions according to an investigative report by stat news published in august  the clinic has benefited by political lobbying of burzynskis supporters including the families of patients with terminal diagnoses according to fda documents obtained by stat from  to   members of congress wrote to the fda about burzynski … most of the lawmakers asked the agency to grant constituents compassionate use exemptions so that they could try his unapproved drugs or to allow his clinical trials to proceed according to burzynski interventions by lawmakers were helpful however appeals to the fda compassionate use exemptions are not always successful in one case burzynski said he used a texas state law to circumvent the agency and start treatment critics state that the congressional advocacy risks giving the terminally ill and their families a false sense of hope while also conferring a measure of legitimacy on him that many believe he does not deserve texas medical board in december  the use of chemotherapeutic agents by the clinic has been characterized as random and their use of unapproved combinations with no known benefits but clear harms by the texas medical board which regulates and licenses physicians in the state of texas led to a case against burzynski by that board burzynski was acquitted because he had not personally written the prescriptions in july  the board filed a page complaint against burzynski to the texas state office of administrative hearings the complaint addressed allegations by the board including misleading patients into paying exorbitant charges misrepresenting unlicensed persons to patients as licensed medical doctors––– and misleading patients into accepting care from providers without significant education or training related to cancer treatment citing examples of problems with  patients which were listed in the document the board said that unapproved combinations of highly toxic chemotherapy were prescribed in ways that caused harm to several patients in july  burzynskis counsel richard jaffe withdrew from the case citing a potential conflict of interest a result of jaffe pursuing actions against burzynski in bankruptcy court with the addition of replacement counsel the hearing was set to begin in november  in november  the texas medical board took burzynski to court in houston texas burzynski was accused of baitandswitch tactics improperly charging patients not informing patients that he owns the pharmacy they were required to use to fill their medications and of offlabel prescribing of drugs burzynskis former attorney richard jaffe has filed suit in federal court claiming unpaid legal fees of over  burzynski through his current attorney denied all charges on march   the texas medical board sanctioned burzynski placing him on probation and fining him  staff recommendations had been more punitive probation terms included additional medical training disclosure of the boards ruling to patients and medical facilities and monitoring of his patient records lawsuits in  a court found against burzynski in a case of insurance fraud according to the smu law review burzynski was found to have defrauded an erisa health insurance fund by billing it for unapproved treatment with antineoplastons in violation of the terms of the health plan it covered in december  the texas state board of medical examiners filed a multicount complaint against burzynski for failure to meet state medical standards this suit was eventually withdrawn in november  after the judge allowed burzynski to repudiate responsibility for the actions of staff at the clinic an appeal against the advertising restrictions on the grounds of free speech was denied on the basis that this was commercial speech promoting an unlawful activity in january  lola quinlan an elderly stage iv cancer patient sued burzynski for using false and misleading tactics to swindle her out of  she also sued his companies the burzynski clinic the burzynski research institute and southern family pharmacy in harris county court she sued for negligence negligent misrepresentation fraud deceptive trade and conspiracy legal threats to online critics in november  a music writer and editor for the british newspaper the observer sought help raising £ to have his yearold niece who was diagnosed with glioma treated at the burzynski clinic several bloggers reported other cases of patients who had spent similar amounts of money on the treatment and had died and challenged the validity of burzynskis treatments marc stephens identifying himself as a representative of the burzynski clinic sent emails accusing them of libel and demanding that coverage of burzynski be removed from their sites one of the bloggers who received threatening emails from stephens was rhys morgan a yearold sixthform student from cardiff wales at the time previously noted for exposing the miracle mineral supplement another was andy lewis a skeptic and publisher of the quackometer blog following the publicity fallout resulting from the legal threats made by stephens against the bloggers the burzynski clinic issued a press release on november   confirming that the clinic had hired stephens to provide web optimization services and to attempt to stop the dissemination of false and inaccurate information concerning dr burzynski and the clinic apologizing for comments made by stephens to bloggers and for the posting of personal information and announcing that stephens no longer has a professional relationship with the burzynski clinic the story including the threats against the bloggers was covered by the bmj formerly the british medical journal the chief clinician at cancer research uk expressed his concern at the treatment offered and andy lewis of quackometer and science writer simon singh who had previously been sued by the british chiropractic association said that english libel law harms public discussion of science and medicine and thus public health in an article in skeptical inquirer published in march  skeptic robert blaskiewicz chronicled the activities by skeptics to investigate and challenge burzynskis claim of cancer treatments he claimed aggressive actions by burzynskis supporters toward the critics including contacting their employers lodging complaints to state licensing boards and defamation blaskiewicz pointedly indicated that although burzynski had dismissed marc stephens his clinic has not retracted the warnings of the possibility of lawsuits against critics that it is a threat that hangs over all of these activists every day media and commentary in  eric merola an art director of television commercials released a film titled burzynski cancer is serious business that promotes the clinics claims and describes burzynskis use of antineoplastons and his legal clashes with government agencies and regulators in march  merola released a followup movie to cancer is serious business the village voice commented that the first movie violates every basic rule of ethical filmmaking and that by interviewing only burzynskis supporters the films producer is either unusually credulous or doesnt understand the difference between a documentary and an advertisement variety described the film as having the qualities of a paranoid conspiracy theory and likened it to the national enquirer adding that the films explanatory diagrams are simplistic to the point of idiocy the variety review concluded that despite its infotainment look burzynski ultimately proves convincing in april  burzynski received the pigasus award which is bestowed each april fools day by the james randi educational foundation jref to honor the five worst offenders who are intentionally or unintentionally peddling harmful paranormal and pseudoscientific nonsense the foundation cited as the basis for the award the high cost of antineoplaston treatments the lack of controlled trials demonstrating efficacy the lack of fda approval on the treatments the lack of published final results of any single clinical trial and the existence of fda warning letters concerning research method safety and possible rules violations impacting patient safety in june  the bbcs panorama explored burzynski in a documentary titled curing cancer or selling hope to the vulnerable and argued burzynski exploits a legal loophole by treating patients with antineoplastons as part of a clinical trial so the drug does not need a licence for twenty years the clinic complained to the office of communications ofcom about the documentary but the complaint was not upheld in november  an investigative report in usa today by liz szabo accused burzynski of selling false hope to families for years in an interview with reporting on health szabo said that her interest in reporting on burzynski was sparked when she emailed him with questions asking for a response to a book critical of him and received a legal warning letter from his attorneys in reply in august  burzynski was listed by the houston press as number  on a list of the  most embarrassing

burzynski research institute inc jump to navigation search the burzynski clinic is a medical clinic in texas united states founded in  and offering unproven cancer treatment it is best known for the controversial antineoplaston therapy a chemotherapy using compounds it calls antineoplastons devised by the clinics founder stanislaw burzynski in the s there is no accepted scientific evidence of benefit from antineoplaston combinations for various diseases the clinic has been the focus of criticism primarily due to the way its antineoplaston therapy is promoted the costs for people with cancer participating in trials of antineoplastons problems with the way these trials are run and legal cases brought as a result of the sale of the therapy without state board approval contents  stanislaw burzynski  antineoplaston therapy  clinical trials  efficacy  cost  legal issues  fda warnings  texas medical board  lawsuits  legal threats to online critics  media and commentary  references  further reading  external links stanislaw burzynski burzynski was born on january   in lublin poland he graduated from the medical academy in lublin the following year he earned a phd in biochemistry burzynski moved to the united states in  working at baylor college until  when he established the burzynski research laboratory where he administered antineoplaston therapy initially to  patients but then more widely as experimental treatment this opened him up to charges of unethical conduct and to the suspicion he had become a merchant of false hope which led to several instances of media controversy burzynski founded the burzynski research institute in  his scientific papers have caused academic controversy with reviewers disputing the design of the trials and scientific validity of the published results in february  following lengthy hearings the texas medical board recommended burzynskis medical license be revoked with the revocation suspended and a fine of  for billing irregularities and other violations antineoplaston therapy antineoplaston is a name coined by burzynski for a group of peptides peptide derivatives and mixtures that he uses as an alternative cancer treatment the word is derived from neoplasm antineoplaston therapy has been offered in the us since  but is not approved for general use the compounds are not licensed as drugs but are instead sold and administered as part of clinical trials at the burzynski clinic and the burzynski research institute burzynski stated that he began investigating the use of antineoplastons after detecting what he considered significant differences in the presence of peptides between the blood of cancer patients and a control group he first identified antineoplastons from human blood since similar peptides had been isolated from urine early batches of burzynskis treatment were isolated from urine burzynski has since produced the compounds synthetically the first active peptide fraction identified was called antineoplaston a phenylacetylaminopiperidinedione from a antineoplaston as was derived – a  mixture of phenylacetic acid and phenylacetylglutamine the burzynski clinic website states that the active ingredient of antineoplaston ai is phenylacetylglutamine since  the clinic has marketed itself as offering personalized genetargeted cancer therapy which has stirred further controversy as the treatment bears no relationship to genetargeted therapy and only superficially incorporates elements of personalized medicine the clinics version of personalized medicine bears little resemblance to targeted cancer therapy as the clinic includes chemotherapy drugs and antineoplastons are part of this treatment clinical trials for definitions of clinical trial phases see clinical trial according to the national cancer institute as of april  no phase iii randomized controlled trials of antineoplastons as a treatment for cancer have been conducted publications have taken the form of case reports phase i clinical trials toxicity studies and phase ii clinical trials and for the most part these publications have been authored by the developer of the therapy dr burzynski in conjunction with his associates at the burzynski clinic although these studies often report remissions other investigators have not been successful in duplicating these results from  to  the nci initiated multiple phase ii trials of antineoplastons in  after over  million had been spent on these trials they were stopped before the effectiveness of antineoplastons could be determined since the mids burzynski registered some sixty clinical trials of antineoplastons and in december  a phase iii trial which did not open for patient recruitment burzynski has not published full results for any of these according to his lawyer richard jaffe  burzynski personally put together seventytwo protocols to treat every type of cancer the clinic had treated and everything burzynski wanted to treat in the future  we heard that the fda had to put together a fiftyperson task force to review all of the protocols burzynski submitted all trials were paused no new patients allowed following a  fda inspections which found for the third consecutive time significant issues with his institutional review board and according to papers published in november  substantial issues with the conduct of both the clinic and burzynski as principal investigator efficacy although burzynski and his associates claim success in the use of antineoplaston combinations for the treatment of various diseases and some of the clinics patients say they have been helped there is no evidence of the clinical efficacy of these methods the consensus among the professional community as represented by the american cancer society and cancer research uk among others is that antineoplaston therapy is unproven and the overall probability of the treatment turning out to be as claimed is low due to lack of credible mechanisms and the poor state of research after more than  years of investigation while the antineoplaston therapy is marketed as a nontoxic alternative to chemotherapy it is a form of chemotherapy with significant known side effects including severe neurotoxicity independent scientists have been unable to reproduce the positive results reported in burzynskis studies nci observed that researchers other than burzynski and his associates have not been successful in duplicating his results and cancer research uk states that available scientific evidence does not support claims that antineoplaston therapy is effective in treating or preventing cancer there is no convincing evidence from randomized controlled trials in the scientific literature that antineoplastons are useful treatments of cancer and the us food and drug administration fda has not approved these products for the treatment of any disease the american cancer society has stated since  that there is no evidence that antineoplastons have any beneficial effects in cancer and recommended that people do not buy these products since there could be serious health consequences a  medical review described antineoplaston treatment as a disproven therapy in  three oncologists were enlisted by the weekly washington newsletter the cancer letter to conduct independent reviews of burzynskis clinical trial research on antineoplastons they concluded that the studies were poorly designed not interpretable and so flawed that it cannot be determined whether it really works one of them characterized the research as scientific nonsense in addition to questioning burzynskis research methods the oncologists found significant and possibly lifethreatening toxicity in some patients treated with antineoplastons the memorial sloankettering cancer center has stated bottom line there is no clear evidence to support the anticancer effects of antineoplastons in humans cost according to the american cancer society treatment can cost from  to  per month or more depending on the type of treatment number of consultations and the need for surgery to implant a catheter for drug delivery available information suggests that health insurance plans often do not reimburse costs linked to this treatment as of march  the burzynski clinic required patients to provide a deposit before treatment starts and their website informed patients that since we are classified as out of network we are unable to accept medicare medicaid and any hmo insurance legal issues fda warnings burzynskis use and advertising of antineoplastons as an unapproved cancer therapy were deemed to be unlawful by the us fda and the texas attorney general and limits on the sale and advertising of the treatment were imposed as a result in  the fda issued a warning letter to the burzynski research institute stating that an investigation had determined the burzynski institutional review board irb did not adhere to the applicable statutory requirements and fda regulations governing the protection of human subjects it identified a number of specific findings among them that the irb had approved research without ensuring risk to patients was minimized had failed to prepare required written procedures or retain required documentation and had failed to conduct required continuing reviews for studies among others the institute was given fifteen days to identify the steps it would take to prevent future violations another warning issued in october  notes that the burzynski clinic is advertising investigational drugs as being safe and effective noting promotion of an investigational new drug is prohibited under fda regulations at  cfr a which states a sponsor or investigator or any person acting on behalf of a  sponsor or investigator shall not represent in a promotional context that an investigational new drug is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is under investigation or otherwise promote the drug this provision is not intended to restrict the full exchange of scientific information concerning the drug including dissemination of scientific findings in scientific or lay media rather its intent is to restrict promotional claims of safety or effectiveness of the drug for a use for which it is under investigation and to preclude commercialization of the drug before it is approved for commercial distribution the websites including the posted press releases and embedded videos contain claims such as the following that promote antineoplastons as safe andor effective for the purposes for which they are being investigated or otherwise promote the drugs  since antineoplastons are investigational new drugs the products indications warnings precautions adverse reactions and dosage and administration have not been established and are unknown at this time promoting antineoplastons as safe and effective for the purposes for which they are under investigation by making representations such as those noted above is in violation of  cfr a — fda enforcement letter original the letter requires cessation of noncompliant promotional activities including use of testimonials and promotional interviews with burzynski himself in june  antineoplaston trials were paused following the death of a child patient in january and february  the fda inspected burzynski and his irb in houston in december  the fda issued its findings in warning letters to burzynski expressing concerns about subject safety and data integrity as well as concerns about the adequacy of safeguards in place at your site to protect patients in november  the fda released the observational notes from an inspection of burzynski as a principal investigator that took place between january and march  among the findings were “failure to comply with protocol requirements related to the primary outcome therapeutic response  for  of study subjects reviewed during the inspection” admitting patients who failed to meet inclusion criteria failing to stop treatment when patients had severe toxic reactions to antineoplastons and failure to report all adverse events further the fda told burzynski you failed to protect the rights safety and welfare of subjects under your care fortyeight  subjects experienced  investigational overdoses between january   and february    there is no documentation to show that you have implemented corrective actions during this time period to ensure the safety and welfare of subjects” the fda also observed that burzynski had denied patients informed consent by not informing them of extra costs that they might incur during treatment and that he could not account for his stock of the investigational drug lastly the fda observed your  tumor measurements initially recorded on worksheets at baseline and onstudy treatment  studies for all study subjects were destroyed and are not available for fda inspectional review meaning that there was no way for the fda to verify either initial tumor sizes or effects that the antineoplastons may have had in burzynskis written response to the  fda investigation he states that the investigators complied with all criteria for evaluation of response and made accurate assessments for tumor response in december  the fda issued two warning letters one to the burzynski institutional review board and one to burzynski the subjects of the investigations in february the fda found that burzynski and the irb had largely failed to address the concerns identified in the initial observation reports the letter to burzynski noted serious problems with patient medical files with respect to a pediatric patient who died while treated by burzynski and whose death apparently initiated the investigation on march   usa today reported that the fda had decided to permit a handful of cancer patients to receive burzynskis treatment provided that the patients did not receive the treatment directly from him david gorski wrote in  that over four decades the fda and state medical boards have been unable to shut down burzynkskis business selling unproven treatments – these organizations are supposed to protect the public from practitioners like burzynski but all too often they fail at their charges in this case spectacularly the burzynski clinic has also made use of compassionate use exemptions according to an investigative report by stat news published in august  the clinic has benefited by political lobbying of burzynskis supporters including the families of patients with terminal diagnoses according to fda documents obtained by stat from  to   members of congress wrote to the fda about burzynski … most of the lawmakers asked the agency to grant constituents compassionate use exemptions so that they could try his unapproved drugs or to allow his clinical trials to proceed according to burzynski interventions by lawmakers were helpful however appeals to the fda compassionate use exemptions are not always successful in one case burzynski said he used a texas state law to circumvent the agency and start treatment critics state that the congressional advocacy risks giving the terminally ill and their families a false sense of hope while also conferring a measure of legitimacy on him that many believe he does not deserve texas medical board in december  the use of chemotherapeutic agents by the clinic has been characterized as random and their use of unapproved combinations with no known benefits but clear harms by the texas medical board which regulates and licenses physicians in the state of texas led to a case against burzynski by that board burzynski was acquitted because he had not personally written the prescriptions in july  the board filed a page complaint against burzynski to the texas state office of administrative hearings the complaint addressed allegations by the board including misleading patients into paying exorbitant charges misrepresenting unlicensed persons to patients as licensed medical doctors––– and misleading patients into accepting care from providers without significant education or training related to cancer treatment citing examples of problems with  patients which were listed in the document the board said that unapproved combinations of highly toxic chemotherapy were prescribed in ways that caused harm to several patients in july  burzynskis counsel richard jaffe withdrew from the case citing a potential conflict of interest a result of jaffe pursuing actions against burzynski in bankruptcy court with the addition of replacement counsel the hearing was set to begin in november  in november  the texas medical board took burzynski to court in houston texas burzynski was accused of baitandswitch tactics improperly charging patients not informing patients that he owns the pharmacy they were required to use to fill their medications and of offlabel prescribing of drugs burzynskis former attorney richard jaffe has filed suit in federal court claiming unpaid legal fees of over  burzynski through his current attorney denied all charges on march   the texas medical board sanctioned burzynski placing him on probation and fining him  staff recommendations had been more punitive probation terms included additional medical training disclosure of the boards ruling to patients and medical facilities and monitoring of his patient records lawsuits in  a court found against burzynski in a case of insurance fraud according to the smu law review burzynski was found to have defrauded an erisa health insurance fund by billing it for unapproved treatment with antineoplastons in violation of the terms of the health plan it covered in december  the texas state board of medical examiners filed a multicount complaint against burzynski for failure to meet state medical standards this suit was eventually withdrawn in november  after the judge allowed burzynski to repudiate responsibility for the actions of staff at the clinic an appeal against the advertising restrictions on the grounds of free speech was denied on the basis that this was commercial speech promoting an unlawful activity in january  lola quinlan an elderly stage iv cancer patient sued burzynski for using false and misleading tactics to swindle her out of  she also sued his companies the burzynski clinic the burzynski research institute and southern family pharmacy in harris county court she sued for negligence negligent misrepresentation fraud deceptive trade and conspiracy legal threats to online critics in november  a music writer and editor for the british newspaper the observer sought help raising £ to have his yearold niece who was diagnosed with glioma treated at the burzynski clinic several bloggers reported other cases of patients who had spent similar amounts of money on the treatment and had died and challenged the validity of burzynskis treatments marc stephens identifying himself as a representative of the burzynski clinic sent emails accusing them of libel and demanding that coverage of burzynski be removed from their sites one of the bloggers who received threatening emails from stephens was rhys morgan a yearold sixthform student from cardiff wales at the time previously noted for exposing the miracle mineral supplement another was andy lewis a skeptic and publisher of the quackometer blog following the publicity fallout resulting from the legal threats made by stephens against the bloggers the burzynski clinic issued a press release on november   confirming that the clinic had hired stephens to provide web optimization services and to attempt to stop the dissemination of false and inaccurate information concerning dr burzynski and the clinic apologizing for comments made by stephens to bloggers and for the posting of personal information and announcing that stephens no longer has a professional relationship with the burzynski clinic the story including the threats against the bloggers was covered by the bmj formerly the british medical journal the chief clinician at cancer research uk expressed his concern at the treatment offered and andy lewis of quackometer and science writer simon singh who had previously been sued by the british chiropractic association said that english libel law harms public discussion of science and medicine and thus public health in an article in skeptical inquirer published in march  skeptic robert blaskiewicz chronicled the activities by skeptics to investigate and challenge burzynskis claim of cancer treatments he claimed aggressive actions by burzynskis supporters toward the critics including contacting their employers lodging complaints to state licensing boards and defamation blaskiewicz pointedly indicated that although burzynski had dismissed marc stephens his clinic has not retracted the warnings of the possibility of lawsuits against critics that it is a threat that hangs over all of these activists every day media and commentary in  eric merola an art director of television commercials released a film titled burzynski cancer is serious business that promotes the clinics claims and describes burzynskis use of antineoplastons and his legal clashes with government agencies and regulators in march  merola released a followup movie to cancer is serious business the village voice commented that the first movie violates every basic rule of ethical filmmaking and that by interviewing only burzynskis supporters the films producer is either unusually credulous or doesnt understand the difference between a documentary and an advertisement variety described the film as having the qualities of a paranoid conspiracy theory and likened it to the national enquirer adding that the films explanatory diagrams are simplistic to the point of idiocy the variety review concluded that despite its infotainment look burzynski ultimately proves convincing in april  burzynski received the pigasus award which is bestowed each april fools day by the james randi educational foundation jref to honor the five worst offenders who are intentionally or unintentionally peddling harmful paranormal and pseudoscientific nonsense the foundation cited as the basis for the award the high cost of antineoplaston treatments the lack of controlled trials demonstrating efficacy the lack of fda approval on the treatments the lack of published final results of any single clinical trial and the existence of fda warning letters concerning research method safety and possible rules violations impacting patient safety in june  the bbcs panorama explored burzynski in a documentary titled curing cancer or selling hope to the vulnerable and argued burzynski exploits a legal loophole by treating patients with antineoplastons as part of a clinical trial so the drug does not need a licence for twenty years the clinic complained to the office of communications ofcom about the documentary but the complaint was not upheld in november  an investigative report in usa today by liz szabo accused burzynski of selling false hope to families for years in an interview with reporting on health szabo said that her interest in reporting on burzynski was sparked when she emailed him with questions asking for a response to a book critical of him and received a legal warning letter from his attorneys in reply in august  burzynski was listed by the houston press as number  on a list of the  most embarrassing

burzynski research institute inc jump to navigation search the burzynski clinic is a medical clinic in texas united states founded in  and offering unproven cancer treatment it is best known for the controversial antineoplaston therapy a chemotherapy using compounds it calls antineoplastons devised by the clinics founder stanislaw burzynski in the s there is no accepted scientific evidence of benefit from antineoplaston combinations for various diseases the clinic has been the focus of criticism primarily due to the way its antineoplaston therapy is promoted the costs for people with cancer participating in trials of antineoplastons problems with the way these trials are run and legal cases brought as a result of the sale of the therapy without state board approval contents  stanislaw burzynski  antineoplaston therapy  clinical trials  efficacy  cost  legal issues  fda warnings  texas medical board  lawsuits  legal threats to online critics  media and commentary  references  further reading  external links stanislaw burzynski burzynski was born on january   in lublin poland he graduated from the medical academy in lublin the following year he earned a phd in biochemistry burzynski moved to the united states in  working at baylor college until  when he established the burzynski research laboratory where he administered antineoplaston therapy initially to  patients but then more widely as experimental treatment this opened him up to charges of unethical conduct and to the suspicion he had become a merchant of false hope which led to several instances of media controversy burzynski founded the burzynski research institute in  his scientific papers have caused academic controversy with reviewers disputing the design of the trials and scientific validity of the published results in february  following lengthy hearings the texas medical board recommended burzynskis medical license be revoked with the revocation suspended and a fine of  for billing irregularities and other violations antineoplaston therapy antineoplaston is a name coined by burzynski for a group of peptides peptide derivatives and mixtures that he uses as an alternative cancer treatment the word is derived from neoplasm antineoplaston therapy has been offered in the us since  but is not approved for general use the compounds are not licensed as drugs but are instead sold and administered as part of clinical trials at the burzynski clinic and the burzynski research institute burzynski stated that he began investigating the use of antineoplastons after detecting what he considered significant differences in the presence of peptides between the blood of cancer patients and a control group he first identified antineoplastons from human blood since similar peptides had been isolated from urine early batches of burzynskis treatment were isolated from urine burzynski has since produced the compounds synthetically the first active peptide fraction identified was called antineoplaston a phenylacetylaminopiperidinedione from a antineoplaston as was derived – a  mixture of phenylacetic acid and phenylacetylglutamine the burzynski clinic website states that the active ingredient of antineoplaston ai is phenylacetylglutamine since  the clinic has marketed itself as offering personalized genetargeted cancer therapy which has stirred further controversy as the treatment bears no relationship to genetargeted therapy and only superficially incorporates elements of personalized medicine the clinics version of personalized medicine bears little resemblance to targeted cancer therapy as the clinic includes chemotherapy drugs and antineoplastons are part of this treatment clinical trials for definitions of clinical trial phases see clinical trial according to the national cancer institute as of april  no phase iii randomized controlled trials of antineoplastons as a treatment for cancer have been conducted publications have taken the form of case reports phase i clinical trials toxicity studies and phase ii clinical trials and for the most part these publications have been authored by the developer of the therapy dr burzynski in conjunction with his associates at the burzynski clinic although these studies often report remissions other investigators have not been successful in duplicating these results from  to  the nci initiated multiple phase ii trials of antineoplastons in  after over  million had been spent on these trials they were stopped before the effectiveness of antineoplastons could be determined since the mids burzynski registered some sixty clinical trials of antineoplastons and in december  a phase iii trial which did not open for patient recruitment burzynski has not published full results for any of these according to his lawyer richard jaffe  burzynski personally put together seventytwo protocols to treat every type of cancer the clinic had treated and everything burzynski wanted to treat in the future  we heard that the fda had to put together a fiftyperson task force to review all of the protocols burzynski submitted all trials were paused no new patients allowed following a  fda inspections which found for the third consecutive time significant issues with his institutional review board and according to papers published in november  substantial issues with the conduct of both the clinic and burzynski as principal investigator efficacy although burzynski and his associates claim success in the use of antineoplaston combinations for the treatment of various diseases and some of the clinics patients say they have been helped there is no evidence of the clinical efficacy of these methods the consensus among the professional community as represented by the american cancer society and cancer research uk among others is that antineoplaston therapy is unproven and the overall probability of the treatment turning out to be as claimed is low due to lack of credible mechanisms and the poor state of research after more than  years of investigation while the antineoplaston therapy is marketed as a nontoxic alternative to chemotherapy it is a form of chemotherapy with significant known side effects including severe neurotoxicity independent scientists have been unable to reproduce the positive results reported in burzynskis studies nci observed that researchers other than burzynski and his associates have not been successful in duplicating his results and cancer research uk states that available scientific evidence does not support claims that antineoplaston therapy is effective in treating or preventing cancer there is no convincing evidence from randomized controlled trials in the scientific literature that antineoplastons are useful treatments of cancer and the us food and drug administration fda has not approved these products for the treatment of any disease the american cancer society has stated since  that there is no evidence that antineoplastons have any beneficial effects in cancer and recommended that people do not buy these products since there could be serious health consequences a  medical review described antineoplaston treatment as a disproven therapy in  three oncologists were enlisted by the weekly washington newsletter the cancer letter to conduct independent reviews of burzynskis clinical trial research on antineoplastons they concluded that the studies were poorly designed not interpretable and so flawed that it cannot be determined whether it really works one of them characterized the research as scientific nonsense in addition to questioning burzynskis research methods the oncologists found significant and possibly lifethreatening toxicity in some patients treated with antineoplastons the memorial sloankettering cancer center has stated bottom line there is no clear evidence to support the anticancer effects of antineoplastons in humans cost according to the american cancer society treatment can cost from  to  per month or more depending on the type of treatment number of consultations and the need for surgery to implant a catheter for drug delivery available information suggests that health insurance plans often do not reimburse costs linked to this treatment as of march  the burzynski clinic required patients to provide a deposit before treatment starts and their website informed patients that since we are classified as out of network we are unable to accept medicare medicaid and any hmo insurance legal issues fda warnings burzynskis use and advertising of antineoplastons as an unapproved cancer therapy were deemed to be unlawful by the us fda and the texas attorney general and limits on the sale and advertising of the treatment were imposed as a result in  the fda issued a warning letter to the burzynski research institute stating that an investigation had determined the burzynski institutional review board irb did not adhere to the applicable statutory requirements and fda regulations governing the protection of human subjects it identified a number of specific findings among them that the irb had approved research without ensuring risk to patients was minimized had failed to prepare required written procedures or retain required documentation and had failed to conduct required continuing reviews for studies among others the institute was given fifteen days to identify the steps it would take to prevent future violations another warning issued in october  notes that the burzynski clinic is advertising investigational drugs as being safe and effective noting promotion of an investigational new drug is prohibited under fda regulations at  cfr a which states a sponsor or investigator or any person acting on behalf of a  sponsor or investigator shall not represent in a promotional context that an investigational new drug is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is under investigation or otherwise promote the drug this provision is not intended to restrict the full exchange of scientific information concerning the drug including dissemination of scientific findings in scientific or lay media rather its intent is to restrict promotional claims of safety or effectiveness of the drug for a use for which it is under investigation and to preclude commercialization of the drug before it is approved for commercial distribution the websites including the posted press releases and embedded videos contain claims such as the following that promote antineoplastons as safe andor effective for the purposes for which they are being investigated or otherwise promote the drugs  since antineoplastons are investigational new drugs the products indications warnings precautions adverse reactions and dosage and administration have not been established and are unknown at this time promoting antineoplastons as safe and effective for the purposes for which they are under investigation by making representations such as those noted above is in violation of  cfr a — fda enforcement letter original the letter requires cessation of noncompliant promotional activities including use of testimonials and promotional interviews with burzynski himself in june  antineoplaston trials were paused following the death of a child patient in january and february  the fda inspected burzynski and his irb in houston in december  the fda issued its findings in warning letters to burzynski expressing concerns about subject safety and data integrity as well as concerns about the adequacy of safeguards in place at your site to protect patients in november  the fda released the observational notes from an inspection of burzynski as a principal investigator that took place between january and march  among the findings were “failure to comply with protocol requirements related to the primary outcome therapeutic response  for  of study subjects reviewed during the inspection” admitting patients who failed to meet inclusion criteria failing to stop treatment when patients had severe toxic reactions to antineoplastons and failure to report all adverse events further the fda told burzynski you failed to protect the rights safety and welfare of subjects under your care fortyeight  subjects experienced  investigational overdoses between january   and february    there is no documentation to show that you have implemented corrective actions during this time period to ensure the safety and welfare of subjects” the fda also observed that burzynski had denied patients informed consent by not informing them of extra costs that they might incur during treatment and that he could not account for his stock of the investigational drug lastly the fda observed your  tumor measurements initially recorded on worksheets at baseline and onstudy treatment  studies for all study subjects were destroyed and are not available for fda inspectional review meaning that there was no way for the fda to verify either initial tumor sizes or effects that the antineoplastons may have had in burzynskis written response to the  fda investigation he states that the investigators complied with all criteria for evaluation of response and made accurate assessments for tumor response in december  the fda issued two warning letters one to the burzynski institutional review board and one to burzynski the subjects of the investigations in february the fda found that burzynski and the irb had largely failed to address the concerns identified in the initial observation reports the letter to burzynski noted serious problems with patient medical files with respect to a pediatric patient who died while treated by burzynski and whose death apparently initiated the investigation on march   usa today reported that the fda had decided to permit a handful of cancer patients to receive burzynskis treatment provided that the patients did not receive the treatment directly from him david gorski wrote in  that over four decades the fda and state medical boards have been unable to shut down burzynkskis business selling unproven treatments – these organizations are supposed to protect the public from practitioners like burzynski but all too often they fail at their charges in this case spectacularly the burzynski clinic has also made use of compassionate use exemptions according to an investigative report by stat news published in august  the clinic has benefited by political lobbying of burzynskis supporters including the families of patients with terminal diagnoses according to fda documents obtained by stat from  to   members of congress wrote to the fda about burzynski … most of the lawmakers asked the agency to grant constituents compassionate use exemptions so that they could try his unapproved drugs or to allow his clinical trials to proceed according to burzynski interventions by lawmakers were helpful however appeals to the fda compassionate use exemptions are not always successful in one case burzynski said he used a texas state law to circumvent the agency and start treatment critics state that the congressional advocacy risks giving the terminally ill and their families a false sense of hope while also conferring a measure of legitimacy on him that many believe he does not deserve texas medical board in december  the use of chemotherapeutic agents by the clinic has been characterized as random and their use of unapproved combinations with no known benefits but clear harms by the texas medical board which regulates and licenses physicians in the state of texas led to a case against burzynski by that board burzynski was acquitted because he had not personally written the prescriptions in july  the board filed a page complaint against burzynski to the texas state office of administrative hearings the complaint addressed allegations by the board including misleading patients into paying exorbitant charges misrepresenting unlicensed persons to patients as licensed medical doctors––– and misleading patients into accepting care from providers without significant education or training related to cancer treatment citing examples of problems with  patients which were listed in the document the board said that unapproved combinations of highly toxic chemotherapy were prescribed in ways that caused harm to several patients in july  burzynskis counsel richard jaffe withdrew from the case citing a potential conflict of interest a result of jaffe pursuing actions against burzynski in bankruptcy court with the addition of replacement counsel the hearing was set to begin in november  in november  the texas medical board took burzynski to court in houston texas burzynski was accused of baitandswitch tactics improperly charging patients not informing patients that he owns the pharmacy they were required to use to fill their medications and of offlabel prescribing of drugs burzynskis former attorney richard jaffe has filed suit in federal court claiming unpaid legal fees of over  burzynski through his current attorney denied all charges on march   the texas medical board sanctioned burzynski placing him on probation and fining him  staff recommendations had been more punitive probation terms included additional medical training disclosure of the boards ruling to patients and medical facilities and monitoring of his patient records lawsuits in  a court found against burzynski in a case of insurance fraud according to the smu law review burzynski was found to have defrauded an erisa health insurance fund by billing it for unapproved treatment with antineoplastons in violation of the terms of the health plan it covered in december  the texas state board of medical examiners filed a multicount complaint against burzynski for failure to meet state medical standards this suit was eventually withdrawn in november  after the judge allowed burzynski to repudiate responsibility for the actions of staff at the clinic an appeal against the advertising restrictions on the grounds of free speech was denied on the basis that this was commercial speech promoting an unlawful activity in january  lola quinlan an elderly stage iv cancer patient sued burzynski for using false and misleading tactics to swindle her out of  she also sued his companies the burzynski clinic the burzynski research institute and southern family pharmacy in harris county court she sued for negligence negligent misrepresentation fraud deceptive trade and conspiracy legal threats to online critics in november  a music writer and editor for the british newspaper the observer sought help raising £ to have his yearold niece who was diagnosed with glioma treated at the burzynski clinic several bloggers reported other cases of patients who had spent similar amounts of money on the treatment and had died and challenged the validity of burzynskis treatments marc stephens identifying himself as a representative of the burzynski clinic sent emails accusing them of libel and demanding that coverage of burzynski be removed from their sites one of the bloggers who received threatening emails from stephens was rhys morgan a yearold sixthform student from cardiff wales at the time previously noted for exposing the miracle mineral supplement another was andy lewis a skeptic and publisher of the quackometer blog following the publicity fallout resulting from the legal threats made by stephens against the bloggers the burzynski clinic issued a press release on november   confirming that the clinic had hired stephens to provide web optimization services and to attempt to stop the dissemination of false and inaccurate information concerning dr burzynski and the clinic apologizing for comments made by stephens to bloggers and for the posting of personal information and announcing that stephens no longer has a professional relationship with the burzynski clinic the story including the threats against the bloggers was covered by the bmj formerly the british medical journal the chief clinician at cancer research uk expressed his concern at the treatment offered and andy lewis of quackometer and science writer simon singh who had previously been sued by the british chiropractic association said that english libel law harms public discussion of science and medicine and thus public health in an article in skeptical inquirer published in march  skeptic robert blaskiewicz chronicled the activities by skeptics to investigate and challenge burzynskis claim of cancer treatments he claimed aggressive actions by burzynskis supporters toward the critics including contacting their employers lodging complaints to state licensing boards and defamation blaskiewicz pointedly indicated that although burzynski had dismissed marc stephens his clinic has not retracted the warnings of the possibility of lawsuits against critics that it is a threat that hangs over all of these activists every day media and commentary in  eric merola an art director of television commercials released a film titled burzynski cancer is serious business that promotes the clinics claims and describes burzynskis use of antineoplastons and his legal clashes with government agencies and regulators in march  merola released a followup movie to cancer is serious business the village voice commented that the first movie violates every basic rule of ethical filmmaking and that by interviewing only burzynskis supporters the films producer is either unusually credulous or doesnt understand the difference between a documentary and an advertisement variety described the film as having the qualities of a paranoid conspiracy theory and likened it to the national enquirer adding that the films explanatory diagrams are simplistic to the point of idiocy the variety review concluded that despite its infotainment look burzynski ultimately proves convincing in april  burzynski received the pigasus award which is bestowed each april fools day by the james randi educational foundation jref to honor the five worst offenders who are intentionally or unintentionally peddling harmful paranormal and pseudoscientific nonsense the foundation cited as the basis for the award the high cost of antineoplaston treatments the lack of controlled trials demonstrating efficacy the lack of fda approval on the treatments the lack of published final results of any single clinical trial and the existence of fda warning letters concerning research method safety and possible rules violations impacting patient safety in june  the bbcs panorama explored burzynski in a documentary titled curing cancer or selling hope to the vulnerable and argued burzynski exploits a legal loophole by treating patients with antineoplastons as part of a clinical trial so the drug does not need a licence for twenty years the clinic complained to the office of communications ofcom about the documentary but the complaint was not upheld in november  an investigative report in usa today by liz szabo accused burzynski of selling false hope to families for years in an interview with reporting on health szabo said that her interest in reporting on burzynski was sparked when she emailed him with questions asking for a response to a book critical of him and received a legal warning letter from his attorneys in reply in august  burzynski was listed by the houston press as number  on a list of the  most embarrassing
