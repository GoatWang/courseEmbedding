antitheft technology product genotyping and product authentication solutions released results from a recently commissioned survey of over  americans regarding their attitudes toward misleadinglylabeled aloe vera products and the importance of products with forensically verified ingredientskey findings include percent of americans said they would be more likely to buy an aloe vera product that has ingredients that have been forensically verified over a product that did not  percent of americans said they would not be likely to buy an aloe vera product they were planning to buy if they heard or read that it did not in reality contain any aloe vera percent of americans would be willing to pay more for an aloe vera product made with forensically verified ingredients versus one that is not percent of americans indicated willingness to pay more for an aloe vera product that is ethically sourced versus one that is notthe survey was conducted online by harris poll on behalf of applied dna sciences in response to recent revelations that many consumer products claiming to contain aloe vera do not in reality contain measurable amounts of this ingredient bloomberg aloe vera articledr james hayward president and ceo of applied dna said no consumer wants to be cheated with independent laboratory studies revealing scant evidence of aloe vera within a range of consumer products prominently featuring this ingredient on their labels there is clearly a need for better verification techniques our verification methods in aloe or food supplements are a natural extension of our work in cotton and offer an ideal way to help manufacturers protect their brands and supply chain while benefitting consumers and retailers alikescientists can identify ingredients  including aloe vera  using unique gene sequences known as the bar code of life bcol but these sequences are subject to degradation during harsh processing and can be easily lost or damaged when a product is manufacturedin comparison applied dna sciences signature® molecular tagging is much more stable the tags are combined with the aloe vera during the manufacturing process the tags meet the fda guidance for physical chemical identifiers that can be added to foods or drugs and can be ingested by consumers preliminary studies conducted by the company suggest that in contrast to bcol sequences signature molecular tags survive in finished goods and can be detected even after dilution from their original concentration by one millionfold proof that aloe vera is contained in the product to review findings click herequality control laboratories can now use the signature platform to prove the presence of key ingredients such as aloe vera unlike the bcol signature molecular tags are not restricted to biological materials and can also be used to tag nonbiological materials by using signature tags and forensic knowledge brands and retailers can protect their reputations and attract the high percentage of consumers indicated by the survey results who value and would be prepared to pay more for products with forensicallyverified ingredientsapplied dnas solutions have helped consumer
