well as the assumptions on which such statements are based and generally are identified by the use of words such as “may” “will” “seeks” “anticipates” “believes” “estimates” “expects” “plans” “intends” “should” or similar expressions actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forwardlooking statements further forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we undertake no obligation to update or revise forwardlooking statements to reflect changed assumptions the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time unless required by law the following are some of the risks and uncertainties although not all of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forwardlooking statements • all of our executive officers and some of our directors and other key real estate and debt finance professionals are also officers directors managers key professionals andor holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in our advisor the entity that acted as our dealer manager andor other kbsaffiliated entities as a result they face conflicts of interest including significant conflicts created by our advisor’s compensation arrangements with us and other kbssponsored programs and kbsadvised investors and conflicts in allocating time among us and these other programs and investors these conflicts could result in unanticipated actions • we pay substantial fees to and expenses of our advisor and its affiliates these payments increase the risk that our stockholders will not earn a profit on their investment in us and increase the risk of loss to our stockholders • we have used proceeds from financings when necessary to fund a portion of our distributions during our operational stage we currently expect that our distributions will generally be paid from cash flow from operations and funds from operations from current or prior periods we also expect to fund other distributions from the net proceeds from the sale of real estate and from the receipt of principal payments from or the sale of our real estaterelated loan receivable we can give no assurance regarding the timing amount or source of future distributions • we depend on tenants for the revenue generated by our real estate investments and accordingly the revenue generated by our real estate investments is dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants revenues from our properties could decrease due to a reduction in occupancy caused by factors including but not limited to tenant defaults tenant insolvency early termination of tenant leases and nonrenewal of existing tenant leases andor lower rental rates making it more difficult for us to meet our debt service obligations and limiting our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders • our investments in real estate and our mortgage loan may be affected by unfavorable real estate market and general economic conditions which could decrease the value of those assets and reduce the investment return to our stockholders revenues from our properties and the property and other assets directly securing our loan investment could decrease such events would make it more difficult for the borrower under our loan investment to meet its payment obligations to us it could also make it more difficult for us to meet our debt service obligations and limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders • disruptions in the financial markets and uncertain economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy and generate returns to our stockholders • certain of our debt obligations have variable interest rates and related payments that vary with the movement of libor or other indexes increases in these indexes could increase the amount of our debt payments and limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders • our share redemption program provides only for redemptions sought upon a stockholder’s death “qualifying disability” or “determination of incompetence” each as defined in the share redemption program document and together with redemptions sought in connection with a stockholder’s death “special redemptions” the dollar amounts available for such redemptions are determined by the board of directors and may be reviewed and adjusted from time to time additionally redemptions are further subject to limitations described in our share redemption program we currently do not expect to have funds available for ordinary redemptions in the future • since we have terminated our dividend reinvestment plan we may have to use a greater proportion of our cash flow from operations to meet cash requirements for general corporate purposes including but not limited to capital expenditures tenant improvement costs and leasing costs related to our real estate properties reserves required by financings of our real estate properties the repayment of debt and special redemptions under our share redemption program this may reduce cash available for distributions  table of

general and administrative expenses which are not directly related to the size of our portfolio have increased significantly as a percentage of our cash flow from operations and will continue to increase to the extent we sell additional assets • although the special committee defined below has engaged a financial advisor to assist with the exploration of strategic alternatives for us we are not obligated to enter into any particular transaction or any transaction at all further although we have begun the process of exploring strategic alternatives and are marketing some of our assets for sale there is no assurance that this process will result in stockholder liquidity or provide a return to stockholders that equals or exceeds our estimated value per share we do not expect to provide

the “company” was formed on july   as a maryland corporation that elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust “reit” beginning with the taxable year ended december   and it intends to continue to operate in such a manner the company invested in a diverse portfolio of real estate and real estaterelated investments as used herein the terms “we” “our” and “us” refer to the company and as required by context kbs limited partnership ii a delaware limited partnership the “operating partnership” and their subsidiaries we conduct our business primarily through our operating partnership of which we are the sole general partner subject to certain restrictions and limitations our business is managed by kbs capital advisors llc “kbs capital advisors” our external advisor pursuant to an advisory agreement kbs capital advisors conducts our operations and manages our portfolio of real estate and real estaterelated investments our advisor owns  shares of our common stock we have no paid employees on september   we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” to offer a maximum of  shares of common stock for sale to the public of which  shares were registered in our primary offering and  shares were registered under our dividend reinvestment plan we ceased offering shares of common stock in our primary offering on december   we sold  shares of common stock in the primary offering for gross offering proceeds of  billion  we terminated the offering under our dividend reinvestment plan effective may   we sold  shares of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of  million also as of december    we had redeemed  of the shares sold in our offering for  million  as of december    we owned  real estate properties consisting of  office properties and an office campus consisting of eight office buildings and one real estate loan receivable on january   our board of directors formed a special committee the “special committee” composed of all of our independent directors to explore the availability of strategic alternatives involving us as part of the process of exploring strategic alternatives on february   the special committee engaged evercore group llc “evercore” to act as our financial advisor and to assist us and the special committee with this process under the terms of the engagement evercore provided various financial advisory services as requested by the special committee as customary for an engagement in connection with exploring strategic alternatives although the special committee has engaged evercore to assist us and the special committee with the exploration of strategic alternatives for us we are not obligated to enter into any particular transaction or any transaction at all while the special committee continues to explore strategic alternatives for us the special committee has determined that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders to market some of our assets for sale based on the results of this sales effort the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders to sell one or more of our assets and depending on the scope of the proposed asset sales thereafter to adopt a plan of liquidation that would involve the sale of our remaining assets in the event of such a determination the proposed plan of liquidation would be presented to our stockholders for approval alternatively based on the results of the initial sales effort the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders for us to engage in a limited number of asset sales and continue to operate as a going concern but with a portfolio that is smaller than the present portfolio although we have begun the process of exploring strategic alternatives and are marketing some of our assets for sale there is no assurance that this process will result in stockholder liquidity or provide a return to stockholders that equals or exceeds our estimated value per share our focus in  is to continue to strategically sell assets and consider special distributions to stockholders negotiate lease renewals or new leases that facilitate the sales process and enhance property stability for prospective buyers complete capital projects such as renovations or amenity enhancements to attract quality buyers and finalize the strategic alternatives assessment and decide on a course of action  table of contents objectives and strategies our primary investment objectives are • to provide our stockholders with attractive and stable cash distributions and • to preserve and return our stockholders’ capital contributions we have sought and will seek to achieve these objectives by managing our portfolio of real estate and real estaterelated investments which we acquired using a combination of equity raised in our initial public offering and debt financing we diversified our portfolio by investment size investment type investment risk and geographic region real estate portfolio real estate investments we made investments in core properties which are generally lower risk existing properties with at least  occupancy and minimal nearterm lease rollover as of december    our portfolio of real estate properties was composed of ten office properties and an office campus consisting of eight office buildings encompassing  million rentable square feet all of our properties are located in the united states we originally intended to hold our core properties for four to seven years however economic and market conditions may influence us to hold our investments for different periods of time and we currently expect our hold period for the majority of our remaining properties may last for a few more years our advisor has developed a welldefined exit strategy for each of our investments specifically our advisor assigned a sell date to each asset we acquired prior to its purchase as part of the original business plan for the asset kbs capital advisors continually performs a holdsell analysis on each asset in order to determine a reasonable time to sell the asset and generate a strong return for our stockholders periodic reviews of each asset focus on the remaining available value enhancement opportunities for the asset and the demand for the asset in the marketplace we may sell an asset before the end of the expected holding period if we believe that market conditions and asset positioning have maximized its value to us or the sale of the asset would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders  table of contents the following charts illustrate the geographic

annualized contractual base rental income as of december    adjusted to straightline any contractual tenant concessions including free rent rent increases and rent decreases from the lease’s inception through the balance of the lease term we have a stable tenant base and we have tried to diversify our tenant base in order to limit exposure to any one tenant or industry as of december    our portfolio of real estate properties was  occupied one tenant leasing space in our portfolio of real estate properties represented more than  of our total annualized base rent see item  “properties —

revenues for the years ended december     and   respectively  table of contents real estaterelated investment as of december    we owned one fixedrate mortgage loan we originally intended to hold our real estaterelated investment until maturity however economic and market conditions may influence us to hold it for a different period of time we may sell our mortgage loan before the end of the expected holding period if we believe that market conditions and asset positioning have maximized its value to us or the sale of the asset would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders

majority of our real estate and real estaterelated investments with a combination of the proceeds we received from our initial public offering and debt we used debt financing to increase the amount available for investment and to increase overall investment yields to us and our stockholders as of december    the weightedaverage interest rate on our debt was  we borrow funds at both fixed and variable rates as of december    we had  million and  million of fixed and variable rate debt outstanding respectively of the variable rate debt outstanding approximately  million was effectively fixed through the use of interest rate swap agreements the weightedaverage interest rates of our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt as of december   were  and  respectively the weightedaverage interest rate represents the actual interest rate in effect as of december   consisting of the contractual interest rate and the effect of interest rate swaps and floors using interest rate indices as of december    where applicable the following is a schedule of maturities including principal amortization payments for all of our notes payable outstanding as of december   in thousands                        we plan to exercise our extension options available under our loan agreements or payoff or refinance the related notes payable prior to their maturity dates we limit our total liabilities to  of the cost before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves of all of our tangible assets however we may exceed that limit if the majority of the conflicts committee approves each borrowing in excess of this limitation and we disclose such borrowings to our stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing we did not exceed this limitation on borrowings during any quarter of  as of december    our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately  of both the cost before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves and book value before deducting depreciation of our tangible assets respectively market outlook  real estate and real estate finance markets the following discussion is based on management’s beliefs observations and expectations with respect to the real estate and real estate finance markets conditions in the global capital markets remain volatile as of the first quarter of  current economic data and financial market developments suggest that the global economy is improving although at a slow and uneven pace european economic growth has recently picked up whereas the uk and china remain areas of concern against this backdrop the central banks of the world’s major industrialized economies are beginning to back away from their strong monetary accommodation quantitative easing in japan and europe is slowing but the liquidity generated from these programs continues to impact the global capital markets  table of contents at a duration of  months as of yearend  the current business cycle which commenced in june  is the fourth longest in us history including the postworld war ii cycle which lasted  months in december  the us federal reserve the “fed” increased interest rates for the second time since the  financial crisis expectations are for the rate increases to continue in the wake of ongoing economic growth and some acceleration in inflationary pressures with the goal of the fed to normalize the level of interest rates little in the us macroeconomic data suggests that the economy is growing too rapidly the primary symptom of trouble ahead for a business cycle real gross domestic product “gdp” growth has averaged approximately  per year over the past two years and job growth has averaged about  personal income growth has started to pick up and unemployment statistics indicate that labor force conditions are finally showing real improvements the us commercial real estate market continues to benefit from inflows of foreign capital particularly from china with a backdrop of global political conflict and stabilizing international economic conditions the us dollar has remained a safe haven currency the volume of available capital that is seeking “core” properties has helped to push the pricing of some assets past prior peaks making some markets look expensive reduced leverage ratios have shifted more risk toward the equity investor traditional sources of capital are favoring a “riskoff” approach where investors’ appetite for risk falls when valuing investments investors acquiring properties are extremely selective with cap rate compression having spread into secondary markets over the last two years commercial real estate returns are increasingly being driven by property income yield as opposed to price appreciation through cap rate compression lenders with long memories remain disciplined in their underwriting of investments for balance sheet lenders such as banks and insurance companies underwriting standards for commercial real estate have been tightened this has resulted in lower loantovalue and higher debt coverage ratios cmbs originations also have been limited as lenders are attempting to adjust to new securitization rules which require issuers to maintain an ongoing equity stake in pooled transactions these trends have led to increased uncertainty in the level and cost of debt for commercial properties and in turn has injected some volatility into commercial real estate markets a major factor contributing to the strength of the real estate cycle is the difficulty of securing construction financing lack of construction financing is effectively keeping an oversupply of commercial real estate which is typical late in a real estate cycle from emerging bank regulators and new riskbased capital guidelines have enforced discipline in lending which has helped reduce new construction impact on our real estate investments the volatility in the global financial markets continues to cause a level of uncertainty in our outlook for the performance of the us commercial real estate markets both the investing and leasing environments are highly competitive while foreign capital continues to flow into us real estate markets the uncertainty regarding the political regulatory and economic environments has introduced uncertainty into the markets possible future declines in rental rates slower or potentially negative net absorption of leased space and expectations of future rental concessions including free rent to renew tenants early to retain tenants who are up for renewal or to attract new tenants may result in decreases in cash flows historically low interest rates could help offset some of the impact of these potential decreases in operating cash flow for properties financed with variable rate mortgages however interest rates in the united states have started to increase the fed increased interest rates in the fourth quarter of  and again in december  the real estate and finance markets anticipate further rate increases as long as the economy remains strong if this trend continues management will review our debt financing strategies to optimize the cost of our debt exposure impact on our real estaterelated investment our real estate loan receivable is directly secured by commercial real estate as a result our real estaterelated investment in general has been and likely will continue to be impacted by the same factors impacting our real estate properties the higher yields and the improving credit position of many us tenants and borrowers have attracted global capital however the real estate and capital markets are fluid and the positive trends can reverse quickly economic conditions remain relatively volatile and can have a negative impact on the performance of collateral securing our loan investment and therefore may impact the ability of the borrower under our loan to make contractual interest payments to us as of december    we had a fixedrate real estate loan receivable with an outstanding principal balance of  million and a carrying value including unamortized origination and closing costs of  million that matures in   table of contents impact on our financing activities in light of the risks associated with potentially volatile operating cash flows from some of our real estate properties and the possible increase in the cost of financing due to higher interest rates we may have difficulty refinancing some of our debt obligations prior to or at maturity or we may not be able to refinance these obligations at terms as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness shortterm interest rates in the united states have increased market conditions can change quickly potentially negatively impacting the value of our investments as of december    we had debt obligations in the aggregate principal amount of  million with a weightedaverage remaining term of  years we had a total of  million of fixed rate notes payable and  million of variable rate notes payable as of december    the interest rates on  million  of our variable rate notes payable are effectively fixed through interest rate swap agreements as of december    we had a total of  million of debt obligations scheduled to mature within  months of that date we plan to exercise our extension options available under our loan agreements or pay off or refinance the related notes payable prior to their maturity dates economic dependency we are dependent on our advisor for certain services that are essential to us including the management of the daily operations of our real estate and real estaterelated investment portfolio the disposition of real estate and real estaterelated investments and other general and administrative responsibilities in the event that our advisor is unable to provide any of these services we will be required to obtain such services from other sources competitive market factors the us commercial real estate leasing markets remain competitive we face competition from various entities for prospective tenants and to retain our current tenants including other reits pension funds insurance companies investment funds and companies partnerships and developers many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant as a result of their greater resources those entities may have more flexibility than we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract and retain tenants this could put pressure on our ability to maintain or raise rents and could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants as a result our financial condition results of operations cash flow ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected we also face competition from many of the types of entities referenced above regarding the disposition of properties these entities may possess properties in similar locations andor of the same property types as ours and may be attempting to dispose of these properties at the same time we are attempting to dispose of some of our properties providing potential purchasers with a larger number of properties from which to choose and potentially decreasing the sales price for such properties additionally these entities may be willing to accept a lower return on their individual investments which could further reduce the sales price of such properties this competition could decrease the sales proceeds we receive for properties that we sell assuming we are able to sell such properties which could adversely affect our cash flows and the overall return for our stockholders although we believe that we are wellpositioned to compete effectively in each facet of our business there is enormous competition in our market sector and there can be no assurance that we will compete effectively or that we will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit our ability to conduct our business effectively  table of contents compliance with federal state and local environmental law under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous real property owner or operator may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property these costs could be substantial such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances environmental laws also may impose liens on properties or restrictions on the manner in which properties may be used or businesses may be operated and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures or prevent us from entering into leases with prospective tenants that may be impacted by such laws environmental laws provide for sanctions for noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or in certain circumstances by private parties certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of and exposure to hazardous substances including asbestoscontaining materials and leadbased paint third parties may seek recovery from real property owners or operators for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances and governments may seek recovery for natural resource damage the cost of defending against claims of environmental liability of complying with environmental regulatory requirements of remediating any contaminated property or of paying personal injury property damage or natural resource damage claims could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders all of our properties were subject to phase i environmental assessments prior to the time they were acquired some of our properties are subject to potential environmental liabilities arising primarily from historic activities at or in the vicinity of the properties based on our environmental diligence and assessments of our properties and our purchase of pollution and remediation legal liability insurance with respect to some of our properties we do not believe that environmental conditions at our properties are likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations industry segments as of december    we aggregated our investments into one reportable business segment we considered both quantitative and qualitative thresholds and determined that our investment in a real estate loan receivable does not constitute a reportable segment prior to the reporting period commencing on january   we had identified two reportable business segments based on our investment types real estate and real estaterelated however based on our current investment portfolio we do not believe that our investment in a real estaterelated investment is a reportable segment employees we have no paid employees the employees of our advisor and its affiliates provide management disposition advisory and certain administrative services for us principal executive office our principal executive offices are located at  newport center drive suite  newport beach ca  our telephone number general facsimile number and website address are     and wwwkbsreitiicom  respectively available information access to copies of our annual reports on form k quarterly reports on form q current reports on form k proxy statements and other filings with the sec including amendments to such filings may be obtained free of charge from the following website wwwkbsreitiicom  or through the sec’s website wwwsecgov  these filings are available promptly after we file them with or furnish them to the sec  table of contents item a risk factors the following are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forwardlooking statements the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face but do represent those risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business risks related to an investment in us because no public trading market for our shares currently exists it will be difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares and if they are able to sell their shares they will likely sell them at a substantial discount to the public offering price adjusted for special distributions and the estimated value per share our charter does not require our directors to seek stockholder approval to liquidate our assets by a specified date nor does our charter require our directors to list our shares for trading on a national securities exchange by a specified date there is no public market for our shares and we currently have no plans to list our shares on a national securities exchange until our shares are listed if ever our stockholders may not sell their shares unless the buyer meets the applicable suitability and minimum purchase standards any sale must comply with applicable state and federal securities laws our charter prohibits the ownership of more than  of our stock by any person unless exempted by our board of directors which may inhibit large investors from purchasing our shares on may   our board of directors amended and restated our share redemption program to provide only for redemptions sought in connection with a special redemption such special redemptions are subject to an annual dollar limitation on december   our board of directors approved an annual dollar limitation of  million in the aggregate for the calendar year  subject to review and adjustment during the year by the board of directors and further subject to the limitations described in the share redemption program we do not currently expect to have funds available for ordinary redemptions in the future thus until further notice and except with respect to special redemptions stockholders will not be able to sell any of their shares back to us pursuant to our share redemption program in addition even if we were to resume ordinary redemptions our share redemption program includes numerous restrictions that would limit a stockholder’s ability to sell his or her shares in its sole discretion our board of directors may amend suspend or terminate our share redemption program upon  days’ notice provided that we may increase or decrease the funding available for the redemption of shares under the program upon ten business days’ notice to stockholders therefore it will be difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares promptly or at all if a stockholder is able to sell his or her shares it would likely be at a substantial discount to the price at which we sold the shares in our public offering adjusted for special distributions and to the estimated value per share it is also likely that our shares would not be accepted as the primary collateral for a loan we face significant competition for tenants and in the disposition of our assets which may limit our ability pay distributions to stockholders or reduce the value of an investment in us we face competition from various entities for prospective tenants and to retain our current tenants including other reits pension funds insurance companies investment funds and companies partnerships and developers many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant as a result of their greater resources those entities may have more flexibility than we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract and retain tenants this could put pressure on our ability to maintain or raise rents and could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants as a result our financial condition results of operations cash flow ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected we also face competition from many of the types of entities referenced above regarding the disposition of properties these entities may possess properties in similar locations andor of the same property types as ours and may be attempting to dispose of these properties at the same time we are attempting to dispose of some of our properties providing potential purchasers with a larger number of properties from which to choose and potentially decreasing the sales price for such properties additionally these entities may be willing to accept a lower return on their individual investments which could further reduce the sales price of such properties this competition could decrease the sales proceeds we receive for properties that we sell assuming we are able to sell such properties which could adversely affect our cash flows and the overall return for our stockholders  table of contents disruptions in the financial markets and uncertain economic conditions could adversely affect market rental rates and commercial real estate values and our ability to refinance or secure debt financing service future debt obligations or pay distributions to our stockholders we relied on debt financing to finance our real estate properties and we may have difficulty refinancing some of our debt obligations prior to or at maturity or we may not be able to refinance these obligations at terms as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness we also may be unable to obtain additional debt financing on attractive terms or at all if we are not able to refinance our existing indebtedness on attractive terms at the various maturity dates we may be forced to dispose of some of our assets volatile market conditions and a challenging global macroeconomic environment may interfere with the implementation of our business strategy andor force us to modify it disruptions in the financial markets and uncertain economic conditions could adversely affect the values of our investments any disruption to the debt and capital markets could result in fewer buyers seeking to acquire commercial properties and possible increases in capitalization rates and lower property values furthermore any decline in economic conditions could negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy lower rental rates and declining values in our real estate portfolio and in the collateral securing our loan investment which could have the following negative effects on us • the values of our investments in commercial properties could decrease below the amounts paid for such investments • the value of collateral securing our loan investment could decrease below the outstanding principal amount of the loan • revenues from our properties could decrease due to fewer tenants andor lower rental rates making it more difficult for us to pay distributions or meet our debt service obligations on debt financing andor • revenues generated by the property and other assets underlying our loan investment could decrease making it more difficult for the borrower to meet its payment obligations to us which could in turn make it more difficult for us to pay distributions or meet our debt service obligations on debt financing • all of these factors could reduce our stockholders’ return and decrease the value of an investment in us because we depend upon our advisor and its affiliates to conduct our operations any adverse changes in the financial health of our advisor or its affiliates or our relationship with them could hinder our operating performance we depend on our advisor to manage our operations and our portfolio of assets our advisor depends upon the fees and other compensation that it receives from us kbs real estate investment trust inc “kbs reit i” kbs real estate investment trust iii inc “kbs reit iii” kbs strategic opportunity reit inc “kbs strategic

relationship with or the financial condition of our advisor and its affiliates could hinder their ability to successfully manage our operations and our portfolio of investments to the extent distributions exceed cash flow from operations a stockholder’s basis in our stock will be reduced and to the extent distributions exceed a stockholder’s basis the stockholder may recognize capital gain our organizational documents permit us to the extent permitted by maryland law to pay distributions from any source  if we fund distributions from financings or future offerings or sources other than our cash flow from operations the overall return to our stockholders may be reduced  to date we have funded total distributions paid which includes net cash distributions and distributions reinvested by stockholders with cash flow from operations debt financing proceeds from the payoff or sale of our real estate loans receivable and proceeds from the sales of real estate properties other than distributions paid from the sale of assets and the maturity payoff or settlement of our debt investment we currently expect that our distributions will generally be paid from cash flow from operations and funds from operations from current or prior periods if we fund distributions from borrowings our interest expense and other financing costs as well as the repayment of such borrowings will reduce our earnings and cash flow from operations available for distribution in future periods if we fund distributions from the sale of assets or the maturity payoff or settlement of our debt investment this will affect our ability to generate cash flow from operations in future periods  in addition to the extent distributions exceed cash flow from operations a stockholder’s basis in our stock will be reduced and to the extent distributions exceed a stockholder’s basis the stockholder may recognize capital gain there is no limit on the amount of distributions we may fund from sources other than from cash flow from operations we can give no assurance regarding the timing amount or source of future distributions for the year ended december   we paid aggregate distributions of  million  all of which were paid in cash  table of contents funds from operations and cash flow from operations during the year ended december   were  million and  million  respectively  we funded our total distributions paid with  million of current period cash flow from operations and  million of cash on hand for a reconciliation of funds from operations to net income see part ii item  “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — funds from operations and modified funds from operations” during the year ended december   we sold one officeflex property during the year ended december   we sold one office property and received the repayment of one of our real estate loans receivable during the year ended december   we sold  real estate properties and received the repayment of three of our real estate loans receivable as a result our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our cash flow from operations has increased and this increase was significant our real estate properties generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues and tenant reimbursements and our real estaterelated investment generates cash flow in the form of interest income during the year ended december   we disposed of one officeflex property during the year ended december   we disposed of one office property additionally we received the repayment of one of our real estate loans receivable  during the year ended december   we sold  real estate properties and received the repayment of three of our real estate loans receivable as a result our cash flow from operations has decreased our general and administrative expenses are not directly related to the size of our portfolio and thus will not decrease proportionately as a result our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of cash flow from operations has increased significantly and depending on the amount of assets we sell in the future this increase could become even more significant the loss of or the inability to retain or obtain key real estate and debt finance professionals at our advisor could delay or hinder implementation of our investment management and disposition strategies which could limit our ability to pay distributions and decrease the value of an investment in our shares our success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of peter m bren keith d hall peter mcmillan iii and charles j schreiber jr each of whom would be difficult to replace neither we nor our advisor nor its affiliates have employment agreements with these individuals and they may not remain associated with us our advisor or its affiliates if any of these persons were to cease their association with us our advisor or its affiliates we may be unable to find suitable replacements and our operating results could suffer as a result we do not intend to maintain key person life insurance on any person we believe that our future success depends in large part upon our advisor’s and its affiliates’ ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial operational and marketing professionals competition for such professionals is intense and our advisor and its affiliates may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining such skilled individuals further we have established strategic relationships with firms that have special expertise in certain services or detailed knowledge regarding real properties in certain geographic regions maintaining such relationships will be important for us to effectively compete with other investors for

none of our independent directors shall be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages and that we will generally indemnify them for losses unless they are grossly negligent or engage in willful misconduct as a result our stockholders and we may have more limited rights against our independent directors than might otherwise exist under common law which could reduce our stockholders’

associated with security breaches whether through cyberattacks or cyber intrusions over the internet malware computer viruses attachments to emails persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems the risk of a security breach or disruption particularly through cyberattack or cyber

world have increased our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations although we make efforts to maintain the security

security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging even the most well protected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not to be detected and in fact may not be detected accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk a security breach or other significant disruption involving our it networks and related systems could • disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations • result in misstated financial reports violations of loan covenants andor missed reporting deadlines • result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a reit • result in the unauthorized access to and destruction loss theft misappropriation or release of proprietary confidential sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage claims by thirdparties for disruptive

stockholders to sell one or more of our assets and depending on the scope of the proposed asset sales thereafter to adopt a plan of liquidation that would involve the sale of our remaining assets alternatively based on the results of the initial sales effort the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders for us to engage in a limited number of asset sales and continue to operate as a going concern but with a portfolio that is smaller than the present portfolio although we have begun the process of exploring strategic

to acquisition fees in connection with its services to the purchaser in addition to disposition and other fees that we might pay to our advisor in connection with such transaction decisions of our board or the conflicts committee regarding the terms of those transactions may be influenced by our board’s or the conflicts committee’s loyalties to such other kbssponsored programs • a decision of the board or the conflicts committee regarding the timing of a debt or equity offering could be influenced by concerns that the offering would compete with offerings of other kbssponsored programs • a decision of the board the conflicts committee or the special committee regarding the timing of property sales could be influenced by concerns that the sales would compete with those of other kbssponsored programs because our independent directors are also independent directors of kbs reit i and kbs reit iii they receive compensation for service on the board of directors of kbs reit i and kbs reit iii like us kbs reit i and kbs reit iii each pays each independent director an annual retainer of  as well as compensation for attending meetings as follows i  for each board meeting attended ii  for each conflicts or audit committee meeting attended except that the committee chairman is paid  for each conflicts or audit committee meeting attended iii  for each teleconference board meeting attended and iv  for each teleconference conflicts or audit committee meeting attended except that the committee chairman is paid  for each teleconference conflicts or audit committee meeting attended

at meetings of their boards of directors risks related to our corporate structure ownership limitations may restrict change of control or business combination opportunities in which our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in order for us to qualify as a reit for each taxable year no more than  in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals during the last half of any calendar year “individuals” for this purpose include natural persons and some entities such as private foundations to preserve our reit qualification our charter generally prohibits any person from directly or indirectly owning more than  in value of our capital stock this ownership limitation could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a takeover or other transaction including an extraordinary transaction such as a merger tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets in which holders of our common stock might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price or which holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests  table of contents our charter permits our board of directors to issue stock with terms that may subordinate the rights of our common stockholders or discourage a third party from acquiring us in a manner that could result in a premium price to our stockholders our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued common stock or preferred stock and establish the preferences conversion or other rights voting powers restrictions limitations as to dividends and other distributions qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption of any such stock thus our board of directors could authorize the issuance of preferred stock with priority as to distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation over the rights of the holders of our common stock such preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of us including an extraordinary transaction such as a merger tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that might provide a premium price to holders of our common stock our stockholders’ investment return may be reduced if we are required to register as an investment company under the investment company act if we or our subsidiaries become an unregistered investment company we could not continue our business neither we nor any of our subsidiaries intend to register as an investment company under the investment company act if we or any of our subsidiaries were obligated to register as an investment company we would have to comply with a variety of substantive requirements under the investment company act that impose among other things • limitations on capital structure • restrictions on specified investments • prohibitions on transactions with affiliates and • compliance with reporting record keeping voting proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would significantly increase our operating expenses under the relevant provisions of section a of the investment company act an investment company is any issuer that • pursuant to section aa is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily or proposes to engage primarily in the business of investing reinvesting or trading in securities the “primarily engaged test” or • pursuant to section ac is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing reinvesting owning holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire “investment securities” having a value exceeding  of the value of such issuer’s total assets exclusive of us government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis the “ test” “investment securities” excludes us government securities and securities of majorityowned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company under section c or section c relating to private investment companies we believe neither we nor our operating partnership is required to register as an investment company based on the following analysis with respect to the  test most of the entities through which we and our operating partnership own our assets are majority owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exceptions from the definition of investment company under section c or section c with respect to the primarily engaged test we and our operating partnership are holding companies and do not intend to invest or trade in securities ourselves rather through the majorityowned subsidiaries of our operating partnership we and our operating partnership are primarily engaged in the noninvestment company businesses of these subsidiaries namely the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring real estate and real estaterelated assets if any of the subsidiaries of our operating partnership fail to meet the  test we believe they will usually if not always be able to rely on section cc of the investment company act for an exception from the definition of an investment company otherwise they should be able to rely on the exceptions for private investment companies pursuant to section c and section c of the investment company act as reflected in noaction letters the sec staff’s position on section cc generally requires that an issuer maintain at least  of its assets in “mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate” or qualifying assets at least  of its assets in qualifying assets plus real estaterelated assets and no more than  of the value of its assets in other than qualifying assets and real estaterelated assets which we refer to as miscellaneous assets to constitute a qualifying asset under this  requirement a real estate interest must meet various criteria based on noaction letters we expect that each of the subsidiaries of our operating partnership relying on section cc will invest at least  of its assets in qualifying assets and approximately an additional  of its assets in other types of real estaterelated assets if any subsidiary relies on section cc we expect to rely on guidance published by the sec staff or on our analyses of guidance published with respect to types of assets to determine which assets are qualifying real estate assets and real estaterelated assets  table of contents to maintain compliance with the investment company act our subsidiaries may be unable to sell assets we would otherwise want them to sell and may need to sell assets we would otherwise wish them to retain in addition our subsidiaries may have to acquire additional assets that they might not otherwise have acquired moreover the sec or its staff may issue interpretations with respect to various types of assets that are contrary to our views and current sec staff interpretations are subject to change which increases the risk of noncompliance and the risk that we may be forced to make adverse changes to our portfolio if we were required to register as an investment company but failed to do so we would be prohibited from engaging in our business and criminal and civil actions could be brought against us in addition our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court required enforcement and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business rapid changes in the values of our assets may make it more difficult for us to maintain our qualification as a reit or our exception from the definition of an investment company under the investment company act if the market value or income potential of our qualifying real estate assets changes as compared to the market value or income potential of our nonqualifying assets or if the market value or income potential of our assets that are considered “real estaterelated assets” under the investment company act or reit qualification tests changes as compared to the market value or income potential of our assets that are not considered “real estaterelated assets” under the investment company act or reit qualification tests whether as a result of increased interest rates prepayment rates or other factors we may need to modify our investment portfolio in order to maintain our reit qualification or exception from the definition of an investment company if the decline in asset values or income occurs quickly this may be especially difficult if not impossible to accomplish this difficulty may be exacerbated by the illiquid nature of many of the assets that we may own we may have to make investment decisions that we otherwise would not make absent reit and investment company act considerations our stockholders will have limited control over changes in our policies and operations which increases the uncertainty and risks our stockholders face our board of directors determines our major policies including our policies regarding financing debt capitalization reit qualification and distributions our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies without a vote of the stockholders under maryland general corporation law and our charter our stockholders have a right to vote only on limited matters our board’s broad discretion in setting policies and our stockholders’ inability to exert control over those policies increases the uncertainty and risks our stockholders face our share redemption program only provides for special redemptions we currently do not expect to have funds available for ordinary redemptions in the future our share redemption program only provides for special redemptions such special redemptions are subject to an annual dollar limitation on december   our board of directors approved an annual dollar limitation of  million in the aggregate for the calendar year  subject to review and adjustment during the year by the board of directors and further subject to the limitations described in the share redemption program based on historical redemption activity we believe the  million redemption limitation for the calendar year  will be sufficient for these special redemptions during each calendar year the annual dollar limitation for the share redemption program will be reviewed and adjusted from time to time we currently do not expect to have funds available for ordinary redemptions in the future thus until further notice and except with respect to special redemptions stockholders will not be able to sell any of their shares back to us pursuant to our share redemption program in addition even if we were to resume ordinary redemptions our share redemption program includes numerous restrictions that would limit a stockholder’s ability to sell his or her shares including that we have no obligation to redeem shares if the redemption would violate the restrictions on distributions under maryland law which prohibits distributions that would cause a corporation to fail to meet statutory tests of solvency in its sole discretion our board of directors may amend suspend or terminate our share redemption program upon  days’ notice provided that we may increase or decrease the funding available for the redemption of shares under the program upon ten business days’ notice to stockholders  table of contents pursuant to our share redemption program the redemption price per share for eligible redemptions is equal to the estimated value per share on december   our board of directors approved an estimated value per share of our common stock of  unaudited based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding all as of september   therefore commencing with the december   redemption date the redemption price for all shares eligible for redemption is  unaudited per share for a full description of the methodologies and assumptions used to value our assets and liabilities in connection with the calculation of the estimated value per share see part ii item  “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities — market information” the value of our shares will fluctuate over time in response to developments related to individual assets in our portfolio and the management of those assets in response to the real estate and finance markets and due to other factors as such the estimated value per share does not take into account developments in our portfolio since december   we currently expect to utilize our advisor andor an independent valuation firm to update the estimated value per share no later than december  the estimated value per share of our common stock may not reflect the value that stockholders will receive for their investment and does not take into account how developments subsequent to the valuation date related to individual assets the financial or real estate markets or other events may have increased or decreased the value of our portfolio on december   our board of directors approved an estimated value per share of our common stock of  unaudited based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding all as of september   we provided this estimated value per share to assist brokerdealers that participated in our initial public offering in meeting their customer account statement reporting obligations under national association of securities dealers “nasd” conduct rule  as required by the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” this valuation was performed in accordance with the provisions of and also to comply with practice guideline  valuations of publicly registered nonlisted reits  issued by the investment program association “ipa” in april  the “ipa valuation guidelines” the estimated value per share was based on the recommendation and valuation performed by our advisor we engaged cbre inc “cbre” an independent thirdparty real estate valuation firm to provide appraisals for our real estate properties as with any valuation methodology the methodologies used are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that may not be accurate or complete different parties using different assumptions and estimates could derive a different estimated value per share of our common stock and this difference could be significant the estimated value per share is not audited and does not represent the fair value of our assets less the fair value of our liabilities according to us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” nor does it represent a liquidation value of our assets and liabilities or the price at which our shares of common stock would trade on a national securities exchange the estimated value per share does not reflect a discount for the fact that we are externally managed nor does it reflect a real estate portfolio premiumdiscount versus the sum of the individual property values the estimated value per share also does not take into account estimated disposition costs and fees for real estate properties that are not under contract to sell debt prepayment penalties or swap breakage fees that could apply upon the prepayment of certain of our debt obligations or termination of related swap agreements prior to expiration or the impact of restrictions on the assumption of debt we have generally incurred disposition costs and fees related to the sale of each real estate property since inception of  to  of the gross sales price less concessions and credits with the weighted average being approximately   if this range of disposition costs and fees was applied to our real estate properties which do not include these costs and fees in the appraised values the resulting impact on the estimated value per share would be a decrease of  to  per share  accordingly with respect to the estimated value per share we can give no assurance that • a stockholder would be able to resell his or her shares at this estimated value per share • a stockholder would ultimately realize distributions per share equal to our estimated value per share upon liquidation of our assets and settlement of our liabilities or a sale of our company • our shares of common stock would trade at the estimated value per share on a national securities exchange • an independent thirdparty appraiser or other thirdparty valuation firm would agree with our estimated value per share or • the methodology used to calculate our estimated value per share would be acceptable to finra or for compliance with erisa reporting requirements for a full description of the methodologies and assumptions used to value our assets and liabilities in connection with the calculation of the estimated value per share see part ii item  “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity

addition the value of our shares will fluctuate over time in response to developments related to individual assets in our portfolio and the management of those assets in response to fluctuations in

future asset sales at values different from those used in the determination of estimated value per share as well as any impairment charges related to these or other assets as a result of changes in the expected hold period or the estimated cash flows for or future expenses related to these assets • any impairments we may recognize with respect to our real estaterelated investment • any increases

expenditure requirements • any inability to meet our existing debt service obligations or to repay or refinance such obligations on attractive terms or at all at or prior to maturity our stockholders’ interest in us will be diluted if we issue additional shares which could reduce the overall value of their investment our common stockholders do not have preemptive rights to any shares we issue in the future our charter authorizes us to issue  shares of capital stock of which  shares are designated as common stock and  shares are designated as preferred stock our board of directors may increase the number of authorized shares of capital stock without stockholder approval our board may elect to i sell additional shares in future public offerings ii issue equity interests in private offerings or iii issue shares to our advisor or its successors or assigns in payment of an outstanding obligation to the extent we issue additional equity interests our stockholders’ percentage ownership interest in us will be diluted in addition depending upon the terms and pricing of any additional offerings the use of the proceeds and the value of our real estate investments our stockholders may also experience dilution in the book value and fair value of their shares and in the earnings and distributions per share payment of fees to kbs capital advisors and its affiliates reduces cash available for distribution to stockholders and increases the risk that our stockholders will not be able to recover the amount of their investment in our shares kbs capital advisors and its affiliates performed services for us in connection with the selection and acquisition or origination of our investments and continue to perform services for us in connection with the management leasing and disposition of our properties and the management structuring administration and disposition of our other investments we pay them substantial fees for these services which results in immediate dilution of the value of our stockholders’ investment in us and reduces the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders we may also pay significant fees during our liquidation stage although most of the fees expected to be paid during our liquidation stage are contingent on our stockholders first receiving agreedupon investment returns the investmentreturn thresholds may be reduced with the approval of our conflicts committee and subject to the other limitations in our charter therefore these fees increase the risk that the cash available for distribution to common stockholders upon a liquidation of our portfolio would be less than stockholders paid for our shares these substantial fees and other payments also increase the risk that our stockholders will not be able to resell their shares at a profit if we are unable to obtain funding for future capital needs cash distributions to our stockholders and the value of our investments could decline when tenants do not renew their leases or otherwise vacate their space we will often need to expend substantial funds for improvements to the vacated space in order to attract replacement tenants even when tenants do renew their leases we may agree to make improvements to their space as part of our negotiations if we need additional capital in the future to improve or maintain our properties or for any other reason we may have to obtain funding from sources other than our cash flow from operations such as borrowings asset sales or future equity offerings these sources of funding may not be available on attractive terms or at all if we cannot procure additional funding for capital improvements our investments may generate lower cash flow or decline in value or both which would limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders and could reduce the value of our stockholders’ investment in us  table of contents our stockholders may be more likely to sustain a loss on their investment in us because our sponsors do not have as strong an economic incentive to avoid losses as do sponsors who have made significant equity investments in their companies our sponsors have only invested  in us through the purchase of  shares of our common stock at  per share our sponsors will have little exposure to loss in the value of our shares with this limited exposure our stockholders may be at a greater risk of loss because our sponsors do not have as much to lose from a decrease in the value of our shares as do those sponsors who make more significant equity investments in their companies although we are not currently afforded the protection of the maryland general corporation law relating to deterring or defending hostile takeovers our board of directors could opt into these provisions of maryland law in the future which may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and may prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium price for their stock in connection with a business combination under maryland law “business combinations” between a maryland corporation and certain interested stockholders or affiliates of interested stockholders are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these business combinations include a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities also under maryland law control shares of a maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter shares owned by the acquirer an officer of the corporation or an employee of the corporation who is also a director of the corporation are excluded from the vote on whether to accord voting rights to the control shares should our board opt into these provisions of maryland law it may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer similarly provisions of title  subtitle  of the maryland general corporation law could provide similar antitakeover protection general risks related to investments in real estate economic market and regulatory changes that impact the real estate market generally may decrease the value of our investments and weaken our operating results our operating results and the performance of our properties are subject to the risks typically associated with real estate any of which could decrease the value of our investments and could weaken our operating results including • downturns in national regional and local economic conditions • competition from other office buildings • adverse local conditions such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office buildings and changes in real estate zoning laws that may reduce the desirability of real estate in an area • vacancies changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair renovate and relet space • changes in interest rates and the availability of permanent mortgage financing which may render the sale of a property or loan difficult or unattractive • changes in tax including real and personal property tax real estate environmental and zoning laws • natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes and floods • acts of war or terrorism including the consequences of terrorist attacks such as those that occurred on september   • the potential for uninsured or underinsured property losses and • periods of high interest rates and tight money supply any of the above factors or a combination thereof could result in a decrease in our cash flow from operations and a decrease in the value of our investments which would have an adverse effect on our operations on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders and on the value of our stockholders’ investment in us if our acquisitions fail to perform as expected cash distributions to our stockholders may decline since breaking escrow in june  we made acquisitions of real estate and real estaterelated assets based on an underwriting analysis with respect to each asset and how the asset fits into our portfolio if these assets do not perform as expected we may have less cash flow from operations available to fund distributions and stockholders’ returns may be reduced  table of contents we acquired the    campus drive buildings on september   the  campus drive buildings on october   union bank plaza on september   and corporate technology center on march   a significant percentage of our assets is invested in the    campus drive buildings the  campus drive buildings union bank plaza and corporate technology center and the value of our stockholders’ investment in us will fluctuate with the performance of these investments the    campus drive buildings represented  of our total assets and represented approximately  of our total annualized base rent as of december   the  campus drive buildings represented  of our total assets and represented approximately  of our total annualized base rent as of december   union bank plaza represented approximately  of our total assets and represented approximately  of our total annualized base rent as of december   corporate technology center represented approximately  of our total assets and represented approximately  of our total annualized base rent as of december   as a result the geographic concentration of our portfolio makes us particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in the florham park new jersey los angeles and san jose real estate markets respectively any adverse economic or real estate developments in these markets such as business layoffs or downsizing industry slowdowns relocations of businesses changing demographics and other factors or any decrease in demand for office space resulting from the local business climate could adversely affect our operating results and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders because of the concentration of a significant portion of our assets in two geographic areas any adverse economic real estate or business conditions in these areas could affect our operating results and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders as of december    our real estate properties in california and new jersey represented  and  of our total assets respectively as a result the geographic concentration of our portfolio makes it particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in the california and new jersey real estate markets any adverse economic or real estate developments in these markets such as business layoffs or downsizing industry slowdowns relocations of businesses changing demographics and other factors or any decrease in demand for office space resulting from the local business climate could adversely affect our operating results and our ability to pay distributions to stockholders properties that have significant vacancies could be difficult to sell which could diminish the return on these properties and adversely affect our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders a property may incur vacancies either by the expiration and nonrenewal of tenant leases or the continued default of tenants under their leases if vacancies continue for a long period of time we may suffer reduced revenues resulting in less cash available for distribution to our stockholders in addition the resale value of the property could be diminished because the market value of a particular property depends principally upon the value of the cash flow generated by the leases associated with that property such a reduction in the resale value of a property could also reduce the value of our stockholders’ investment in us we depend on tenants for our revenue generated by our real estate investments and accordingly our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders is partially dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants and our ability to retain and attract tenants nonrenewals terminations or lease defaults could reduce our net income and limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders the success of our real estate investments materially depends upon the financial stability of the tenants leasing the properties we own the inability of a single major tenant or a significant number of smaller tenants to meet their rental obligations would significantly lower our net income a nonrenewal after the expiration of a lease term termination or default by a tenant on its lease payments to us would cause us to lose the revenue associated with such lease and require us to find an alternative source of revenue to meet mortgage payments and prevent a foreclosure if the property is subject to a mortgage in the event of a tenant default or bankruptcy we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord of a property and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment and releasing the property tenants may have the right to terminate their leases upon the occurrence of certain customary events of default and in other circumstances may not renew their leases or because of market conditions may only be able to renew their leases on terms that are less favorable to us than the terms of their initial leases when tenants exercise early termination rights our cash flow and earnings will be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to generate an equivalent amount of net rental income by leasing the vacated space to new third party tenants further some of our properties may be outfitted to suit the particular needs of the tenants we may have difficulty replacing the tenants of these properties if the outfitted space limits the types of businesses that could lease that space without major renovation if a tenant does not renew a lease or terminates or defaults on a lease we may be unable to lease the property for the rent previously received or sell the property without incurring a loss  table of contents the bankruptcy or insolvency of our tenants or delays by our tenants in making rental payments could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition any bankruptcy filings by or relating to any of our tenants could bar us from collecting prebankruptcy debts from that tenant unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court a tenant bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude full collection of these sums if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt entity may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims we may recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims which would harm our financial condition our inability to sell a property at the time and on the terms we want could limit our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders and could reduce the value of our stockholders’ investment in us many factors that are beyond our control affect the real estate market and could affect our ability to sell properties for the price on the terms or within the time frame that we desire these factors include general economic conditions the availability of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand because real estate investments are relatively illiquid we have a limited ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions further before we can sell a property on the terms we want it may be necessary to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements however we can give no assurance that we will have the funds available to correct such defects or to make such improvements we may be unable to sell our properties at a profit our inability to sell properties at the time and on the terms we want could reduce our cash flow limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders and reduce the value of our stockholders’ investment in us costs imposed pursuant to laws and governmental regulations may reduce our net income and our cash available for distribution to our stockholders real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and human health we could be subject to liability in the form of fines penalties or damages for noncompliance with these laws and regulations these laws and regulations generally govern wastewater discharges air emissions the operation and removal of underground and aboveground storage tanks the use storage treatment transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous materials the remediation of contamination associated with the release or disposal of solid and hazardous materials the presence of toxic building materials and other health and safetyrelated concerns some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability on the tenants owners or operators of real property for the costs to investigate or remediate contaminated properties regardless of fault whether the contamination occurred prior to purchase or whether the acts causing the contamination were legal our tenants’ operations the condition of properties at the time we buy them operations in the vicinity of our properties such as the presence of underground storage tanks or activities of unrelated third parties may affect our properties the presence of hazardous substances or the failure to properly manage or remediate these substances may hinder our ability to sell rent or pledge such property as collateral for future borrowings any material expenditures fines penalties or damages we must pay will reduce our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders and may reduce the value of our stockholders’ investment  table of contents the costs of defending against claims of environmental liability of complying with environmental regulatory requirements of remediating any contaminated property or of paying personal injury or other damage claims could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous real property owner or operator may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property these costs could be substantial such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances environmental laws also may impose liens on property or restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures or prevent us from entering into leases with prospective tenants that may be impacted by such laws environmental laws provide for sanctions for noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or in certain circumstances by private parties certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of and exposure to hazardous substances including asbestoscontaining materials and leadbased paint third parties may seek recovery from real property owners or operators for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances and governments may seek recovery for natural resource damage the costs of defending against claims of environmental liability of complying with environmental regulatory requirements of remediating any contaminated property or of paying personal injury property damage or natural resource damage claims could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders all of our properties were subject to phase i environmental assessments prior to the time they were acquired costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act may decrease our cash available for distribution our properties may be subject to the americans with disabilities act of  as amended the “disabilities act” under the disabilities act all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons the disabilities act has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities” that generally require that buildings and services be made accessible and available to people with disabilities the disabilities act’s requirements could require removal of access barriers and could result in the imposition of injunctive relief monetary penalties or in some cases an award of damages any funds used for disabilities act compliance will reduce our net income and the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders uninsured losses relating to real property or excessively expensive premiums for insurance coverage could reduce our cash flow from operations and the return on our stockholders’ investment in us there are types of losses generally catastrophic in nature such as losses due to wars acts of terrorism earthquakes floods hurricanes pollution or environmental matters that are uninsurable or not economically insurable or may be insured subject to limitations such as large deductibles or copayments insurance risks associated with potential acts of terrorism could sharply increase the premiums we pay for coverage against property and casualty claims additionally mortgage lenders in some cases have begun to insist that commercial property owners purchase coverage against terrorism as a condition to providing mortgage loans such insurance policies may not be available at reasonable costs if at all which could inhibit our ability to finance or refinance our properties in such instances we may be required to provide other financial support either through financial assurances or selfinsurance to cover potential losses we may not have adequate coverage for such losses if any of our properties incurs a casualty loss that is not fully insured the value of our assets will be reduced by any such uninsured loss which will reduce the value of our stockholders’ investment in addition other than any working capital reserve or other reserves we may establish we have limited sources of funding to repair or reconstruct any uninsured property also to the extent we must pay unexpectedly large amounts for insurance we could suffer reduced earnings that would result in lower distributions to our stockholders terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the markets in which we operate which could delay or hinder our ability to meet our investment objectives and reduce our stockholders’ overall return terrorist attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact the value of our properties through damage destruction loss or increased security costs we have invested in major metropolitan markets we may not be able to obtain insurance against the risk of terrorism because it may not be available or may not be available on terms that are economically feasible the terrorism insurance that we obtain may not be sufficient to cover loss for damages to our properties as a result of terrorist attacks the inability to obtain sufficient terrorism insurance or any terrorism insurance at all could limit our refinancing options as some mortgage lenders have begun to insist that specific coverage against terrorism be purchased by commercial owners as a condition of providing loans  table of contents risks related to real estaterelated investments our real estaterelated investment is and will be subject to the risks typically associated with real estate our mortgage loan investment is secured by a lien on real property that upon the occurrence of a default on the loan could result in our taking ownership of the property the value of this property may have changed since we originated the loan and if it has dropped our risk will increase because of the lower value of the security associated with the loan in this manner real estate values could impact the value of our loan investment therefore our real estaterelated investment is subject to the risks typically associated with real estate which are described above under the heading “—general risks related to investments in real estate” our mortgage loan investment is and will be subject to interest rate fluctuations that affect our return as compared to market interest rates accordingly the value of our stockholders’ investment in us is subject to fluctuations in interest rates with respect to our fixed rate longterm loan receivable if interest rates rise the loan could yield a return that is lower than thencurrent market rates if interest rates decrease we will be adversely affected to the extent that the loan is prepaid because we would no longer receive the revenue generated by the loan for this reason our return on this loan and the value of our stockholders’ investment in us are and will be subject to fluctuations in interest rates our mortgage loan investment is subject to delinquency foreclosure and loss which could result in losses to us commercial real estate loans are secured by commercial real estate properties that are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure the ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by an incomeproducing property typically is dependent primarily upon the successful operation of such property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower if the net operating income of the property is reduced the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired net operating income of an incomeproducing property can be affected by among other things tenant mix success of tenant businesses occupancy rates property management decisions property location and condition competition from comparable types of properties changes in laws that increase operating expenses or limit rents that may be charged any need to address environmental contamination at the property the occurrence of any uninsured casualty at the property changes in national regional or local economic conditions andor specific industry segments declines in regional or local real estate values declines in regional or local rental or occupancy rates increases in interest rates real estate tax rates and other operating expenses changes in governmental rules fiscal policies and regulations including environmental legislation natural disasters terrorism social unrest and civil disturbances in the event of any default under our mortgage loan we will bear a risk of loss of principal and accrued interest to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the mortgage loan which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations foreclosure on a property securing a mortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process that could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the investment in the event of the bankruptcy of our mortgage loan borrower the mortgage loan will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy as determined by the bankruptcy court and the lien securing the mortgage loan will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtorinpossession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law in addition if there is a default under our mortgage loan we may not be able to repossess and sell the underlying property quickly the resulting time delay could reduce the value of our investment in the defaulted mortgage loan an action to foreclose on a property securing a mortgage loan is regulated by state statutes and regulations and is subject to many of the delays and expenses of other lawsuits if the borrower raises defenses or counterclaims in the event of default by a borrower these restrictions among other things may impede our ability to foreclose on or sell the mortgaged property or to obtain proceeds sufficient to repay all amounts due to us on the mortgage loan our real estate loan investment is illiquid and we may not be able to adjust this portion of our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions our real estate loan investment is illiquid as a result our ability to vary this portion of our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be relatively limited  table of contents we depend on the borrower for the revenue generated by our real estaterelated investment and accordingly our revenue and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders are partially dependent upon the success and economic viability of such borrower the success of our real estaterelated investment materially depends on the financial stability of the borrower under the investment the inability of the borrower to meet its payment obligations could result in reduced revenue or losses for us in the event of the default or bankruptcy of the borrower we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a creditor and such rights may be subordinated to the rights of other creditors these events could negatively affect the cash available for distribution to our stockholders and the value of their investment in us hedging against interest rate exposure may adversely affect our earnings limit our gains or result in losses which could adversely affect cash available for distribution to our stockholders we have entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swap agreements or pursue other interest rate hedging strategies our hedging activity will vary in scope based on the level of interest rates the type of investments we hold at the relevant time and other changing market conditions interest rate hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us because among other things • interest rate hedging can be expensive particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates • available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought • the duration of the hedge products may not match the duration of the related liability or asset • the amount of income that a reit may earn from hedging transactions to offset losses due to fluctuations in interest rates is limited by federal tax provisions governing reits • the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction • the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay and • we may purchase a hedge that turns out not to be necessary ie a hedge that is out of the money any hedging activity we engage in may adversely affect our earnings which could adversely affect cash available for distribution to our stockholders therefore while we may enter into such transactions to seek to reduce interest rate risks unanticipated changes in interest rates may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions in addition the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the investments being hedged or liabilities being hedged may vary materially moreover for a variety of reasons we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the interest rate risk sought to be hedged any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended accounting treatment and may expose us to risk of loss we assume the credit risk of our counterparties with respect to derivative transactions we enter into derivative contracts for risk management purposes to hedge our exposure to cash flow variability caused by changing interest rates on our variable rate notes payable these derivative contracts generally are entered into with bank counterparties and are not traded on an organized exchange or guaranteed by a central clearing organization we would therefore assume the credit risk that our counterparties will fail to make periodic payments when due under these contracts or become insolvent if a counterparty fails to make a required payment becomes the subject of a bankruptcy case or otherwise defaults under the applicable contract we would have the right to terminate all outstanding derivative transactions with that counterparty and settle them based on their net market value or replacement cost in such an event we may be required to make a termination payment to the counterparty or we may have the right to collect a termination payment from such counterparty we assume the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to make any termination payment owing to us we may not receive any collateral from a counterparty or we may receive collateral that is insufficient to satisfy the counterparty’s obligation to make a termination payment if a counterparty is the subject of a bankruptcy case we will be an unsecured creditor in such case unless the counterparty has pledged sufficient collateral to us to satisfy the counterparty’s obligations to us we assume the risk that our derivative counterparty may terminate transactions early if we fail to make a required payment or otherwise default under the terms of a derivative contract the counterparty would have the right to terminate all outstanding derivative transactions between us and that counterparty and settle them based on their net market value or replacement cost in certain circumstances the counterparty may have the right to terminate derivative transactions early even if we are not defaulting if our derivative transactions are terminated early it may not be possible for us to replace those transactions with another counterparty on as favorable terms or at all  table of contents we may be required to collateralize our derivative transactions we may be required to secure our obligations to our counterparties under our derivative contracts by pledging collateral to our counterparties that collateral may be in the form of cash securities or other assets if we default under a derivative contract with a counterparty or if a counterparty otherwise terminates one or more derivative contracts early that counterparty may apply such collateral toward our obligation to make a termination payment to the counterparty if we have pledged securities or other assets the counterparty may liquidate those assets in order to satisfy our obligations if we are required to post cash or securities as collateral such cash or securities will not be available for use in our business cash or securities pledged to counterparties may be repledged by counterparties and may not be held in segregated accounts therefore in the event of a counterparty insolvency we may not be entitled to recover some or all collateral pledged to that counterparty which could result in losses and have an adverse effect on our operations there can be no assurance that the direct or indirect effects of the doddfrank act and other applicable nonus regulations will not have an adverse effect on our interest rate hedging activities title vii of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  the “doddfrank act” imposed additional regulations on derivatives markets and transactions such regulations and to the extent we trade with counterparties organized in nonus jurisdictions any applicable regulations in those jurisdictions are still being implemented and will affect our interest rate hedging activities while the full impact of regulation on our interest rate hedging activities cannot be fully assessed until all final rules and regulations are implemented such regulation may affect our ability to enter into hedging or other risk management transactions may increase our costs in entering into such transactions andor may result in us entering into such transactions on less favorable terms than prior to implementation of such regulation for example but not by way of limitation the doddfrank act and the rule making thereunder provides for significantly increased regulation of the derivative transactions used to affect our interest rate hedging activities including i regulatory reporting ii subject to an exemption for endusers of swaps upon which we and our subsidiaries generally rely mandated clearing of certain derivatives transactions through central counterparties and execution on regulated exchanges or execution facilities and iii to the extent we are required to clear any such transactions margin and collateral requirements the imposition or the failure to comply with any of the foregoing requirements may have an adverse effect on our business and our stockholders’ return declines in the market values of our investments may adversely affect periodic reported results of operations and credit availability which may reduce earnings and in turn cash available for distribution to our stockholders a decline in the market value of our assets may adversely affect us particularly in instances where we have borrowed money based on the market value of those assets if the market value of those assets declines the lender may require us to post additional collateral to support the loan if we were unable to post the additional collateral we may have to sell assets at a time when we might not otherwise have chosen to do so a reduction in available credit may reduce our earnings and in turn cash available for distribution to stockholders further credit facility providers may require us to maintain a certain amount of cash reserves or to set aside unleveraged assets sufficient to maintain a specified liquidity position which would allow us to satisfy our collateral obligations as a result if the market value of our investments declines we may not be able to leverage our assets as fully as we would choose which could reduce our return on equity in the event that we are unable to meet these contractual obligations our financial condition could deteriorate rapidly the market value of our real estaterelated investment may decline for a number of reasons such as changes in prevailing market rates a default related to the underlying collateral and widening of credit spreads our investments in derivatives are carried at estimated fair value as determined by us and as a result there may be uncertainty as to the value of these instruments our investments in derivatives are recorded at fair value but have limited liquidity and are not publicly traded the fair value of our derivatives may not be readily determinable we will estimate the fair value of any such investments on a quarterly basis because such valuations are inherently uncertain may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on numerous estimates our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these investments existed the value of our common stock could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of these investments are materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon their disposal or maturity  table of contents risks associated with debt financing we obtain mortgage indebtedness lines of credit and other borrowings which increases our risk of loss due to potential foreclosure we obtain lines of credit and longterm financing secured by our properties and other assets we have acquired many of our real properties by financing a portion of the price of the properties and mortgaging or pledging some or all of the properties purchased as security for that debt we may also incur mortgage debt on properties that we already own in order to fund property improvements and other capital expenditures to pay distributions and for other purposes in addition we may borrow as necessary or advisable to ensure that we maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes including borrowings to satisfy the reit requirement that we distribute at least  of our annual reit taxable income to our stockholders computed without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and excluding net capital gain however we can give our stockholders no assurance that we will be able to obtain such borrowings on satisfactory terms or at all if there is a shortfall between the cash flow generated by a mortgaged property and the cash flow needed to service mortgage debt on that property then the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders may be reduced in addition incurring mortgage debt increases the risk of loss of a property since defaults on indebtedness secured by a property may result in lenders initiating foreclosure actions in that case we could lose the property securing the loan that is in default reducing the value of our stockholders’ investment for tax purposes a foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage if the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure even though we would not necessarily receive any cash proceeds we have given and may give full or partial guarantees to lenders of mortgage or other debt on behalf of the entities that own our properties when we give a guaranty on behalf of an entity that owns one of our properties we will be responsible to the lender for satisfaction of all or a part of the debt or other amounts related to the debt if it is not paid by such entity if any mortgages contain crosscollateralization or crossdefault provisions a default on a mortgage secured by a single property could affect mortgages secured by other properties high mortgage rates or changes in underwriting standards may make it difficult for us to refinance properties which could reduce our cash flow from operations and the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders we may be unable to refinance part or all of the property subject to the mortgage debt when it becomes due or of being unable to refinance on favorable terms if interest rates are higher when we refinance properties our income could be reduced we may be unable to refinance or may only be able to partly refinance properties if underwriting standards including loan to value ratios and yield requirements among other requirements are more strict than when we originally financed the properties if any of these events occurs our cash flow could be reduced andor we might have to pay down existing mortgages this in turn would reduce cash available for distribution to our stockholders could cause us to require additional capital and may hinder our ability to raise capital by issuing more stock or by borrowing more money lenders may require us to enter into restrictive covenants relating to our operations which could limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders when providing financing a lender may impose restrictions on us that affect our distribution and operating policies and our ability to incur additional debt loan agreements into which we enter may contain covenants that limit our ability to further mortgage a property or that prohibit us from discontinuing insurance coverage or replacing our advisor these or other limitations would decrease our operating flexibility and our ability to achieve our operating objectives and limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders increases in interest rates would increase the amount of our debt payments and limit our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders we have incurred variable rate debt and we may incur additional debt or refinance existing debt in the future increases in interest rates will increase the cost of that debt which could reduce our cash flow from operations and the cash we have available for distribution to our stockholders in addition if we need to repay existing debt during periods of rising interest rates we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on such investments  table of contents we have broad authority to incur debt and high debt levels could hinder our ability to pay distributions and decrease the value of our stockholders’ investment we limit our total liabilities to  of the cost before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves of our tangible assets however we may exceed this limit if the majority of the conflicts committee approves each borrowing in excess of this limitation and we disclose such borrowings to our stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing as of december    our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately  of both the cost before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves and book value before deducting depreciation of our tangible assets respectively high debt levels would cause us to incur higher interest charges and higher debt service payments and may also be accompanied by restrictive covenants these factors could limit the amount of cash we have available to distribute to our stockholders and could result in a decline in the value of our stockholders’ investment in us federal income tax risks failure to qualify as a reit would reduce our net earnings available for distribution our qualification as a reit will depend upon our ability to meet requirements regarding our organization and ownership distributions of our income the nature and diversification of our income and assets and other tests imposed by the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit for any taxable year after electing reit status we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates in addition we would generally be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost our reit status losing our reit status would reduce our net earnings available for distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability in addition distributions to stockholders would no longer qualify for the dividendspaid deduction and we would no longer be required to pay distributions if this occurs we might be required to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order to pay the applicable tax failure to qualify as a reit would subject us to federal income tax which would reduce the cash available for distribution to our stockholders we believe that we have operated and will continue to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with the taxable year ended december   however the federal income tax laws governing reits are extremely complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification as a reit are limited qualifying as a reit requires us to meet various tests regarding the nature of our assets and our income the ownership of our outstanding stock and the amount of our distributions on an ongoing basis accordingly we cannot be certain that we will be successful in operating so we can remain qualified as a reit while we intend to continue to operate so that we will qualify as a reit given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits the ongoing importance of factual determinations including the tax treatment of certain investments we may make and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances no assurance can be given that we will so qualify for any particular year if we fail to qualify as a reit in any calendar year and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions we would be required to pay federal income tax on our taxable income we might need to borrow money or sell assets to pay that tax our payment of income tax would decrease the amount of our income available for distribution to our stockholders furthermore if we fail to maintain our qualification as a reit and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions we no longer would be required to distribute substantially all of our reit taxable income to our stockholders unless our failure to qualify as a reit were excused under federal tax laws we would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost  table of contents even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we may be subject to federal state local or other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we may be subject to some federal state and local taxes on our income or property for example • in order to qualify as a reit we must distribute annually at least  of our reit taxable income to our stockholders which is determined without regard to the dividendspaid deduction or net capital gain to the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement but distribute less than  of our reit taxable income we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on the undistributed income • we will be subject to a  nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions we pay in any calendar year are less than the sum of  of our ordinary income  of our capital gain net income and  of our undistributed income from prior years • if we elect to treat property that we acquire in connection with a foreclosure of a mortgage loan or certain leasehold terminations as “foreclosure property” we may avoid the  tax on the gain from a resale of that property but the income from the sale or operation of that property may be subject to corporate income tax at the highest applicable rate • if we sell an asset other than foreclosure property that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business our gain would be subject to the  “prohibited transaction” tax unless such sale were made by one of our taxable reit subsidiaries reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan we generally must distribute annually at least  of our reit taxable income subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain in order for federal corporate income tax not to apply to earnings that we distribute to the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement but distribute less than  of our reit taxable income we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed reit taxable income in addition we will be subject to a  nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under federal tax laws we also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our property and pay us federal income tax directly on such income in that event our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly however stockholders that are taxexempt such as charities or qualified pension plans would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability unless they file us federal income tax returns and thereon seek a refund of such tax we also will be subject to corporate tax on any undistributed taxable income we intend to pay distributions to our stockholders to comply with the reit requirements of the internal revenue code from time to time we may generate taxable income greater than our income for financial reporting purposes or our taxable income may be greater than our cash flow available for distribution to stockholders for example where a borrower defers the payment of interest in cash pursuant to a contractual right or otherwise if we do not have other funds available in these situations we could be required to borrow funds sell investments at disadvantageous prices or find another alternative source of funds to pay distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the reit distribution requirements and to avoid corporate income tax and the  excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits to maintain our reit status we may be forced to forego otherwise attractive business opportunities which may delay or hinder our ability to meet our investment objectives and reduce our stockholders’ overall return to qualify as a reit we must satisfy certain tests on an ongoing basis concerning among other things the sources of our income nature of our assets and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders we may be required to pay distributions to stockholders at times when it would be more advantageous to reinvest cash in our business or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits and reduce the value of our stockholders’ investment  table of contents if our operating partnership fails to maintain its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes its income would be subject to taxation and our reit status would be terminated we intend to maintain the status of our operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes however if the irs were to successfully challenge the status of our operating partnership as a partnership it would be taxable as a corporation in such event this would reduce the amount of distributions that our operating partnership could make to us this would also result in our losing reit status and becoming subject to a corporate level tax on our own income this would substantially reduce our cash available to pay distributions and the return on your investment in addition if any of the entities through which our operating partnership owns its properties in whole or in part loses its characterization as a partnership for federal income tax purposes the underlying entity would become subject to taxation as a corporation thereby reducing distributions to our operating partnership and jeopardizing our ability to maintain reit status potential characterization of distributions or gain on sale may be treated as unrelated business taxable income to taxexempt investors if i all or a portion of our assets are subject to the rules relating to taxable mortgage pools ii we are a “pensionheld reit” iii a taxexempt stockholder has incurred debt to purchase or hold our common stock or iv the residual real estate mortgage investment conduit interests or remics we buy if any generate “excess inclusion income” then a portion of the distributions to and in the case of a stockholder described in clause iii gains realized on the sale of common stock by such taxexempt stockholder may be subject to federal income tax as unrelated business taxable income under the internal revenue code the tax on prohibited transactions will limit our ability to engage in transactions that would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes a reit’s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a  tax in general prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of assets other than foreclosure property deemed held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business we might be subject to this tax if we were to dispose of loans in a manner that was treated as a sale of the loans for federal income tax purposes therefore in order to avoid the prohibited transactions tax we may choose not to engage in certain sales of loans at the reit level even though the sales might otherwise be beneficial to us it may be possible to reduce the impact of the prohibited transaction tax by conducting certain activities through taxable reit subsidiaries however to the extent that we engage in such activities through taxable reit subsidiaries the income associated with such activities may be subject to full corporate income tax complying with reit requirements may force us to liquidate otherwise attractive investments to qualify as a reit we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least  of the value of our assets consists of cash cash items government securities and qualified reit real estate assets including certain mortgage loans and residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities the remainder of our investment in securities other than government securities and qualified real estate assets generally cannot include more than  of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than  of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer in addition in general no more than  of the value of our assets other than government securities and qualified real estate assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer and no more than   for taxable years after  of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter we must correct the failure within  days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences as a result we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio otherwise attractive investments these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders liquidation of assets may jeopardize our reit qualification to qualify as a reit we must comply with requirements regarding our assets and our sources of income if we are compelled to liquidate our investments to repay obligations to our lenders we may be unable to comply with these requirements ultimately jeopardizing our qualification as a reit or we may be subject to a  tax on any resultant gain if we sell assets that are treated as dealer property or inventory  table of contents complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively the reit provisions of the internal revenue code may limit our ability to hedge our assets and operations under these provisions any income that we generate from transactions intended to hedge our interest rate inflation andor currency risks will be excluded from gross income for purposes of the reit  and  gross income tests if the purpose of the instrument is to i hedge interest rate risk on liabilities incurred to carry or acquire real estate ii hedge risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that would be qualifying income under the reit  or  gross income tests or iii manage risk with respect to the termination of certain prior hedging transactions described in i andor ii above and in each case such instrument is properly identified under applicable treasury regulations income from hedging transactions that do not meet these requirements will generally constitute nonqualifying income for purposes of both the reit  and  gross income tests as a result of these rules we may have to limit our use of hedging techniques that might otherwise be advantageous which could result in greater risks associated with interest rate or other changes than we would otherwise incur the ability of our board of directors to revoke our reit qualification without stockholder approval may subject us to us federal income tax and reduce distributions to our stockholders our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a reit while we intend to elect and qualify to be taxed as a reit we may not elect to be treated as a reit or may terminate our reit election if we determine that qualifying as a reit is no longer in our best interests if we cease to be a reit we would become subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our stockholders and on the market price of our common stock we may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes at any time the federal income tax laws or regulations governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws or regulations may be amended we cannot predict when or if any new federal income tax law regulation or administrative interpretation or any amendment to any existing federal income tax law regulation or administrative interpretation will be adopted promulgated or become effective and any such law regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively we and our stockholders could be adversely affected by any such change in or any new federal income tax law regulation or administrative interpretation you are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the impact of recent legislation on your investment in our shares and the status of legislative regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our shares although reits generally receive better tax treatment than entities taxed as regular corporations it is possible that future legislation would result in a reit having fewer tax advantages and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for us federal income tax purposes as a corporation as a result our charter provides our board of directors with the power under certain circumstances to revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election and cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation without the vote of our stockholders our board of directors has fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders and could only cause such changes in our tax treatment if it determines in good faith that such changes are in the best interest of our stockholders dividends payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates in general the maximum tax rate for dividends payable to domestic stockholders that are individuals trusts and estates is  dividends payable by reits however are generally not eligible for this reduced rate while this tax treatment does not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends paid by reits the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause investors who are individuals trusts or estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in stock of non‑reit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our common stock qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification our continued qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis in addition our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes  table of contents the taxation of distributions to our stockholders can be complex however distributions that we make to our stockholders generally will be taxable as ordinary income which may reduce your anticipated return from an investment in us distributions that we make to our taxable stockholders to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income generally will be taxable as ordinary income however a portion of our distributions may i be designated by us as capital gain dividends generally taxable as longterm capital gain to the extent that they are attributable to net capital gain recognized by us ii be designated by us as qualified dividend income generally to the extent they are attributable to dividends we receive from nonreit corporations if any or iii constitute a return of capital generally to the extent that they exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined for us federal income tax purposes a return of capital distribution is not taxable but has the effect of reducing the basis of a stockholder’s investment in our common stock nonus stockholders will be subject to us federal withholding tax and may be subject to us federal income tax on distributions received from us and upon the disposition of our shares subject to certain exceptions distributions received from us will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits such dividends ordinarily will be subject to us withholding tax at a  rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty unless the distributions are treated as “effectively connected” with the conduct by the nonus stockholder of a us trade or business pursuant to the foreign investment in real property tax act of  or firpta capital gain distributions attributable to sales or exchanges of “us real property interests” or usrpis generally will be taxed to a nonus stockholder as if such gain were effectively connected with a us trade or business unless firpta provides an exemption however a capital gain dividend will not be treated as effectively connected income if i the distribution is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the united states and ii the nonus stockholder does not own more than  of the class of our stock at any time during the oneyear period ending on the date the distribution is received we do not anticipate that our shares will be “regularly traded” on an established securities market for the foreseeable future and therefore this exception is not expected to apply gain recognized by a nonus stockholder upon the sale or exchange of our common stock generally will not be subject to us federal income taxation unless such stock constitutes a usrpi under firpta subject to specific firpta exemptions for certain nonus stockholders our common stock will not constitute a usrpi so long as we are a “domesticallycontrolled qualified investment entity” a domesticallycontrolled qualified investment entity includes a reit if at all times during a specified testing period less than  in value of such reit’s stock is held directly or indirectly by nonus stockholders we believe but cannot assure you that we will be a domesticallycontrolled qualified investment entity even if we do not qualify as a domesticallycontrolled qualified investment entity at the time a nonus stockholder sells or exchanges our common stock gain arising from such a sale or exchange would not be subject to us taxation under firpta as a sale of a usrpi if a our common stock is “regularly traded” as defined by applicable treasury regulations on an established securities market and b such nonus stockholder owned actually and constructively  or less of our common stock at any time during the fiveyear period ending on the date of the sale however it is not anticipated that our common stock will be “regularly traded” on an established market we encourage you to consult your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences applicable to you if you are a nonus stockholder  table of contents retirement plan risks if the fiduciary of an employee benefit plan subject to erisa such as a profit sharing section k or pension plan or an owner of a retirement arrangement subject to section  of the internal revenue code such as an individual retirement account “ira” fails to meet the fiduciary and other standards under erisa or the internal revenue code as a result of an investment in our stock the fiduciary could be subject to penalties and other sanctions there are special considerations that apply to employee benefit plans subject to the employee retirement income security act “erisa” such as profit sharing section k or pension plans and other retirement plans or accounts subject to section  of the internal revenue code such as an ira that invest in our shares fiduciaries and ira owners that invest the assets of such a plan or account in our common stock should satisfy themselves that • the investment is consistent with their fiduciary and other obligations under erisa and the internal revenue code • the investment is made in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan or ira including the plan’s or account’s investment policy • the investment satisfies the prudence and diversification requirements of sections ab and ac of erisa and other applicable provisions of erisa and the internal revenue code • the investment in our shares for which no public market currently exists is consistent with the liquidity needs of the plan or ira • the investment will not produce an unacceptable amount of “unrelated business taxable income” for the plan or ira • our stockholders will be able to comply with the requirements under erisa and the internal revenue code to value the assets of the plan or ira annually and • the investment will not constitute a prohibited transaction under section  of erisa or section  of the internal revenue code with respect to the annual valuation requirements described above we will provide an estimated value for our common stock annually we can make no claim whether such estimated value will or will not satisfy the applicable annual valuation requirements under erisa and the internal revenue code  the department of labor or the internal revenue service may determine that a plan fiduciary or an ira custodian is required to take further steps to determine the value of our common stock in the absence of an appropriate determination of value a plan fiduciary or an ira custodian may be subject to damages penalties or other sanctions for information regarding our estimated value per share see part ii item  “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  market information” of this annual report on form k failure to satisfy the fiduciary standards of conduct and other applicable requirements of erisa and the internal revenue code may result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties and could subject the fiduciary to claims for damages or for equitable remedies including liability for investment losses in addition if an investment in our shares constitutes a prohibited transaction under erisa or the internal revenue code the fiduciary or ira owner who authorized or directed the investment may be subject to the imposition of excise taxes with respect to the amount invested in addition the investment transaction must be undone in the case of a prohibited transaction involving an ira owner the ira may be disqualified as a taxexempt account and all of the assets of the ira may be deemed distributed and subjected to tax erisa plan fiduciaries and ira owners should consult with counsel before making an investment in our common stock if our assets are deemed to be plan assets the advisor and we may be exposed to liabilities under title i of erisa and the internal revenue code in some circumstances where an erisa plan holds an interest in an entity the assets of the entity are deemed to be erisa plan assets unless an exception applies this is known as the “lookthrough rule” under those circumstances the obligations and other responsibilities of plan sponsors plan fiduciaries and plan administrators and of parties in interest and disqualified persons under title i of erisa or section  of the internal revenue code may be applicable and there may be liability under these and other provisions of erisa and the internal revenue code we believe that our assets should not be treated as plan assets because the shares should qualify as “publiclyoffered securities” that are exempt from the lookthrough rules under applicable treasury regulations we note however that because certain limitations are imposed upon the transferability of shares so that we may qualify as a reit and perhaps for other reasons it is possible that this exemption may not apply if that is the case and if we or our advisor are exposed to liability under erisa or the internal revenue code our performance and results of operations could be adversely affected stockholders should consult with their legal and other advisors concerning the impact of erisa and the internal revenue code on their investment and our performance  table of contents item b unresolved staff comments we have no unresolved

are listed if ever our stockholders may not sell their shares unless the buyer meets the applicable suitability and minimum purchase requirements any sale must comply with applicable state and federal securities laws in addition our charter prohibits the ownership of more than  of our stock by a single person unless exempted by our board of directors consequently there is the risk that our stockholders may not be able to sell their shares at a time or price acceptable to them we provide an estimated value per share to assist brokerdealers that participated in our initial public offering in meeting their customer account statement reporting obligations under nasd conduct rule  as required by finra this valuation was performed in accordance with the provisions of and also to comply with the ipa valuation guidelines for this purpose we estimated the value of the shares of our common stock as  unaudited per share as of december   this estimated value per share is based on our board of directors’ approval on december   of an estimated value per share of our common stock of  unaudited based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities or net asset value divided by the number of shares outstanding all as of september   there were no material changes between september   and december   that impacted the overall estimated value per share the conflicts committee composed solely of all of our independent directors is responsible for the oversight of the valuation process used to determine the estimated value per share of our common stock including the review and approval of the valuation and appraisal processes and methodologies used to determine our estimated value per share the consistency of the valuation and appraisal methodologies with real estate industry standards and practices and the reasonableness of the assumptions used in the valuations and appraisals the estimated value per share was based upon the recommendation and valuation prepared by our advisor our advisor’s valuation of our  real estate properties held as of september   was based on appraisals performed by cbre an independent thirdparty valuation firm cbre prepared appraisal reports summarizing key inputs and assumptions for each of our real estate properties our advisor performed valuations with respect to our real estaterelated investments cash other assets mortgage debt and other liabilities the methodologies and assumptions used to determine the estimated value of our assets and the estimated value of our liabilities are described further below our advisor used the appraised values of our real estate properties together with our advisor’s estimated value of each of our other assets and our liabilities to calculate and recommend an estimated value per share of our common stock based on i the conflicts committee’s receipt and review of our advisor’s valuation report including our advisor’s summary of the appraisal reports prepared by cbre and our advisor’s estimated value of each of our other assets and our liabilities ii the conflicts committee’s review of the reasonableness of our estimated value per share resulting from our advisor’s valuation process and iii other factors considered by the conflicts committee and the conflicts committee’s own extensive knowledge of our assets and liabilities the conflicts committee concluded that the estimated value per share proposed by our advisor was reasonable and recommended to our board of directors that it adopt  unaudited as the estimated value per share of our common stock the board of directors unanimously agreed to accept the recommendation of the conflicts committee and approved  unaudited as the estimated value per share of our common stock which determination is ultimately and solely the responsibility of the board of directors  table of contents the table below sets forth the calculation of our estimated value per share as of december

cbre our advisor performed valuations of our real estaterelated investment cash other assets mortgage debt and other liabilities for more information relating to the december   estimated value per share and the assumptions and methodologies used by cbre and our advisor see our current report on form k filed with the sec on december    the decrease in the estimated value of real estate properties per share was primarily due to the sale of one real estate property and decreases in the appraised values of the real estate properties partially offset by capital additions subsequent to september    the decrease in cash per share was primarily due to principal repayments on our mortgage debt  the decrease in the estimated value of mortgage debt per share was primarily due to principal repayments to pay off certain mortgages a principal repayment as a result of the sale of one real estate property and amortizing principal payments subsequent to september   the decrease in our estimated value per share from the previous estimate was primarily due to the items noted in the table below which reflect the significant contributors to the decrease in the estimated value per share from  unaudited to  unaudited  the changes are not equal to the change in values of each asset and liability group presented in the table above due to asset sales or payoffs debt repayments and other factors which caused the value of certain asset or liability groups to change with no impact to our fair value of equity or the overall estimated value per share      calculation of estimated

mffo in accordance with the definition included in the practice guideline issued by the ipa in november   table of contents as with any valuation methodology the methodologies used are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that may not be accurate or complete different parties using different assumptions and estimates could derive a different estimated value per share of our common stock and this difference could be significant the estimated value per share is not audited and does not represent the fair value of our assets less the fair value of our liabilities according to us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” nor does it represent a liquidation value of our assets and liabilities or the price at which our shares of common stock would trade on a national securities exchange the estimated value per share does not reflect a discount for the fact that we are externally managed nor does it reflect a real estate portfolio premiumdiscount versus the sum of the individual property values the estimated value per share also does not take into account estimated disposition costs and fees for real estate properties that are not under contract to sell debt prepayment penalties or swap breakage fees that could apply upon the prepayment of certain of our debt obligations or termination of related swap agreements prior to expiration or the impact of restrictions on the assumption of debt we have generally incurred disposition costs and fees related to the sale of each real estate property since inception of  to  of the gross sales price less concessions and credits with the weighted average being approximately   if this range of disposition costs and fees was applied to our real estate properties which do not include these costs and fees in the appraised values the resulting impact on the estimated value per share would be a decrease of  to  per share  our estimated value per share takes into consideration any potential liability related to a subordinated participation in cash flows our advisor is entitled to upon meeting certain stockholder return thresholds in accordance with the advisory agreement for purposes of determining the estimated value per share our advisor calculated the potential liability related to this incentive fee based on a hypothetical liquidation of the assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values after considering the impact of any potential closing costs and fees related to the disposition of real estate properties and determined that there would be no liability related to the subordinated participation in cash flows as of december   we had no potentially dilutive securities outstanding that would impact the estimated value per share of our common stock methodology our goal for the valuation was to arrive at a reasonable and supportable estimated value per share using a process that was designed to be in compliance with the ipa valuation guidelines and using what we and our advisor deemed to be appropriate valuation methodologies and assumptions the following is a summary of the valuation and appraisal methodologies assumptions and estimates used to value our assets and liabilities real estate independent valuation firm cbre  was selected by our advisor and approved by our conflicts committee and board of directors to appraise our real estate properties cbre is not affiliated with us or our advisor the compensation we paid to cbre was based on the scope of work and not on the appraised values of our real estate properties  the appraisals were performed in accordance with the code of ethics and the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice or uspap the real estate appraisal industry standards created by the appraisal foundation as well as the requirements of the state where each real property is located  each appraisal was reviewed approved and signed by an individual with the professional designation of mai member of the appraisal institute the use of the reports is subject to the requirements of the appraisal institute relating to review by its duly authorized representatives cbre collected all reasonably available material information that it deemed relevant in appraising our real estate properties cbre obtained propertylevel information from our advisor including i property historical and projected operating revenues and expenses ii property lease agreements and iii information regarding recent or planned capital expenditures cbre reviewed and relied in part on the propertylevel information provided by our advisor and considered this information in light of its knowledge of each property’s specific market conditions   cbre is actively engaged in the business of appraising commercial real estate properties similar to those we own in connection with public securities offerings private placements business combinations and similar transactions we engaged cbre to deliver appraisal reports relating to our real estate properties and cbre received fees upon the delivery of such reports in addition we have agreed to indemnify cbre against certain liabilities arising out of this engagement cbre is an affiliate of cbre group inc a parent holding company of affiliated companies that are engaged in the ordinary course of business in many areas related to commercial real estate and related services in the two years prior to december   cbre and its affiliates provided a number of commercial real estate appraisal valuation and financial advisory services for us and our affiliates and have received fees in connection with such services cbre and its affiliates may from time to time in the future perform other commercial real estate appraisal valuation and financial advisory services for us and our affiliates in transactions related to the properties that are the subjects of the appraisals so long as such other services do not adversely affect the independence of the applicable cbre appraiser as certified in the applicable appraisal report in the ordinary course of its business cbre and its affiliates directors and officers may structure and effect transactions for their own accounts or for the accounts of their customers in commercial real estate assets of the same kind and in the same markets as our assets  table of contents in conducting its investigation and analyses cbre took into account customary and accepted financial and commercial procedures and considerations as it deemed relevant although cbre reviewed information supplied or otherwise made available by us or our advisor for reasonableness it assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all such information and of all information supplied or otherwise made available to it by any other party and did not independently verify any such information with respect to operating or financial forecasts and other information and data provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with cbre cbre assumed that such forecasts and other information and data were reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of our management andor our advisor cbre relied on us to advise it promptly if any information previously provided became inaccurate or was required to be updated during the period of its review in performing its analyses cbre made numerous other assumptions as of various points in time with respect to industry performance general business economic and regulatory conditions and other matters many of which are beyond its and our control as well as certain factual matters for example unless specifically informed to the contrary cbre assumed that we had clear and marketable title to each real estate property appraised that no title defects existed that any improvements were made in accordance with law that no hazardous materials were present or had been present previously that no deed restrictions existed and that no changes to zoning ordinances or regulations governing use density or shape were pending or being considered furthermore cbre’s analyses opinions and conclusions were necessarily based upon market economic financial and other circumstances and conditions existing as of or prior to the date of the appraisal and any material change in such circumstances and conditions may affect cbre’s analyses and conclusions  cbre’s appraisal reports contain other assumptions qualifications and limitations that qualify the analyses opinions and conclusions set forth therein  furthermore the prices at which our real estate properties may actually be sold could differ from their appraised values although cbre considered any comments to its appraisal reports received from us or our advisor the final appraised values of our real estate properties were determined by cbre  the appraisal reports for our real estate properties are addressed solely to us to assist our advisor in calculating and recommending an updated estimated value per share of our common stock the appraisal reports are not addressed to the public and may not be relied upon by any other person to establish an estimated value per share of our common stock and do not constitute a recommendation to any person to purchase or sell any shares of our common stock in preparing its appraisal reports cbre did not solicit thirdparty indications of interest for our real estate properties in preparing its appraisal reports cbre also did not and was not requested to solicit third party indications of interest for our common stock in connection with possible purchases thereof or the acquisition of all or any part of us while cbre was responsible for providing appraisals of our real estate properties for us cbre was not responsible for did not calculate and did not participate in the determination of the estimated value per share of our common stock the foregoing is a summary of the standard assumptions qualifications and limitations that generally apply to cbre’s appraisal reports all of the cbre appraisal reports including the analyses opinions and conclusions set forth in such reports are qualified by the assumptions qualifications and limitations set forth in the respective appraisal reports real estate valuation as of september   we owned  real estate properties consisting of  office properties and an office campus consisting of eight office buildings cbre appraised each of our real estate properties using various methodologies including the direct capitalization approach discounted cash flow analyses and sales comparison approach and relied primarily on year discounted cash flow analyses for the final appraisal of each of the properties cbre calculated the discounted cash flow value of our real estate properties using propertylevel cash flow estimates terminal capitalization rates and discount rates that fall within ranges it believes would be used by similar investors to value our real estate properties based on recent comparable market transactions adjusted for unique property and marketspecific factors the total appraised value of our real estate properties as of september   was  billion the total cost basis of these properties as of september   was  billion this amount includes the purchase price of  billion  million in capital expenditures leasing commissions and tenant improvements since inception and  million of acquisition fees and expenses the appraised value of our real estate properties as of september   compared to the total acquisition cost of these properties plus subsequent capital expenditures leasing commissions and tenant improvements and acquisition fees and expenses through september   results in an overall decrease in the real estate value of the properties of approximately   table of contents the following table summarizes the key assumptions that cbre used in the year discounted cash flow models to arrive at the appraised values for our real estate properties   range in values   weightedaverage basis terminal capitalization rate  to     discount rate  to     net operating income compounded annual growth rate   to       the net operating income compounded annual growth rates “cagrs” reflect both the contractual and market rents and reimbursements in cases where the contractual lease period is less than the hold period of the property net of expenses over the holding period the range of cagrs shown is the constant annual rate at which the net operating income is projected to grow to reach the net operating income in the final year of the hold period for each of the properties the highend range in values reflects the lease up of a property with a considerable amount of vacancy and that was  leased as of september   while we believe that cbre’s assumptions and inputs are reasonable a change in these assumptions and inputs would significantly impact the appraised value of our real estate properties and thus our estimated value per share the table below illustrates the impact on the estimated value per share if the terminal capitalization rates or discount rates cbre used to appraise our real estate properties were adjusted by  basis points assuming all other factors remain unchanged additionally the table below illustrates the impact on our estimated value per share if the terminal capitalization rates or discount rates were adjusted by  in accordance with the ipa valuation guidelines assuming all other factors remain unchanged     increase decrease on the estimated value per share due to     decrease of  basis points   increase of  basis points   decrease of    increase of  terminal capitalization rates                   discount rates               finally each  change in the appraised value of our real estate properties would result in a change of  to the estimated value per share assuming all other factors remain unchanged real estate loan receivable as of september   we owned one real estate loan receivable the estimated value for our real estate loan receivable is equal to the gaap fair value disclosed in our quarterly report on form q for the period ended september   but does not equal the book value of the loan in accordance with gaap the value of the real estate loan receivable was estimated by applying a discounted cash flow analysis over the remaining expected life of the investment excluding any potential transaction costs the cash flow estimate used in the analysis during the term of the investment was based on the investment’s contractual cash flow which we anticipate we will receive the expected cash flow for the loan was discounted at a rate that we expect a market participant would require for an instrument with similar characteristics including remaining loan term loantovalue ratio type of collateral current performance credit enhancements and other factors the cost of our real estate loan receivable was  million including  of origination fees and costs and  million of principal repayments as of september   the fair value of our real estate loan receivable was  million and the outstanding principal balance was  million the discount rate applied to the cash flow from the real estate loan receivable which has a remaining term of  years was approximately  similar to the valuation for real estate a change in the assumptions and inputs would change the fair value of our real estate loan receivable and thus our estimated value per share assuming all other factors remain unchanged a decrease or increase in the discount rates of  basis points would have no impact on the estimated value per share and additionally a  decrease or increase in the discount rates would have no impact on the estimated value per share notes payable the estimated values of our notes payable are equal to the gaap fair values disclosed in our quarterly report on form q for the period ended september   the estimated value of our notes payable does not equal the book value of the loans in accordance with gaap the gaap fair values of our notes payable were determined using a discounted cash flow analysis the discounted cash flow analysis was based on projected cash flow over the remaining loan terms including extensions we expect to exercise and on management’s estimates of current market interest rates for instruments with similar characteristics including remaining loan term loantovalue ratio and type of collateral  table of contents as of september   the gaap fair value and carrying value of our notes payable were  million and  million respectively the weightedaverage discount rate applied to the future estimated debt payments was approximately  our notes payable have a weightedaverage remaining term of  years the table below illustrates the impact on our estimated value per share if the discount rates were adjusted by  basis points assuming all other factors remain unchanged with respect to our notes payable additionally the table below illustrates the impact on the estimated value per share if the discount rates were adjusted by  in accordance with the ipa valuation guidelines assuming all other factors remain unchanged     increase decrease on the estimated value per share due to     decrease of  basis points   increase of  basis points   decrease of    increase of  discount rates                   other assets and liabilities the carrying values of a majority of our other assets and liabilities are considered to equal their fair value due to their short maturities or liquid nature certain balances such as straightline rent receivables lease intangible assets and liabilities capital expenditures payable deferred financing costs unamortized lease commissions and unamortized lease incentives have been eliminated for the purpose of the valuation due to the fact that the values of those balances were already considered in the valuation of the related asset or liability our advisor has also excluded redeemable common stock as temporary equity does not represent a true liability to us and the shares that this amount represents are included in our total outstanding shares of common stock for purposes of calculating the estimated value per share of our common stock limitations of the estimated value per share as mentioned above we are providing this estimated value per share to assist broker dealers that participated in our initial public offering in meeting their customer account statement reporting obligations this valuation was performed in accordance with the provisions of and also to comply with the ipa valuation guidelines the estimated value per share set forth above first appeared on the december   customer account statements that were mailed in january  as with any valuation methodology the methodologies used are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that may not be accurate or complete different parties with different assumptions and estimates could derive a different estimated value per share of our common stock and this difference could be significant the estimated value per share is not audited and does not represent the fair value of our assets less the fair value of our liabilities according to gaap accordingly with respect to the estimated value per share we can give no assurance that • a stockholder would be able to resell his or her shares at this estimated value per share • a stockholder would ultimately realize distributions per share equal to our estimated value per share upon liquidation of our assets and settlement of our liabilities or a sale of our company • our shares of common stock would trade at the estimated value per share on a national securities exchange • an independent thirdparty appraiser or other thirdparty valuation firm would agree with our estimated value per share or • the methodology used to calculate our estimated value per share would be acceptable to finra or for compliance with erisa reporting requirements  table of contents further the estimated value per share as of december   is based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding all as of september   the value of our shares will fluctuate over time in response to developments related to individual assets in our portfolio and the management of those assets in response to the real estate and finance markets and due to other factors the estimated value per share does not reflect a discount for the fact that we are externally managed nor does it reflect a real estate portfolio premiumdiscount versus the sum of the individual property values the estimated value per share does not take into account estimated disposition costs and fees for real estate properties that are not under contract to sell debt prepayment penalties or swap breakage fees that could apply upon the prepayment of certain of our debt obligations or termination of related swap agreements prior to expiration or the impact of restrictions on the assumption of debt we have generally incurred disposition costs and fees related to the sale of each real estate property since inception of  to  of the gross sales price less concessions and credits with the weighted average being approximately   if this range of disposition costs and fees was applied to our real estate properties which do not include these costs and fees in the appraised values the resulting impact on the estimated value per share would be a decrease of  to  per share we currently expect to utilize our advisor andor an independent valuation firm to update the estimated value per share no later than december  historical estimated values per share the historical reported estimated values per share of our common stock approved by our board of directors are set forth below estimated value per share

september   excluding the impact of the special distribution our estimated value per share of common stock would have been  as of september   our board of directors declared special distributions in the amount of   and  per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock on july   august   and august   respectively for an aggregate amount of  per share of common stock to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on september   these special distributions were paid on september   and were funded from our proceeds from the disposition of nine real estate properties between may  and august  as well as cash on hand resulting primarily from the repayment or sale of five real estate loans receivable during  and  distribution information over the long term we expect that our distributions will generally be paid from cash flow from operations and ffo from current or prior periods except with respect to distributions related to sales of our assets and distributions related to the repayment of principal under our mortgage loan investment during the year ended december    we sold one officeflex property during the year ended december   we sold one office property and received the repayment of one of our real estate loans receivable and during the year ended december   we sold  real estate properties and received repayments on three of our real estate loans receivable our cash flow from operations has decreased and will continue to decrease as a result of our disposition activity and we have adjusted our distribution policy with respect to the amount of monthly distribution payments to take into account our disposition activity and current real estate investments we may continue to make strategic asset sales as opportunities become available in the market our focus in  is to continue to strategically sell assets and consider paying special distributions to stockholders negotiate lease renewals or new leases that facilitate the sales process and enhance property stability for prospective buyers complete capital projects such as renovations or amenity enhancements to attract quality buyers and finalize the strategic alternatives assessment and decide on a course of action any future special distributions we make from the proceeds of future dispositions will reduce our estimated value per share and this reduction will be reflected in our updated estimated value per share which we expect to update no later than december   table of contents our operating performance and ability to pay distributions from our cash flow from operations

liquidity and capital resources” and “ — results of operations” herein those factors include the future operating performance of our investments in the existing real estate and financial environment the success and economic viability of our tenants the ability of our borrower to continue to make debt service payments andor to repay its loan upon maturity our ability to refinance existing indebtedness at comparable terms changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt obligations our ability to successfully dispose of some of our assets and the sources and amounts of cash we have available for distributions our board has the authority under our organizational documents to the extent permitted by maryland law to pay distributions from any source including proceeds from the issuance of securities in the future our board of directors has not preestablished a percentage range of return for distributions to stockholders or a minimum distribution level and our charter does not require that we pay distributions to our stockholders the rate will be determined by our board of directors based on our financial condition and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code and have operated as such beginning with our taxable year ended december   to maintain our qualification as a reit we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute at least  of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividendspaid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with gaap our board of directors may authorize distributions in excess of those required for us to maintain reit status depending on our financial condition and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant distributions declared per common share were  and  in the aggregate for the years ended

years ended december   and  see part ii item  “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  distribution information”  we believe that funds from operations “ffo” is a beneficial indicator of the performance of an equity reit we compute ffo in accordance with the current national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” definition ffo represents net income excluding gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and usefullife estimates impairment losses on real estate assets depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures we believe ffo facilitates comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other reits however our computation of ffo may not be comparable to other reits that do not define ffo in accordance with the nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do our management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves as a result we believe that the use of ffo together with the required gaap presentations provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating financing and investing activities ffo is a nongaap financial measure and does not represent net income as defined by gaap net income as defined by gaap is the most relevant measure in determining our operating performance because ffo includes adjustments that investors may deem subjective such as adding back expenses such as depreciation and amortization accordingly ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance  table of contents item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the “selected financial data” above and our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto also see “forwardlooking statements” preceding part i and part i item a “risk factors” overview we were formed on july   as a maryland corporation that elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust “reit” beginning with the taxable year ended december   and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner we conduct our business primarily through our operating partnership of which we are the sole general partner subject to certain restrictions and limitations our business is managed by our advisor kbs capital advisors llc pursuant to an advisory agreement kbs capital advisors conducts our operations and manages our portfolio of real estate and real estaterelated investments our advisor owns  shares of our common stock we have no paid employees we invested in a diverse portfolio of real estate and real estaterelated investments as of december    we owned   real estate properties consisting of   office properties and an office campus consisting of eight office buildings and one real estate loan receivable on september   we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec to offer a maximum of  shares of common stock for sale to the public of which  shares were registered in our primary offering and  shares were registered under our dividend reinvestment plan we ceased offering shares of common stock in our primary offering on december   we sold   shares of common stock in our primary offering for gross offering proceeds of  billion we terminated the offering under our dividend reinvestment plan effective may   we sold   shares of common stock under our dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of  million  also as of december    we had redeemed  shares sold in our offering for  million  on january   our board of directors formed the special committee composed of all of our independent directors to explore the availability of strategic alternatives involving us as part of the process of exploring strategic alternatives on february   the special committee engaged evercore to act as our financial advisor and to assist us and the special committee with this process under the terms of the engagement evercore provided various financial advisory services as requested by the special committee as customary for an engagement in connection with exploring strategic alternatives although the special committee has engaged evercore to assist us and the special committee with the exploration of strategic alternatives for us we are not obligated to enter into any particular transaction or any transaction at all while the special committee continues to explore strategic alternatives for us the special committee has determined that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders to market some of our assets for sale based on the results of this sales effort the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders to sell one or more of our assets and depending on the scope of the proposed asset sales thereafter to adopt a plan of liquidation that would involve the sale of our remaining assets in the event of such a determination the proposed plan of liquidation would be presented to our stockholders for approval alternatively based on the results of the initial sales effort the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders for us to engage in a limited number of asset sales and continue to operate as a going concern but with a portfolio that is smaller than the present portfolio although we have begun the process of exploring strategic alternatives and are marketing some of our assets for sale there is no assurance that this process will result in stockholder liquidity or provide a return to stockholders that equals or exceeds our estimated value per share our focus in  is to continue to strategically sell assets and consider special distributions to stockholders negotiate lease renewals or new leases that facilitate the sales process and enhance property stability for prospective buyers complete capital projects such as renovations or amenity enhancements to attract quality buyers and finalize the strategic alternatives assessment and decide on a course of action  table of contents market outlook – real estate and real estate finance markets the following discussion is based on management’s beliefs observations and expectations with respect to the real estate and real estate finance markets conditions in the global capital markets remain volatile as of the first quarter of  current economic data and financial market developments suggest that the global economy is improving although at a slow and uneven pace european economic growth has recently picked up whereas the uk and china remain areas of concern against this backdrop the central banks of the world’s major industrialized economies are beginning to back away from their strong monetary accommodation quantitative easing in japan and europe is slowing but the liquidity generated from these programs continues to impact the global capital markets for further discussion of current market conditions see part i item  “business ─ market outlook ─ real estate and real estate finance markets” impact on our real estate investments the volatility in the global financial markets continues to cause a level of uncertainty in our outlook for the performance of the us commercial real estate markets both the investing and leasing environments are highly competitive while foreign capital continues to flow into us real estate markets the uncertainty regarding the political regulatory and economic environments has introduced uncertainty into the markets possible future declines in rental rates slower or potentially negative net absorption of leased space and expectations of future rental concessions including free rent to renew tenants early to retain tenants who are up for renewal or to attract new tenants may result in decreases in cash flows historically low interest rates could help offset some of the impact of these potential decreases in operating cash flow for properties financed with variable rate mortgages however interest rates in the united states have started to increase the fed increased interest rates in the fourth quarter of  and again in december  the real estate and finance markets anticipate further rate increases as long as the economy remains strong if this trend continues management will review our debt financing strategies to optimize the cost of our debt exposure impact on our real estaterelated investment our real estate loan receivable is directly secured by commercial real estate as a result our real estaterelated investment in general has been and likely will continue to be impacted by the same factors impacting our real estate properties the higher yields and the improving credit position of many us tenants and borrowers have attracted global capital however the real estate and capital markets are fluid and the positive trends can reverse quickly economic conditions remain relatively volatile and can have a negative impact on the performance of collateral securing our loan investment and therefore may impact the ability of the borrower under our loan to make contractual interest payments to us as of december    we had a fixedrate real estate loan receivable with an outstanding principal balance of  million and a carrying value including unamortized origination and closing costs of  million that matures in  impact on our financing activities in light of the risks associated with potentially volatile operating cash flows from some of our real estate properties and the possible increase in the cost of financing due to higher interest rates we may have difficulty refinancing some of our debt obligations prior to or at maturity or we may not be able to refinance these obligations at terms as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness shortterm interest rates in the united states have increased market conditions can change quickly potentially negatively impacting the value of our investments as of december    we had debt obligations in the aggregate principal amount of  million with a weightedaverage remaining term of  years we had a total of  million of fixed rate notes payable and  million of variable rate notes payable as of december    the interest rates on  million  of our variable rate notes payable are effectively fixed through interest rate swap agreements as of december    we had a total of  million of debt obligations scheduled to mature within  months of that date we plan to exercise our extension options available under our loan agreements if applicable or pay down or refinance the related notes payable prior to their maturity dates  table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal demands for funds during the short and longterm are and will be for the payment of operating expenses capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses payments under debt obligations special redemptions of common stock pursuant to our share redemption program and payments of distributions to stockholders we intend to use our cash on hand cash flow generated by our real estate properties and real estaterelated investment proceeds from debt financing proceeds from the sale of real estate properties and possibly the principal repayment on or sale of our real estate loan receivable as our primary sources of immediate and longterm liquidity as of december    we had an aggregate of  million available for future disbursements under two credit facilities subject to certain conditions and restrictions set forth in the respective loan agreements our share redemption program provides only for special redemptions during each calendar year such special redemptions are limited to an annual dollar amount determined by the board of directors which may be reviewed during the year and increased or decreased upon ten business days’ notice to our stockholders special redemptions are made at a price per share equal to the most recent estimated value per share of our common stock as of the applicable redemption date we currently do not expect to make ordinary redemptions in the future on december   our board of directors approved an annual dollar limitation of  million in the aggregate for the calendar year  subject to review and adjustment during the year by the board of directors and further subject to the limitations described in the share redemption program our investments in real estate generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues and tenant reimbursements which are reduced by operating expenditures debt service payments the payment of asset management fees and corporate general and administrative expenses cash flow from operations from our real estate investments is primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio the net effective rental rates on our leases the collectibility of rent and operating recoveries from our tenants and how well we manage our expenditures as of december    our real estate was   occupied and our bad debt reserve was less than  of annualized base rent our real estaterelated investment generates cash flow in the form of interest income which is reduced by the payment of asset management fees and corporate general and administrative expenses cash flow from operations from our real estaterelated investment is primarily dependent on the operating performance of the underlying collateral and the borrower’s ability to make debt service payments as of december    the borrower under our real estate loan receivable was current on its debt service payments to us for the year ended december    our cash needs for capital expenditures and the payment of debt obligations were met with the proceeds from the payoff or sale of real estate loans receivable and proceeds from the sales of real estate properties from prior periods operating cash needs during the same period were met with cash flow generated by our real estate and real estaterelated investments we made distributions to our stockholders during the year ended december   using cash flows from operations and cash on hand we believe that our cash on hand cash flow from operations availability under our credit facilities proceeds from the sales of real estate properties and the repayment of or sale of our real estate loan receivable will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future as of december    we had a total of  million of debt obligations scheduled to mature within  months of that date we plan to exercise our extension options available under our loan agreements if applicable or pay down or refinance the related notes payable prior to their maturity dates on december   our board of directors approved an estimated value per share of our common stock of  unaudited based on the estimated value of our assets less the estimated value of our liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding all as of september   for a full description of the assumptions methodologies and limitations used to value our assets and liabilities in connection with the calculation of our estimated value per share see part ii item  “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities — market information” our cash flow from operations has decreased and will continue to decrease as a result of our disposition activity and we have adjusted our distribution policy with respect to the amount of monthly distribution payments to take into account our disposition activity and current real estate investments we may continue to make strategic asset sales as opportunities become available in the market any future special distributions we make from the proceeds of future dispositions will reduce our estimated value per share and this reduction will be reflected in our updated estimated value per share which we expect to update no later than december   table of contents on january   our board of directors formed the special committee which is composed of all of our independent directors to explore the availability of strategic alternatives involving us as part of the process of exploring strategic alternatives on february   the special committee engaged evercore to act as our financial advisor and to assist us and the special committee with this process under the terms of the engagement evercore provided various financial advisory services as requested by the special committee as customary for an engagement in connection with exploring strategic alternatives although the special committee has engaged evercore to assist us and the special committee with the exploration of strategic alternatives for us we are not obligated to enter into any particular transaction or any transaction at all while the special committee continues to explore strategic alternatives for us the special committee has determined that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders to market some of our assets for sale based on the results of this sales effort the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders to sell one or more of our assets and depending on the scope of the proposed asset sales thereafter to adopt a plan of liquidation that would involve the sale of our remaining assets in the event of such a determination the proposed plan of liquidation would be presented to our stockholders for approval alternatively based on the results of the initial sales effort the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders for us to engage in a limited number of asset sales and continue to operate as a going concern but with a portfolio that is smaller than the present portfolio although we have begun the process of exploring strategic alternatives and are marketing some of our assets for sale there is no assurance that this process will result in stockholder liquidity or provide a return to stockholders that equals or exceeds our estimated value per share cash flows from operating activities as of december    we owned  real estate properties consisting of  office properties and an office campus consisting of eight office buildings and one real estate loan receivable during the year  ended december    net cash provided by operating activities was  million  compared to  million during the year  ended december    the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the timing of lease commission payments we anticipate cash flows from operating activities to decrease to the extent we make additional asset sales cash flows from investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was  million for the year ended december    and primarily consisted of the following •  million of proceeds from the sale of one officeflex property and •  million used for improvements to real estate cash flows from financing activities during the year ended december    net cash used in financing activities was  million and consisted primarily of the following •  million of cash distributions •  million of principal payments on notes payable •  million of proceeds from note payable and •  million of cash used for redemptions of common stock in addition to using our capital resources to meet our debt service obligations for capital expenditures and for operating costs we use our capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor we paid our advisor fees in connection with the acquisition and origination of our assets and pay our advisor fees in connection with the management and disposition of our assets and for certain costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us among the fees payable to our advisor is an asset management fee with respect to investments in real estate we pay our advisor a monthly asset management fee equal to onetwelfth of  of the amount paid or allocated to acquire the investment plus the cost of any subsequent development construction or improvements to the property this amount includes any portion of the investment that was debt financed and is inclusive of acquisition fees and expenses related thereto with respect to investments in loans and any investments other than real estate we pay our advisor a monthly asset management fee calculated each month as onetwelfth of  of the lesser of i the amount paid or allocated to acquire or fund the loan or other investment which amount includes any portion of the investment that was debt financed and is inclusive of acquisition or origination fees and expenses related thereto and ii the outstanding principal amount of such loan or other investment plus the acquisition or origination fees and expenses related to the acquisition or funding of such investment as of the time of calculation we also continue to reimburse our advisor and our dealer manager for certain stockholder services  table of contents as of december    we had  million of cash and cash equivalents and up to  million available for future disbursements under two credit facilities subject to certain conditions and restrictions set forth in the respective loan agreements to meet our operational and capital needs in order to execute our investment strategy we primarily utilized secured debt to finance a portion of our investment portfolio management remains vigilant in monitoring the risks inherent with the use of debt in our portfolio and is taking actions to ensure that these risks including refinance and interest rate risks are properly balanced with the benefit of using leverage we limit our total liabilities to  of the cost before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves of our tangible assets however we may exceed that limit if the majority of the conflicts committee approves each borrowing in excess of such limitation and we disclose such borrowings to our stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing as of december    our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately  of both the cost before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves and book value before deducting depreciation of our tangible assets

the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   related to real estate and real estaterelated investments owned by us throughout both periods presented rental income and tenant reimbursements decreased from  million for the year ended december   to  million for the year ended december    primarily due to the dispositions of two real estate properties subsequent to january   and a net decrease in rental income from properties held throughout both periods  rental income related to properties held throughout both periods decreased primarily due to an overall decrease in occupancy in such properties of  and an aggregate decrease in average annualized base rent per square foot in such properties of  overall we expect rental income and tenant reimbursements to decrease in future periods due to the anticipated dispositions of real estate properties for the years ended december   and   rental income and tenant reimbursements from our real estate properties sold were  million and  million respectively interest income from our real estate loans receivable recognized using the interest method decreased from  million for the year ended december   to  million for the year ended december    primarily as a result of the payoff of a real estate loan receivable in august  interest income from real estate loans receivable in future periods compared to historical periods will decrease as a result of the payoff or sale of our real estate loan receivable other operating income decreased from  million for the year ended december   to  million for the year ended december    primarily due to the dispositions of two real estate properties subsequent to january   and a decrease in parking revenues for properties held throughout both periods overall we expect other operating income to decrease in future periods due to anticipated dispositions of real estate properties for the years ended december   and   other operating income from our real estate properties sold was  and  million  respectively operating maintenance and management costs decreased from  million for the year ended december   to  million  for the year ended december    the decrease was primarily due to the dispositions of two real estate properties subsequent to january   and a decrease in snow removal costs and utility costs for properties held throughout both periods operating maintenance and management costs may increase in future periods as compared to historical periods as a result of inflation overall we expect operating maintenance and management costs to decrease in future periods due to the anticipated dispositions of real estate properties for the years ended december   and   operating maintenance and management costs from our real estate properties sold were  and  million  respectively  table of contents real estate taxes and insurance decreased from  million for the year ended december   to  million  for the year ended december    this decrease was primarily due to the dispositions of two real estate properties subsequent to january   partially offset by a net increase in real estate taxes and insurance for properties held throughout both periods we expect real estate taxes and insurance to decrease in future periods due to the anticipated dispositions of real estate properties for the years ended december   and   real estate taxes and insurance from our real estate properties sold were  million and  million  respectively asset management fees with respect to our real estate and real estaterelated investments decreased from  million for the year ended december   to  million for the year ended december    due to the disposition of two real estate properties and the payoff of a real estate loan receivable subsequent to january   partially offset by an increase in asset management fees due to an overall increase in the average total real estate balance for properties held throughout both periods all asset management fees incurred as of december   have been paid we expect asset management fees to decrease in future periods due to anticipated asset sales or other dispositions for the years ended december   and   asset management fees from our real estate and real estaterelated investments sold or otherwise disposed of were  million and  million respectively general and administrative expenses increased from  million for the year ended december   to  million for the year ended december    this increase was primarily due to professional fees related to the special committee’s engagement of evercore to act as our financial advisor and legal fees related to the anticipated dispositions of our real estate properties see “—liquidity and capital resources” for our discussion on the engagement of evercore depreciation and amortization increased from  million for the year ended december   to  million  for the year ended december    primarily due to the reclassification of two real estate properties from held for sale to held for investment which resulted in a portion of the depreciation and amortization expense being classified as an impairment charge during the year ended december    this increase was offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization due to the disposition of two real estate properties subsequent to january   we expect depreciation and amortization to decrease in future periods due to the anticipated dispositions of real estate properties and an overall decrease in amortization of tenant origination costs related to lease expirations for the years ended december   and   depreciation and amortization from our real estate properties sold or held for sale was  million and  million  respectively interest expense decreased from  million for the year ended december   to  million  for the year ended december    the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to an overall decrease to our total debt outstanding due to loan repayments in connection with dispositions of two real estate properties subsequent to january   and an overall decrease in the average loan balance of our existing notes payable related to properties held throughout both periods included in interest expense is the amortization of deferred financing costs of  million and  million for the years ended december   and   respectively also included in interest expense during the years ended december   and  were  million and  million of termination fees related to the payoff of loans secured by the real estate properties sold subsequent to january   during the years ended december   and   we recorded  million and  million of unrealized gain on interest rate swaps respectively in general we expect interest expense to decrease in future periods due to debt repayments related to assets sold and anticipated asset sales which may be offset by certain fees and costs that may be incurred due to the prepayment of certain loans our interest expense in future periods will also vary based on fluctuations in onemonth libor for our variable rate debt to the extent that such variable rate debt is not subject to an interest rate swap agreement and our level of future borrowings which will depend on the availability and cost of debt financing draws on our credit facilities and any debt repayments we make in addition our interest expense in future periods will vary based on fair value changes with respect to our interest rate swaps that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges for the years ended december   and   interest expense from our real estate properties sold was  million and  million  respectively  table of contents during the year ended december    we recognized aggregate impairment charges of  million  including an impairment charge of  million to writedown the carrying value of the    campus drive buildings an office property located in florham park new jersey to its estimated fair value as a result of changes in cash flow estimates the decrease in cash flow projections was primarily due to i the lack of demand in the florham park office rental market resulting in slower rent growth and longer lease up periods and ii an increase in projected vacancy related to a tenant occupying  rentable square feet or approximately  of the    campus drive buildings this tenant’s lease expired in november  as a result we revised our cash flow projections for longer lease up periods and additional tenant improvement costs and leasing concessions required to attract new tenants in addition during the year ended december   we recorded aggregate impairment charges of  million with respect to two real estate properties that were reclassified from held for sale to held for investment the impairment charge was recorded to adjust the carrying values of the properties for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized if the properties had always been classified as held for investment which otherwise would have been recorded through depreciation and amortization expense we did not recognize any impairment charge during the year ended december    we recognized a gain on sale of real estate of

periods for the years ended december   and  depreciation and amortization from our real estate properties sold or held for sale was  and  million respectively interest expense decreased from  million for the year ended december   to  million for the year ended december   the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to an overall decrease to our total debt outstanding due to loan payoffs or

periods included in interest expense is the amortization of deferred financing costs of  million and  million for the years ended december   and  respectively also included in interest expense during

of termination fees related to the payoff of loans secured by the real estate properties sold during the year ended december   as of december   we had dedesignated all of our interest rate swap agreements as a result changes to the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements are recognized directly in earnings as interest expense during the year ended december   we recorded  million of unrealized gain on interest rate swaps for the years ended december   and  interest expense from our real estate properties sold was  million and  million respectively during the year ended december   we recorded aggregate impairment charges of  million including an impairment charge of  million to writedown the carrying value of the    campus drive buildings an office property located in florham park new jersey to its estimated fair value as a result of changes in cash flow estimates please see “ — comparison of the year ended december   versus the year ended december  ” above for a discussion of the  impairment charges during the year ended december   we recognized an impairment charge of  million consisting of i  million with respect to a real estate property held for investment ii  million with respect to two of our real estate properties that were reclassified from held for sale to held for investment and iii  million on a real estate property sold during the year ended december   the impairment charge for the property held for investment was to reduce the carrying value of this property to its estimated fair value  the impairment was caused by us revising our cash flow projections and the estimated hold period of the investment due to longer than estimated leaseup periods and lower projected rental rates the impairment charge related to the reclassified properties was recorded to adjust the carrying values of the properties for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized if the properties had always been classified as held for investment which otherwise would have been recorded through depreciation and amortization expense  table of contents we recognized a gain on sale of real estate of  million related to the disposition of one office property during the year ended december   during the year ended december   we recognized a gain on sale of real estate of  million related to the disposition of nine office properties one industrial property a portfolio of four industrial properties and a leasehold interest in one industrial property funds from operations and modified funds from operations we believe that ffo is a beneficial indicator of the performance of an equity reit we compute ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition ffo represents net income excluding gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and usefullife estimates impairment losses on real estate assets depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures we believe ffo facilitates comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other reits however our computation of ffo may not be comparable to other reits that do not define ffo in accordance with the nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do our management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves as a result we believe that the use of ffo together with the required gaap presentations provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and provides a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating financing and investing activities changes in accounting rules have resulted in a substantial increase in the number of nonoperating and noncash items included in the calculation of ffo as a result our management also uses modified funds from operations “mffo” as an indicator of our ongoing performance as well as our dividend sustainability mffo excludes from ffo acquisition fees and expenses adjustments related to contingent purchase price obligations amounts relating to straightline rents and amortization of above and below market intangible lease assets and liabilities accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments amortization of closing costs relating to debt investments impairments of real estaterelated investments marktomarket adjustments included in net income and gains or losses included in net income for the extinguishment or sale of debt or hedges we compute mffo in accordance with the definition of mffo included in the practice guideline issued by the ipa in november  as interpreted by management our computation of mffo may not be comparable to other reits that do not compute mffo in accordance with the current ipa definition or that interpret the current ipa definition differently than we do we believe that mffo is helpful as a measure of ongoing operating performance because it excludes nonoperating items included in ffo  mffo excludes noncash items such as straightline rental revenue  additionally we believe that mffo provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance indicators and analysis used by management in addition to net income and cash flows from operating activities as defined by gaap to evaluate the sustainability of our operating performance  mffo provides comparability in evaluating the operating performance of our portfolio with other nontraded reits which typically have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies  mffo or an equivalent measure is routinely reported by nontraded reits and we believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes ffo and mffo are nongaap financial measures and do not represent net income as defined by gaap net income as defined by gaap is the most relevant measure in determining our operating performance because ffo and mffo include adjustments that investors may deem subjective such as adding back expenses such as depreciation and amortization and the other items described above accordingly ffo and mffo should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indicator of our current and historical operating performance in addition ffo and mffo do not represent cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered an indication of our liquidity we believe ffo and mffo in addition to net income and cash flows from operating activities as defined by gaap are meaningful supplemental performance measures however neither ffo nor mffo reflects adjustments for the operations of properties and real estaterelated investments sold or held for sale during the periods presented during periods of significant disposition activity ffo and mffo are much more limited measures of future performance and dividend sustainability in connection with our presentation of ffo and mffo we are providing information related to the proportion of mffo related to properties sold and real estaterelated investments sold or repaid as of december     table of contents although mffo includes other adjustments the exclusion of straightline rent the amortization of above and belowmarket leases the amortization of discounts and closing costs prepayment fees received on notes receivable termination fees on derivative instruments unrealized gains losses on derivative instruments and prepayment fees related to the extinguishment of debt are the most significant adjustments for the periods presented  we have excluded these items based on the following economic considerations • adjustments for straightline rent  these are adjustments to rental revenue as required by gaap to recognize contractual lease payments on a straightline basis over the life of the respective lease  we have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of mffo to more appropriately reflect the current economic impact of our inplace leases while also providing investors with a useful supplemental metric that addresses core operating performance by removing rent we expect to receive in a future period or rent that was received in a prior period • amortization of above and belowmarket leases   similar to depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and lease related costs that are excluded from ffo gaap implicitly assumes that the value of intangible lease assets and liabilities diminishes predictably over time and requires that these charges be recognized currently in revenue  since real estate values and market lease rates in the aggregate have historically risen or fallen with local market conditions management believes that by excluding these charges mffo provides useful supplemental information on the realized economics of the real estate • amortization of discounts and closing costs   discounts and closing costs related to debt investments are amortized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to interest income  this application results in income recognition that is different than the underlying contractual terms of the debt investments  we have excluded the amortization of discounts and closing costs related to our debt investments in our calculation of mffo to more appropriately reflect the economic impact of our debt investments as discounts will not be economically recognized until the loan is repaid and closing costs are essentially the same as acquisition fees and expenses on real estate  we believe excluding these items provides investors with a useful supplemental metric that directly addresses core operating performance • prepayment fees received on notes receivable   prepayment fees related to notes receivable are included in interest income from real estate loans receivable  although these amounts increase net income we exclude them from mffo to more appropriately present the ongoing operating performance of our real estaterelated investments on a comparative basis • termination fees on derivative instruments termination fees on derivative instruments are included in interest expense although these amounts reduce net income we exclude them from mffo to more appropriately reflect the ongoing impact of our interest rate swap agreements • unrealized gains losses on derivative instruments   these adjustments include unrealized gains losses from marktomarket adjustments on interest rate swaps and losses due to hedge ineffectiveness  the change in fair value of interest rate swaps not designated as a hedge and the change in fair value of the ineffective portion of interest rate swaps are noncash adjustments recognized directly in earnings and are included in interest expense  we have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of mffo to more appropriately reflect the economic impact of our interest rate swap agreements and • prepayment fees related to the extinguishment of debt prepayment fees related to the extinguishment of debt are generally included in interest expense although these amounts reduce net income we exclude them from mffo to more appropriately present the ongoing operating performance of

    second quarter              third quarter              fourth quarter                                  assumes each share was issued and outstanding each day that was a record date for distributions during the periods presented  other than special distributions distributions generally are paid on a monthly basis on or about the first business day of the following month  table of contents for the year ended december    we paid aggregate distributions of  million all of which were paid in cash ffo and cash flow from operations for the year ended december   were  million and  million  respectively  we funded our total distributions paid with  million of current period cash flow from operations and  million of cash on hand for purposes of determining the source of our distributions paid we assume first that we use cash flow from operations from the relevant periods to fund distribution payments see the reconciliation of ffo to net income above over the long term we expect that our distributions will generally be paid from cash flow from operations and ffo from current or prior periods except with respect to distributions related to sales of our assets and distributions related to the repayment of principal under our mortgage loan investment during the year ended december    we sold one officeflex property during the year ended december    we sold one office property and received the repayment of one of our real estate loans receivable and during the year ended december   we sold  real estate properties and received repayments of three of our real estate loans receivable our cash flow from operations has decreased and will continue to decrease as a result of our disposition activity and we have adjusted our distribution policy with respect to the amount of monthly distribution payments to take into account our disposition activity and current real estate investments we may continue to make strategic asset sales as opportunities become available in the market any future special distributions we make from the proceeds of future dispositions will reduce our estimated value per share and this reduction will be reflected in our updated estimated value per share which we expect to update no later than december  our operating performance and ability to pay distributions from our cash flow from operations andor the disposition of our assets cannot be accurately predicted and may deteriorate in the future due to numerous factors including those discussed under “forwardlooking statements” part i item  “business — market outlook — real estate and real estate finance markets” part i item a “risk factors” part ii item  “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — results of operations” those factors include the future operating performance of our investments in the existing real estate and financial environment the success and economic viability of our tenants the ability of our borrower to continue to make debt service payments andor to repay its loan upon maturity our ability to refinance existing indebtedness at comparable terms changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt obligations our ability to successfully dispose of some of our assets and the sources and amounts of cash we have available for distributions critical accounting policies below is a discussion of the accounting policies that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments and assumptions require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods with different estimates or assumptions materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements additionally other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses revenue recognition real estate we recognize minimum rent including rental abatements lease incentives and contractual fixed increases attributable to operating leases on a straightline basis over the term of the related leases when collectibility is reasonably assured and record amounts expected to be received in later years as deferred rent receivable if the lease provides for tenant improvements we determine whether the tenant improvements for accounting purposes are owned by the tenant or by us when we are the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance including amounts that a tenant can take in the form of cash or a credit against its rent that is funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including but not limited to • whether the lease stipulates how a tenant improvement allowance may be spent • whether the amount of a tenant improvement allowance is in excess of market rates • whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term • whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or generalpurpose in nature and • whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease  table of contents we record property operating expense reimbursements due from tenants for common area maintenance real estate taxes and other recoverable costs in the period the related expenses are incurred we make estimates of the collectibility of our tenant receivables related to base rents including deferred rent receivable expense reimbursements and other revenue or income we specifically analyze accounts receivable deferred rent receivable historical bad debts customer creditworthiness current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts in addition with respect to tenants in bankruptcy we make estimates of the expected recovery of prepetition and postpetition claims in assessing the estimated collectibility of the related receivable in some cases the ultimate resolution of these claims can exceed one year when a tenant is in bankruptcy we will record a bad debt reserve for the tenant’s receivable balance and generally will not recognize subsequent rental revenue until cash is received or until the tenant is no longer in bankruptcy and has the ability to make rental payments we recognize a gain on sales of real estate upon the closing of a transaction with the purchaser gains on real estate sold are recognized using the full accrual method when collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured we are not obligated to perform additional activities that may be considered significant the initial investment from the buyer is sufficient and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied gain on sales of real estate may be deferred in whole or in part until the requirements for gain recognition have been met real estate loans receivable interest income on our real estate loans receivable is recognized on an accrual basis over the life of the investment using the interest method direct loan origination fees and origination or acquisition costs as well as acquisition premiums or discounts are amortized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to interest income we will place loans on nonaccrual status when any portion of principal or interest is  days past due or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collection of principal or interest when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status we will reserve for any unpaid accrued interest and generally will not recognize subsequent interest income until the cash is received or the loan returns to accrual status we will resume the accrual of interest if we determine the collection of interest according to the contractual terms of the loan is probable real estate depreciation and amortization real estate costs related to the acquisition and improvement of properties are capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life of the asset on a straightline basis repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized repair and maintenance costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of the real estate asset we consider the period of future benefit of an asset to determine its appropriate useful life expenditures for tenant improvements are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of the tenant’s lease term or expected useful life we anticipate the estimated useful lives of our assets by class to be generally as follows buildings  years building improvements  years tenant improvements shorter of lease term or expected useful life tenant origination and absorption costs remaining term of related leases including belowmarket renewal periods impairment of real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities may not be recoverable or realized when indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities may not be recoverable we assess the recoverability by estimating whether we will recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities through its undiscounted future cash flows and its eventual disposition if based on this analysis we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities we would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities projecting future cash flows involves estimating expected future operating income and expenses related to the real estate and its related intangible assets and liabilities as well as market and other trends using inappropriate assumptions to estimate cash flows could result in incorrect fair values of the real estate and its related intangible assets and liabilities and could result in the overstatement of the carrying values of our real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities and an overstatement of our net income  table of contents real estate held for sale and discontinued operations we generally consider real estate to be “held for sale” when the following criteria are met i management commits to a plan to sell the property ii the property is available for sale immediately iii the property is actively being marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value iv the sale of the property within one year is considered probable and v significant changes to the plan to sell are not expected real estate that is held for sale and its related assets are classified as “real estate held for sale” and “assets related to real estate held for sale” respectively for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements notes payable and other liabilities related to real estate held for sale are classified as “notes payable related to real estate held for sale” and “liabilities related to real estate held for sale” respectively for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements real estate classified as held for sale is no longer depreciated and is reported at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell additionally with respect to properties that were classified as held for sale in financial statements prior to january   we record the operating results as discontinued operations for all periods presented if the operations have been or are expected to be eliminated and we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the property following the sale operating results of properties that were disposed of or classified as held for sale in the ordinary course of business during the years ended december    and  that had not been classified as held for sale in financial statements prior to january   are included in continuing operations on our consolidated statements of operations change in a plan to sell when real estate is initially considered “held for sale” it is measured at the lower of its depreciated book value or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell changes in the market may compel us to decide to reclassify a property that was designated as held for sale to held for investment  a property that is reclassified from held for sale to held for investment is measured and recorded at the lower of i its carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale adjusted for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used or ii its fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell any adjustment to the carrying amount of the property as a result of the reclassification is included in income from continuing operations as an impairment charge on real estate held for investment real estate loan receivable our real estate loan receivable is recorded at amortized cost net of loan loss reserves if any and evaluated for impairment at each balance sheet date the amortized cost of a real estate loan receivable is the outstanding unpaid principal balance net of unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts and unamortized costs and fees directly associated with the origination or acquisition of the loan as of december   we did not have a loan loss reserve and we did not record any impairment losses related to our real estate loans receivable during the years ended december    and  however in the future we may experience losses from our investments in loans receivable requiring us to record loan loss reserves realized losses on individual loans could be material and significantly exceed any recorded reserves the reserve for loan losses is a valuation allowance that reflects our estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date the reserve is adjusted through “provision for loan losses” in our consolidated statements of operations and is decreased by chargeoffs to specific loans when losses are confirmed we consider a loan to be impaired when based upon current information and events we believe that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement we also consider a loan to be impaired if we grant the borrower a concession through a modification of the loan terms or if we expect to receive assets including equity interests in the borrower with fair values that are less than the carrying value of our loan in satisfaction of the loan a reserve is established when the present value of payments expected to be received observable market prices the estimated fair value of the collateral for loans that are dependent on the collateral for repayment or amounts expected to be received in satisfaction of a loan are lower than the carrying value of that loan failure to recognize impairments would result in the overstatement of earnings and the carrying value of our real estate loans held for investment actual losses if any could differ significantly from estimated amounts  table of contents marketable securities we classify our investments in marketable securities as availableforsale since we may sell them prior to their maturity but do not hold them principally for the purpose of making frequent investments and sales with the objective of generating profits on shortterm differences in price these investments are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss estimated fair values are generally based on quoted market prices when available or on estimates provided by independent pricing sources or dealers who make markets in such securities in certain circumstances such as when the market for the securities becomes inactive we may determine it is appropriate to perform an internal valuation of the securities upon the sale of a security the previously recognized unrealized gain loss is reversed out of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and the actual realized gain loss is recognized in earnings on a quarterly basis we evaluate our marketable securities for otherthantemporary impairment we review the projected future cash flows from these securities for changes in assumptions due to prepayments credit loss experience and other factors if based on our quarterly estimate of cash flows there has been an adverse change in the estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously estimated the present value of the revised cash flows is less than the present value previously estimated and the fair value of the securities is less than their amortized cost basis an otherthantemporary impairment is deemed to have occurred we recognize interest income on marketable securities that are beneficial interests in securitized financial assets and are rated “aa” and above on an accrual basis according to the contractual terms of the securities discounts or premiums are amortized to interest income over the life of the investment using the interest method we recognize interest income on marketable securities that are beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that are rated below “aa” using the effective yield method which requires us to periodically project estimated cash flows related to these securities and recognize interest income at an interest rate equivalent to the estimated yield on the security as calculated using the security’s estimated cash flows and amortized cost basis or reference amount changes in the estimated cash flows are recognized through an adjustment to the yield on the security on a prospective basis projecting cash flows for these types of securities requires significant judgment which may have a significant impact on the timing of revenue recognized on these investments we are required to distinguish between otherthantemporary impairments related to credit and otherthantemporary impairments related to other factors eg market fluctuations on our debt securities that we do not intend to sell and where it is not likely that we will be required to sell the security prior to the anticipated recovery of its amortized cost basis we calculate the credit component of the otherthantemporary impairment as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and the present value of its estimated cash flows discounted at the yield used to recognize interest income the credit component will be charged to earnings and the component related to other factors is recorded to other comprehensive income loss derivative instruments we enter into derivative instruments for risk management purposes to hedge our exposure to cash flow variability caused by changing interest rates on our variable rate notes payable we record these derivative instruments at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets derivative instruments designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges the change in fair value of the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded as other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss and consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity the changes in fair value for derivative instruments that are not designated as a hedge or that do not meet the hedge accounting criteria are recorded as gain or loss on derivative instruments in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our riskmanagement objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions this process includes designating all derivative instruments that are part of a hedging relationship to specific forecasted transactions or recognized obligations on the consolidated balance sheets we also assess and document both at the hedging instrument’s inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter whether the derivative instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the respective hedged items when we determine that a derivative instrument ceases to be highly effective as a hedge or that it is probable the underlying forecasted transaction will not occur we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively and reclassify amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to earnings  table of contents the termination of a cash flow hedge prior to the maturity date may result in a net derivative instrument gain or loss that continues to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is reclassified into earnings over the period of the original forecasted hedged transaction ie libor based debt service payments unless it is probable that the original forecasted hedged transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period as documented at the inception of the hedging relationship or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter if it is probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will not occur either by the end of the originally specified time period or within the additional twomonth period of time that derivative instrument gain or loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss shall be reclassified into earnings immediately fair value measurements under gaap we are required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis in addition we are required to measure other nonfinancial and financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis eg carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and longlived assets fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the gaap fair value framework uses a threetiered approach fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories • level  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities • level  quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelderived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets and • level  prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable when available we utilize quoted market prices from independent thirdparty sources to determine fair value and classify such items in level  or level  in instances where the market for a financial instrument is not active regardless of the availability of a nonbinding quoted market price observable inputs might not be relevant and could require us to make a significant adjustment to derive a fair value measurement additionally in an inactive market a market price quoted from an independent third party may rely more on models with inputs based on information available only to that independent third party when we determine the market for a financial instrument owned by us to be illiquid or when market transactions for similar instruments do not appear orderly we use several valuation sources including internal valuations discounted cash flow analysis and quoted market prices and establish a fair value by assigning weights to the various valuation sources additionally when determining the fair value of liabilities in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available we measure fair value using i a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as assets or ii another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of fair value measurement such as the income approach or the market approach changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values in this regard the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and in many cases may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument we consider the following factors to be indicators of an inactive market i there are few recent transactions ii price quotations are not based on current information iii price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers for example some brokered markets iv indexes that previously were highly correlated with the fair values of the asset or liability are demonstrably uncorrelated with recent indications of fair value for that asset or liability v there is a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums yields or performance indicators such as delinquency rates or loss severities for observed transactions or quoted prices when compared with our estimate of expected cash flows considering all available market data about credit and other nonperformance risk for the asset or liability vi there is a wide bidask spread or significant increase in the bidask spread vii there is a significant decline or absence of a market for new issuances that is a primary market for the asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities and viii little information is released publicly for example a principaltoprincipal market we consider the following factors to be indicators of nonorderly transactions i there was not adequate exposure to the market for a period before the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets or liabilities under current market conditions ii there was a usual and customary marketing period but the seller marketed the asset or liability to a single market participant iii the seller is in or near bankruptcy or receivership that is distressed or the seller was required to sell to meet regulatory or legal requirements that is forced and iv the transaction price is an outlier when compared with other recent transactions for the same or similar assets or liabilities  table of contents income taxes we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute at least  of our annual reit taxable income to stockholders which is computed without regard to the dividendspaid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with gaap as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the internal revenue service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders however we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a reit subsequent events we evaluate subsequent events up until the date the consolidated financial statements are issued distributions paid on january   we paid distributions of  million  which related to distributions declared for december  in the amount of  per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on december   on february   we paid distributions of  million  which related to distributions declared for january  in the amount of  per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on january   on march   we paid distributions of  million  which related to distributions declared for february  in the amount of  per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on february   distributions declared on march   our board of directors declared a march  distribution in the amount of  per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on march   which we expect to pay in april  and an april  distribution in the amount of  per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on april   which we expect to pay in may  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of borrowings used to maintain liquidity to fund the financing and refinancing of our real estate and real estaterelated investment portfolio and to fund our operations our profitability and the value of our investment portfolio may be adversely affected during any period as a result of interest rate changes our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings prepayment penalties and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs we have managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by maintaining a ratio of fixed rate longterm debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level in addition we may utilize a variety of financial instruments including interest rate caps floors and swap agreements in order to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations when we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interestearning assets or interestbearing liabilities we may be subject to certain risks including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments of distributions to our stockholders and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments  table of

real estaterelated investments at a combination of fixed and variable rates interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt or fixed rate real estate loan receivable unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated however interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments as of december    the fair value and carrying value of our fixed rate real estate loan receivable were  million and  million  respectively the fair value estimate of our real estate loan receivable is calculated using an internal valuation model that considers the expected cash flows for the loan underlying collateral value for collateraldependent loans and the estimated yield requirements of institutional investors for loans with similar characteristics including remaining loan term loantovalue type of collateral and other credit enhancements as of december    the fair value of our fixed rate debt was  million and the outstanding principal balance of our fixed rate debt was  million  the fair value estimate of our fixed rate debt is calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing rates we would expect to pay for debt of a similar type and remaining maturity if the loans were originated as of december    with respect to our fixed rate instruments we do not expect that fluctuations in interest rates and the resulting change in fair value of our fixed rate instruments would have a significant impact on our ongoing operations conversely movements in interest rates on our variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments however changes in required risk premiums would result in changes in the fair value of

of the conflicts committee review of our policies the conflicts committee has reviewed our policies and determined that they are in the best interest of our stockholders set forth below is a discussion of the basis for that determination portfolio management disposition and distribution policy  on january   our board of directors formed the special committee composed of all of our independent directors to explore the availability of strategic alternatives involving us as part of the process of exploring strategic alternatives on february   the special committee engaged evercore to act as our financial advisor and to assist us and the special committee with this process under the terms of the engagement evercore provided various financial advisory services as requested by the special committee as customary for an engagement in connection with exploring strategic alternatives although the special committee engaged evercore to assist us and the special committee with the exploration of strategic alternatives for us we are not obligated to enter into any particular transaction or any transaction at all while the special committee continues to explore strategic alternatives for us the special committee has determined that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders to market some of our assets for sale based on the results of this sales effort the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders to sell one or more of our assets and depending on the scope of the proposed asset sales thereafter to adopt a plan of liquidation that would involve the sale of our remaining assets in the event of such a determination the proposed plan of liquidation would be presented to our stockholders for approval alternatively based on the results of the initial sales effort the board of directors may conclude that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders for us to engage in a limited number of asset sales and continue to operate as a going concern but with a portfolio that is smaller than the present portfolio although we have begun the process of exploring strategic alternatives and are marketing some of our assets for sale there is no assurance that this process will result in stockholder liquidity or provide a return to stockholders that equals or exceeds our estimated value per share our focus in  is to continue to strategically sell assets and consider special distributions to stockholders negotiate lease renewals or new leases that facilitate the sales process and enhance property stability for prospective buyers complete capital improvement projects such as renovations or amenity enhancements to attract quality buyers and finalize the strategic alternatives assessment and decide on a course of action we originally intended to hold our core properties for four to seven years however economic and market conditions may influence us to hold our investments for different periods of time and we currently expect our hold period for the majority of our remaining properties may last for a few more years we intend to hold our real estaterelated investment until maturity our advisor has developed a welldefined exit strategy for each investment we make and periodically performs a holdsell analysis on each asset these periodic analyses focus on the remaining available value enhancement opportunities for the asset the demand for the asset in the marketplace market conditions and our overall portfolio objectives to determine if the sale of the asset whether via an individual sale or as part of a portfolio sale or merger would generate a favorable return to our stockholders we may sell an asset before the end of the expected holding period if we believe that market conditions and asset positioning have maximized its value or the sale of the asset would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders during the year ended december   we sold one officeflex property since inception we have sold  properties and we have sold or received principal repayments on seven of our real estate loans receivable as discussed above we plan to make certain strategic asset sales and from time to time may declare special distributions to our stockholders that would be funded with the net proceeds from those asset sales or from cash flow from other sources over the long term we expect that our distributions will generally be paid from cash flow from operations and ffo from current or prior periods except with respect to distributions related to sales of our assets and distributions related to the repayment of principal under our mortgage loan investment our cash flow from operations has decreased and will continue to decrease as a result of our disposition activity and we have adjusted our distribution policy with respect to the amount of monthly distribution payments to take into account our disposition activity and current real estate investments any future special distributions we make from the proceeds of future dispositions will reduce our estimated value per share and this reduction will be reflected in our updated estimated value per share which we expect to update no later than december   table of contents our operating performance and ability to pay distributions from our cash flow from operations andor the disposition of our assets cannot be accurately predicted and may deteriorate in the future due to numerous factors including the future operating performance of our investments in the existing real estate and the financial environment the success and economic viability of our tenants the ability of our borrower to continue to make its debt service payments andor to repay the loan upon maturity our ability to refinance existing indebtedness at comparable terms changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt obligations our ability to successfully dispose of some of our assets and the sources and amounts of cash we have available for distributions distributions declared per common share were  in the aggregate for the year ended december   distributions declared per common share assumes each share was issued and outstanding at each record date for distributions distributions per common share were based on a monthly record date for each month during the period commencing january  through december  acquisition and investment policies  we did not acquire any real estate properties or acquire or originate any real estate loans receivable during the period from january   through january   and we do not expect to make new acquisitions of real estate or real estaterelated investments in the future we used substantially all of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to invest in and manage a diverse portfolio of real estate and real estaterelated investments we diversified our portfolio by investment size investment type investment risk and geographic region with the goal of obtaining a portfolio of incomeproducing real estate and real estaterelated assets that provide attractive and stable returns to our stockholders and would allow us to preserve and return our stockholders’ capital contributions as of january   we owned  real estate properties consisting of  office properties and an office campus consisting of eight office buildings and one real estate loan receivable see “—disposition policies” below borrowing policies  in order to execute our investment strategy we primarily utilized secured debt to finance a portion of our investment portfolio management remains vigilant in monitoring the risks inherent with the use of debt in our portfolio and is taking actions to ensure that these risks including refinance and interest rate risks are properly balanced with the benefit of using leverage we limit our total liabilities to  of the cost before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves of our tangible assets however we may exceed that limit if the majority of the conflicts committee approves each borrowing in excess of this limitation and we disclose such borrowings to our stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing as of january   our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately  of both the cost before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves and book value before deducting depreciation of our tangible assets respectively

fixed increases attributable to operating leases on a straightline basis over the term of the related leases when collectibility is reasonably assured and records amounts expected to be received in later years as deferred rent receivable if the lease provides for tenant improvements the company determines whether the tenant improvements for accounting purposes are owned by the tenant or the company when the company is the owner of the tenant improvements the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed when the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance including amounts that a tenant can take in the form of cash or a credit against its rent that is funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including but not limited to • whether the lease stipulates how a tenant improvement allowance may be spent • whether the amount of a tenant improvement allowance is in excess of market rates • whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term • whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or generalpurpose in nature and • whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease the company makes estimates of the collectibility of its tenant receivables related to base rents including deferred rent receivable expense reimbursements and other revenue or income management specifically analyzes accounts receivable deferred rent receivable historical bad debts customer creditworthiness current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts in addition with respect to tenants in bankruptcy management makes estimates of the expected recovery of prepetition and postpetition claims in assessing the estimated collectibility of the related receivable in some cases the ultimate resolution of these claims can exceed one year when a tenant is in bankruptcy the company will record a bad debt reserve for the tenant’s receivable balance and generally will not recognize subsequent rental revenue until cash is received or until the tenant is no longer in bankruptcy and has the ability to make rental payments the company recognizes a gain on sales of real estate upon the closing of a transaction with the purchaser gains on real estate sold are recognized using the full accrual method when collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured the company is not obligated to perform additional activities that may be considered significant the initial investment from the buyer is sufficient and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied gain on sales of real estate may be deferred in whole or in part until the requirements for gain recognition have been met real estate loans receivable interest income on the company’s real estate loan receivable is recognized on an accrual basis over the life of the investment using the interest method direct loan origination fees and origination or acquisition costs as well as acquisition premiums or discounts are amortized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to interest income the company will place a loan on nonaccrual status when any portion of principal or interest is  days past due or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collection of principal or interest when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the company will reserve for any unpaid accrued interest and generally will not recognize subsequent interest income until the cash is received or the loan returns to accrual status the company will resume the accrual of interest if it determines the collection of interest according to the

related intangible assets and liabilities the company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of its real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities may not be recoverable or realized when indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities may not be recoverable the company assesses the recoverability by estimating whether the company will recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities through its undiscounted future cash flows and its eventual disposition if based on this analysis the company does not believe that it will be able to recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities the company would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities real estate held for sale and discontinued operations the company generally considers real estate to be “held for sale” when the following criteria are met i management commits to a plan to sell the property ii the property is available for sale immediately iii the property is actively being marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value iv the sale of the property within one year is considered probable and v significant changes to the plan to sell are not expected real estate that is held for sale and its related assets are

and other liabilities related to real estate held for sale are classified as “notes payable related to real estate held for sale” and “liabilities related to real estate held for sale” respectively

reserves if any and evaluated for impairment at each balance sheet date the amortized cost of a real estate loan receivable is the outstanding unpaid principal balance net of unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts and unamortized costs and fees directly associated with the origination or acquisition of the loan as of december    there was no loan loss reserve and the company did not record any impairment losses related to the real estate loans receivable during the years ended december     and   however in the future the company may experience losses from its investments in loans receivable requiring the company to record loan loss reserves realized losses on individual loans could be material and significantly exceed any recorded reserves the reserve for loan losses is a valuation allowance that reflects management’s estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date the reserve is adjusted through “provision for loan losses” on the company’s consolidated statements of operations and is decreased by chargeoffs to specific loans when losses are confirmed the company considers a loan to be impaired when based upon current information and events it believes that it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement the company also considers a loan to be impaired if it grants the borrower a concession through a modification of the loan terms or if it expects to receive assets including equity interests in the borrower with fair values that are less than the carrying value of the loan in satisfaction of the loan a reserve is established when the present value of payments expected to be received observable market prices the estimated fair value of the collateral for loans that are dependent on the collateral for repayment or amounts expected to be received in satisfaction of a loan are lower than the carrying value of that loan failure to recognize impairments would result in the overstatement of earnings and the carrying value of the company’s real estate loans held for investment actual losses if any could differ significantly from estimated amounts marketable securities the company classifies its investments in marketable securities as availableforsale since the company may sell them prior to their maturity but does not hold them principally for the purpose of making frequent investments and sales with the objective of generating profits on shortterm differences in price these investments are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss estimated fair values are generally based on quoted market prices when available or on estimates provided by independent pricing sources or dealers who make markets in such securities in certain circumstances such as when the market for the securities becomes inactive the company may determine it is appropriate to perform an internal valuation of the securities upon the sale of a security the previously recognized unrealized gain loss is reversed out of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and the actual realized gain loss is recognized in earnings on a quarterly basis the company evaluates its marketable securities for otherthantemporary impairment the company reviews the projected future cash flows from these securities for changes in assumptions due to prepayments credit loss experience and other factors if based on the company’s quarterly estimate of cash flows there has been an adverse change in the estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously estimated the present value of the revised cash flows is less than the present value previously estimated and the fair value of the securities is less than their amortized cost basis an otherthantemporary impairment is deemed to have occurred the company recognizes interest income on marketable securities that are beneficial interests in securitized financial assets and are rated “aa” and above on an accrual basis according to the contractual terms of the securities discounts or premiums are amortized to interest income over the life of the investment using the interest method the company recognizes interest income on marketable securities that are beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that are rated below “aa” using the effective yield method which requires the company to periodically project estimated cash flows related to these securities and recognize interest income at an interest rate equivalent to the estimated yield on the security as calculated using the security’s estimated cash flows and amortized cost basis or reference amount changes in the estimated cash flows are recognized through an adjustment to the yield on the security on a prospective basis projecting cash flows for these types of securities requires significant judgment which may have a significant impact on the timing of revenue recognized on these investments f table of contents kbs real estate investment trust ii inc notes to consolidated financial statements continued december   the company

does not intend to sell and where it is not likely that the company will be required to sell the security prior to the anticipated recovery of its amortized cost basis the company calculates the credit component of the otherthantemporary impairment as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and the present value of its estimated cash flows discounted at the yield used to recognize interest income the credit component will be charged to earnings and the component related to other factors is recorded to other comprehensive income loss cash and cash equivalents the company considers all shortterm with an original maturity of three months or less highlyliquid investments utilized as part of the company’s cashmanagement activities to be cash equivalents cash equivalents may include cash and shortterm investments shortterm investments are stated at cost which approximates fair value the company’s cash and cash equivalents balance exceeds federally insurable limits as of december    the company monitors the cash balances in its operating accounts and adjusts the cash balances as appropriate however these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets to date the company has experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in its operating accounts rents and other receivables the company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under lease agreements in addition the company maintains an allowance for deferred rent receivable that arises from the straightlining of rents the company exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status of its tenants in developing these estimates derivative instruments the company enters into derivative instruments for risk management purposes to hedge its exposure to cash flow variability caused by changing interest rates on its variable rate notes payable the company records these derivative instruments at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets derivative instruments designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges the change in fair value of the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded as other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss and consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity the changes in fair value for derivative instruments that are not designated as a hedge or that do not meet the hedge accounting criteria are recorded as gain or loss on derivative instruments in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its riskmanagement objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions this process includes designating all derivative instruments that are part of a hedging relationship to specific forecasted transactions or recognized obligations on the consolidated balance sheets the company also assesses and documents both at the hedging instrument’s inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter whether the derivative instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the respective hedged items when the company determines that a derivative instrument ceases to be highly effective as a hedge or that it is probable the underlying forecasted transaction will not occur the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively and reclassifies amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to earnings the termination of a cash flow hedge prior to the maturity date may result in a net derivative instrument gain or loss that continues to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is reclassified into earnings over the period of the original forecasted hedged transaction ie libor based debt service payments unless it is probable that the original forecasted hedged transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period as documented at the inception of the hedging relationship or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter if it is probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will not occur either by the end of the originally specified time period or within the additional twomonth period of time that derivative instrument gain or loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss shall be reclassified into earnings immediately

loan fees legal fees and other thirdparty costs associated with obtaining financing and are presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability these costs are amortized over the terms of the respective financing agreements using the interest method unamortized deferred financing costs are generally expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity unless specific rules are met that would allow for the carryover of such costs to the refinanced debt deferred financing costs incurred before an associated debt liability is recognized are included in prepaid and other assets on the balance sheet costs incurred in seeking financing transactions that do not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not close fair value measurements under gaap the company is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis in addition the company is required to measure other nonfinancial and financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis eg carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and longlived assets fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the gaap fair value framework uses a threetiered approach fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories • level  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities • level  quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelderived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets and • level  prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable when available the company utilizes quoted market prices from independent thirdparty sources to determine fair value and classifies such items in level  or level  in instances where the market for a financial instrument is not active regardless of the availability of a nonbinding quoted market price observable inputs might not be relevant and could require the company to make a significant adjustment to derive a fair value measurement additionally in an inactive market a market price quoted from an independent third party may rely more on models with inputs based on information available only to that independent third party when the company determines the market for a financial instrument owned by the company to be illiquid or when market transactions for similar instruments do not appear orderly the company uses several valuation sources including internal valuations discounted cash flow analysis and quoted market prices and establishes a fair value by assigning weights to the various valuation sources additionally when determining the fair value of liabilities in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available the company measures fair value using i a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as assets or ii another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of fair value measurement such as the income approach or the market approach changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values in this regard the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and in many cases may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument f table of

i there are few recent transactions ii price quotations are not based on current information iii price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers for example some brokered markets iv indexes that previously were highly correlated with the fair values of the asset or liability are demonstrably uncorrelated with recent indications of fair value for that asset or liability

or significant increase in the bidask spread vii there is a significant decline or absence of a market for new issuances that is a primary market for the asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities and viii little information is released publicly for example a principaltoprincipal market the company considers the following factors to be indicators of nonorderly transactions i there was not adequate exposure to the market for a period before the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets or liabilities under current market conditions ii there was a usual and customary marketing period but the seller marketed the asset or liability to a single market participant iii the seller is in or near

debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities b cash payments relating to contingent consideration made soon after an acquisition’s consummation date ie approximately three months or less should be classified as cash outflows for investing activities payments made thereafter should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities up to the amount of the original contingent consideration liability payments made in excess of the amount of the original contingent consideration liability should be classified as cash outflows for operating activities c cash payments received from the settlement of insurance claims should be classified on the basis of the nature of the loss or each component loss if an entity receives a lumpsum settlement d in the absence of specific guidance an entity should classify each separately identifiable cash source and use on the basis of the nature of the underlying cash flows for cash flows with aspects of more than one class that cannot be separated the classification should be based on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source or use of cash flow  asu no  is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period  the company is still evaluating the impact of adopting asu no  on its financial statements but does not expect the adoption of asu no  to have a material impact to its financial statements f table of contents kbs real estate investment trust ii inc notes to consolidated financial statements continued december   in november  the fasb issued asu no  statement of cash flows topic  restricted cash “asu no ” asu no  requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash cash equivalents restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents  therefore amounts generally described as restricted cash should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning of period and end of period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows  asu no  is effective for annual periods beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years  the company elected to early adopt asu no  for the reporting period ended december   and it was applied retrospectively as a result of the adoption of asu no  the company no longer presents the changes within restricted cash in the consolidated statements of cash flows   in january  the fasb issued asu no  business combinations topic  clarifying the definition of a business “asu no ” to add guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses  asu no  provides a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities collectively referred to as a “set” is not a business the screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets the set is not a business  if the screen is not met asu no   requires that to be considered a business a set must include at a minimum an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and  removes the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements  asu no  provides a framework to assist entities in evaluating whether both an input and a substantive process are present the framework includes two sets of criteria to consider that depend on whether a set has outputs  although outputs are not required for a set to be a business outputs generally are a key element of a business therefore the fasb has developed more stringent criteria for sets without outputs  asu no  is effective for annual periods beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years  early adoption is permitted  the amendments can be applied to transactions occurring before the guidance was issued january   as long as the applicable financial statements have not been issued  the company elected to early adopt asu no  for the reporting period beginning january   as a result of the adoption of asu no  the company’s acquisitions of investment properties beginning january   could qualify as an asset acquisition as opposed to a business combination  therefore transaction costs associated with asset acquisitions will be capitalized while these costs associated with business combinations will continue to be expensed as incurred  f table of contents kbs real estate investment trust ii inc

management purposes to hedge its exposure to cash flow variability caused by changing interest rates the primary goal of the company’s risk management practices related to interest rate risk is to

company enters into interest rate swaps as a fixed rate payer to mitigate its exposure to rising interest rates on its variable rate notes payable the value of interest rate swaps is primarily impacted by interest rates market expectations about interest rates and the remaining life of the instrument in general increases in interest rates or anticipated increases in interest rates will

is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis in addition the company is required to measure other nonfinancial and financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis eg carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and longlived assets fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the gaap fair value framework uses a threetiered approach fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories • level  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities • level  quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelderived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets and • level  prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable f table of contents kbs real estate investment trust ii inc notes to consolidated financial statements continued december   the fair value for certain financial instruments is derived using a combination of market quotes pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment the price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the company’s financial instruments financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available and for which markets contain orderly transactions will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments for which markets are inactive or consist of nonorderly trades the company evaluates several factors when determining if a market is inactive or when market transactions are not orderly the following is a summary of the methods and assumptions used by management in estimating the fair value of each class of assets and liabilities for which it is practicable to estimate the fair value cash and cash equivalents rent and other receivables and accounts payable and accrued liabilities these balances approximate their fair values due to the short maturities of these items real estate loan receivable the company’s real estate loan receivable is presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at its amortized cost net of recorded loan loss reserves if applicable and not at fair value the fair value of the real estate loan receivable was estimated using an internal valuation model that considered the expected cash flows for the loan underlying collateral value for collateraldependent loans and estimated yield requirements of institutional investors for loans with similar characteristics including remaining loan term loantovalue type of collateral and other credit enhancements the company classifies these inputs as level  inputs derivative instruments the company’s derivative instruments are presented at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets the valuation of these instruments is determined using a proprietary model that utilizes observable inputs as such the company classifies these inputs as level  inputs the proprietary model uses the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity as well as observable marketbased inputs including interest rate curves and volatility the fair values of interest rate swaps are estimated using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts the variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate curves in addition credit valuation adjustments which consider the impact of any credit risks to the contracts are incorporated in the fair values to account for potential nonperformance risk notes payable the fair value of the company’s notes payable is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management’s estimates of current market interest rates for instruments with similar characteristics including remaining loan term loantovalue ratio type of collateral and other credit enhancements additionally when determining the fair value of liabilities in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available the company measures fair value using i a valuation technique that
