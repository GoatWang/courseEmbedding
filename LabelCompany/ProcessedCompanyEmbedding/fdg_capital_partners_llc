direct and candid communication with decisionmakers responsiveness – fdg’s principals are attentive accessible and able to move quickly and decisively these values offer advantages to our management partners and investors as well as to the investment bankers and other intermediaries who provide many of our investment opportunities our approach undertaking the sale of a business often represents a defining moment in the lives of the principals and frequently their families and close associates who have committed themselves to the success of that enterprise over many years our approach to transactions reflects both an understanding of the magnitude of such decisions for our partners and the creativity and flexibility required to provide the structure incentives and support for our management partners to help them get the most out of their businesses our team while fdg has access to the resources of a much larger organization through our founders and other key relationships we
