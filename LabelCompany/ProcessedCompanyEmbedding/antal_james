studied in normal subjects single doses equivalent to  mg of doxycycline were administered to six subjects in a crossover design as the innovators intravenous solution given orally treatment a the innovators capsule product treatment b a noninnovators capsule product treatment c the innovators oral suspension product treatment d and a second noninnovators capsule product treatment e all dosage forms contained doxycycline as the hyclate except the suspension which contained the nonhyclate form serum levels were determined periodically over  hr and cumulative urinary excretion was measured concurrently over a hr collection period no statistically significant differences were observed in any in vivo indicator of bioequivalence when the three capsule products were compared consequently they were judged to be bioequivalent when these capsule products were compared to the oral solution no statistically significant differences were observed however when the capsules and the suspension were compared statistically significant differences were found in the rate of absorption in vitro dissolution tests were also conducted on the three brands of capsules and times required to achieve  dissolution showed rankorder correlation with corresponding absorption rate constants continue reading full article standard pdf  kb close article support pane journal of pharmaceutical sciences
