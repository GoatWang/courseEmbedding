children believe it or not this is very hard to find our son is now  and after years of being told nothing was wrong by drs  but preschool and sitters had numerous challenges  we knew we needed a more specific diagnosis dr berman did a full assessment and now we have a path forward have had lots of support in how to work with the school productively to get his iep in place and get him the services to support him we keep records and go back once a year now and again wonderful having a child with learning issues some obvious and others not as much it is amazing to have an advocate on your team also he is very well respected and knows throughout the schools out in contra costa so it helps as he has relationships with them and sometimes can directly discuss to refine your childs program it does take a team to raise a confident and supported child especially with sensory or other learning issues and dr berman is a key member to have and he is very funny and so sweet with kids  it is very much appreciated im a behavior  education consultant and have been in practice in the bay area for  years dr berman and i have crossed paths many times i also have had interactions with him as a part of an evidencebased education group i am a member of anyhow hes brilliant there should be no hesitation to refer or use him he is quite simply the best i cant believe some of these reviews one isnt even for his practice but a plastic surgeonmedi spa the review by a former patient is compelling however i would remind folks that a diagnoses often change from yo to a young adult also i might suggest to that young man that whatever brad wrote in that  year old report could have been the catalyst to get him the support he needed to grow into a functioning adult duh i cant think of anyone better than dr berman youve seen the other two reviews i can only confirm them he is one of the most caring thorough wellinformed experienced doctors i know if you have a child with any sort of learning or behavioral disabilitybrad is the one to see period we took our son to dr berman in desperation after being told he had a huge range of mysterious problems from autism to sensory processing disorder and him essentially flunking out of preschool extensive testing from the school district only confirmed him as being th percentile for speech but provided no diagnosis answers or treatment dr berman is amazing after just two appointments he showed that our son has nothing wrong other than delayed speech he set him up with an great speech pathology group and he established that our son actually tests a year ahead not a year behind as we had been told just two months later now our son is thriving and speaking more every day we are so grateful to dr berman we feel like our son was spared a lifetime of being put in the wrong box he is worth every penny if you have a neat kid and need a worldclass behavioural pediatrician look no further he doesnt take insurance so any paperwork

confirm them he is one of the most caring thorough wellinformed experienced doctors i know if you have a child with any sort of learning or behavioral disabilitybrad is the one to see period we took our son to dr berman in desperation after being told he had a huge range of mysterious problems from autism to sensory processing disorder and him essentially flunking out of preschool extensive testing from the school district only confirmed him as being th percentile for speech but provided no diagnosis answers or treatment dr berman is amazing after just two appointments he showed that our son has nothing wrong other than delayed speech he set him up with an great speech pathology group and he established that our son actually tests a year ahead not a year behind as we had been told just two months later now our son is thriving and speaking more every day we are so grateful to dr berman we feel like our son was spared a lifetime of being put in the wrong box he is worth every penny if you have a neat kid and need a worldclass behavioural pediatrician look no further he doesnt take insurance so any paperwork is up to me you also get more than the office appointment brad has

kate h moraga ca  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow kate h stop following kate h  dr berman is a fantastic diagnostician very well informed and wonderful with children  believe it or not this is very hard to find  our son is now  and after years of being told nothing was wrong by drs  but preschool and sitters had numerous challenges  we knew we needed a more specific diagnosis  dr berman did a full assessment and now we have a path forward have had lots of support in how to work with the school productively to get his iep in place and get him the services to support him  we keep records and go back once a year now and again wonderful  having a child with learning issues some obvious and others not as much it is amazing to have an advocate on your team  also he is very well respected and knows throughout the schools out in contra costa so it helps as he has relationships with them and sometimes can directly discuss to refine your childs program  it does take a team to raise a confident and supported child especially with sensory or other learning issues and dr berman is a key member to have  and he is very funny and so sweet with kids  it is very much appreciated was this review … useful  funny cool alulubeth o morgan hill ca  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow
