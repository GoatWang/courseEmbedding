diabetes serving as ceo and chief medical officer of healing our village inc clinical professor of medicine at emory university school of medicine and clinical professor of medicine at indiana university school of medicine dr gavin is a former president of the american diabetes association recipient of the banting medal for distinguished service and in  received the associations clinician of the year award for his contributions to diabetes care in  dr gavin along with the rest of the kapche litigation team received the associations public policy leadership award for his work in defending the right of people with diabetes to live free of discrimination dr gavin played a critical role as medical expert in kapche v holder a case that involved a challenge to the federal bureau of investigations hiring policies for people with insulintreated diabetes when jeff kapche was told the fbi wouldnt hire him as a special agent because he manages his diabetes with injections rather than an insulin pump dr gavin responded to a request from kapches lawyers to help as a medical expert gavin helped lawyers establish that kapches diabetes was a disability under federal law at trial dr gavin was such a fabulous witness that the fbi was desperate to discredit him and tried to make it seem like he was just saying good things about kapche because he had been paid to do so the courtroom was listening intently when dr gavin answered the fbis question about his role in the case no im not being paid and i did not expect to be paid because this is really something thats an important issue for me i come out of a background where i was always taught if you—youve got to be twice as good to get the opportunities youve got to work twice as hard and if you do make those sacrifices and you put that kind of work in you can get the type of opportunities to do what your hearts desire is and for me for people like jeff kapche this is precisely that kind of situation testimony of dr james gavin iiikapche v holder dc district court may  we are grateful to dr gavin for the time he spent on jeff kapches case and for his continued excellence in the field of diabetes
