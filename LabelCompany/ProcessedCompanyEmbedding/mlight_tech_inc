 in addition we have an accumulated deficit of  and working capital deficiency of  as of september   managements plans include generating income by offering additional training courses to cover operating costs to generate sufficient cash flows and raise funds by issuing debt securities to continue as a going concern management has successfully negotiated an agreement with a debt holder to

loan payable of  and cash received from officer of  for working capital needs of the company as a result of the above activities we experienced a net decrease in cash of  for the year ended september   cash balance at september  was as we were overdrawn in our bank account by  to date we have financed our operations primarily through borrowings from our president chief executive officer and more recently by executing promissory notes for our working capital requirements our working capital and other capital requirements for the next twelve months to bring our proposed training programs to commercial viability will vary based upon a number of factors including but not limited to obtaining approvals from various states to open new training schools in their states and signing up for federally funded programs to open training schools however because several factors related to the growth of our operations remain outside of our control eg timing of the approvals by states for us to open training schools there can be no assurance we will achieve commercial viability due to the limited funds available the company has partnered with its former students to act as instructors in missouri and texas and subleasing their facilities to offer training courses to students we believe that funds generated from our operations plus those we have raised from borrowings will not be sufficient to support our operations for the next twelve months however it is possible that we will not be able to maintain our training programs and other services through such period or we will not raise sufficient additional funds from borrowings to cover operational expenses under those circumstances we will need to obtain additional funding to support our operations because we have no contractual commitments with respect to any of these initiatives there can be no assurance that additional funds for operations will be available on commercially reasonable terms or in the necessary amounts our inability to obtain any needed additional financing would have a material adverse effect on us including possibly requiring us to significantly curtail our operations effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business critical accounting estimates and policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and judgments related to the application of certain accounting policies while we base our estimates on historical experience current information and other factors deemed relevant actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical to our reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain and ii different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period would have material impact on our financial statements table of contents we consider our policy for revenue recognition due to the continuously evolving standards and industry practices related to revenue recognition wherein any changes could materially impact the way we report revenues accounting policies related to income taxes are also considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management for the valuation allowances associated with our deferred tax assets critical accounting policies and our procedures related to these policies are described below revenue recognition the companys tuition packages vary in price according to the different types of training programs purchased by the companys tuition packages vary in price according to the different types of training programs purchased by the students upon commencement of the courses the company recognizes as revenue any deposits previously received as they are nonrefundable upon commencement of the courses the remaining tuition from the student or the students employer which is received upon the commencement of the course or extended credit over a period of one to three months or as agreed upon is recognized as revenue upon the completion of the training courses the training course duration is from one to two weeks the companys revenue recognition policy is based on the revenue recognition criteria established under the secs staff accounting bulletin no  the criteria and how the company satisfies each element are as follows  persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the company and the student or the students employer the customer enters into a signed contract with the company  delivery has occurred  as noted above upon the commencement of the course the deposit is nonrefundable per the terms of the signed contract and upon completion of the course the company has provided all services to be delivered to the student under the contract  the price is fixed and determinable  the signed contract indicates a fixed dollar amount for the tuition for the courses enrolled by the student  collectability is reasonable assured  the company receives as payment a deposit and the balance of the tuition before the course is completed or credit is extended for installment payments as evidenced by promissory note not to exceed one year the company records licensing revenue by granting an annual exclusive license to sell dent tools direct usa inc dent tools merchandise online under the ding king name and logo on the dkti website the company recognizes licensing revenue ratably monthly as the company earns revenue and satisfies conditions for recognition of revenues environmental matters our operations are subject to evolving federal state and local environmental laws and regulations related to the discharge of materials into the environment our process is not expected to produce harmful levels of emissions or waste byproducts however these laws and regulations would require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of substances at our site should they occur compliance with such laws and regulations can be costly additionally governmental authorities may enforce the laws and regulations with a variety of civil and criminal enforcement measures including monetary penalties and remediation requirements we are not aware of any area of noncompliance with federal state or local environmental laws and regulations as of the date of this report management has not recorded a reserve for any contingencies related to this area however that is based on management current understanding of the applicable laws and regulations that are subject to interpretation by the regulatory authorities income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial reporting requirements and those imposed under federal and state tax laws deferred taxes are provided for timing differences in the recognition of revenue and expenses for income tax and financial reporting purposes and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date deferred income tax expense represents the change during the period in the deferred tax assets and liabilities the components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and noncurrent based on their characteristics realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future years deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized

accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  these estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues costs and expenses during the reporting period  management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on a regular basis  actual results could differ from those estimates interim financial statements the accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america for interim financial information and with the instructions to form q and regulation sx accordingly these condensed financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements in the opinion of management all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the year ended september   and notes thereto and other pertinent information contained in our annual form k the company has filed with the securities and exchange commission the results of operations for the ninemonth period ending june

development stage entities   the company is still devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business and its planned principal operations have not commenced  all losses accumulated since inception have been considered as part of the company’s development stage activities    cash and cash equivalents the company follows asc  cash and cash equivalents and considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents  cash and cash equivalents totaled  and  at june   and september   respectively earnings loss per share the company computes basic and diluted earnings per share amounts in accordance with asc topic  earnings per share basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the company  as of june   and  there were no common stock equivalents or options outstanding dividends the company has not adopted any policy regarding payment of dividends no dividends have been paid during the periods shown and none are contemplated in the near future deferred income taxes and valuation allowance   the company accounts for income taxes under asc  “income taxes”  under the asset and liability method of asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs  a valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the company will not realize tax assets through future operations  no deferred tax assets or liabilities were recognized as of june   or june   respectively advertising no advertising costs were incurred for the periods ending june   and june   related parties the company follows asc  related party disclosures for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions  related party transactions for the periods ending june   and september   totaled  sharebased expenses asc  “compensation – stock compensation” prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all sharebased payment transactions in which employee services are acquired  transactions include incurring liabilities or issuing or offering to issue shares options  and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights  sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values that expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period the company accounts for stockbased compensation issued to nonemployees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of asc  “ equity – based payments to nonemployees”  measurement of sharebased payment transactions with nonemployees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable  a the goods or services received or b the equity instruments issued  the fair value of the sharebased payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date there were no sharebased expenses for the periods ending june   and june      financial instruments the company’s balance sheet includes certain financial instruments the carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization asc  “fair value measurements and disclosures” defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date asc  also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between  market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and  an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs the fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below · level   unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities     · level   inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability eg interest rates and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means     · level   inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of june   the respective carrying value of certain onbalancesheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the shortterm nature of these instruments note   going concern the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern as shown in the accompanying financial statements the company incurred losses of  since its inception has not yet produced revenues from operations and has a working capital deficit these factors raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the company cannot continue as a going concern management anticipates that it will be able to raise additional working capital through the issuance of stock and through additional loans and advances from investors the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company’s ability to attain a satisfactory level of profitability and obtain suitable and adequate financing there can be no assurance that management’s plan will be

analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our  annual report on form k item   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable to a smaller reporting company item   controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures we maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in rule ae under the securities exchange act of  in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures our management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met additionally in designing disclosure controls and procedures our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures the design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions based on his evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form k our president who serves as both our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to our company required to be disclosed in our securities and exchange commission reports i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to our management including our president to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as a result of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule af or df promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and includes those policies and procedures that · pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company     · provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and    · provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation because of the inherent limitations of internal control there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk as of june   management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” and sec guidance on conducting such assessments based on that evaluation they concluded that during the period covered by this report such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of us gaap rules as more fully described below this was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses the matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the public company accounting oversight board were lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives and affecting the functions of authorization recordkeeping custody of assets and reconciliation and management dominated by a single individualsmall group without adequate compensating controls  the aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our chief executive officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of june   management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results however management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods management’s remediation initiatives in an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls we have initiated or plan to initiate the following series of measures we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us and we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board we anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially if not fully implemented by december   additionally we plan to test our updated controls and remediate our deficiencies by december   changes in internal controls over financial reporting there was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report which has materially affected or is

account to date we have financed our operations primarily through borrowings from our president chief executive officer and more recently by executing promissory notes for our working capital requirements our working capital and other capital requirements for the next twelve months to bring our proposed training programs to commercial viability will vary based upon a number of factors including but not limited to obtaining approvals from various states to open new training schools in their states and signing up for federally funded programs to open training schools however because several factors related to the growth of our operations remain outside of our control eg timing of the approvals by states for us to open training schools there can be no assurance we will achieve commercial viability due to the limited funds available the company has partnered with its former students to act as instructors in missouri and texas and using their facilities to offer training courses to students we believe that funds generated from our operations plus those we have raised from borrowings will not be sufficient to support our operations for the next twelve months however it is possible that we will not be able to maintain our training programs and other services through such period or we will not raise sufficient additional funds from borrowings or sale of our common stock to cover operational expenses under those circumstances we will need to obtain additional funding to support our operations because we have no contractual commitments with respect to any of these initiatives there can be no assurance that additional funds for operations will be available on commercially reasonable terms or in the necessary amounts our inability to obtain any needed additional financing would have a material adverse effect on us including possibly requiring us to significantly curtail our operations table of contents effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business critical accounting estimates and policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and judgments related to the application of certain accounting policies while we base our estimates on historical experience current information and other factors deemed relevant actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical to our reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain and ii different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period would have material impact on our financial statements we consider our policy for revenue recognition due to the continuously evolving standards and industry practices related to revenue recognition wherein any changes could materially impact the way we report revenues accounting policies related to income taxes are also considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management critical accounting policies and our procedures related to these policies are described below revenue recognition the companys tuition packages vary in price according to the different types of training programs purchased by the students upon commencement of the courses the company recognizes as revenue any deposits previously received as they are nonrefundable upon commencement of the courses the remaining tuition from the student or the students employer which is received upon the commencement of the course or extended credit over a period of one to three months is recognized as revenue upon the completion of the training courses the duration of which is one to two weeks the companys revenue recognition policy is based on the revenue recognition criteria established under the secs staff accounting bulletin no  the criteria and how the company satisfies each element are as follows  persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the company and the student or the students employer the customer enters into a signed contract with the company  delivery has occurred  as noted above upon the commencement of the course the deposit is nonrefundable per the terms of the signed contract and upon completion of the course the company has provided all services to be delivered to the student under the contract  the price is fixed and determinable  the signed contract indicates a fixed dollar amount for the tuition for the courses enrolled by the student  collectability is reasonable assured  the company receives as payment a deposit and the balance of the tuition before the course is

needs of their clients unispace wanted to come up with a lighting solution for their melbourne head office to match their thinkingoutsideofthebox approach to their work  ndylight worked collaboratively with unispace to provide a curvaceous lighting design that broke free of the straightline approach to office lighting we at mlight introduced the swerve led system to the team and the flexibility of the system and mlights commitment to delivering on the vision allowed the design to be realised in full  as well as being a powerful luminaire the swerve is an interior designer’s dream being fully customisable to any space we can curve both the fitting and the led in any number of shapes which is how we created the stunning yjoins seen at unispace  swerve’s flexibility allowed us to outline the work spaces around the office providing a bright space to facilitate their designers’ bright thoughts and unifying the furnishings with the interior architecture the shiny finish on the ceiling also resulted in a gorgeous electrifying reflection of the installation  our swerve led is here to inspire creative minds from interior designers to those under its beam it’s the new box to think outside of our outcome the solution previous next swerve taking creativity to a new level the swerve bends minds allowing a huge leap in customisation curved lighting is one of the fastest
