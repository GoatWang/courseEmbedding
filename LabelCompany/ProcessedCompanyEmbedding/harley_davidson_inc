left william a davidson walter davidson sr arthur davidson and william s harley beginning in  yearold william s harley drew up plans for a small engine with a displacement of  cubic inches  cc³ and fourinch  mm flywheels the engine was designed for use in a regular pedalbicycle frame over the next two years harley and his childhood friend arthur davidson worked on their motorbicycle using the northside milwaukee machine shop at the home of their friend henry melk it was finished in  with the help of arthurs brother walter davidson upon testing their powercycle harley and the davidson brothers found it unable to climb the hills around milwaukee without pedal assistance they quickly wrote off their first motorbicycle as a valuable learning experiment work immediately began on a new and improved secondgeneration machine this first real harleydavidson motorcycle had a bigger engine of  cubic inches  cc³ with  inches  cm flywheels weighing  lb  kg the machines advanced loopframe pattern was similar to the  milwaukee merkel motorcycle designed by joseph merkel later of flying merkel fame the bigger engine and loopframe design took it out of the motorized bicycle category and marked the path to future motorcycle designs the boys also received help with their bigger engine from outboard motor pioneer ole evinrude who was then building gas engines of his own design for automotive use on milwaukees lake street prototype the prototype of the new loopframe harleydavidson was assembled in a  ft ×  ft  m ×  m shed in the davidson family backyard most of the major parts however were made elsewhere including some probably fabricated at the west milwaukee railshops where oldest brother william a davidson was then toolroom foreman this prototype machine was functional by september   when it competed in a milwaukee motorcycle race held at state fair park it was ridden by edward hildebrand and placed fourth this is the first documented appearance of a harleydavidson motorcycle in the historical record in january  small advertisements were placed in the automobile and cycle trade journal offering bare harleydavidson engines to the doityourself trade by april complete motorcycles were in production on a very limited basis that year the first harleydavidson dealer carl h lang of chicago sold three bikes from the five built in the davidson backyard shed years later the original shed was taken to the juneau avenue factory where it would stand for many decades as a tribute to the motor companys humble origins until it was accidentally destroyed by contractors cleaning the factory yard in the early s in  harley and the davidson brothers built their first factory on chestnut street later juneau avenue at the current location of harleydavidsons corporate headquarters the first juneau avenue plant was a  ft ×  ft  m ×  m singlestory wooden structure the company produced about  motorcycles that year  model harleydavidson  cc ht  in  william s harley graduated from the university of wisconsin–madison with a degree in mechanical engineering that year additional factory expansion came with a second floor and later with facings and additions of milwaukee pale yellow cream brick with the new facilities production increased to  motorcycles in  the company was officially incorporated that september they also began selling their motorcycles to police departments around this time a market that has been important to them ever since in  william a davidson brother to arthur and walter davidson quit his job as tool foreman for the milwaukee road railroad and joined the motor company production in  and  were all singlecylinder models with  cubic inch  cm³ engines in february  a prototype model with a degree vtwin engine was displayed at the chicago automobile show although shown and advertised very few vtwin models were built between  and  these first vtwins displaced  cubic inches  cm³ and produced about  horsepower  kw this gave about double the power of the first singles top speed was about  mph  kmh production jumped from  motorcycles in  to  machines in  harleydavidson works in  by  some  makes of motorcycles had already been built in the united states – although just a handful would survive the s in  an improved vtwin model was introduced the new engine had mechanically operated intake valves as opposed to the automatic intake valves used on earlier vtwins that opened by engine vacuum with a displacement of  cubic inches  cm³ the  vtwin was smaller than earlier twins but gave better performance after  the majority of bikes produced by harleydavidson would be vtwin models in  harleydavidson introduced their patented fulfloteing seat which was suspended by a coil spring inside the seat tube the spring tension could be adjusted to suit the riders weight more than  inches  mm of travel was available harleydavidson would use seats of this type until  by  the yellow brick factory had been demolished and on the site a new story structure had been built begun in  the factory with its many additions would take up two blocks along juneau avenue and around the corner on th street despite the competition harleydavidson was already pulling ahead of indian and would dominate motorcycle racing after  production that year swelled to  machines ralph hepburn on his harley racing bike in this  photo world war i in  the united states entered world war i and the military demanded motorcycles for the war effort harleys had already been used by the military in the pancho villa expedition but world war i was the first time the motorcycle had been adopted for military issue first with the british model h produced by british triumph motorcycles ltd in  after the us entry into the war the us military purchased over  motorcycles from harleydavidson bicycles harleydavidson launched a line of bicycles in  in hopes of recruiting customers for its motorcycles besides the traditional diamond frame mens bicycle models included a stepthrough frame  ladies standard and a  boy scout for youth the effort was discontinued in  because of disappointing sales the bicycles were built for harleydavidson in dayton ohio by the davis machine company from  to  when davis stopped manufacturing bicycles s harleydavidson  cc ht  by  harleydavidson was the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world with  machines produced and dealers in  countries in  a harleydavidson ridden by otto walker was the first motorcycle ever to win a race at an average speed greater than  mph  kmh during the s several improvements were put in place such as a new  cubic inch   cm³ vtwin introduced in  and the teardrop gas tank in  a front brake was added in  although notably only on the jjd models in the late summer of  harleydavidson introduced its  cubic inches  cm³ flathead vtwin to compete with the indian  scout and the excelsior super x this was the d model produced from  to  riders of indian motorcycles derisively referred to this model as the three cylinder harley because the generator was upright and parallel to the front cylinder the  in  mm bore and  in  mm stroke would continue in most versions of the  engine exceptions include the xa and the xrcitation needed great depression harleydavidson  cc sv  the great depression began a few months after the introduction of their  cubic inch  cm³ model harleydavidsons sales fell from  in  to  in  despite this harleydavidson unveiled a new lineup for  which included a flathead engine and art deco styling in order to survive the

sidevalve and shaftdriven r harley largely copied the bmw engine and drive train and produced the shaftdriven  cc  harleydavidson xa this shared no dimensions no parts and no design concepts except side valves with any prior harleydavidson engine due to the superior cooling of the flattwin engine with the cylinders across the frame harleys xa cylinder heads ran  °f  °c cooler than its vtwins the

typically had waiting lists that extended up to a year for some of the most popular models harleydavidson like the auto manufacturers records a sale not when a consumer buys their product but rather when it is delivered to a dealer therefore it is possible for the manufacturer to inflate sales numbers by requiring dealers to accept more inventory than desired in a practice called channel stuffing

classic harleydavidson engines are vtwin engines with a ° angle between the cylinders the crankshaft has a single pin and both pistons are connected to this pin through their connecting rods this ° angle is covered under several united states patents and is an engineering tradeoff that allows a large hightorque engine in a relatively small space it causes the cylinders to fire at uneven intervals and produces the choppy potatopotato sound so strongly linked to the harleydavidson brand to simplify the engine and reduce costs the vtwin ignition was designed to operate with a single set of points and no distributor this is known as a dual fire ignition system causing both spark plugs to fire regardless of which cylinder was on its compression stroke with the other spark plug firing on its cylinders exhaust stroke effectively wasting a spark the exhaust note is basically a throaty growling sound with some popping the ° design of the engine thus creates a plug firing sequencing as such the first cylinder fires the second rear cylinder fires ° later then there is a ° gap until the first cylinder fires again giving the engine its unique sound harleydavidson has used various ignition systems throughout its history – be it the early points and condenser system big twin up to  and sportsters up to  magneto ignition system used on some  to  sportsters early electronic with centrifugal mechanical advance weights all models  and a half to  or the late electronic with transistorized ignition control module more familiarly known as the black box or the brain all models  to

bikes that were introduced in compliance with eu standards for  on february   the company filed a sound trademark application for the distinctive sound of the harleydavidson motorcycle engine the mark consists of the exhaust sound of applicants motorcycles produced by vtwin common crankpin motorcycle engines when the goods are in use nine of harleydavidsons competitors filed comments opposing the

arthur davidson and william s harley beginning in  yearold william s harley drew up plans for a small engine with a displacement of  cubic inches  cc³ and fourinch  mm flywheels the engine was designed for use in a regular pedalbicycle frame over the next two years harley and his childhood friend arthur davidson worked on their motorbicycle using the northside milwaukee machine shop at the home of their friend henry melk it was finished in  with the help of arthurs brother walter davidson upon testing their powercycle harley and the davidson brothers found it unable to climb the hills around milwaukee without pedal assistance they quickly wrote off their first motorbicycle as a valuable learning experiment work immediately began on a new and improved secondgeneration machine this first real harleydavidson motorcycle had a bigger engine of  cubic inches  cc³ with  inches  cm flywheels weighing  lb  kg the machines advanced loopframe pattern was similar to the  milwaukee merkel motorcycle designed by joseph merkel later of flying merkel fame the bigger engine and loopframe design took it out of the motorized bicycle category and marked the path to future motorcycle designs the boys also received help with their bigger engine from outboard motor pioneer ole evinrude who was then building gas engines of his own design for automotive use on milwaukees lake street prototype the prototype of the new loopframe harleydavidson was assembled in a  ft ×  ft  m ×  m shed in the davidson family backyard most of the major parts however were made elsewhere including some probably fabricated at the west milwaukee railshops where oldest brother william a davidson was then toolroom foreman this prototype machine was functional by september   when it competed in a milwaukee motorcycle race held at state fair park it was ridden by edward hildebrand and placed fourth this is the first documented appearance of a harleydavidson motorcycle in the historical record in january  small advertisements were placed in the automobile and cycle trade journal offering bare harleydavidson engines to the doityourself trade by april complete motorcycles were in production on a very limited basis that year the first harleydavidson dealer carl h lang of chicago sold three bikes from the five built in the davidson backyard shed years later the original shed was taken to the juneau avenue factory where it would stand for many decades as a tribute to the motor companys humble origins until it was accidentally destroyed by contractors cleaning the factory yard in the early s in  harley and the davidson brothers built their first factory on chestnut street later juneau avenue at the current location of harleydavidsons corporate headquarters the first juneau avenue plant was a  ft ×  ft  m ×  m singlestory wooden structure the company produced about  motorcycles that year  model harleydavidson  cc ht  in  william s harley graduated from the university of wisconsin–madison with a degree in mechanical engineering that year additional factory expansion came with a second floor and later with facings and additions of milwaukee pale yellow cream brick with the new facilities production increased to  motorcycles in  the company was officially incorporated that september they also began selling their motorcycles to police departments around this time a market that has been important to them ever since in  william a davidson brother to arthur and walter davidson quit his job as tool foreman for the milwaukee road railroad and joined the motor company production in  and  were all singlecylinder models with  cubic inch  cm³ engines in february  a prototype model with a degree vtwin engine was displayed at the chicago automobile show although shown and advertised very few vtwin models were built between  and  these first vtwins displaced  cubic inches  cm³ and produced about  horsepower  kw this gave about double the power of the first singles top speed was about  mph  kmh production jumped from  motorcycles in  to  machines in  harleydavidson works in  by  some  makes of motorcycles had already been built in the united states – although just a handful would survive the s in  an improved vtwin model was introduced the new engine had mechanically operated intake valves as opposed to the automatic intake valves used on earlier vtwins that opened by engine vacuum with a displacement of  cubic inches  cm³ the  vtwin was smaller than earlier twins but gave better performance after  the majority of bikes produced by harleydavidson would be vtwin models in  harleydavidson introduced their patented fulfloteing seat which was suspended by a coil spring inside the seat tube the spring tension could be adjusted to suit the riders weight more than  inches  mm of travel was available harleydavidson would use seats of this type until  by  the yellow brick factory had been demolished and on the site a new story structure had been built begun in  the factory with its many additions would take up two blocks along juneau avenue and around the corner on th street despite the competition harleydavidson was already pulling ahead of indian and would dominate motorcycle racing after  production that year swelled to  machines ralph hepburn on his harley racing bike in this  photo world war i in  the united states entered world war i and the military demanded motorcycles for the war effort harleys had already been used by the military in the pancho villa expedition but world war i was the first time the motorcycle had been adopted for military issue first with the british model h produced by british triumph motorcycles ltd in  after the us entry into the war the us military purchased over  motorcycles from harleydavidson bicycles harleydavidson launched a line of bicycles in  in hopes of recruiting customers for its motorcycles besides the traditional diamond frame mens bicycle models included a stepthrough frame  ladies standard and a  boy scout for youth the effort was discontinued in  because of disappointing sales the bicycles were built for harleydavidson in dayton ohio by the davis

as a new  cubic inch   cm³ vtwin introduced in  and the teardrop gas tank in  a front brake was added in  although notably only on the jjd models in the late summer of  harleydavidson introduced its

to  in  despite this harleydavidson unveiled a new lineup for  which included a flathead engine and art deco styling in order to survive the remainder of the depression the company manufactured industrial powerplants based on their motorcycle engines they also designed and built a threewheeled delivery vehicle called the servicar which remained in production until  harleydavidson ul in the mids alfred rich child opened a production line in japan with the cubicinch  cm³ vl the japanese licenseholder sankyo seiyaku corporation severed its business relations with harleydavidson in  and continued manufacturing the vl under the rikuo name harleydavidson dealer in texas ca  an cubicinch  cm³ flathead engine was added to the line in  by which time the singlecylinder motorcycles had been discontinued in  the e and el models with the knucklehead ohv engines was introduced valvetrain problems in early knucklehead engines required a redesign halfway through its first year of production and retrofitting of the new valvetrain on earlier engines by  all harleydavidsons flathead engines were equipped with drysump oil recirculation systems similar to the one introduced in the knucklehead ohv engine the revised cubicinch  cm³ v and vl models were renamed u and ul the cubicinch  cc³ vh and vlh to be renamed uh and ulh and the cubicinch  cc³ r to be renamed w in  the cubicinch  cm³

copied the bmw r to produce its xa model one of only two american cycle manufacturers to survive the great depression harleydavidson again produced large numbers of motorcycles for the us army in world war ii and resumed civilian production afterwards producing a range of large vtwin motorcycles that were successful both on racetracks and for private buyers harleydavidson on the eve of world war ii was already supplying the army with a militaryspecific version of its  cubic inches  cm³ wl line called the wla the a in this case stood for army upon the outbreak of war the company along with most other manufacturing enterprises shifted to war work more than  military motorcycles mostly wlas and wlcs the canadian version were produced many to be provided to allies harleydavidson received two armynavy ‘e’ awards one in  and the other in  which were awarded for excellence in production harley produced the wlc for the canadian military shipments to the soviet union under the lendlease program numbered at least  the wlas produced during all four years of war production generally have  serial numbers production of the wla stopped at the end of world war ii but was resumed from  to  for use in the korean war the us army also asked harleydavidson to produce a new motorcycle with many of the features of bmws sidevalve and shaftdriven r harley largely copied the bmw engine and drive train and produced the shaftdriven  cc  harleydavidson xa this shared no dimensions no parts and no design concepts except side valves with any prior harleydavidson engine due to the superior cooling of the flattwin engine with the cylinders across the frame harleys xa cylinder heads ran  °f  °c cooler than its vtwins the xa never entered full production the motorcycle by that time had been eclipsed by the jeep as the armys general purpose vehicle and the wla—already in production—was sufficient for its limited police escort and courier roles only  were made and the xa never went into

on imported bikes with engine capacities greater than  cc harleydavidson subsequently rejected offers of assistance from japanese motorcycle makers however the company did offer to drop the request for the tariff in exchange for loan guarantees from the japanese rather than trying to match the japanese the new management deliberately exploited the retro appeal of the machines building motorcycles that deliberately adopted the look and feel of their earlier machines and the subsequent customizations of owners of that era many components such as brakes forks shocks carburetors electrics and wheels were outsourced from foreign manufacturers and quality increased technical improvements were made and buyers slowly returned harleydavidson bought the sub shock cantileverswingarm

st century harleydavidson embarked on a program of expanding the number of dealerships throughout the country at the same time its current dealers typically had waiting lists that extended up to a year for some of the most popular models harleydavidson like the auto manufacturers records a sale not when a consumer buys their product but rather when it is delivered to a dealer therefore it is possible for the manufacturer to inflate sales numbers by requiring dealers to accept more inventory than desired in a practice called channel stuffing when demand softened following the unique  model

engines with a ° angle between the cylinders the crankshaft has a single pin and both pistons are connected to this pin through their connecting rods this ° angle is covered under several united states patents and is an engineering tradeoff that allows a large hightorque engine in a relatively small space it causes the cylinders to fire at uneven intervals and produces the choppy potatopotato sound so strongly linked to the harleydavidson brand to simplify the engine and reduce costs the vtwin ignition was designed to operate with a single set of points and no distributor this is known as a dual fire ignition system causing both spark plugs to fire regardless of which cylinder was on its compression stroke with the other spark plug firing on its cylinders exhaust stroke effectively wasting a spark the exhaust note is basically a throaty growling sound with some popping the ° design of the engine thus creates a plug firing sequencing as such the first cylinder fires the second rear cylinder fires ° later then there is a ° gap until the first cylinder fires again giving the engine its unique sound harleydavidson has used various ignition systems throughout its history – be it the early points and condenser system big twin up to  and sportsters up to  magneto ignition system used on some  to  sportsters early electronic with centrifugal mechanical advance weights all models  and a half to  or the late electronic with transistorized ignition control module more familiarly known as the black box or the brain all models  to present starting in  the company introduced

arthur davidson and william s harley beginning in  yearold william s harley drew up plans for a small engine with a displacement of  cubic inches  cc³ and fourinch  mm flywheels the engine was designed for use in a regular pedalbicycle frame over the next two years harley and his childhood friend arthur davidson worked on their motorbicycle using the northside milwaukee machine shop at the home of their friend henry melk it was finished in  with the help of arthurs brother walter davidson upon testing their powercycle harley and the davidson brothers found it unable to climb the hills around milwaukee without pedal assistance they quickly wrote off their first motorbicycle as a valuable learning experiment work immediately began on a new and improved secondgeneration machine this first real harleydavidson motorcycle had a bigger engine of  cubic inches  cc³ with  inches  cm flywheels weighing  lb  kg the machines advanced loopframe pattern was similar to the  milwaukee merkel motorcycle designed by joseph merkel later of flying merkel fame the bigger engine and loopframe design took it out of the motorized bicycle category and marked the path to future motorcycle designs the boys also received help with their bigger engine from outboard motor pioneer ole evinrude who was then building gas engines of his own design for automotive use on milwaukees lake street prototype the prototype of the new loopframe harleydavidson was assembled in a  ft ×  ft  m ×  m shed in the davidson family backyard most of the major parts however were made elsewhere including some probably fabricated at the west milwaukee railshops where oldest brother william a davidson was then toolroom foreman this prototype machine was functional by september   when it competed in a milwaukee motorcycle race held at state fair park it was ridden by edward hildebrand and placed fourth this is the first documented appearance of a harleydavidson motorcycle in the historical record in january  small advertisements were placed in the automobile and cycle trade journal offering bare harleydavidson engines to the doityourself trade by april complete motorcycles were in production on a very limited basis that year the first harleydavidson dealer carl h lang of chicago sold three bikes from the five built in the davidson backyard shed years later the original shed was taken to the juneau avenue factory where it would stand for many decades as a tribute to the motor companys humble origins until it was accidentally destroyed by contractors cleaning the factory yard in the early s in  harley and the davidson brothers built their first factory on chestnut street later juneau avenue at the current location of harleydavidsons corporate headquarters the first juneau avenue plant was a  ft ×  ft  m ×  m singlestory wooden structure the company produced about  motorcycles that year  model harleydavidson  cc ht  in  william s harley graduated from the university of wisconsin–madison with a degree in mechanical engineering that year additional factory expansion came with a second floor and later with facings and additions of milwaukee pale yellow cream brick with the new facilities production increased to  motorcycles in  the company was officially incorporated that september they also began selling their motorcycles to police departments around this time a market that has been important to them ever since in  william a davidson brother to arthur and walter davidson quit his job as tool foreman for the milwaukee road railroad and joined the motor company production in  and  were all singlecylinder models with  cubic inch  cm³ engines in february  a prototype model with a degree vtwin engine was displayed at the chicago automobile show although shown and advertised very few vtwin models were built between  and  these first vtwins displaced  cubic inches  cm³ and produced about  horsepower  kw this gave about double the power of the first singles top speed was about  mph  kmh production jumped from  motorcycles in  to  machines in  harleydavidson works in  by  some  makes of motorcycles had already been built in the united states – although just a handful would survive the s in  an improved vtwin model was introduced the new engine had mechanically operated intake valves as opposed to the automatic intake valves used on earlier vtwins that opened by engine vacuum with a displacement of  cubic inches  cm³ the  vtwin was smaller than earlier twins but gave better performance after  the majority of bikes produced by harleydavidson would be vtwin models in  harleydavidson introduced their patented fulfloteing seat which was suspended by a coil spring inside the seat tube the spring tension could be adjusted to suit the riders weight more than  inches  mm of travel was available harleydavidson would use seats of this type until  by  the yellow brick factory had been demolished and on the site a new story structure had been built begun in  the factory with its many additions would take up two blocks along juneau avenue and around the corner on th street despite the competition harleydavidson was already pulling ahead of indian and would dominate motorcycle racing after  production that year swelled to  machines ralph hepburn on his harley racing bike in this  photo world war i in  the united states entered world war i and the military demanded motorcycles for the war effort harleys had already been used by the military in the pancho villa expedition but world war i was the first time the motorcycle had been adopted for military issue first with the british model h produced by british triumph motorcycles ltd in  after the us entry into the war the us military purchased over  motorcycles from harleydavidson bicycles harleydavidson launched a line of bicycles in  in hopes of recruiting customers for its motorcycles besides the traditional diamond frame mens bicycle models included a stepthrough frame  ladies standard and a  boy scout for youth the effort was discontinued in  because of disappointing sales the bicycles were built for harleydavidson in dayton ohio by the davis machine company from  to  when davis stopped manufacturing bicycles s harleydavidson  cc ht  by  harleydavidson was the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world with  machines produced and dealers in  countries in  a harleydavidson ridden by otto walker was the first motorcycle ever to win a race at an average speed greater than  mph  kmh during the s several improvements were put in place such as a new  cubic inch   cm³ vtwin introduced in  and the teardrop gas tank in  a front brake was added in  although notably only on the jjd models in the late summer of  harleydavidson introduced its  cubic inches  cm³ flathead vtwin to compete with the indian  scout and the excelsior super x this was the d model produced from  to  riders of indian motorcycles derisively referred to this model as the three cylinder harley because the generator was upright and parallel to the front cylinder the  in  mm bore and  in  mm stroke would continue in most versions of the  engine exceptions include the xa and the xrcitation needed great depression harleydavidson  cc sv  the great depression began a few months after the introduction of their  cubic inch  cm³ model harleydavidsons sales fell from  in  to  in  despite this harleydavidson unveiled a new lineup for  which included a flathead engine and art deco styling in order to survive the remainder of the depression the company manufactured industrial powerplants based on their motorcycle engines they also designed and built a threewheeled delivery vehicle called the servicar which remained in production until  harleydavidson ul in the mids alfred rich child opened a production line in japan with the cubicinch  cm³ vl the japanese licenseholder sankyo seiyaku corporation severed its business relations with harleydavidson in  and continued manufacturing the vl under the rikuo name harleydavidson dealer in texas ca  an cubicinch  cm³ flathead engine was added to the line in  by which time the singlecylinder motorcycles had been discontinued in  the e and el models with the knucklehead ohv engines was introduced valvetrain problems in early knucklehead engines required a redesign halfway through its first year of production and retrofitting of the new valvetrain on earlier engines by  all harleydavidsons flathead engines were equipped with drysump oil recirculation systems similar to the one introduced in the knucklehead ohv engine the revised cubicinch  cm³ v and vl models were renamed u and ul the cubicinch  cc³ vh and vlh to be renamed uh and ulh and the cubicinch  cc³ r to be renamed w in  the cubicinch  cm³ knucklehead was introduced as the f and the fl the cubicinch  cc³ flathead uh and ulh models were discontinued after  while the  inch  mm u  ul flathead models were produced up to  world war ii harley copied the bmw r to produce its xa model one of only two american cycle manufacturers to survive the great depression harleydavidson again produced large numbers of motorcycles for the us army in world war ii and resumed civilian production afterwards producing a range of large vtwin motorcycles that were successful both on racetracks and for private buyers harleydavidson on the eve of world war ii was already supplying the army with a militaryspecific version of its  cubic inches  cm³ wl line called the wla the a in this case stood for army upon the outbreak of war the company along with most other manufacturing enterprises shifted to war work more than  military motorcycles mostly wlas and wlcs the canadian version were produced many to be provided to allies harleydavidson received two armynavy ‘e’ awards one in  and the other in  which were awarded for excellence in production harley produced the wlc for the canadian military shipments to the soviet union under the lendlease program numbered at least  the wlas produced during all four years of war production generally have  serial numbers production of the wla stopped at the end of world war ii but was resumed from  to  for use in the korean war the us army also asked harleydavidson to produce a new motorcycle with many of the features of bmws sidevalve and shaftdriven r harley largely copied the bmw engine and drive train and produced the shaftdriven  cc  harleydavidson xa this shared no dimensions no parts and no design concepts except side valves with any prior harleydavidson engine due to the superior cooling of the flattwin engine with the cylinders across the frame harleys xa cylinder heads ran  °f  °c cooler than its vtwins the xa never entered full production the motorcycle by that time had been eclipsed by the jeep as the armys general purpose vehicle and the wla—already in production—was sufficient for its limited police escort and courier roles only  were made and the xa never went into full production it remains the only shaftdriven harleydavidson ever made small harleys hummers and aermacchis harleydavidson hummer see also harleydavidson hummer and harleydavidson topper as part of war reparations harleydavidson acquired the design of a small german motorcycle the dkw rt  which they adapted manufactured and sold from  to  various models were made including the hummer from  to

when the fourstroke sprint was discontinued after the pacer and scat models were discontinued at the end of  the bobcat became the last of harleydavidsons americanmade twostroke motorcycles the bobcat was manufactured only in the  model year harleydavidson replaced their americanmade lightweight twostroke motorcycles with the aermacchibuilt twostroke powered m ms and rapido the m had a semistepthrough frame and tank the ms was a m with a larger tank that eliminated the stepthrough feature the rapido was a larger bike with a  cc engine the aermacchibuilt harleydavidsons became entirely twostroke powered when the  cc twostroke ss replaced the fourstroke  cc sprint in  harleydavidson purchased full control of aermacchis motorcycle production in  and continued making twostroke

motorcycles into the us in such volume as to harm or threaten to harm domestic producers after an investigation by the us international trade commission president reagan imposed in  a  percent tariff on imported bikes with engine capacities greater than  cc harleydavidson subsequently rejected offers of assistance from japanese motorcycle makers however the company did offer to drop the request for the tariff in exchange for loan guarantees from the japanese rather than trying to match the japanese the new management deliberately exploited the retro appeal of the machines building motorcycles that deliberately adopted the look and feel of their earlier machines and the subsequent customizations of owners of that era many components such as brakes forks shocks carburetors electrics and wheels were outsourced from foreign manufacturers and quality increased technical improvements were made and buyers slowly returned harleydavidson bought the sub shock cantileverswingarm rear suspension design from missouri engineer bill davis and developed it into its softail series of motorcycles introduced in  with the fxst softail in response to possible motorcycle market loss due to the aging of babyboomers harleydavidson bought luxury motorhome manufacturer holiday rambler in  in  the company sold holiday rambler to the monaco coach corporation the sturgis model boasting a

harleydavidson increased its share in buell to ninetyeight percent in  and to complete ownership in  in an attempt to attract newcomers to motorcycling in general and to harleydavidson in particular buell developed a lowcost lowmaintenance motorcycle the resulting singlecylinder buell blast was introduced in  and was made through  which according to buell was to be the final year of production on october   harleydavidson inc issued an official statement that it would be discontinuing the buell line and ceasing production immediately the stated reason was to focus on the harleydavidson brand

southern hemisphere market claims of stock price manipulation harleydavidson inc nysehog stock price source zenobankcom during its period of peak demand during the late s and early first decade of the st century harleydavidson embarked on a program of expanding the number of dealerships throughout the country at the same time its current dealers typically had waiting lists that extended up to a year for some of the most popular models harleydavidson like the auto manufacturers records a sale not when a consumer buys their product but rather when it is delivered to a dealer therefore it is possible for the manufacturer to inflate sales numbers by requiring dealers to accept more inventory than desired in a practice called channel stuffing when demand softened following the unique  model year this news led to a dramatic decline in the stock price in april  alone the price of hog shares dropped from more than  to less than  immediately prior to this decline retiring ceo jeffrey

established a subsidiary harleydavidson india in gurgaon near delhi in  and created an indian dealer network financial crisis according to interbrand the value of the harleydavidson brand fell by  percent to  billion in  the fall in value is believed to be connected to the  percent drop in the company profits in two quarters of the previous year on april   harleydavidson stated that they must cut  million in manufacturing costs from its production facilities in wisconsin and that they would explore alternative us sites to accomplish this the announcement came in the wake of a massive companywide restructuring which began in early  and involved the closing of two factories one distribution center and the planned elimination of nearly  percent of its total workforce around  employees the company announced on september   that it would remain in wisconsin motorcycle engines  cc vtwin main article harleydavidson engine timeline the classic harleydavidson engines are vtwin engines with a ° angle between the cylinders the crankshaft has a single pin and both pistons are connected to this pin through their connecting rods this ° angle is covered under several united states patents and is an engineering tradeoff that allows a large hightorque engine in a relatively small space it causes the cylinders to fire at uneven intervals and produces the choppy potatopotato sound so strongly linked to the harleydavidson brand to simplify the engine and reduce costs the vtwin ignition was designed to operate with a single set of points and no distributor this is known as a dual fire ignition system causing both spark plugs to fire regardless of which cylinder was on its compression stroke with the other spark plug firing on its cylinders exhaust stroke effectively wasting a spark the exhaust note is basically a throaty growling sound with some popping the ° design of the engine thus creates a plug firing sequencing as such the first cylinder fires the second rear cylinder fires ° later then there is a ° gap until the first cylinder fires again giving the engine its unique sound harleydavidson has used various ignition systems throughout its history – be it the early points and condenser system big twin up to  and sportsters up to  magneto ignition system used on some  to  sportsters early electronic with centrifugal mechanical advance weights all models  and a half to  or the late electronic with transistorized ignition control module more familiarly known as the black box or the brain all models  to present starting in  the company introduced electronic fuel injection efi as an option for the th anniversary edition electra glide efi became standard on all harleydavidson motorcycles including sportsters upon the introduction of the  product line in  harleydavidson began to participate in the sound quality working group founded by orfield labs bruel and kjaer teac yamaha sennheiser sms and cortex this was the nations first group to share research on psychological acoustics later that year harleydavidson participated in a series of sound quality studies at orfield labs based on recordings taken at the talladega superspeedway with the objective to lower the sound level for eu standards while analytically capturing the harley soundcitation needed this research resulted in the bikes that were introduced in compliance with eu standards for  on february   the company filed a sound trademark application for the distinctive sound of the harleydavidson motorcycle engine the mark consists of the exhaust sound of applicants motorcycles produced by vtwin common crankpin motorcycle engines when the goods are in use nine of harleydavidsons competitors filed comments opposing the application arguing that cruiserstyle motorcycles of various brands use a singlecrankpin vtwin engine which produce a similar sound these objections were followed by litigation in june  the company dropped efforts to federally register

simulating the german autobahn highways without general speed limit between the porsche research and development center in weissach near stuttgart to düsseldorf uncounted samples of engines crashed until an engine successfully passed the  hour nonstop run this was the benchmark for the engineers to approve the start of production for the revolution engine which was documented in the discovery channel special harleydavidson birth of the vrod october   singlecylinder engines  harleydavidson singlecylinder motorcycle ioe singles the first harleydavidson motorcycles were powered by singlecylinder ioe engines with the inlet valve operated by engine vacuum singles of this type continued to be made until  when a pushrod and rocker system was used to operate the overhead inlet valve

arthur davidson and william s harley beginning in  yearold william s harley drew up plans for a small engine with a displacement of  cubic inches  cc³ and fourinch  mm flywheels the engine was designed for use in a regular pedalbicycle frame over the next two years harley and his childhood friend arthur davidson worked on their motorbicycle using the northside milwaukee machine shop at the home of their friend henry melk it was finished in  with the help of arthurs brother walter davidson upon testing their powercycle harley and the davidson brothers found it unable to climb the hills around milwaukee without pedal assistance they quickly wrote off their first motorbicycle as a valuable learning experiment work immediately began on a new and improved secondgeneration machine this first real harleydavidson motorcycle had a bigger engine of  cubic inches  cc³ with  inches  cm flywheels weighing  lb  kg the machines advanced loopframe pattern was similar to the  milwaukee merkel motorcycle designed by joseph merkel later of flying merkel fame the bigger engine and loopframe design took it out of the motorized bicycle category and marked the path to future motorcycle designs the boys also received help with their bigger engine from outboard motor pioneer ole evinrude who was then building gas engines of his own design for automotive use on milwaukees lake street prototype the prototype of the new loopframe harleydavidson was assembled in a  ft ×  ft  m ×  m shed in the davidson family backyard most of the major parts however were made elsewhere including some probably fabricated at the west milwaukee railshops where oldest brother william a davidson was then toolroom foreman this prototype machine was functional by september   when it competed in a milwaukee motorcycle race held at state fair park it was ridden by edward hildebrand and placed fourth this is the first documented appearance of a harleydavidson motorcycle in the historical record in january  small advertisements were placed in the automobile and cycle trade journal offering bare harleydavidson engines to the doityourself trade by april complete motorcycles were in production on a very limited basis that year the first harleydavidson dealer carl h lang of chicago sold three bikes from the five built in the davidson backyard shed years later the original shed was taken to the juneau avenue factory where it would stand for many decades as a tribute to the motor companys humble origins until it was accidentally destroyed by contractors cleaning the factory yard in the early s in  harley and the davidson brothers built their first factory on chestnut street later juneau avenue at the current location of harleydavidsons corporate headquarters the first juneau avenue plant was a  ft ×  ft  m ×  m singlestory wooden structure the company produced about  motorcycles that year  model harleydavidson  cc ht  in  william s harley graduated from the university of wisconsin–madison with a degree in mechanical engineering that year additional factory expansion came with a second floor and later with facings and additions of milwaukee pale yellow cream brick with the new facilities production increased to  motorcycles in  the company was officially incorporated that september they also began selling their motorcycles to police departments around this time a market that has been important to them ever since in  william a davidson brother to arthur and walter davidson quit his job as tool foreman for the milwaukee road railroad and joined the motor company production in  and  were all singlecylinder models with  cubic inch  cm³ engines in february  a prototype model with a degree vtwin engine was displayed at the chicago automobile show although shown and advertised very few vtwin models were built between  and  these first vtwins displaced  cubic inches  cm³ and produced about  horsepower  kw this gave about double the power of the first singles top speed was about  mph  kmh production jumped from  motorcycles in  to  machines in  harleydavidson works in  by  some  makes of motorcycles had already been built in the united states – although just a handful would survive the s in  an improved vtwin model was introduced the new engine had mechanically operated intake valves as opposed to the automatic intake valves used on earlier vtwins that opened by engine vacuum with a displacement of  cubic inches  cm³ the  vtwin was smaller than earlier twins but gave better performance after  the majority of bikes produced by harleydavidson would be vtwin models in  harleydavidson introduced their patented fulfloteing seat which was suspended by a coil spring inside the seat tube the spring tension could be adjusted to suit the riders weight more than  inches  mm of travel was available harleydavidson would use seats of this type until  by  the yellow brick factory had been demolished and on the site a new story structure had been built begun in  the factory with its many additions would take up two blocks along juneau avenue and around the corner on th street despite the competition harleydavidson was already pulling ahead of indian and would dominate motorcycle racing after  production that year swelled to  machines ralph hepburn on his harley racing bike in this  photo world war i in  the united states entered world war i and the military demanded motorcycles for the war effort harleys had already been used by the military in the pancho villa expedition but world war i was the first time the motorcycle had been adopted for military issue first with the british model h produced by british triumph motorcycles ltd in  after the us entry into the war the us military purchased over  motorcycles from harleydavidson bicycles harleydavidson launched a line of bicycles in  in hopes of recruiting customers for its motorcycles besides the traditional diamond frame mens bicycle models included a stepthrough frame  ladies standard and a  boy scout for youth the effort was discontinued in  because of disappointing sales the bicycles were built for harleydavidson in dayton ohio by the davis machine company from  to  when davis stopped manufacturing bicycles s harleydavidson  cc ht  by  harleydavidson was the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world with  machines produced and dealers in  countries in  a harleydavidson ridden by otto walker was the first motorcycle ever to win a race at an average speed greater than  mph  kmh during the s several improvements were put in place such as a new  cubic inch   cm³ vtwin introduced in  and the teardrop gas tank in  a front brake was added in  although notably only on the jjd models in the late summer of  harleydavidson introduced its  cubic inches  cm³ flathead vtwin to compete with the indian  scout and the excelsior super x this was the d model produced from  to  riders of indian motorcycles derisively referred to this model as the three cylinder harley because the generator was upright and parallel to the front cylinder the  in  mm bore and  in  mm stroke would continue in most versions of the  engine exceptions include the xa and the xrcitation needed great depression harleydavidson  cc sv  the great depression began a few months after the introduction of their  cubic inch  cm³ model harleydavidsons sales fell from  in  to  in  despite this harleydavidson unveiled a new lineup for  which included a flathead engine and art deco styling in order to survive the remainder of the depression the company manufactured industrial powerplants based on their motorcycle engines they also designed and built a threewheeled delivery vehicle called the servicar which remained in production until  harleydavidson ul in the mids alfred rich child opened a production line in japan with the cubicinch  cm³ vl the japanese licenseholder sankyo seiyaku corporation severed its business relations with harleydavidson in  and continued manufacturing the vl under the rikuo name harleydavidson dealer in texas ca  an cubicinch  cm³ flathead engine was added to the line in  by which time the singlecylinder motorcycles had been discontinued in  the e and el models with the knucklehead ohv engines was introduced valvetrain problems in early knucklehead engines required a redesign halfway through its first year of production and retrofitting of the new valvetrain on earlier engines by  all harleydavidsons flathead engines were equipped with drysump oil recirculation systems similar to the one introduced in the knucklehead ohv engine the revised cubicinch  cm³ v and vl models were renamed u and ul the cubicinch  cc³ vh and vlh to be renamed uh and ulh and the cubicinch  cc³ r to be renamed w in  the cubicinch  cm³ knucklehead was introduced as the f and the fl the cubicinch  cc³ flathead uh and ulh models were discontinued after  while the  inch  mm u  ul flathead models were produced up to  world war ii harley copied the bmw r to produce its xa model one of only two american cycle manufacturers to survive the great depression harleydavidson again produced large numbers of motorcycles for the us army in world war ii and resumed civilian production afterwards producing a range of large vtwin motorcycles that were successful both on racetracks and for private buyers harleydavidson on the eve of world war ii was already supplying the army with a militaryspecific version of its  cubic inches  cm³ wl line called the wla the a in this case stood for army upon the outbreak of war the company along with most other manufacturing enterprises shifted to war work more than  military motorcycles mostly wlas and wlcs the canadian version were produced many to be provided to allies harleydavidson received two armynavy ‘e’ awards one in  and the other in  which were awarded for excellence in production harley produced the wlc for the canadian military shipments to the soviet union under the lendlease program numbered at least  the wlas produced during all four years of war production generally have  serial numbers production of the wla stopped at the end of world war ii but was resumed from  to  for use in the korean war the us army also asked harleydavidson to produce a new motorcycle with many of the features of bmws sidevalve and shaftdriven r harley largely copied the bmw engine and drive train and produced the shaftdriven  cc  harleydavidson xa this shared no dimensions no parts and no design concepts except side valves with any prior harleydavidson engine due to the superior cooling of the flattwin engine with the cylinders across the frame harleys xa cylinder heads ran  °f  °c cooler than its vtwins the xa never entered full production the motorcycle by that time had been eclipsed by the jeep as the armys general purpose vehicle and the wla—already in production—was sufficient for its limited police escort and courier roles only  were made and the xa never went into full production it remains the only shaftdriven harleydavidson ever made small harleys hummers and aermacchis harleydavidson hummer see also harleydavidson hummer and harleydavidson topper as part of war reparations harleydavidson acquired the design of a small german motorcycle the dkw rt  which they adapted manufactured and sold from  to  various models were made including the hummer from  to

when the fourstroke sprint was discontinued after the pacer and scat models were discontinued at the end of  the bobcat became the last of harleydavidsons americanmade twostroke motorcycles the bobcat was manufactured only in the  model year harleydavidson replaced their americanmade lightweight twostroke motorcycles with the aermacchibuilt twostroke powered m ms and rapido the m had a semistepthrough frame and tank the ms was a m with a larger tank that eliminated the stepthrough feature the rapido was a larger bike with a  cc engine the aermacchibuilt harleydavidsons became entirely twostroke powered when the  cc twostroke ss replaced the fourstroke  cc sprint in  harleydavidson purchased full control of aermacchis motorcycle production in  and continued making twostroke motorcycles there until  when they sold the facility to cagiva overseas established in  the oldest continuously operating harleydavidson dealership outside of the united states is in australia sales

commission for a  percent tax on imported motorcycles harleydavidson was charged with restrictive practices amf hd electra glide in  american machine and foundry amf bought the company streamlined production and slashed the workforce this tactic resulted in a labor strike and lowerquality bikes the bikes were expensive and inferior in performance handling and quality to japanese motorcycles sales and quality declined and the company almost went bankrupt the harleydavidson name was mocked as hardly ableson hardly driveable and hogly ferguson and the nickname hog became pejorativecitation

vaughn beals and willie g davidson for  million inventory was strictly controlled using the justintime system in the early eighties harleydavidson claimed that japanese manufacturers were importing motorcycles into the us in such volume as to harm or threaten to harm domestic producers after an investigation by the us international trade commission president reagan imposed in  a  percent tariff on imported bikes with engine capacities greater than  cc harleydavidson subsequently rejected offers of assistance from japanese motorcycle makers however the company did offer to drop the request for the tariff in exchange for loan guarantees from the japanese rather than trying to match the japanese the new management deliberately exploited the retro appeal of the machines building motorcycles that deliberately adopted the look and feel of their earlier machines and the subsequent customizations of owners of that era many components such as brakes forks shocks carburetors electrics and wheels were outsourced from foreign manufacturers and quality increased technical improvements were made and buyers slowly returned harleydavidson bought the sub shock cantileverswingarm rear suspension design from missouri engineer bill davis and developed it into its softail series of motorcycles introduced in  with the fxst softail in response to possible motorcycle market loss due to the aging of babyboomers harleydavidson bought luxury motorhome manufacturer holiday rambler in  in  the company sold holiday rambler to the monaco coach corporation the sturgis model boasting a

harleydavidson increased its share in buell to ninetyeight percent in  and to complete ownership in  in an attempt to attract newcomers to motorcycling in general and to harleydavidson in particular buell developed a lowcost lowmaintenance motorcycle the resulting singlecylinder buell blast was introduced in  and was made through  which according to buell was to be the final year of production on october   harleydavidson inc issued an official statement that it would be discontinuing the buell line and ceasing production immediately the stated reason was to focus on the harleydavidson brand the company refused to consider selling buell founder erik buell subsequently established erik buell racing and continued to manufacture and develop the companys rr racing motorcycle first overseas factory in brazil in  the first harleydavidson factory outside the us opened in manaus brazil taking advantage of the free economic zone there the location was positioned to sell motorcycles in the southern hemisphere market claims of stock price manipulation harleydavidson inc nysehog stock price source zenobankcom during its period of peak demand during the late s and early first decade of the st century harleydavidson embarked on a program of expanding the number of dealerships throughout the country at the same time its current dealers typically had waiting lists that extended up to a year for some of the most popular models harleydavidson like the auto manufacturers records a sale not when a consumer buys their product but rather when it is delivered to a dealer therefore it is possible for the manufacturer to inflate sales numbers by requiring dealers to accept more inventory than desired in a practice called channel stuffing when demand softened following the unique  model year this news led to a dramatic decline in the stock price in april  alone the price of hog shares dropped from more than  to less than  immediately prior to this decline retiring ceo jeffrey bleustein profited  million on the exercise of employee stock options harleydavidson was named as a defendant in numerous class action suits filed by investors who claimed they were intentionally defrauded by harleydavidsons management and directors by january  the price of harleydavidson shares reached  problems with police touring models starting around  several police departments started

the day before the strike after the union voted against the proposed contract and to authorize the strike the company shut down all production at the plant the york facility employs more than  workers both union and nonunion harleydavidson announced on february   that it had reached a labor agreement with union workers at its largest manufacturing plant a breakthrough in the twoweekold strike the

established a subsidiary harleydavidson india in gurgaon near delhi in  and created an indian dealer network financial crisis according to interbrand the value of the harleydavidson brand fell by  percent to  billion in  the fall in value is believed to be connected to the  percent drop in the company profits in two quarters of the previous year on april   harleydavidson stated that they must cut  million in manufacturing costs from its production facilities in wisconsin and that they would explore alternative us sites to accomplish this the announcement came in the wake of a massive companywide restructuring which began in early  and involved the closing of two factories one distribution center and the planned elimination of nearly  percent of its total workforce around  employees the company announced on september   that it would remain in wisconsin motorcycle engines  cc vtwin main article harleydavidson engine timeline the classic harleydavidson engines are vtwin engines with a ° angle between the cylinders the crankshaft has a single pin and both pistons are connected to this pin through their connecting rods this ° angle is covered under several united states patents and is an engineering tradeoff that allows a large hightorque engine in a relatively small space it causes the cylinders to fire at uneven intervals and produces the choppy potatopotato sound so strongly linked to the harleydavidson brand to simplify the engine and reduce costs the vtwin ignition was designed to operate with a single set of points and no distributor this is known as a dual fire ignition system causing both spark plugs to fire regardless of which cylinder was on its compression stroke with the other spark plug firing on its cylinders exhaust stroke effectively wasting a spark the exhaust note is basically a throaty growling sound with some popping the ° design of the engine thus creates a plug firing sequencing as such the first cylinder fires the second rear cylinder fires ° later then there is a ° gap until the first cylinder fires again giving the engine its unique sound harleydavidson has used various ignition systems throughout its history – be it the early points and condenser system big twin up to  and sportsters up to  magneto ignition system used on some  to  sportsters early electronic with centrifugal mechanical advance weights all models  and a half to  or the late electronic with transistorized ignition control module more familiarly known as the black box or the brain all models  to present starting in  the company introduced electronic fuel injection efi as an option for the th anniversary edition electra glide efi became standard on all harleydavidson motorcycles including sportsters upon the introduction of the  product line in  harleydavidson began to participate in the sound quality working group founded by orfield labs bruel and kjaer teac yamaha sennheiser sms and cortex this was the nations first group to share research on psychological acoustics later that year harleydavidson participated in a series of sound quality studies at orfield labs based on recordings taken at the talladega superspeedway with the objective to lower the sound level for eu standards while analytically capturing the harley soundcitation needed this research resulted in the bikes that were introduced in compliance with eu standards for  on february   the company filed a sound trademark application for the distinctive sound of the harleydavidson motorcycle engine the mark consists of the exhaust sound of applicants motorcycles produced by vtwin common crankpin motorcycle engines when the goods are in use nine of harleydavidsons competitors filed comments opposing the application arguing that cruiserstyle motorcycles of various brands use a singlecrankpin vtwin engine which produce a similar sound these objections were followed by litigation in june  the company dropped efforts to federally register

simulating the german autobahn highways without general speed limit between the porsche research and development center in weissach near stuttgart to düsseldorf uncounted samples of engines crashed until an engine successfully passed the  hour nonstop run this was the benchmark for the engineers to approve the start of production for the revolution engine which was documented in the discovery channel special harleydavidson birth of the vrod october   singlecylinder engines  harleydavidson singlecylinder motorcycle ioe singles the first harleydavidson motorcycles were powered by singlecylinder ioe engines with the inlet valve operated by engine vacuum singles of this type continued to be made until  when a pushrod and rocker system was used to operate the overhead inlet valve

arthur davidson and william s harley beginning in  yearold william s harley drew up plans for a small engine with a displacement of  cubic inches  cc³ and fourinch  mm flywheels the engine was designed for use in a regular pedalbicycle frame over the next two years harley and his childhood friend arthur davidson worked on their motorbicycle using the northside milwaukee machine shop at the home of their friend henry melk it was finished in  with the help of arthurs brother walter davidson upon testing their powercycle harley and the davidson brothers found it unable to climb the hills around milwaukee without pedal assistance they quickly wrote off their first motorbicycle as a valuable learning experiment work immediately began on a new and improved secondgeneration machine this first real harleydavidson motorcycle had a bigger engine of  cubic inches  cc³ with  inches  cm flywheels weighing  lb  kg the machines advanced loopframe pattern was similar to the  milwaukee merkel motorcycle designed by joseph merkel later of flying merkel fame the bigger engine and loopframe design took it out of the motorized bicycle category and marked the path to future motorcycle designs the boys also received help with their bigger engine from outboard motor pioneer ole evinrude who was then building gas engines of his own design for automotive use on milwaukees lake street prototype the prototype of the new loopframe harleydavidson was assembled in a  ft ×  ft  m ×  m shed in the davidson family backyard most of the major parts however were made elsewhere including some probably fabricated at the west milwaukee railshops where oldest brother william a davidson was then toolroom foreman this prototype machine was functional by september   when it competed in a milwaukee motorcycle race held at state fair park it was ridden by edward hildebrand and placed fourth this is the first documented appearance of a harleydavidson motorcycle in the historical record in january  small advertisements were placed in the automobile and cycle trade journal offering bare harleydavidson engines to the doityourself trade by april complete motorcycles were in production on a very limited basis that year the first harleydavidson dealer carl h lang of chicago sold three bikes from the five built in the davidson backyard shed years later the original shed was taken to the juneau avenue factory where it would stand for many decades as a tribute to the motor companys humble origins until it was accidentally destroyed by contractors cleaning the factory yard in the early s in  harley and the davidson brothers built their first factory on chestnut street later juneau avenue at the current location of harleydavidsons corporate headquarters the first juneau avenue plant was a  ft ×  ft  m ×  m singlestory wooden structure the company produced about  motorcycles that year  model harleydavidson  cc ht  in  william s harley graduated from the university of wisconsin–madison with a degree in mechanical engineering that year additional factory expansion came with a second floor and later with facings and additions of milwaukee pale yellow cream brick with the new facilities production increased to  motorcycles in  the company was officially incorporated that september they also began selling their motorcycles to police departments around this time a market that has been important to them ever since in  william a davidson brother to arthur and walter davidson quit his job as tool foreman for the milwaukee road railroad and joined the motor company production in  and  were all singlecylinder models with  cubic inch  cm³ engines in february  a prototype model with a degree vtwin engine was displayed at the chicago automobile show although shown and advertised very few vtwin models were built between  and  these first vtwins displaced  cubic inches  cm³ and produced about  horsepower  kw this gave about double the power of the first singles top speed was about  mph  kmh production jumped from  motorcycles in  to  machines in  harleydavidson works in  by  some  makes of motorcycles had already been built in the united states – although just a handful would survive the s in  an improved vtwin model was introduced the new engine had mechanically operated intake valves as opposed to the automatic intake valves used on earlier vtwins that opened by engine vacuum with a displacement of  cubic inches  cm³ the  vtwin was smaller than earlier twins but gave better performance after  the majority of bikes produced by harleydavidson would be vtwin models in  harleydavidson introduced their patented fulfloteing seat which was suspended by a coil spring inside the seat tube the spring tension could be adjusted to suit the riders weight more than  inches  mm of travel was available harleydavidson would use seats of this type until  by  the yellow brick factory had been demolished and on the site a new story structure had been built begun in  the factory with its many additions would take up two blocks along juneau avenue and around the corner on th street despite the competition harleydavidson was already pulling ahead of indian and would dominate motorcycle racing after  production that year swelled to  machines ralph hepburn on his harley racing bike in this  photo world war i in  the united states entered world war i and the military demanded motorcycles for the war effort harleys had already been used by the military in the pancho villa expedition but world war i was the first time the motorcycle had been adopted for military issue first with the british model h produced by british triumph motorcycles ltd in  after the us entry into the war the us military purchased over  motorcycles from harleydavidson bicycles harleydavidson launched a line of bicycles in  in hopes of recruiting customers for its motorcycles besides the traditional diamond frame mens bicycle models included a stepthrough frame  ladies standard and a  boy scout for youth the effort was discontinued in  because of disappointing sales the bicycles were built for harleydavidson in dayton ohio by the davis machine company from  to  when davis stopped manufacturing bicycles s harleydavidson  cc ht  by  harleydavidson was the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world with  machines produced and dealers in  countries in  a harleydavidson ridden by otto walker was the first motorcycle ever to win a race at an average speed greater than  mph  kmh during the s several improvements were put in place such as a new  cubic inch   cm³ vtwin introduced in  and the teardrop gas tank in  a front brake was added in  although notably only on the jjd models in the late summer of  harleydavidson introduced its  cubic inches  cm³ flathead vtwin to compete with the indian  scout and the excelsior super x this was the d model produced from  to  riders of indian motorcycles derisively referred to this model as the three cylinder harley because the generator was upright and parallel to the front cylinder the  in  mm bore and  in  mm stroke would continue in most versions of the  engine exceptions include the xa and the xrcitation needed great depression harleydavidson  cc sv  the great depression began a few months after the introduction of their  cubic inch  cm³ model harleydavidsons sales fell from  in  to  in  despite this harleydavidson unveiled a new lineup for  which included a flathead engine and art deco styling in order to survive the remainder of the depression the company manufactured industrial powerplants based on their motorcycle engines they also designed and built a threewheeled delivery vehicle called the servicar which remained in production until  harleydavidson ul in the mids alfred rich child opened a production line in japan with the cubicinch  cm³ vl the japanese licenseholder sankyo seiyaku corporation severed its business relations with harleydavidson in  and continued manufacturing the vl under the rikuo name harleydavidson dealer in texas ca  an cubicinch  cm³ flathead engine was added to the line in  by which time the singlecylinder motorcycles had been discontinued in  the e and el models with the knucklehead ohv engines was introduced valvetrain problems in early knucklehead engines required a redesign halfway through its first year of production and retrofitting of the new valvetrain on earlier engines by  all harleydavidsons flathead engines were equipped with drysump oil recirculation systems similar to the one introduced in the knucklehead ohv engine the revised cubicinch  cm³ v and vl models were renamed u and ul the cubicinch  cc³ vh and vlh to be renamed uh and ulh and the cubicinch  cc³ r to be renamed w in  the cubicinch  cm³ knucklehead was introduced as the f and the fl the cubicinch  cc³ flathead uh and ulh models were discontinued after  while the  inch  mm u  ul flathead models were produced up to  world war ii harley copied the bmw r to produce its xa model one of only two american cycle manufacturers to survive the great depression harleydavidson again produced large numbers of motorcycles for the us army in world war ii and resumed civilian production afterwards producing a range of large vtwin motorcycles that were successful both on racetracks and for private buyers harleydavidson on the eve of world war ii was already supplying the army with a militaryspecific version of its  cubic inches  cm³ wl line called the wla the a in this case stood for army upon the outbreak of war the company along with most other manufacturing enterprises shifted to war work more than  military motorcycles mostly wlas and wlcs the canadian version were produced many to be provided to allies harleydavidson received two armynavy ‘e’ awards one in  and the other in  which were awarded for excellence in production harley produced the wlc for the canadian military shipments to the soviet union under the lendlease program numbered at least  the wlas produced during all four years of war production generally have  serial numbers production of the wla stopped at the end of world war ii but was resumed from  to  for use in the korean war the us army also asked harleydavidson to produce a new motorcycle with many of the features of bmws sidevalve and shaftdriven r harley largely copied the bmw engine and drive train and produced the shaftdriven  cc  harleydavidson xa this shared no dimensions no parts and no design concepts except side valves with any prior harleydavidson engine due to the superior cooling of the flattwin engine with the cylinders across the frame harleys xa cylinder heads ran  °f  °c cooler than its vtwins the xa never entered full production the motorcycle by that time had been eclipsed by the jeep as the armys general purpose vehicle and the wla—already in production—was sufficient for its limited police escort and courier roles only  were made and the xa never went into full production it remains the only shaftdriven harleydavidson ever made small harleys hummers and aermacchis harleydavidson hummer see also harleydavidson hummer and harleydavidson topper as part of

when the fourstroke sprint was discontinued after the pacer and scat models were discontinued at the end of  the bobcat became the last of harleydavidsons americanmade twostroke motorcycles the bobcat was manufactured only in the  model year harleydavidson replaced their americanmade lightweight twostroke motorcycles with the aermacchibuilt twostroke powered m ms and rapido the m had a semistepthrough frame and tank the ms was a m with a larger tank that eliminated the stepthrough feature the rapido was a larger bike with a  cc engine the aermacchibuilt harleydavidsons became entirely twostroke powered when the  cc twostroke ss replaced the fourstroke  cc sprint in  harleydavidson purchased full control of aermacchis motorcycle production in  and continued making twostroke

commission for a  percent tax on imported motorcycles harleydavidson was charged with restrictive practices amf hd electra glide in  american machine and foundry amf bought the company streamlined production and slashed the workforce this tactic resulted in a labor strike and lowerquality bikes the bikes were expensive and inferior in performance handling and quality to japanese motorcycles

vaughn beals and willie g davidson for  million inventory was strictly controlled using the justintime system in the early eighties harleydavidson claimed that japanese manufacturers were importing motorcycles into the us in such volume as to harm or threaten to harm domestic producers after an investigation by the us international trade commission president reagan imposed in  a  percent tariff on imported bikes with engine capacities greater than  cc harleydavidson subsequently rejected offers of assistance from japanese motorcycle makers however the company did offer to drop the request for the tariff in exchange for loan guarantees from the japanese rather than trying to match the japanese the new management deliberately exploited the retro appeal of the machines building motorcycles that deliberately adopted the look and feel of their earlier machines and the subsequent customizations of owners of that era many components such as brakes forks shocks carburetors electrics and wheels were outsourced from foreign manufacturers and quality increased technical improvements were made and buyers slowly returned harleydavidson bought the sub shock cantileverswingarm rear suspension design from missouri engineer bill davis and developed it into its softail series of motorcycles introduced in  with the fxst softail in response to possible motorcycle market loss due to the aging of babyboomers harleydavidson bought luxury motorhome manufacturer holiday rambler in  in  the company sold holiday rambler to the monaco coach corporation the sturgis model boasting a

harleydavidson increased its share in buell to ninetyeight percent in  and to complete ownership in  in an attempt to attract newcomers to motorcycling in general and to harleydavidson in particular buell developed a lowcost lowmaintenance motorcycle the resulting singlecylinder buell blast was introduced in  and was made through  which according to buell was to be the final year of production on october   harleydavidson inc issued an official statement that it would be discontinuing the buell line and ceasing production immediately the stated reason was to focus on the harleydavidson brand the company refused to consider selling buell founder erik buell subsequently established erik buell racing and continued to manufacture and develop the companys rr racing motorcycle first overseas

southern hemisphere market claims of stock price manipulation harleydavidson inc nysehog stock price source zenobankcom during its period of peak demand during the late s and early first decade of the st century harleydavidson embarked on a program of expanding the number of dealerships throughout the country at the same time its current dealers typically had waiting lists that extended up to a year for some of the most popular models harleydavidson like the auto manufacturers records a sale not when a consumer buys their product but rather when it is delivered to a dealer therefore it is possible for the manufacturer to inflate sales numbers by requiring dealers to accept more inventory than desired in a practice called channel stuffing when demand softened following the unique  model year this news led to a dramatic decline in the stock price in april  alone the price of hog shares dropped from more than  to less than  immediately prior to this decline retiring ceo jeffrey bleustein profited  million on the exercise of employee stock options harleydavidson was named as a defendant in numerous class action suits filed by investors who claimed they were intentionally defrauded by harleydavidsons management and directors by january  the price of harleydavidson shares reached  problems with police touring models starting around  several police departments started

the day before the strike after the union voted against the proposed contract and to authorize the strike the company shut down all production at the plant the york facility employs more than  workers both union and nonunion harleydavidson announced on february   that it had reached a labor agreement with union workers at its largest manufacturing plant a breakthrough in the twoweekold strike the

established a subsidiary harleydavidson india in gurgaon near delhi in  and created an indian dealer network financial crisis according to interbrand the value of the harleydavidson brand fell by  percent to  billion in  the fall in value is believed to be connected to the  percent drop in the company profits in two quarters of the previous year on april   harleydavidson stated that they must cut  million in manufacturing costs from its production facilities in wisconsin and that they would explore alternative us sites to accomplish this the announcement came in the wake of a massive companywide restructuring which began in early  and involved the closing of two factories one distribution center and the planned elimination of nearly  percent of its total workforce around  employees the company announced on september   that it would remain in wisconsin motorcycle engines  cc vtwin main article harleydavidson engine timeline the classic harleydavidson engines are vtwin engines with a ° angle between the cylinders the crankshaft has a single pin and both pistons are connected to this pin through their connecting rods this ° angle is covered under several united states patents and is an engineering tradeoff that allows a large hightorque engine in a relatively small space it causes the cylinders to fire at uneven intervals and produces the choppy potatopotato sound so strongly linked to the harleydavidson brand to simplify the engine and reduce costs the vtwin ignition was designed to operate with a single set of points and no distributor this is known as a dual fire ignition system causing both spark plugs to fire regardless of which cylinder was on its compression stroke with the other spark plug firing on its cylinders exhaust stroke effectively wasting a spark the exhaust note is basically a throaty growling sound with some popping the ° design of the engine thus creates a plug firing sequencing as such the first cylinder fires the second rear cylinder fires ° later then there is a ° gap until the first cylinder fires again giving the engine its unique sound harleydavidson has used various ignition systems throughout its history – be it the early points and condenser system big twin up to  and sportsters up to  magneto ignition system used on some  to  sportsters early electronic with centrifugal mechanical advance weights all models  and a half to  or the late electronic with transistorized ignition control module more familiarly known as the black box or the brain all models  to present starting in  the company introduced electronic fuel injection efi as an option for the th anniversary edition electra glide efi became standard on all harleydavidson motorcycles including sportsters upon the introduction of the  product line in  harleydavidson began to participate in the sound quality working group founded by orfield labs bruel and kjaer teac yamaha sennheiser sms and cortex this was the nations first group to share research on psychological acoustics later that year harleydavidson participated in a series of sound quality studies at orfield labs based on recordings taken at the talladega superspeedway with the objective to lower the sound level for eu standards while analytically capturing the harley soundcitation needed this research resulted in the bikes that were introduced in compliance with eu standards for  on february   the company filed a sound trademark application for the distinctive sound of the harleydavidson motorcycle engine the mark consists of the exhaust sound of applicants motorcycles produced by vtwin common crankpin motorcycle engines when the goods are in use nine of harleydavidsons competitors filed comments opposing the application arguing that cruiserstyle motorcycles of various brands use a singlecrankpin vtwin engine which produce a similar sound these objections were followed by litigation in june  the company dropped efforts to federally register

marketing how harleydavidson mastered product positioning the motorcycle manufacturer has no doubts about its identity heres how you can crystalize yours by laura montini laura montini is a reporter at inc she previously covered health care technology for health  news and has served as an associate editor at the health care blog she lives in san francisco lmmontini reporter inclmmontini  comments credit shutterstock to be able to tell the world about your new product you first need to be able to talk about it internally  this is what it means to position your product to find a great example of strong product positioning take a look at harleydavidson this is the companys internal positioning statement  the only motorcycle manufacturer that makes big loud motorcycles for macho guys and macho wannabes mostly in the united states who want to join a gang of cowboys in an era of decreasing personal freedom its rather poetic but you dont have to be a poet to draft a similarly effective statement developing this kind of mantra is formulaic startup advisor arielle jackson recently told first round review jackson is a former product marketing manager for google and square she recommended using the following structure to come up with your own positioning statement  for target customer who statement of need or opportunity product name is a product category that statement of key benefit unlike competing alternative product namestatement of primary differentiation note that the end result is different from a tagline jackson said taglines are consumerfacing catch phrases that summarize your positioning statement extremely concisely for example one of harleydavidsons tag lines is american by birth rebel by choice   internally positioning statements are crucial because they set the stage for all that will followincluding finding the right people as you expand further developing the product and of course marketing it to your audience it all starts with nailing down your positioning everything stems from that jackson said if youve done it right youll be able to tell everyone why what you’re doing matters in a way that will make them listen and respond published
