marketing in order to have your clients remember your company northstar utilizes cross media marketing this form of marketing utilizes many different mediums to communicate with your clients through cross media marketing you reach out to your clients through one type of media and they respond to your through a different type of media through this avenue you are creating communication and a relationship with your clients and allowing them to also be active in the marketing process in addition you are also collecting information about your clients to better learn about what they need what is an aqueous coating an aqueous coating is a fastdrying waterbased protective coating which is applied right after the ink on a press it provides a super highgloss surface extreme durability which is good for post cards and business cards dries fast and is environmentally friendly if glossy paper isn’t glossy enough for your project an aqueous coating takes your product’s sheen to the next level  some may chose to downgrade to a lower quality less expensive paper and then apply an aqueous coating this makes the final product look and feel much more expensive than it really is either way an aqueous coating is a great upgrade for your fullcolor printed product what is “printready” artwork and why is it important for promotional items and apparel when you supply us with a logo or other artwork for a promotional product or embroideredscreen printed item it is important to provide artwork that is ‘printready’ in the past there were exact technical specifications for what constituted ‘printready’ artwork however with the advent of advanced image manipulation software we can be much more flexible with the type of artwork we can accept the best format for artwork is eps ai adobe illustrator or any other sort of vectorized digital artwork if you are not sure if your digital artwork is vectorized send it to us and we can determine if it is we prefer digital epsvectorized artwork because it can be printed with very little additional manipulation which saves money and helps accelerate the production of your promo item vectorized northstar logo in adobe illustrator showing outlines we can also accept highresolution jpg gif png bmp or printed art with solid colors our software can vectorize the image or the scan the image in the case of printed art as long as it is a crisp clean large welldefined image a small conversion charge may apply in this case partial highresolution jpg of the northstar logo the least preferable form of artwork is small blurry images or images with gradients or nonsolid colors copying your company’s logo from your webpage definitely does not constitute ‘print ready’ time for a redesign if you do not have print ready artwork we can still help our graphic designers can redraw your artwork or create a new logo that will be both printready and a corporate asset for years to come what is pms color pantone matching system or pms color is a standardized color matching system by standardizing colors customers and suppliers in different locations can all refer to the pantone system to make sure colors match without having to contact each other directly there are literally thousands of pms colors across several libraries what is the difference between spot color and process color spot colors such as those in the pms system are simply solid colors printing in spot color is usually a good idea for text and nonphotographic art because it is much cheaper and faster than process color for example most of our envelopes and letterhead are printed using spot colors process color is derived from printing the  primary colors plus black printing in process color is generally necessary for photographic reproduction it is more expensive because each page must be printed on four times for each color what is the embroidery setup all embroidered artwork must be in finished form that will be put in a program that will set up how the embroidery will be stitched when designing artwork to be embroidered it is important to note that any text copy must be large enough to write with a crayola in order for the embroidery to look right unlike silk screen embroidery can be made with up to  different thread colors at no additional cost embroidery is charged by the per thousandth stitch count and not by the color blog – the northstar group inc blog is your data protected data encryption is not just for big corporations in today’s world small and medium sized businesses also need to be vigilant when it comes to protecting their confidential data according to symantec’s  internet security threat report  saw a total of  reported data breaches from companies of all sizes  of those breaches were attributed to theft of datahackers while a combination of improper data use accidental data loss device theft and i hate to say this one it errors accounted for  of data loss in  it’s not just hackers we need to worry about anymore apparently it’s us too there are many different approaches to encrypting your data and it is true that you do not need to employ encryption everywhere in the infrastructure of your business consider the areas where your sensitive data resides and flows the most common areas where encryption is used are endpoint encryption – full pc disk drives removable media and mobile devices are encrypted file and folder encryption – files folders shared drives and even cloud storage are encrypted email encryption – desktop gateway and mobile emails are encrypted whether driven by compliancy hipaa pci etc concern for brand reputation or simply the fear of the legal and monetary costs associated with a breach your data needs to be secure technology advancements have made encryption options more cost–effective and easier for protecting your intellectual property and private data for now i’ll leave you with this thought… if you do happen to become the unfortunate victim of a data breach and that data is encrypted…it is still protected   it’s all in the packaging my sales professor in college use to say “if you want to get your message heard how you say it is as important as what you are saying” in other words “it’s all in the packaging” a good promotional item can become a great promotional item by simply adding some packaging to it you have so much more realestate to add your marketing message and call to action this simply gets you noticed and your message across before they open the box and take out your promotional item if done properly every time you client or prospect picks up or sees your promotional time they will think of you your company and your message prospecting for new clients will no longer be a cold call sending out a useful item in a creative package to a prospect before making the call will set you apart from your competition and increase the chance of getting the appointment did you know that response rates for direct mail campaigns can increase by as much as  when coupled with an effective branded program at trades show people are walking through and picking up items and later looking at them at home or in their hotel room a wellchosen item coupled with a clever designed box or package will help to get your message heard and remembered your prospects or as i like to say future customers will be more likely to visit your website give you a call or request more information with the cost of an average sales call at  to  per call you need to find a more efficient way to get your message across and in front of your prospects and clients better yet wouldn’t it be great to have prospects and clients calling you   choosing the correct promotional item so you want to hand out a promotional item to promote your business you select your item you hand it out but you are underwhelmed by the results what went wrong everything the correct promotional item once handed out can get you noticed build relationships increase sales and drive

promotional handout should be objective focused ask yourself what is your desired goal is it to launch a new product or service to reach a new market or to increase sales of existing product or service who is your target market who are you trying to reach how old are they what is their job function are they tech savvy are they male or female or both answering these questions will help you build a promotional target profile which is critical to your success what delivery method is best how are you going to get your branded promotional item to the correct person it is easier to get your item in the hand of a dock worker than the president of the company the correct delivery system will get your item in the hands of your ideal person what is your message what is the ideal message you want to convey to the person who receives your promotional item the message is as much about what is printed on the items as the item itself if your message is not clear your item will get lost in the

and thank you for your continued patronage social media quantity vs quality how many followers do you have on twitter how many on facebook what about connections on linkedin if you are wishing you had more think about this before wishing for thousands of fans and followers while it may seem nice to have the largest fan base in the world and knowing that your posts tweets and notifications are popping up on many newsfeeds remember that you’re company is not a television station that gets paid based on how many views you receive you need to transform your fans into clients since web based marketing is all about reaching out to people and gathering real time data for your company in order to make relationships it would be in your company’s better interests to have a fan base that you can actually keep up with in order to do this ensure that all your posts are specific to what your business provides in doing this you will be able to actually socialize with your fan base and serve clients who are interested in a long relationship instead of one job remember in every business model your can make a sale however if you take the time to understand what your client’s needs and communicate with them through social media you are creating brand awareness and creating relationships at the same time when not to use your logo your logo is a great way to spread brand awareness and every company would love to have their clients recognize their logo on sight while this is the goal there are times when you should not place your logo on your promotional items the way you present yourself to your clients and potential clients can make or break your marketing plan think about it this way you wouldn’t introduce yourself to potential clients without looking professional and put together so why would you hand out poorly designed promotional items where you squeezed stretched or distorted your logo just so you could place it on a promotional item it will not look professional and this is an example of bad design practices if your logo does not fit there are other ways to represent your brand next to your logo the next best thing to put in your imprint area is your email and web address these still list your company name and you have also provided a point of contact another alternative to placing your full logo on a promotional item is to place an icon in the imprint space that your clients would still recognize this works best when the icon is a part of your logo and can stand alone for example instead of using the long northstar logo the northstar n could be used in its place because it is associated with the brand furthermore if you are seeking design help for your promotions to represent your brand in the most professional way as possible while also still remaining true to your company’s standards northstar’s design team is here to help with all your marketing and promotional endeavors the importance of business cards imagine the scene you are attending a business conference and you hit it off with a potential new customer you are about to leave and hand them a business card how does that business card look does it represent your brand is it clean is it up with the times your business card is still a physical representation of your services for prospective clients to take home after meeting you you want to leave a good lasting impression no one wants to see a poorly designed business card that doesn’t stick with your standards or what you are offering for your clients so if you have not updated your business card if a few years take this into consideration are your logo and layout really working for you once you have established a logo you do not want to completely change it however there are ways to modernize it is it clean if your business card is too busy with too much information on it your clients could discard it because they do not know where to look first make sure the layout makes sense and make sure you are capturing there attention is the design timeless the best way to avoid having to redo your business card again and again is to keep it simple and use designs that will still be acceptable in a few years   it is so easy to allow your business cards to become outdated but if you want your business card to stand out you need to make sure your design is up to date so you are worth remembering make print and promotions work together both your printed projects and your promotional items while often distributed separately are they are meant to work together or show off one united marketing campaign your company standards and design styles play a big part in this but more than that you need to provide both printed and promotional items to your clients as a single marketing plan here is an example when you meet a potential client hand out your business card and receive theirs in return your business card is a representation of your company brand and credibility after you have established contact with your clients then send out or drop off a promotional item that once again represents your brand and plays off the same design of your business card after you have supplied them with a promotional item invite them to join into you cross media marketing campaign that will keep them up to date on your services and will also continue the conversation in this case you are using both print and promotional items as well as your more modern marketing strategies to create a relationship with your clients furthermore with your printed projects and promotions working together you are going to create better brand awareness and you will notice the difference in your bottom line be more social take a guess at the amount of emails you receive a day now think about the amount you delete without even opening the same can be said about mail promotional items and whatever else your company uses to send information to your clients there is so much information pushed in everyone’s face in today’s market that it is more overwhelming than useful we pick and choose what it is we want to pay attention to and the rest goes straight into the trash without a second glance so the question is how to make your company’s marketing and promotions stand out to your consumers it isn’t enough to send out an email or hand out a promotional item with your logo on it anymore instead it is time to begin using a new type of marking where the consumer is just as much a partner in the marketing process as you are this method of marketing is cross media marketing and it allows consumers to optinto a discussion and receive more information about companies that show benefit to them today a company has to be social enough to create the conversation with the consumer because no longer is it a one way conversation with cross media marketing the consumer is playing an active role in the marketing process when a consumer opsin to receive more information they are genuinely interested in receiving the eblasts promotional items mail and any other branded messages your company wishes to send out this will lead to healthier relationships with your clients and in the end it is not just about one business transaction but that relationship to make sure you are reaching your customers in an effective way you need to communicate in the way your consumer chooses to communicate this means reaching out to them through the use of different mediums cross media marketing will ensure those that are interested will receive information about your company and will offer them a chance to spread the word to others who may also be interested as well more than just connecting with your clients cross media marketing can show measurable return on your investment this method of marketing is proven to keep your company fresh in your clients mind and will keep your information out of the trash oops  error – the northstar group inc oops  error return home demolition
