aimed at later stage investments alpha venture partners raises first fund aimed at later stage investments by cale guthrie weissman  written on march   share this article onfacebookshare this article ontwittershare this article ongoogle plusshare this article onlinkedin from the news desk theres a new venture fund in new york but its not taking the same seed and series a spray and pray path thats saturated the market over the last few years alpha venture partners which launched last month and is in the process of closing its first fund will look to make growth stage bets series b and c in established companies seeking scale the company already wrote its first such check to live intent an email advertising startup that raised a  million series c in january alpha has lined up  lps to participate each guaranteeing at least  million some more than  million according to fund cofounder steve brotman he wouldn’t disclose the current fundraising total saying only its enough to get into a first close brotman who cofounded alpha with brian smiga has  years of venture experience under his belt holding positions at greenhill savp the pritzker group venture capital and founding silicon alley venture partners hes invested in  companies both pre and postdot com bust and had two marquee exits liveperson and medidata both of which went public with the latter seeing  times return brotmans has quite a bit of experience with early stage tech companies and a void he sees in the middle marked both contributed to the decision to branch out and start the new fund the structure of the industry is definitely aimed more toward early stage investments brotman tells me theres been a huge boom in seed and series a investing but far fewer firms investing in series bs and cs thats because he says theres a fetishizing for early stage investing as well as a decline in the capital needs of young businesses but brotman has also seen a need for investors wanting to be part of something solid with the potential of an earlier exit limited partners dont want to wait ten years for an exit he says calling later stage rounds undersubscribed” some in the valley may disagree theres been a growing resurgence in growthstage investing lately driven in large part by the success of yuri milner chris sacca and others making latestage bets on facebook twitter and the like at the same time brotmans mileage may vary and surely theres need among less highprofile latestage companies it may require more capital to obtain a meaningful stake in an established company but its also a safer bet according to the wall street journal three out of four startups fail at the same time statistics show that most companies falter at series a and series b but once passed that it’s smooth sailing relatively alpha plans a passive investment strategy brotman and his partners will not serve on boards nor lead investments we are a coinvestor in an opportunity that needs more capital he says brotman adds that this approach should appear advantageous to investors hoping to see sizable returns but with a risk profile of backing proven companies and seeking scale for some investors that strategy could prove to be assuring one real plus he sees is that these laterstage investments dont require as much diligence as those in their early stages to some investors this could seem less exhilarating than discovering the next twitter at the seed stage but easier on the blood pressure historically of course venture returns arent this cut and dried no matter the stage of investment its never a sure bet image via alphavp share this article onfacebookshare this article ontwittershare this article ongoogle plusshare this article onlinkedin read this next alpha venture partners launches
