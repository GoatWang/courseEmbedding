through chipmos shanghai a whollyowned subsidiary incorporated in mainland china in june  chipmos shanghai is engaged in wafer testing and semiconductor assembly and testing industry overview of the semiconductor manufacturing process the manufacturing of semiconductors is a complex process that requires increasingly sophisticated engineering and manufacturing expertise the manufacturing process may be broadly divided into the following stages   click to enlarge   process    description circuit design    the design of a semiconductor is developed by laying out circuit patterns and interconnections wafer fabrication    wafer fabrication begins with the generation of a photomask a photographic negative onto which a circuit design pattern is etched or transferred by an electron beam or laser beam writer each completed wafer contains many fabricated chips each known as a die wafer probe    each individual die is then electrically tested or probed for defects dies that fail this test are discarded or in some cases salvaged for repair assembly    the assembly of semiconductors serves to protect the die facilitates its integration into electronic systems and enables the dissipation of heat the process begins with the dicing of the wafers into chips each die is affixed to a leadframebased or organic substratebased package then electrical connections are formed in many cases by connecting the terminals on the die to the inner leads of the package using fine metal wires finally each chip is encapsulated for protection usually in a molded epoxy enclosure final test    assembled semiconductors are tested to ensure that the device meets performance specifications testing takes place on specialized equipment using software customized for each application for memory semiconductors this process also includes burnin testing to screen out defective devices by applying very high temperatures and voltages to the memory device     s table of contents outsourcing trends in semiconductor manufacturing historically integrated device manufacturers or idms designed manufactured tested and assembled semiconductors primarily at their own facilities in recent years there has been a trend in the industry to outsource stages in the manufacturing process to reduce the high fixed costs resulting from the increasingly complex manufacturing process virtually every significant stage of the manufacturing process can be outsourced the independent semiconductor manufacturing services market currently consists of wafer fabrication and probing services and semiconductor testing and assembly services most of the worlds major idms now use some independent semiconductor manufacturing services to maintain a strategic mix of internal and external manufacturing capacity we believe that many of these idms are significantly reducing their investments in new semiconductor testing and assembly facilities the availability of technologically advanced independent semiconductor manufacturing services has also enabled the growth of fabless semiconductor companies that focus exclusively on semiconductor design and marketing and outsource their fabrication testing and assembly requirements to independent companies we believe the outsourcing of semiconductor manufacturing services and in particular of testing and assembly services will increase for many reasons including the following        significant capital expenditure requirements driven by increasingly sophisticated technological requirements wafer fabrication testing and assembly processes have become highly complex requiring substantial investment in specialized equipment and facilities and sophisticated engineering and manufacturing expertise in addition product life cycles have been shortening magnifying the need to continually upgrade or replace manufacturing testing and assembly equipment to accommodate new products as a result new investments in inhouse fabrication testing and assembly facilities are becoming less desirable for idms because of the high investment costs as well as difficulties in achieving sufficient economies of scale and utilization rates to be competitive with the independent service providers independent foundry testing and assembly companies on the other hand are able to realize the benefits of specialization and achieve economies of scale by providing services to a large base of customers across a wide range of products this enables them to reduce costs and shorten production cycles through high capacity utilization and process expertise        increasing focus on core competencies as the costs of semiconductor manufacturing facilities increase semiconductor companies are expected to further outsource their manufacturing operations such as wafer fabrication testing and assembly requirements that allow them to focus their resources on semiconductor design and marketing which these firms consider to be their core competencies        timetomarket pressure increasingly short product life cycles have amplified timetomarket pressure for semiconductor companies leading them to rely increasingly on independent companies as a key source for effective wafer fabrication testing and assembly services semiconductor testing and assembly services industry growth in the semiconductor testing and assembly services industry is driven by increased outsourcing of the various stages of the semiconductor manufacturing process by idms and fabless semiconductor companies the semiconductor industry and conditions of outsourcing in taiwan and mainland china taiwan is one of the worlds leading locations for outsourced semiconductor manufacturing the semiconductor industry in taiwan has developed such that the various stages of the semiconductor manufacturing process have been disaggregated thus allowing for specialization the disaggregation of the semiconductor manufacturing process in taiwan permits these semiconductor manufacturing service providers to focus on particular parts of the production process develop economies of scale maintain higher capacity utilization rates and remain flexible in responding to customer needs by lowering timetomarket pressure faced by semiconductor companies there are several leading service providers in taiwan each of which offers substantial capacity highquality manufacturing leading semiconductor wafer fabrication test assembly and process technologies and a full range of services these service providers have access to an educated labor pool and a large number of engineers suitable for sophisticated manufacturing industries as a result many of the worlds leading semiconductor     s table of contents companies outsource some or all of their semiconductor manufacturing needs to taiwans semiconductor manufacturing service providers and take advantage of the close proximity among facilities in addition companies located in taiwan are very active in the design and manufacture of electronic systems which has created significant local demand for semiconductor devices mainland china has emerged as a similarly attractive location for outsourced semiconductor manufacturing mainland china is an attractive manufacturing location for electronic products because companies can take advantage of a welleducated yet lowcost labor force cost savings due to tax benefits and a large domestic market these factors have driven increased relocation of much of the electronics industry manufacturing and supply chain to mainland china an increasing number of global electronic systems manufacturers and contract manufacturers are relocating or have relocated production facilities to mainland china we believe that these electronic product manufacturers and contract manufacturers will source an increasing portion of their demand for semiconductors from semiconductor suppliers located in mainland china in order to reduce production cycle times decrease costs simplify supply chain logistics and meet local content requirements in line with this trend we have in recent years expanded our operations in mainland china our business strategies our goal is to reinforce our position as a leading independent provider of semiconductor testing and assembly services concentrating principally on memory logicmixedsignal and lcd and other flatpanel display driver semiconductors the principal components of our business strategy are set forth below focus on providing our services to potential growth segments of the semiconductor industry we intend to continue our focus on developing and providing advanced testing and assembly services for potential growth segments of the semiconductor industry such as memory logicmixedsignal lcd and other flatpanel display driver semiconductors and bumping services we believe that our investments in equipment and research and development in some of these areas allow us to offer a differentiated service from our competition in order to benefit from the expected resumption of growth in these segments we intend to continue to invest in capacity to meet the testing and assembly requirements of these key semiconductor market segments continue to invest in the research and development of advanced testing and assembly technologies we believe that our ability to progressively provide more advanced testing and assembly services to customers is critical to our business in addition advanced semiconductor testing and assembly services typically have the potential to generate higher margins due to the greater expertise required and the more sophisticated technologies used we will continue to invest in the research and development of advanced testing and assembly technologies for example we are expanding our capabilities in finepitch bga multichip package mcp system in package sip flip chip wafer level chip scale packaging wlcsp and the testing and assembly of cofs we have also introduced finepitch cof based on our proprietary technology and cog testing and assembly services for lcd and other flatpanel display driver semiconductors in addition we will continue to pursue the development of new testing and assembly technologies jointly with domestic and foreign research institutions and universities we expect to focus our research and development efforts in the following areas        developing new software conversion programs to increase the capabilities of our testers        developing advanced assembly technologies for flip chip and highspeed and mobile memory devices        developing finepitch bumping chip probing and bonding technologies for fine pitch lcd drivers        developing copper bump plating technology to reduce the gold usage for lcd drivers and launch wlcsp thick copper and flip chip products to serve logicmixedsignal and memory products        improving manufacturing yields for new assembly technologies     s table of contents      improving manufacturing yields for new assembly technologies and        developing environmentally friendly assembly services that focus on eliminating the lead and halogen elements from the materials employed in the package and reducing the toxicity of gaseous chemical wastes in  we spent approximately  of our net revenue on research and development we will continue to invest our resources to recruit and retain experienced research and development personnel as of september   our research and development team comprised  persons build on our strong presence in taiwan and expand our operations outside taiwan we intend to build on our strong presence in key centers of semiconductor and electronics manufacturing to grow our business currently most of our operations are in taiwan one of the worlds leading locations for outsourced semiconductor manufacturing this presence provides us with several advantages first our proximity to other semiconductor companies is attractive to customers who wish to outsource various stages of the semiconductor manufacturing process second our proximity to many of our suppliers customers and the endusers of our customers products enables us to be involved in the early stages of the semiconductor design process enhances our ability to quickly respond to our customers changing requirements and shortens our customers timetomarket third we have access to an educated labor pool and a large number of engineers who are able to work closely with our customers and other providers of semiconductor manufacturing services as with our operations in taiwan we intend to similarly benefit from our operations in mainland china we intend to invest in and expand our operations in mainland china increasing our testing and assembly services for memory and logicmixedsignal semiconductors depending on customers demands market conditions and other relevant considerations we may from time to time look into other opportunities to expand our operations outside taiwan expand our offering of vertically integrated services we believe that one of our competitive strengths is our ability to provide vertically integrated services to our customers vertically integrated services consist of the integrated testing assembly and direct shipment of semiconductors to endusers designated by our customers providing vertically integrated services enables us to shorten lead times for our customers as timetomarket and cost increasingly become sources of competitive advantage for our customers they increasingly value our ability to provide them with comprehensive backend services through chipmos taiwan thailin and chipmos shanghai we are able to offer vertically integrated services for a broad range of products including memory logicmixedsignal and lcd and other flatpanel display driver semiconductors we believe that these affiliations which offer complementary technologies products and services as well as additional capacity will continue to enhance our own development and expansion efforts into new and potential growth markets we intend to establish new alliances with leading companies and if suitable opportunities arise engage in merger and acquisition activities that will further expand the services we can provide focus on increasing sales through longterm agreements with key customers as well as business with smaller customers from time to time we strategically agree to commit a portion of our testing and assembly capacity to certain of our customers we intend to continue to focus on increasing sales to key customers through longterm capacity agreements the customers with which we currently have longterm agreements include a reputable memory customer based in the us global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tight credit conditions and recession in most major economies continuing into  beginning in  we also resumed our focus on our business with smaller customers or customers who do not place orders on a regular basis we believe that the dual focused strategy will assist us to be better prepared for the current economic volatility and ensure maximum utilization rate of our capacity     s table of contents recent developments extension of wafer test service agreement with spansion on june   our majorityowned subsidiary chipmos taiwan announced that it reached an agreement to extend its exclusive wafer sort services contract with spansion inc for two years until april  chipmos taiwan has served as spansions exclusive wafer sort subcontractor since april  metal composite bump technology development to lessen the effects that rising gold prices have on the standard gold bumping processes used for lcd driver integrated circuits  ics  we developed a lower cost copperbased technology that replaces the majority of the gold in the bump structure or metal composite bump  mcb  we began implementing the mcb technology for both  and  inch wafers during q  this technology is experiencing positive market acceptance and enables our customers to improve products margins further the developed copper plating capabilities also enable us to enter advanced packaging segments such as wlcsp and flip chip packaging that allow us to capture greater market share for lowdensity memory products mixedsignal products and power devices these products are used in both mobile and cloudcomputing system structures given the strong demand for products in these endmarkets we believe that advanced packaging processes are increasingly important in todays osat market and offer strong growth opportunities finally in conjunction with our assembly and testing services introducing additional advanced packaging alternatives allows us to improve our standing as a full turnkey service provider in this market at current output and capacity levels we are confident that we will be able to continue meeting our customers demand for services recently output for our gold bumping line reached approximately  inch wafer equivalent per month and our inch copper plating capacity for mcb wlcsp and flip chip increased to  wafers per month as of september   by q  our inch wafer copper bump plating line will provide capacity for  wafers per month in addition our new inch gold bumping line capacity is  wafers per month positioning us to accommodate the lcd driver industry transition to this wafer size these recently added capabilities allow us to further enhance our services for

risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations these risks could materially affect our business results of operations or financial condition and cause the value of our securities to decline risks relating to our business if we are unable to compete effectively in the highly competitive semiconductor testing and assembly markets we may lose customers and our income may decline the semiconductor testing and assembly markets are very competitive we face competition from a number of idms with inhouse testing and assembly capabilities and other independent semiconductor testing and assembly companies our competitors may have access to more advanced technologies and greater financial and other resources than we do many of our competitors have shown a willingness to reduce prices quickly and sharply in the past to maintain capacity utilization in their facilities during periods of reduced demand in addition an increasing number of our competitors conduct their operations in lower cost centers in asia such as mainland china thailand vietnam and the philippines any renewed or continued erosion in the prices or demand for our testing and assembly services as a result of increased competition could adversely affect our profits the ongoing criminal proceeding of and adverse publicity associated with mr shihjye cheng our chairman and chief executive officer and mr hungchiu hu our former director could have a material adverse effect on our business and cause our stock price to decline mr shihjye cheng our chairman and chief executive officer was indicted by the taipei district prosecutors office or the prosecutor in december  based upon information released by the prosecutor the indictment alleges that mr shihjye cheng as instructed by mr hungchiu hu purchased repurchase notes on january  january  and january   from founder associates limited a british virgin islands company affiliated with mega securities co ltd formerly known as barits international securities co ltd with an aggregate principal amount of approximately us million by using corporate funds from chipmos taiwan and thailin the indictment further alleges that these repurchase notes were used as a cover to misuse the corporate funds of mosel vitelic inc mosel and its affiliated entities including chipmos taiwan and thailin in violation of roc law in addition the indictment alleges that mr hu and others were engaged in the insider trading of the securities of mosel in violation of roc law but none of the current officers at chipmos taiwan or thailin was indicted in this regard on january   our board established a special committee to evaluate the circumstances surrounding the indictment of mr cheng the special committee engaged kl gates llp formerly kirkpatrick  lockhart   s table of contents preston gates ellis llp as its independent international legal counsel baker  mckenzie as its independent roc legal counsel and ernst  young formerly diwan ernst  young as its financial advisor to assist in its investigation as of september   the special committee was solely comprised of mr yeongher wang our independent director the special committees investigation focused on  the probability that mr shihjye cheng would be convicted on the charges described in the indictment  whether the indictment resulted in any pecuniary or other damage to us  whether there were any internal control weaknesses related to the investments in repurchase notes within chipmos bermuda and its subsidiaries and  whether chipmos bermuda is required by applicable laws or the nasdaq global select market listing requirements to take any action in connection with the indictment the special committee did not attempt to independently determine whether mr cheng had engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with the investments in repurchase notes irrespective of whether such wrongdoing would lead to a conviction on the charges under the indictment on june   the special committee issued its report including its findings and recommendations based upon the results of its investigation it found that  mr shihjye cheng has declared himself not guilty of the charges described in the indictment  baker  mckenzie after reviewing the indictment and the prosecutors exhibits has found that the evidence produced by the prosecutor seems to be inadequate and that there is a low probability of the charge of irregular transactions in the indictment being founded  the financial advisor to the special committee has found that we suffered no loss not taking into account exchange rate factors and that all monies capital and interest were remitted back to our subsidiaries involved  we have suffered no identifiable harm to our reputation or business and  mr cheng has not been impaired by the indictment to perform as our chairman and chief executive officer the special committee recommended that our board maintain mr cheng as our chairman and chief executive officer with full responsibilities and our board unanimously with mr cheng having recused himself resolved to accept and adopt the special committees recommendation with regard to mr cheng our board of directors also resolved to continue the role of the special committee for the duration of the ongoing criminal proceeding involving mr cheng to actively monitor any developments of the criminal investigation and take or recommend any appropriate action in light of such developments on october   the taipei district court found mr shihjye cheng not guilty and on october   the prosecutor appealed the taipei district court decision at the taiwan high court the taiwan high court held four trial hearings in  six trial hearings in  and six trial hearings in  due to the rotation of the judges in the meantime a new bench was formed at the beginning of  to try this case two trial hearings have since been conducted by the new bench in  on may   the taiwan high court held a hearing to examine the legality and admissibility of certain evidence related to the case the court has not made any substantial rulings with respect to the outcome of the case the date of next hearing is scheduled to be held on november   theoretically as a result of prosecutors appeal mr cheng may still be convicted of one or more charges in the indictment in addition new evidence that leads to additional criminal charges andor an adverse judgment against mr cheng may be produced during the ongoing criminal investigation and the special committee may make recommendations to our board in respect of mr chengs positions with us or our subsidiaries however up to the present no new evidence or charge has been presented or collected by the prosecutor or the court therefore we are reasonably confident that the nonguilty judgment for mr cheng will be maintained by the taiwan high court if mr cheng is convicted or in light of any new developments the special committee may recommend or our board of directors may otherwise decide that it is in the companys best interests that mr cheng no longer serves in all or some of his current capacities with us or our subsidiaries or if mr cheng resigns as a result of a final adverse judgment rendered against him by the court or otherwise the public perception of us may be seriously harmed and we would lose some or all of the services of mr cheng in addition if mr cheng is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment the roc financial supervisory commission may subject chipmos taiwan or thailin to certain restrictions on financing activities if mr cheng continues to serve as the chairman or president of chipmos taiwan or thailin mr cheng is very important to our current   s table of contents ongoing business operations and our relationships with our customers and financing sources and our loss of his services due to and any adverse publicity from the trial or conviction of mr cheng or other key personnel could materially and adversely affect our business reputation and prospects and therefore cause our stock price to decline we are highly dependent on the market for memory products a downturn in market prices for these products could significantly reduce our net revenue and net income a significant portion of our net revenue is derived from testing and assembling memory semiconductors our net revenue derived from the testing and assembly of memory semiconductors accounted for   and  of our net revenue in   and  respectively in the past our service fees for testing and assembling memory semiconductors were sharply reduced in tandem with the decrease in the average selling price of dram in the semiconductor industry the continuing oversupply of dram products in  and the weak demand in the dram market in   and  resulted in significant reductions in the price of dram products which in turn drove down the average prices for our testing and assembly services for dram products in these periods we cannot assure you that there will not be further downturns in dram prices in the future a decrease in market demand for lcd and other flatpanel display driver semiconductors may adversely affect our capacity utilization rates and thereby negatively affect our profitability our testing and assembly services for lcd and other flatpanel display driver semiconductors generated net revenue of nt million nt million and nt million in   and  respectively we invested nt million nt million and nt million in   and  respectively on equipment for tape carrier package or tcp chiponfilm or cof and chiponglass or cog technologies which are used in testing and assembly services for lcd and other flatpanel display driver semiconductors most of this equipment may not be used for technologies other than tcp cof or cog the market demand for lcd and other flatpanel display driver semiconductors and related testing and assembly services increased in  compared to the market demand in  any significant decrease in demand for these products and our related services however would significantly impair our capacity utilization rates that may result in our inability to generate sufficient revenue to cover the significant depreciation expenses for the equipment used in testing and assembling lcd and other flatpanel display driver semiconductors thereby negatively affecting our profitability see also because of our high fixed costs if we are unable to achieve relatively high capacity utilization rates our earnings and profitability may be adversely affected our significant amount of indebtedness and interest expense will limit our cash flow and could adversely affect our operations we have a significant level of debt and interest expense as of december   we had approximately nt million and nt million outstanding longterm and shortterm indebtedness respectively our longterm indebtedness as of december   represented bank loans with an interest rate between  and  as of december   nt million of our shortterm indebtedness and nt million of our longterm indebtedness was secured by collateral comprised of assets owned by chipmos taiwan and thailin our significant indebtedness poses risks to our business including the risks that we may have to use a substantial portion of our consolidated cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing the funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes        insufficient cash flow from operations may force us to sell assets or seek additional capital which we may be unable to do at all or on terms favorable to us        our ability to sell assets or seek additional capital may be adversely affected by security interests in our assets granted to our lenders as collateral   s table of contents      our level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns and        our debt service obligations increase our vulnerabilities to competitive pressures because many of our competitors may be less leveraged than we are for additional information on our indebtedness see item  operating and financial review and prospectsliquidity and capital resources in our annual report on form f for the year ended december   which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement our results of operations may fluctuate significantly and may cause the market price of our common shares to be volatile our results of operations have varied significantly from period to period and may continue to vary in the future among the more important factors affecting our quarterly and annual results of operations are the following        our ability to accurately predict customer demand as we must commit significant capital expenditures in anticipation of future orders        our ability to quickly adjust to unanticipated declines or shortfalls in demand and market prices for our testing and assembly services due to our high percentage of fixed costs        changes in prices for our testing and assembly services        volume of orders relative to our testing and assembly capacity        capital expenditures and production uncertainties relating to the rollout of new testing or assembly services        our ability to obtain adequate testing and assembly equipment on a timely basis        changes in costs and availability of raw materials equipment and labor        changes in our product mix and        earthquakes drought and other natural disasters as well as industrial accidents because of the factors listed above our future results of operations or growth rates may be below the expectations of research analysts and investors if so the market price of our common shares and the market value of your investment may fall we depend on key customers for a substantial portion of our net revenue and a loss of or deterioration of the business from or delayed payment by any one of these customers could result in decreased net revenue and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we depend on a small group of customers for a substantial portion of our business in  our top five customers collectively accounted for  of our net revenue as part of our strategy we have been focusing on sales to key customers through longterm service agreements we also focus on our business with smaller customers and customers who do not place orders on a regular basis we expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively limited number of customers for a significant portion of our net revenue any adverse development in our key customers operations competitive position or customer base could materially reduce our net revenue and adversely affect our business and profitability our customer promos technologies inc promos is an affiliate of mosel commencing april   mosel and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are no longer related parties to the company in march  promos defaulted on its payment obligations under our longterm service agreement in november  we entered into a revised subcontracting contract with promos by requiring promos to provide wafers with a value of  of the subcontracting fee as collateral effective march  we started to request prepayments from   s table of contents promos in may  a further revised subcontracting contract was entered into by and between us and promos under which promos provided us with wafer as a pledge for its payment obligations and workinprocess or wip and existing finished goods would serve as lien material part of promos receivables had been recovered through sales of the pledged wafer and lien material back to promos with a discount to market price and the remaining outstanding accounts receivables have been secured by equipment mortgage under the same contract arrangement nt million was received by april  the remaining outstanding accounts receivables have been paid under the amended subcontracting contract and settlement with promos promos paid us nt million and nt million in may  and december  respectively and the remaining nt million was paid in nine monthly installments ended on march   all sums have been received in  we have no other concern regarding the collection with promos in  see item  information on the companycustomers in our annual report on form f for the year ended december   which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement in january  our customer spansion llc spansion defaulted on its payment obligations under our longterm service agreement and we subsequently terminated the longterm service agreement with spansion on february   on march   spansion filed for a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter  of the us bankruptcy code on january   chipmos taiwan entered into a definitive transfer of claim agreement to sell to citigroup financial products inc citigroup the general unsecured claim reflected in the proof of claim against spansion in february  we received from citigroup the purchase price for the undisputed claim of nt million against accounts receivable of nt million we recognized a related loss on sale of receivables of nt million and we reversed the related allowance for doubtful receivables of nt million in  on october   chipmos taiwan entered into a settlement agreement with spansion llc for the general unsecured claim on breach of contract and liquidated damages rights reflected in the proof of claim claim no  against spansion inc spansion technology llc spansion llc spansion international inc and cerium laboratories llc filed by chipmos taiwan in the us bankruptcy court in october  the company received payment of nt million under the transfer of claim agreement to citigroup see item  information on the companycustomers in our annual report on form f for the year ended december   which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement since semiconductor companies generally rely on service providers with whom they have established relationships to meet their testing and assembly needs for their applications and new customers usually require us to pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process if we lose any of our key customers we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner we cannot assure you that receivable collection difficulties experienced by us will not occur in the future if any of our key customers reduces or cancels its orders or terminates existing contractual arrangements and if we are unable to attract new customers and establish new contractual arrangements with existing or new customers our net revenue could be reduced and our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected because of our high fixed costs if we are unable to achieve relatively high capacity utilization rates our earnings and profitability may be adversely affected our operations are characterized by a high proportion of fixed costs for memory and logicmixedsignal semiconductor testing services our fixed costs represented   and  of our total cost of revenue in   and  respectively for memory and logicmixedsignal semiconductor assembly services our fixed costs represented   and  of our total cost of revenue in   and  respectively for lcd and other flatpanel display driver semiconductor testing and assembly services our fixed costs represented   and  of our total cost of revenue in   and  respectively for bumping services our fixed costs represented   and  of our total cost of revenue in   and  respectively our profitability depends in part not only on absolute pricing levels for our services but also on the utilization rates for our testing and assembly equipment commonly referred to as capacity utilization rates increases or decreases in our capacity utilization rates can significantly affect our gross margins as unit costs generally   s table of contents decrease as the fixed costs are allocated over a larger number of units in the past our capacity utilization rates have fluctuated significantly as a result of the fluctuations in the market demand for semiconductors if we fail to increase or maintain our capacity utilization rates our earnings and profitability may be adversely affected in addition we have entered into various longterm assembly and testing services agreements with certain of our customers that may require us to incur significant capital expenditures if we are unable to achieve high capacity utilization rates for the equipment purchased pursuant to these agreements our gross margins may be materially and adversely affected the testing and assembly process is complex and our production yields and customer relationships may suffer as a result of defects or malfunctions in our testing and assembly equipment and the introduction of new packages semiconductor testing and assembly are complex processes that require significant technological and process expertise semiconductor testing involves sophisticated testing equipment and computer software we develop computer software to test our customers semiconductors we also develop conversion software programs that enable us to test semiconductors on different types of testers similar to most software programs these software programs are complex and may contain programming errors or bugs in addition the testing process is subject to human error by our employees who operate our testing equipment and related software any significant defect in our testing or conversion software malfunction in our testing equipment or human error could reduce our production yields and damage our customer relationships the assembly process involves a number of steps each of which must be completed with precision defective packages primarily result from        contaminants in the manufacturing environment        human error        equipment malfunction        defective raw materials or        defective plating services these and other factors have from time to time contributed to lower production yields they may do so in the future particularly as we expand our capacity or change our processing steps in addition to be competitive we must continue to expand our offering of packages our production yields on new packages typically are significantly lower than our production yields on our more established packages our failure to maintain high standards or acceptable production yields if significant and prolonged could result in a loss of customers increased costs of production delays substantial amounts of returned goods and related claims by customers further to the extent our customers have set target production yields we may be required to compensate our customers in a preagreed manner any of these problems could materially adversely affect our business reputation and result in reduced net revenue and profitability because of the highly cyclical nature of our industry our capital requirements are difficult to plan if we cannot obtain additional capital when we need it we may not be able to maintain or increase our current growth rate and our profits will suffer as our industry is highly cyclical and rapidly changing our capital requirements are difficult to plan to remain competitive we may need capital to fund the expansion of our facilities as well as to fund our equipment purchases and research and development activities to meet our liquidity capital spending and other capital needs we have taken and plan to take certain measures to generate additional working capital and to save cash see item  operating and financial review and prospectsliquidity and capital resources in our annual report on form f for the year ended december   which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement we cannot assure you that these plans and measures will be implemented or will provide sufficient sources of capital   s table of contents in addition future capacity expansions or market or other developments may require additional funding our ability to obtain external financing in the future depends on a number of factors many of which are beyond our control they include        our future financial condition results of operations and cash flows        general market conditions for financing activities by semiconductor testing and assembly companies and        economic political and other conditions in taiwan and elsewhere if we are unable to obtain funding in a timely manner or on acceptable terms our growth prospects and potential future profitability will suffer disputes over intellectual property rights could be costly deprive us of technologies necessary for us to stay competitive render us unable to provide some of our services and reduce our opportunities to generate revenue our ability to compete successfully and achieve future growth will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies and to secure on commercially acceptable terms critical technologies that we do not own we cannot assure you that we will be able to independently develop or secure from any third party the technologies required for our testing and assembly services our failure to successfully obtain these technologies may seriously harm our competitive position and render us unable to provide some of our services our ability to compete successfully also depends on our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others the semiconductor testing and assembly industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights we may incur legal liabilities if we infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others we are not able to ascertain what patent applications have been filed in the united states or elsewhere however until they are granted if any third party succeeds in its intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers we could be required to        discontinue using the disputed process technologies which would prevent us from offering some of our testing and assembly services        pay substantial monetary damages        develop noninfringing technologies which may not be feasible or        acquire licenses to the infringed technologies which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all any one of these developments could impose substantial financial and administrative burdens on us and hinder our business we are from time to time involved in litigation in respect of intellectual property rights any litigation whether as plaintiff or defendant is costly and diverts our resources if we fail to obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or if litigation regardless of the outcome relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters occurs our costs could be substantially increased to impact our margins any such litigation could also prevent us from testing and assembling particular products or using particular technologies which could reduce our opportunities to generate revenue for more information on litigation in respect of intellectual property rights see item  financial informationlegal proceedings in our annual report on form f for the year ended december   which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement if we are unable to obtain raw materials and other necessary inputs from our suppliers in a timely and cost effective manner our production schedules would be delayed and we may lose customers and growth opportunities and become less profitable our operations require us to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials at acceptable prices in a timely and costeffective manner we source most of our raw materials including critical materials like leadframes organic   s table of contents substrates epoxy gold wire and molding compound for assembly and tapes for tcpcof from a limited group of suppliers we purchase all of our materials on a purchase order basis and have no longterm contracts with any of our suppliers from time to time suppliers have extended lead times increased the price or limited the supply of required materials to us because of market shortages consequently we may from time to time experience difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of raw materials on a timely basis in addition from time to time we may reject materials that do not meet our specifications resulting in declines in output or yield although we typically maintain at least two suppliers for each key raw material we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials and other supplies of an acceptable quality in the future it usually takes from three to six months to switch from one supplier to another depending on the complexity of the raw material if we are unable to obtain raw materials and other necessary inputs in a timely and costeffective manner we may need to delay our production and delivery schedules which may result in the loss of business and growth opportunities and could reduce our profitability if we are unable to obtain additional testing and assembly equipment or facilities in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost we may be unable to fulfill our customers orders and may become less competitive and less profitable the semiconductor testing and assembly business is capital intensive and requires significant investment in expensive equipment manufactured by a limited number of suppliers the market for semiconductor testing and assembly equipment is characterized from time to time by intense demand limited supply and long delivery cycles our operations and expansion plans depend on our ability to obtain equipment from a limited number of suppliers in a timely and costeffective manner we have no binding supply agreements with any of our suppliers and we acquire our testing and assembly equipment on a purchase order basis which exposes us to changing market conditions and other significant risks semiconductor testing and assembly also requires us to operate sizeable facilities if we are unable to obtain equipment or facilities in a timely manner we may be unable to fulfill our customers orders which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations as well as our growth prospects previously we committed to acquire certain wafer sorting testers and probers under our longterm service agreement with spansion we terminated that agreement and commitment on february   after spansion defaulted on its payment obligations currently we do not have any longterm service agreements that require our commitment to acquire additional testing and assembly equipment or facilities however we cannot assure you that such commitment will not be made in the future see item  information on the companycustomers in our annual report on form f for the year ended december   which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement if we are unable to manage the expansion of our operations and resources effectively our growth prospects may be limited and our future profitability may be reduced we expect to continue to expand our operations and increase the number of our employees rapid expansion puts a strain on our managerial technical financial operational and other resources as a result of our expansion we will need to implement additional operational and financial controls and hire and train additional personnel we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so effectively in the future and our failure to do so could jeopardize our expansion plans and seriously harm our operations bermuda law may be less protective of shareholder rights than laws of the united states or other jurisdictions our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum of association our byelaws and laws governing corporations incorporated in bermuda shareholder suits such as class actions as these terms are understood with respect to corporations incorporated in the united states are generally not available in bermuda therefore our shareholders may be less able under bermuda law than they would be under the laws of the united states or other jurisdictions to protect their interests in connection with actions by our management members of our board of directors or our controlling shareholder   s table of contents it may be difficult to bring and enforce suits against us in the united states we are incorporated in bermuda and a majority of our directors and most of our officers are not residents of the united states a substantial portion of our assets is located outside the united states as a result it may be difficult for our shareholders to serve notice of a lawsuit on us or our directors and officers within the united states because most of our assets are located outside the united states it may be difficult for our shareholders to enforce in the united states judgments of united states courts appleby our bermuda counsel has advised us that there is some uncertainty as to the enforcement in bermuda in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of united states courts of liabilities predicated upon united states federal securities laws investor confidence and the market price of our common shares may be adversely impacted if we or our independent public registered accounting firm is unable to conclude that our internal control over our financial reporting is effective as required by section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  we are subject to the secs reporting obligations and beginning in our annual report on form f for the year ended december   we have been required by the sec as directed by section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  to include a report of management on our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form f that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning in fiscal year  our independent public registered accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting although our management concluded that our internal controls are effective in our annual report on form f and our independent public registered accounting firm has rendered its opinion that we maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on criteria set forth in internal controlintegrated framework issued by committee of sponsoring organization of the treadway commission coso our management may not conclude that our internal controls are effective in the future moreover even if our management concludes that our internal controls over our financial reporting are effective our independent public registered accounting firm may disagree if our independent public registered accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal controls over our financial reporting or the level at which our controls are documented designed operated or reviewed or if the independent public registered accounting firm interprets the requirements rules or regulations differently from us it may decline to attest to our managements assessment or may issue an adverse opinion in the future any of these possible outcomes could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements which ultimately could negatively impact the market prices of our common shares any environmental claims or failure to comply with any present or future environmental regulations or any new environmental regulations may require us to spend additional funds may impose significant liability on us for present past or future actions and may dramatically increase the cost of providing our services to our customers we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the use storage discharge and disposal of chemical byproducts of and water used in our assembly and gold bumping processes although we have not suffered material environmental claims in the past a failure or a claim that we have failed to comply with any present or future regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us suspension of production or a cessation of our operations or negative publicity new regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses any failure on our part to control the use of or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities that may materially reduce our earnings fluctuations in exchange rates could result in foreign exchange losses currently most of our net revenue is denominated in nt dollars our cost of revenue and operating expenses on the other hand are incurred in several currencies including nt dollars japanese yen us dollars and renminbi   s table of contents or rmb in addition a substantial portion of our capital expenditures primarily for the purchase of testing and assembly equipment has been and is expected to continue to be denominated in japanese yen with much of the remainder in us dollars we also have debt denominated in nt dollars japanese yen us dollars and rmb fluctuations in exchange rates primarily among the us dollar the nt dollar and the japanese yen will affect our costs and operating margins in nt dollar terms in addition these fluctuations could result in exchange losses and increased costs in nt dollar terms despite selective hedging and other techniques implemented by us fluctuations in exchange rates have affected and may continue to affect our financial condition and results of operations we may not be successful in our acquisitions investments joint ventures and dispositions and may therefore be unable to implement fully our business strategy as part of our growth strategy we may make acquisitions and investments in companies and businesses establish joint ventures or make dispositions of our interests for example in september  we acquired all outstanding common shares of chipmos taiwan through a share exchange transaction with chipmos taiwan in february  we agreed to sell  of chipmos taiwans outstanding shares to siliconware precision and the transaction was completed in january  the success of our acquisitions investments joint ventures and dispositions depends on a number of factors including        our ability to identify suitable investment acquisition joint venture or disposition opportunities        our ability to reach an agreement for an acquisition investment joint venture or disposition opportunity on terms that are satisfactory to us or at all        the extent to which we are able to exercise control over the acquired or joint venture company        our ability to align the economic business or other strategic objectives and goals of the acquired company with those of our company and        our ability to successfully integrate the acquired or joint venture company or business with our company if we are unsuccessful in our acquisitions investments joint ventures and dispositions we may not be able to implement fully our business strategy to maintain or grow our business we depend on key personnel and our revenue could decrease and our costs could increase if we lose their services we depend on the continued service of our executive officers and skilled engineering technical and other personnel we will also be required to hire a substantially greater number of skilled employees in connection with our expansion plans in particular we depend on a number of skilled employees in connection with our lcd and other flatpanel display driver semiconductor testing and assembly services and the competition for such employees in taiwan and mainland china is intense we may not be able to either retain our present personnel or attract additional qualified personnel as and when needed moreover we do not carry key person insurance for any of our executive officers nor do we have employment contracts with any of our executive officers or employees and as a result none of our executive officers or employees is bound by any noncompetition agreement if we lose any of our key personnel it could be very difficult to find and integrate replacement personnel which could affect our ability to provide our services resulting in reduced net revenue and earnings in addition we may need to increase employee compensation levels in order to retain our existing officers and employees and to attract additional personnel as of september    of the workforce at our facilities are foreign workers employed by us under work permits that are subject to government regulations on renewal and other terms consequently if the regulations in taiwan relating to the employment of foreign workers were to become significantly more restrictive or if we are otherwise unable to attract or retain these workers at reasonable cost we may be unable to maintain or increase our level of services and may suffer reduced net revenue and earnings   s table of contents if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our information technology systems we may lose proprietary data our security measures may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including computer hackers employees error malfeasance or otherwise and result in unauthorized access to our customers data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information or our information technology systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures any security breach could result in disclosure of our trade secrets confidential customer supplier or employee data which could result in legal liability harm to our reputation and otherwise harm our business risk relating to our relationship with mosel chipmos taiwan entered into certain transactions that if determined to have constituted impermissible financings or purchases of assets or equity of mosel under roc law could result in the resignations of members of our management as a result our business operations could be disrupted and the market price of our common shares could decline roc law limits the ability of a company incorporated in taiwan to purchase any equity interest in companies directly or indirectly holding more than  of its issued and outstanding voting securities or registered capital or to provide loans or other financing to any company chipmos taiwan purchased nt million worth of mosel shares in  lee and li our roc special counsel has advised us that these purchases do not violate relevant roc law that prohibits a subsidiary from buying or taking collateral in shares of companies holding directly or indirectly more than  of its issued and outstanding voting securities or registered capital because mosels indirect interest calculated as the product of i mosels percentage interest in chipmos bermuda and ii chipmos bermudas percentage interest in chipmos taiwan in chipmos taiwan was less than  and chipmos bermuda is incorporated outside of taiwan in  chipmos taiwan disposed of nt million of mosel shares and in august  chipmos taiwan further disposed of the remaining mosel shares for approximately nt million chipmos taiwan no longer owns any mosel shares lee and li has advised that under relevant roc law there is no similar restriction or limitation on a subsidiarys disposal of its parents equity shares if the previous acquisitions of such shares complied with relevant roc law however we understand that there is no applicable judicial precedent and there is some doubt as to how a court would rule if presented with the situation if it were to be determined that any of the transactions described above constituted an impermissible financing or purchase of assets of mosel by chipmos taiwan or an impermissible purchase of mosels equity by chipmos taiwan then chipmos taiwans then chairman and any responsible officers would be jointly and severally liable to chipmos taiwan for any losses suffered by chipmos taiwan and may also be severally liable criminally for any breach of fiduciary duties that resulted in losses and damages suffered by chipmos taiwan moreover certain of these transactions may not have been in full compliance with chipmos taiwans then applicable internal procedures due to the failure to have received an appropriate valuation opinion prior to entering into such purchases the failure to comply fully with chipmos taiwans then applicable internal procedures could constitute evidence of a failure by the then chairman of chipmos taiwan and responsible officers to comply fully with their fiduciary duties which could result in them being held criminally liable for any breach of fiduciary duties that resulted in losses and damages to chipmos taiwan if members of our current management were held to have breached their fiduciary duties or become criminally liable for the transactions described above they may become obliged whether under law or otherwise to resign from their respective positions at chipmos bermuda and our affiliates any loss of the services of these persons could disrupt our business damage our reputation and cause the market price of our common shares to decline   s table of contents risks relating to countries in which we conduct operations roc laws and regulations limit or prohibit certain technology cooperation between roc persons or entities with prc persons or entities and our current technology transfer arrangements between chipmos bermuda and chipmos shanghai may be found to be in violation of any such limitation or prohibition which may result in a fine of between nt thousand and nt million and the termination of such technology transfer arrangements and therefore have a material adverse effect on the operations of chipmos shanghai and our financial condition and results of operations roc laws and regulations previously prohibited any transfer of semiconductor testing and assembly technologies to any person or entity located in mainland china except for transfers involving certain lowend semiconductor testing and assembly technologies such as conventional wire bond assembly technology if certain requirements are met the roc ministry of economic affairs has the ultimate administrative authority in interpreting such laws and regulations in february  these restrictions have been relaxed so that roc entities may transfer semiconductor testing and assembly technologies to any person or entity located in mainland china after they have obtained approval from the investment commission of the roc ministry of economic affairs or the icm under a technology transfer agreement dated august   chipmos bermuda licensed to chipmos shanghai certain testing and assemblyrelated technologies that were then controlled by chipmos bermuda which included technologies that were licensed to chipmos bermuda by chipmos taiwan chipmos bermuda will continue to license such technologies to chipmos shanghai pursuant to a new technology transfer agreement dated october   with effective date on august   chipmos bermuda also provided chipmos shanghai with technical support and consulting services under this agreement on april   chipmos bermuda entered into an assignment agreement with chipmos taiwan pursuant to which chipmos taiwan transferred all of the technologies it owned as of that date to chipmos bermuda including those previously licensed to chipmos bermuda on april   chipmos bermuda entered into an assignment agreement with chipmos taiwan pursuant to which chipmos taiwan assigned and transferred  of the title to ownership of and interest in all of the technologies and intellectual property it owned as of that date to chipmos bermuda in the opinion of lee and li our roc special counsel our technology transfer arrangements as described above are in compliance with all applicable roc laws and regulations however substantial uncertainties remain regarding the interpretation and application of those laws and regulations accordingly we cannot assure you that roc regulatory authorities will not take a view contrary to the opinion of our roc special counsel if chipmos taiwan were determined to be in violation of applicable roc laws and regulations governing technology cooperation with prc persons and entities chipmos taiwan may be subject to a fine of between nt thousand and nt million and may be ordered by the icm to terminate or rectify such activity within a specified period of time any termination of our current technology transfer to chipmos shanghai could materially adversely affect our mainland china operations and our financial condition results of operations or prospects as well as the market price of our common shares our ability to direct the operations we conduct through our subsidiaries and affiliated companies that we do not fully own may be limited by legal duties owed to other shareholders of such companies certain of our operations are conducted through companies that we do not fully own for example certain current consolidated operations are conducted through chipmos taiwan our  subsidiary as of september   thailin chipmos taiwans  owned subsidiary as of september   and chipmos shanghai thailins whollyowned subsidiary as of september   we also conduct other activities through our affiliated entities in accordance with the various laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries and affiliates are organized each of our subsidiaries and affiliates and their respective directors owe various duties to their respective shareholders as a result the actions we wish our subsidiaries or affiliates to take could be in conflict with their or their directors legal duties owed to their other shareholders when those conflicts arise our ability to cause our subsidiaries or affiliates to take the action that we desire may be limited   s table of contents any future outbreak of health epidemics and outbreaks of contagious diseases including avian influenza severe acute respiratory syndrome or hn influenza may materially affect our operations and business an outbreak of a contagious disease such as new influenza a hn or more commonly known as the swine flue severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or more recently avian influenza with subtypes hn and hn for which there is inadequate treatment or no known cure or vaccine may potentially result in a quarantine of infected employees and related persons and adversely affect our operations at one or more of our facilities or the operations of our customers or suppliers we cannot predict the impact that any further future outbreak of the aforementioned influenza viruses or other diseases could have on our business and results of operations we face substantial political risk associated with doing business in taiwan particularly due to recent domestic political events and the strained relations between the republic of china and the peoples republic of china that could negatively affect our business and the market price of our common shares our principal executive offices and most of our testing and assembly facilities are located in taiwan as a result our business financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our common shares may be affected by changes in roc governmental policies as well as social instability and diplomatic and social developments in or affecting taiwan which are beyond our control for example the roc has a unique international political status the prc government regards taiwan as a renegade province and does not recognize the legitimacy of the roc although significant economic and cultural relations have been strengthened in recent years between the roc and the prc relations have often been strained in march  the prc government enacted the antisecession law codifying its policy of retaining the right to use military force to gain control over taiwan particularly under what it considers as highly provocative circumstances such as a declaration of independence by taiwan or the refusal by the roc to accept the prcs stated one china policy past developments related to the interaction between the roc and the prc have on occasion depressed the market prices of the securities of taiwanese or taiwanrelated companies including our own relations between the roc and the prc and other factors affecting military political or economic conditions in taiwan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the market price and the liquidity of our common shares we are vulnerable to natural disasters and other events disruptive to our business and operations we currently provide most of our testing services through our facilities in the hsinchu industrial park and the hsinchu science park in taiwan and the shanghai qingpu industrial zone and all of our assembly services through our facilities in the southern taiwan science park in taiwan and the shanghai qingpu industrial zone significant damage or other impediments to these facilities as a result of natural disasters industrial strikes or industrial accidents could significantly increase our operating costs taiwan is particularly susceptible to earthquakes and typhoons for example in late  taiwan suffered severe earthquakes that caused significant property damage and loss of life particularly in the central part of taiwan these earthquakes damaged production facilities and adversely affected the operations of many companies involved in the semiconductor and other industries we experienced nt million in damages to our machinery and equipment nt million in damages to our facilities nt million in damages to our inventory and five days of delay in our production schedule as a result of these earthquakes in january and february  certain parts of mainland china particularly in the southern central and eastern regions experienced reportedly the most severe winter weather in the country in recent decades which resulted in significant and extensive damages to factories power lines homes automobiles crops and other properties blackouts transportation and communications disruptions and other losses in the affected areas in addition in may  certain semiconductor companies with facilities in eastern mainland china experienced production disruption reportedly due to power stoppages caused by the failure of certain electricity supply system in the area where the plants are located we cannot assure you that our facilities in the shanghai qingpu industrial zone will not be adversely affected by future snowstorms power shortages earthquakes or other similar events   s table of contents the  sendai earthquake and tsunami was a magnitude mw undersea megathrust earthquake off the coast of japan that occurred on march   the  sendai earthquake the  sendai earthquake was recorded as most powerful earthquake to hit japan and the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world overall the earthquake triggered tsunami warnings and evacuations along japans pacific coast and in at least  countries including taiwan and mainland china the earthquake and tsunami resulted in deaths injuries and people missing across the affected japanese prefectures and caused extensive and severe property damage in japan including heavy damage to roads and railways as well as fires in many areas and dam collapse many electrical generators were disabled and at least three nuclear power plant reactors partially melted down and experienced a chemical explosion extensively damaging surrounding buildings we cannot assure you that our production facilities operations and market located in taiwan and mainland china will not be adversely affected as result of the  sendai earthquake including as a result of radiation emission from the damaged nuclear power plants or subsequent future earthquakes that may take place the production facilities of many of our suppliers and customers and providers of complementary semiconductor manufacturing services including foundries are located in taiwan and mainland china if our customers are adversely affected by natural disasters or other events occurring in or affecting these geographic areas it could result in a decline in the demand for our testing and assembly services if our suppliers and providers of complementary semiconductor manufacturing services are affected by such events our production schedule could be interrupted or delayed as a result a major earthquake snowstorm other natural disaster industrial strike industrial accident or other disruptive event occurring in or affecting taiwan or mainland china could severely disrupt the normal operation of business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations any future outbreak of radiationrelated disease as a result of nuclear power plant reactors damage caused by the  sendai earthquake may materially adversely affect our operations and business the  sendai earthquake raises tremendous concerns about the possible effects of radiation emission from the damaged nuclear power plants japanese official authorities are working with experts in assessing the risk and determining the best courses of actions to implement to escape harmful radiation the potential health effects due to exposure to harmful radiation may be temporary or permanent harmful effects in nature multiple radioactive gases could possibly be emitted in a situation where uranium attains a meltdown state which is a severe overheating of the core of a nuclear reactor in which the core melts and radiation and heat are caused to escape this would occur if the containment system partially or fully fails the particles that are released with the gases due to the meltdown would be the spewed particles of iodine strontium and cesium these might enter into a human by being swallowed absorbed through the skin or inhaled depending on the chemical characteristics of each of these and their predilection for certain body tissues they could cause cancers of such organs as bones soft tissues near bones thyroid gland and the bone marrow typically known as leukemia acute or very high level radiation exposure can cause a person to become very ill or to die quickly ionizing radiation which is defined as highenergy particles or electromagnetic waves that can break chemical bonds damage humans by disrupting cellular function particularly in tissues with rapid growth and turnover of cells intense high level andor excessive radiation exposure may result in acute radiation syndrome whereby harmful effects to the human body may be evidenced by skin burns internal organ deterioration bleeding vomiting bone marrow distortion and deaths if the radiation exposure is less intense andor more prolonged at a lower level then the central nervous system kidneys thyroid gland and liver may be affected cancer is the most well known effect and may affect virtually any significantly exposed tissue certain health effects due to exposure to harmful radiation does not have adequate treatment or known cure or vaccine consequently may potentially result in a quarantine of infected employees and related persons and adversely affect our operations at one or more of our facilities or the operations of our customers or suppliers   s table of contents we cannot predict the probability of any future outbreak of radiation related diseases as a possible result of nuclear power plants damage caused by the  sendai earthquake or the extent of the material adverse impact that this could have on our business and results of operations risks relating to our corporate

to grow fund investments make acquisitions pay dividends repay or repurchase outstanding indebtedness and otherwise fund and conduct our business the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us is restricted by among other things the availability of funds and the terms of various credit arrangements entered into by our subsidiaries as well as statutory and other legal restrictions in addition although there are currently no foreign exchange control regulations which restrict the ability of our subsidiaries located in taiwan to distribute dividends to us we cannot assure you that the relevant regulations will not be changed and that the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute dividends to us will not be restricted in the future a taiwan company is generally not permitted to distribute dividends or to make any other distributions to shareholders for any year in which it did not have either earnings or retained earnings excluding reserves in addition before distributing a dividend to shareholders following the end of a fiscal year the company must recover any past losses pay all outstanding taxes and set aside  of its annual net income less prior years losses and outstanding taxes as a legal reserve until the accumulated legal reserve equals its paidin capital and may set aside a special reserve in addition prc law requires that our prcincorporated subsidiary only distributes dividends out of its net income if any as determined in accordance with prc accounting standards and regulations under prc law it is also required to set aside at least  of its aftertax net income each year into its reserve fund until the accumulated legal reserve amounts to  of its registered capital prcincorporated companies are further required to maintain a bonus and welfare fund at percentages determined at their sole discretion the reserve fund and the bonus and welfare fund are not distributable as dividends moreover a rocincorporated company is only able to declare dividends at its annual general meeting of shareholders which cannot occur until after completion of its annual financial statements any limitation on dividend payments

dependent on regulatory approvals if chipmos taiwan is unable to receive the equity financing it requires its ability to grow and fund its operations may be materially adversely affected as chipmos taiwan is not a listed company it generally depends on its shareholders chipmos bermuda and siliconware precision to meet its equity financing requirements any capital contribution by us to chipmos taiwan may require the approval of the relevant roc authorities for example any capital contribution by us to chipmos taiwan will require the approval of the authorities of the science park administration we may not be able to obtain any such approval in the future in a timely manner or at all if chipmos taiwan is unable to receive the equity financing it requires its ability to grow and fund its operations may be materially adversely affected risks relating to our common shares volatility in the price of our common shares may result in shareholder litigation that could in turn result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources the financial markets in the united states and other countries have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and market prices of technology companies have been and continue to be extremely volatile volatility in the price of our common shares may be caused by factors outside of our control and may be unrelated or disproportionate to our results of operations in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a public companys securities shareholders have frequently instituted securities class action litigation against that company litigation of this kind could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources certain provisions in our constitutive documents and in our severance agreements with our executive officers make the acquisition of us by another company more difficult and costly and therefore may delay defer or prevent a change of control our byelaws provide that our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors each class to be reelected only once every three years as a result shareholders would not generally be able to replace a majority of the directors until after two annual general meetings in addition any extraordinary corporate transaction such as a merger amalgamation or consolidation or a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of our assets cannot be done without the approval of shareholders representing  of the total voting rights of all shareholders having the right to vote at such general meeting called to consider such extraordinary transaction these provisions in our constitutive documents may increase the difficulty faced by a party which seeks to acquire control of our board or to approve an extraordinary transaction in  we entered into change in control severance agreements with certain executive officers pursuant to which we agreed to pay certain severance payments if a change in control event as defined in the change in control severance agreements occurs and the employment of such executive officer is terminated by our company other than for cause or by such executive officer for good reasons within two years following the occurrence of the change in control event these agreements may increase the

our common shares are delisted from the nasdaq capital market our common shares would likely trade in the overthecounter market which could make selling our common shares more difficult smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold transactions could be delayed and security analysts coverage of us may be reduced in addition in the event our common shares are delisted brokerdealers have certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them which may discourage brokerdealers from effecting transactions in our common shares these factors could limit our common shares

shares has fluctuated from  to  adjusted for the companys forevery reverse stock split effective on january   risks relating to economic conditions and the financial markets the global credit and financial markets crisis could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations since  and through  global credit and financial markets have experienced severe disruptions these include diminished liquidity and limited availability of credit reduced consumer confidence reduced economic   s table of contents growth increased unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability limited availability of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending this in turn may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us financial difficulties experienced by our customers or suppliers as a result of these conditions could lead to production delays and delays or defaults in payment of accounts receivable continuing credit markets disruption restricts our access to capital and limits our ability to fund operations or to refinance maturing obligations as they become due through additional borrowing or other sources of financing we are not able to predict the duration or extent of the current global credit and financial markets crisis these conditions increase the difficulty of accurately forecasting and planning our business activities if these conditions and uncertainties continue or if credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions further deteriorate our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected risks relating to our industry because we depend on the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is characterized by significant and sometimes prolonged downturns from time to time our net revenue and earnings may fluctuate significantly which in turn could cause the market price of our common shares to decline because our business is and will continue to be dependent on the requirements of semiconductor companies for independent testing and assembly services any downturn in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry may reduce demand for our services and adversely affect our results of operations all of our customers operate in this industry and variations in order levels from our customers and in service fee rates may result in volatility in our net revenue and earnings for instance during periods of decreased demand for assembled semiconductors some of our customers may even simplify delay or forego final testing of certain types of semiconductors such as dynamic random access memory or dram further intensifying our difficulties from time to time the semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns which have adversely affected our results of operations in  the semiconductor industry especially the assembly and testing services for dram products sector continued to experience the significant downturn that began in fourth quarter of  which adversely affected our business as a result of the industry downturn our net revenue for  decreased  from  levels this industry downturn started to recover from the second quarter of  and our net revenue for  increased  from  levels our net revenue for  increased  from  levels and generated a net loss of nt million in  we cannot give any assurances that there will not be any downturn in the future or that any future downturn will not affect our results of operations any deterioration in the market for enduser applications for semiconductor products would reduce demand for our services and may result in a decrease in our earnings market conditions in the semiconductor industry track to a large degree those for their enduser applications any deterioration in the market conditions for the enduser applications of semiconductors we test and assemble could reduce demand for our services and in turn materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our net revenue is largely attributable to fees derived from testing and assembling semiconductors for use in personal computers communications equipment consumer electronic products and display applications a significant decrease in demand for products in these markets could put pricing pressure on our testing and assembly services and negatively affect our net revenue and earnings weak demand for lcd and other flatpanel display products began in  and adversely affected our operating results in   and  the lcd driver market started to recover in the second quarter of  and the positive recovery trend continued in  and  we cannot give any assurances that there will not be any downturn in the future or that any future downturn will not affect our results of operations any significant decrease in demand for enduser applications of semiconductors will negatively affect our net revenue and earnings a decline in average selling prices for our services could result in a decrease in our earnings historically prices for our testing and assembly services in relation to any given semiconductor tend to decline over the course of its product and technology life cycle see also a decrease in market demand for lcd and   s table of contents other flatpanel display driver semiconductors may adversely affect our capacity utilization rates and thereby negatively affect our profitability if we cannot reduce the cost of our testing and assembly services or introduce highermargin testing and assembly services for new package types to offset the decrease in average selling prices for our services our earnings could decrease a reversal or slowdown in the outsourcing trend for semiconductor testing and assembly services could reduceour profitability in recent years integrated device manufacturers or idms have increasingly outsourced stages of the semiconductor production process including testing and assembly to independent companies like us to shorten production cycles in addition the availability of advanced independent semiconductor manufacturing services has also enabled the growth of socalled fabless semiconductor companies that focus exclusively on design and marketing and outsource their manufacturing testing and assembly requirements to independent companies a substantial portion of our net revenue is indirectly generated from providing semiconductor assembly and testing services to these idms and fabless companies we cannot assure you that these companies will continue to outsource their testing and assembly requirements to independent companies like us a reversal of or a slowdown in this outsourcing trend could result in reduced demand for our services which in turn could reduce our profitability   s table of contents use of proceeds the selling shareholders identified in this prospectus supplement are offering up to

the overallotment option described below if an underwriter defaults the underwriting agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the nondefaulting underwriters may be increased or the

they have discretionary authority stabilization in connection with this offering the underwriters may engage in stabilizing transactions overallotment transactions syndicate covering transactions penalty bids and purchases to cover positions created by short sales        stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase common shares so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum and are engaged in for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the common shares while the offering is in progress        overallotment transactions involve sales by the underwriters of common shares in excess of the number of shares the underwriters are obligated to purchase this creates a syndicate short position which may be either a covered short position or a naked short position in a covered short position the number of shares overallotted by the underwriters is not greater than the number of shares that they may purchase in the overallotment option in a naked short position the number of shares involved is greater than the number of shares in the overallotment option the underwriters may close out any short position by exercising their overallotment option andor purchasing shares in the open market        syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of common shares in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions in determining the source of shares to close out the short position the underwriters will consider among other things the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared with the price at which they may purchase shares through exercise of the overallotment option if the underwriters sell more shares than could be covered by exercise of the overallotment option and therefore have a naked short position the position can be closed out only by buying shares in the open market a naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that after pricing there could be downward pressure on the price of the shares in the open market that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering penalty bids permit the underwriters to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the common shares originally sold by that syndicate member are purchased in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions to cover syndicate short positions these stabilizing transactions syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our common shares or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our common shares as a result the price of our common shares in the open market may be higher than it
