the properties were used to run the mills with hydroelectric power by  the mills provided  percent of us newsprint in  in order to enhance its research and development efforts the company opened the

organization to run both an industrial firm and a power company the law signified the end of international paper’s involvement in the energy and power business instead the company began to focus on key areas such as paper and packaging the company expanded into the southern united states in the s and s primarily because trees could be grown more quickly and in greater volume than they could in the north it also maximized its use of the trees through the kraft process which involved use of a very strong pulp to manufacture packaging materials in june  a new company was incorporated to acquire the assets of international paper  power company the new parent company was named international paper company to reflect the change from a paper and power company to a manufacturer devoted solely to paper during world war ii international paper did what it could to support the war effort its contributions included the development of nitrate pulp for use in explosives and the development of a waterproof board called vboard—victory board—which was used to make boxes to send food and other supplies to the troops the new technology along with the wartime inventions of other manufacturers led to increased competition after the war as a result ip began to invest more capital in research and development shortly after the war it established the erling riis research laboratory in mobile alabama an emphasis on packaging products also characterized the firm’s progress in the s in december  it acquired the agor manufacturing company which included three subsidiaries and four container plants in illinois kansas massachusetts and new jersey in june  ip merged the southern kraft corporation with its main business previously a subsidiary southern kraft owned eight kraft board and paper mills in the southern united states ip also bought the assets of a shippingcontainer maker the scharffkoken manufacturing company in  ip merged with single service containers inc a manufacturer of

of a specialty coated paper manufacturer am collins manufacturing company of philadelphia in  in  the latter merged with ip in  ip bought lord baltimore press inc a maryland manufacturer of cartons and labels ip’s canadian subsidiary canadian international paper company also made its share of acquisitions in the s these included brown corporation in  hygrade containers ltd in  and anglo american paper company midwest paper ltd vancouver pacific paper company and victoria paper company in  s and s diversifying beyond the core with mixed results during the following decade new technology improved both product design and manufacturing processes in  for example ip began using computers to control paper machines at its mill in georgetown south carolina a year later it introduced polyethylenecoated milk cartons in addition to new products the s presented ip with challenges including development of new production and management techniques since  ip had been headed by the hinman family john hinman was chief executive from  to  and his son edward b hinman held the post from  to  various associates appointed by the elder hinman ran the company from  to  during the s ip continued to grow internally and took giant leaps toward diversification—many of them in haste—and learned that bigger is not always better ip had emphasized production efficiency as a means of increasing output for most of the century ip’s production muscle came at the expense of marketing expertise which lagged the production emphasis led to overexpansion of paper plants which in turn resulted in low profit margins to increase profitability ip diversified with little success into areas as far ranging as residential construction prefabricated housing nonwoven fabrics consumer facial tissue and disposable diapers it also moved into lumber and plywood but found equally little success in those areas white paper paperboard and pulp still accounted for more than half of the company’s sales during the early s converted paper products comprised onethird lumber plywood and other building products totaled  percent and the remaining sales came from real estate packaging systems and nonwoven fabrics by  ip’s longterm debt which had been almost nonexistent in  reached  million when edward hinman took over in  the company’s greatest asset was its large share of real estate including eight million acres that it owned and  million that it leased in  hinman sought the help of frederick kappel formerly chairman of att the two ran the company together but after earnings declined by  percent in  kappel and a team of outside directors replaced hinman the following year with paul a gorman another att executive gorman faced the challenge of returning the company to profitability gorman started the longterm task by setting up a  million reserve to cover writeoffs of inefficient facilities closing a specialty mill in york haven pennsylvania and closing various plants in ecuador italy puerto rico and west germany in  he also sold most of donald l bren co a southern california house builder acquired in  and spacemakers inc a prefabricatedhousing subsidiary the company also sold its interest in cr bard inc a medical equipment manufacturer company perspectives the ip way as in the past international paper is committed to continuous improvement in everything it does and the key is the people who make up the company in  a typical paper mill was run by skilled workers who knew more about pulp production paper machines and product quality than anyone else in the organization one hundred years later international paper is committed to becoming a high performance organization a company with a greater degree of teamwork and greater decisionmaking power delegated throughout the organization in order to better satisfy customers and beat the competition employees sharing their ideas and experiences to improve the business is part of what has come to be called “the ip way” more formally “the ip way” includes a commitment to be a global leader and earn an excellent return it includes being the company of choice not only for customers but employees shareholders and suppliers from  to  ip had spent  billion to increase its papermaking and converting capacity by  percent during the early s the paper industry headed toward cyclical recession ip laid off  percent of its employees gorman felt that the firm needed more financial control and saw to it that decisions made by the company’s manufacturing groups were reviewed from a financial marketing and manufacturing perspective in addition all projects had to show a minimum aftertax profit of  percent ailing plants were improved sold or shut down gorman also reorganized international operations on a product line basis his efforts were successful earnings of  million in  were the lowest in ten years despite record earnings just two years earlier but they jumped  percent the first six months of  in  j stanford smith joined ip as vicechairman previously a senior vicepresident with general electric smith eventually would replace gorman as chairman smith felt that one way to increase profitability was to develop natural resources on the company’s land he devised a plan to purchase general crude oil company which ip did in  for  million the business was unsuccessful however in locating major oil or gas deposits on ip’s land five years later in order to raise capital for acquisitions and internal growth the company sold general crude oil’s oil and natural gas operations to gulf oil corporation for  million in addition ip sold a panama city florida pulp and linerboard mill to southwest forest industries for  million early s major plant modernization program between  and  ip’s operating profits were mediocre again it turned to new management for help and in  edwin gee stepped in as chairman a chemical engineer gee recognized that many of the company’s  pulp and paper mills—all built in the s and s—were wasting labor and energy immediately he instituted a  billion program to modernize the plants gee’s goal was to turn the world’s largest paper company into one of the lowestcost producers of white paper and packaging materials thus making it one of the most profitable papermakers as well to raise money for gee’s plan ip sold its remaining interest in general crude oil company for  million and used the profits to buy bodcaw company of dallas in  bodcaw added a highly efficient linerboard mill in pineville louisiana and  acres of prime timberland in  ip sold canadian international paper for us million in addition gee increased the researchanddevelopment budget and reduced ip’s labor force by  percent by  he had raised us billion aided by sales of land timber and other subsidiaries after determining that only two of the six major packaging mills were operating efficiently gee sold one mill shut down three others and invested  million in the mansfield louisiana mill in april  ip unveiled a new southern pine plywood and lumber manufacturing plant in springhill louisiana the  million facility the brainchild of gee featured the latest computerized process controls and supplied the containerboard mill in mansfield plus paper and pulp mills at camden arkansas and in bastrop louisiana in the same year john georges became chief operating officer his solution to ip’s production problems was not to build new plants but to remodel existing facilities the company also spent  million on remodeling a georgetown south carolina mill changing its product focus in the process instead of brown linerboard a cyclical product part of the plant was set up to make white papers the white paper business was to offer a fastergrowing and more stable market in addition georges began a  million project to convert another mill in mobile alabama the yearold facility which housed the company’s last remaining newsprint machine was also remodeled to produce white papers in  thus marking the end of the company’s longstanding newsprint business in  newsprint prices began a steady decline a recession in the early s meant further delays but the investments began to bear fruit in the mids as a result of new automation ip’s production costs decreased  percent between  and  and its mills were able to use  percent less energy georges was named chairman in  succeeding gee key dates  international paper company ip is formed from the merger of  pulp and paper mills in the northeastern united states  with

divest  billion in assets by yearend   divestments include masonite and zanders feinpapiere late s to mids diversifying geographically and in product mix the appointment had been preceded in  by a decline in linerboard and pulp prices and a year low in earnings the whitepaper market seemed to be one of the few that was profitable so georges hired a team of scientists and technicians to promote business in that area their work led to a major acquisition in  hammermill paper company the  billion purchase increased ip’s whitepaper capacity by  tons and provided the technology to produce premium paper lines georges also reduced the number of salaried employees from  in  to  in  and streamlined management under his leadership the firm also acquired anitec image technology corporation maker of photographic film papers and darkroom chemicals avery corporation a chicagobased envelope manufacturer and kendall company’s nonwoven fabrics division ip also purchased masonite corporation maker of composite wood products in  as a result profits improved in  and set a record in  in addition to the company’s recovery however it also weathered several crises these included a  fire that destroyed its nacogdoches texas plywoodmanufacturing plant causing  million in damages the facility reopened in  after being equipped to produce orientedstrand board in  to protest inadequate wages and benefits  workers went on strike at paper mills in alabama maine mississippi and wisconsin under georges’s leadership the watchword at ip in the late s and early s was diversity both in geography and product mix his aim was to lessen the firm’s vulnerability to the cyclical nature of its core paper packaging and forestry operations many of the international acquisitions that georges pursued were aimed at expanding ip further into the area of specialty products which generally produce higher margins these products included photographic paper and films specialty industrial papers moldedwood products laminated products and nonwoven fabrics such as disposable diapers although similar in some ways to the firm’s diversification of the s this round of expansion proved more successful heading into its overseas spending spree international paper already owned boxmanufacturing facilities in italy the netherlands spain sweden and the united kingdom in  it acquired three major european manufacturers aussedatrey the second largest paper company in france the ilford photographicproducts division of cibageigy and germany’s zanders feinpapiere ag a highquality coatedpaper company in  ip bought the french operations of georgiapacific corporation the following year in addition to bolstering its domestic base with the purchase of two us paper companies—dillon paper and leslie paper—and its european holdings with the acquisition of scaldia paper bv of the netherlands and the packaging equipment business of dominion industries ltd ip gained a presence in the pacific rim through a  million purchase of a  percent interest in the leading new zealand forest products company carter holt harvey ltd chh ip increased its stake in chh in  to  percent by investing an additional  million not only dominant in its home market chh was a major exporter of forest products to australia and asia also in  ip paid  million for an  percent stake in israel’s scitex corporation ltd a world leader in color electronicimaging equipment the stake was increased to  percent the following year the company also purchased kwidzyn from the government of poland for  million and the promise to invest  million more in the firm the country’s largest whitepaper manufacturer and operator of one of the most modern paper mills in eastern europe ip’s diversification program appeared to pay off in the early s when the paper industry encountered one of its worst cyclical downturns in  years while competitors boise cascade corp and champion international corp posted huge losses ip continued to report profits albeit smaller than those of – sales in  hit a record  billion although earnings were reduced substantially by a  million restructuring charge for the closure and consolidation of  underperforming mills and sales offices worldwide in  ip folded its north american distribution business into resourcenet international with more than  locations ip continued to expand aggressively in the mids in  resourcenet international picked up two paperdistributing companies in mexico while in the area of liquid packaging a new plant was built in brazil and a joint venture was formed in china to build and operate a plant near shanghai ip made its biggest purchases yet in  however the firm spent  billion to attain majority control of carter holt harvey and  million to acquire dsm a producer of ink and adhesive resin based in the netherlands ip attempted to acquire holvis ag a swiss fiber and paper company for  million but was rebuffed by the holvis board late in  ip announced a  billion purchase of federal paper board company based in montvale new jersey and the th largest paper company in the united states federal paper specialized in bleached paperboard used for cigarette cartons laundry detergent and other consumer products and added to ip’s packaging operations gave ip about onethird of the bleached board market through the transaction ip gained mills in augusta georgia riegelwood north carolina and versailles connecticut fittingly the federal paper acquisition was consummated nearly simultaneously with the announcement of georges’s retirement as chairman and ceo both of which occurred in early  georges’s diversification program had increased nonus sales to  percent of total revenues by  while ip’s core paper pulp and paperboard businesses accounted for  percent of sales in  they accounted for only  percent of sales by  during the same period ip’s specialty products’ share of sales increased from just  percent to  percent overall during georges’s leadership tenure annual revenues at the company quadrupled to nearly  billion late s into st century restructurings and major acquisitions john t dillon previously president and coo succeeded georges as chairman and ceo of international paper in addition to working to consolidate the federal paper acquisition dillon’s initial months of leadership focused on divesting some operations in part to offset the approximately  million in longterm debt incurred with the purchase of federal paper in the most significant divestment of  international paper sold off about  acres of timberlands in oregon and washington booking a  million pretax gain in the process also in  ip took a  million restructuring and asset impairment charge as part of an ongoing costcutting program a large proportion of the charge went toward the writing off of assets in the company’s struggling imaging products business maker of printing plates films chemicals and paper for the photography and commercial printing market with market conditions suddenly deteriorating after a recordsetting year for the paper industry in  ip saw its net earnings drop to  million in  from the  billion of the previous year conditions failed to improve in  and dillon responded midyear with a major restructuring plan that aimed to divest more than  billion in underperforming assets or businesses by mid ip had sold its imaging products business veratec its nonwovens business two of its four box plants in california and small paper mills in france and colombia the company’s workforce was reduced by about  percent restructuring and other charges led to a net loss of  million for  among the other charges that year was  million set aside as a legal reserve as part of the settlement of a classaction lawsuit brought against masonite corporation the suit alleged that pressedwood exterior siding made by masonite was failing prematurely allowing moisture to be retained and causing damage to the underlying structure in september  a jury found that the siding was defective leading to the settlement in january  two other similar suits—one also involving siding the other a roofing material—against masonite were settled in similar fashion in january  concurrent with the restructuring efforts were targeted acquisitions ip’s north american distribution business which changed its name from resourcenet international to xpedx in january  expanded in july of that year with the purchase of the mead corporation’s zellerbach distribution unit for about  million in cash this acquisition increased xpedx’s  revenues to  billion a  percent increase over the previous year the combination was expected to result in annual savings of  million in operating costs and ip shut down  facilities and eliminated about  jobs following the deal’s closure also added in  was weston paper and manufacturing company acquired through a stock deal valued at  million based in terre haute indiana weston operated  corrugatedcontainer plants in the south and midwest in december  international paper expanded in eastern europe with the purchase of svetogorsk ao a russiabased pulp and paper firm dillon moved beyond these smaller deals in april  with a blockbuster stockswap acquisition of union camp corporation for about  billion including the assumption of about  billion in union camp debt although much larger than the previous several acquisitions this deal was also targeted in the sense that union camp’s operations meshed so well with those of international paper two of union camp’s strengths— uncoated paper and containerboard—were strengths of ip as well union camp’s ailing and cory distribution business was merged into xpedx the merger also added  million acres of timberlands to ip’s holdings with most of the new lands adjacent to the previously held ones union camp also held a  percent stake in bush boake allen inc a leading producer of flavors and fragrances and this concern was seen as complementary to ip’s arizona chemical unit a product of an early diversification effort dating back to the early s in the wake of the union camp acquisition ip eliminated more than  jobs from its workforce and closed a number of unprofitable plants in an effort to eliminate excess capacity ip’s acquisition spree continued in  with the company picking up shorewood packaging corporation in march for about  million in cash plus assumed debt of  million and champion international corporation in june for about  billion in cash and  billion in ip stock and the assumption of  billion in debt both acquisitions involved third parties in the case of shorewood that company had been fending off a hostile takeover by chesapeake corporation before agreeing to be acquired by ip the addition of shorewood greatly expanded ip’s position in the high end of the consumer packaging sector making it a leading provider of highquality printing and paperboard packaging for home entertainment cosmetics health and beauty pharmaceutical sporting goods tobacco and other consumer products champion had agreed to be acquired by upmkymmene corporation of finland in february  in a stockswap deal originally valued at  billion upm’s stock had fallen significantly in price reducing the value of the deal by april  which is when ip stepped in with its first offer a combined cash and stock transaction valued at  billion upm responded with an allcash offer of  per share or  billion but in may international paper emerged the winner of a tense takeover battle with a revised offer of  in cash and stock or  billion champion was a company with  revenues of  billion and papermaking capacity of  million tons a year it ranked as the second largest producer of magazine paper and the sixth largest maker of office paper in north america champion and shorewood had distribution operations that were absorbed by xpedx postmerger the five million acres of us timberlands controlled by champion greatly increased ip’s land holdings champion also had key assets outside the united states its weldwood of canada limited subsidiary was a manufacturer of pulp lumber plywood and engineered wood products with operations centered in british columbia and alberta brazilbased champion papel e celulose ltda was one of south america’s leading makers of office paper and a major producer of magazine paper with a total of  tons of annual capacity ip also gained the significant timber holdings in canada and brazil controlled by these two companies and even more importantly it now had a major presence on three continents north america europe and south america international paper also gained a new headquarters through the champion deal as the company moved its head offices to the former headquarters of champion in stamford connecticut later in  during  ip also launched a major divestiture program it was originally aimed at eliminating  billion in assets but this figure was increased to  billion following the acquisition of champion the divestitures were slated to be completed by the end of  the program had a number of goals cutting down the debt incurred from the string of acquisitions paring the company’s operations to three core areas paper packaging and forest products and reducing capacity in an attempt to break free of the ups and downs of the paper industry cycle in november  ip sold its interest in bush boake allen for  million during  ip completed a series of divestitures selling its petroleum and minerals business  acres of forest lands in washington and  acres in east texas masonite corporation zanders feinpapiere a hydroelectric facility in the state of new york a water company in texas and its flexible packaging business the company also closed down a number of mills and announced plans to lay off about  workers in the united states or about  percent of the workforce there by early  international paper was still attempting to sell a number of businesses including arizona chemical its industrial packaging business its chemical cellulose unit its decorative products unit and its oriented strand board facilities for  ip reported revenues of  billion a decline from the previous year’s total of  billion thanks to restructuring and other charges of  billion and losses on the sales of businesses totaling  million the company posted a net loss of  billion for the year despite this volley of red ink under the continued leadership of dillon international paper had made great strides in its ambitious restructuring

crude oil company for  million and used the profits to buy bodcaw company of dallas in  bodcaw added a highly efficient linerboard mill in pineville louisiana and  acres of prime timberland in  ip sold canadian international paper for us million in addition gee increased the researchanddevelopment budget and reduced ip’s labor force by  percent by  he had raised us billion aided by sales of

computerized process controls and supplied the container board mill in mansfield plus paper and pulp mills at camden arkansas and in bastrop louisiana in the same year john georges became chief operating officer his solution to ip’s production problems was not to build new plants but to remodel existing facilities the company also spent  million on remodeling a georgetown south carolina mill changing its product focus in the process instead of brown linerboard a cyclical product part of the plant was set up to make white papers the white paper business was to offer a fastergrowing and more stable market in addition georges began a  million project to convert another mill in mobile alabama the yearold facility which housed the company’s last remaining newsprint machine was also remodeled to produce white papers in  thus marking the end of the company’s longstanding newsprint business in  newsprint prices began a steady decline a recession in the early s meant further delays

named chairman in  succeeding gee the appointment had been preceded in  by a decline in linerboard and pulp prices and a year low in earnings the whitepaper market seemed to be one of the few that was profitable so georges hired a team of scientists and technicians to promote business in that area their work led to a major acquisition in  hammermill paper company the  billion purchase increased ip’s whitepaper capacity by  tons and provided the technology to produce premium paper lines georges also reduced the number of salaried employees from  in  to  in  and streamlined management under his leadership the firm also acquired anitec image technology corporation maker of photographic film papers and darkroom chemicals avery corporation a chicagobased envelope manufacturer and kendall

destroyed its nacogdoches texas plywoodmanufacturing plant causing  million in damages the facility reopened in  after being equipped to produce orientedstrand board in  to protest inadequate wages and benefits  workers went on strike at paper mills in alabama maine mississippi and wisconsin under georges’s leadership the watchword at ip in the late s and early s was diversity both in geography and product mix his aim was to lessen the firm’s vulnerability to the cyclical nature of its core paper packaging and forestry operations many of the international acquisitions that georges pursued were aimed at expanding ip further into the area of specialty products which generally produce higher margins these products included photographic paper and films specialty industrial papers moldedwood products laminated products and nonwoven fabrics such as disposable diapers although similar in some ways to the firm’s diversification of the s this round of expansion proved more successful heading into its overseas spending spree international paper already owned boxmanufacturing facilities in italy the netherlands spain sweden and the united kingdom in  it acquired two major european manufacturers aussedatrey the secondlargest paper company in france and the ilford photographicproducts division of cibageigy in  ip bought germany’s zanders feinpapiere ag a highquality

and the promise to invest  million more in the firm the country’s largest whitepaper manufacturer and operator of one of the most modern paper mills in eastern europe ip’s diversification program appeared to pay off in the early s when the paper industry encountered one of its worst cyclical downturns in  years while competitors boise cascade corp and champion international corp posted huge losses ip continued to report profits albeit smaller than those of  sales in  hit a record  billion although earnings were reduced substantially by a  million restructuring charge for the closure and consolidation of  underperforming mills and sales offices worldwide ip continued to expand aggressively in the mids in  its distribution unit picked up two paperdistributing companies in mexico while in the area of liquid packaging a new plant was built in brazil and a joint venture was formed in china to build and operate a plant near shanghai ip made its biggest purchases yet in  however the

acquire holvis ag a swiss fiber and paper company for  million but was rebuffed by the holvis board late in  ip announced a  billion purchase of federal paper board co based in montvale new jersey and the thlargest paper company in the united states federal paper specialized in bleached paperboard used for cigarette cartons laundry detergent and other consumer products and added to ip’s packaging operations would give ip about onethird of the bleached board market fittingly the federal paper acquisition was consummated nearly simultaneously with the announcement of georges’s retirement as

accounted for  percent of sales in  they accounted for only  percent of sales by  during the same period ip’s specialty products’ share of sales increased from just  percent to  percent john t dillon previously president and coo succeeded georges as chairman and ceo of international paper although dillon inherited a company in an enviably strong position some observers felt that he might make some moves to refocus ip on its core businesses ip had already exited the envelope business late in  and divestments of additional specialty businesses were seen as possible in particular given the

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible
