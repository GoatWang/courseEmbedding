stereopure oligonucleotide therapeutics for up to five programs the “pfizer programs” each directed at a geneticallydefined hepatic target selected by pfizer the “collaboration” the company received  million as an upfront license fee under the pfizer collaboration agreement subject to option exercises by pfizer assuming five potential products are successfully developed and commercialized the company may earn up to  million in potential research development and commercial milestone payments plus royalties tiered up to low doubledigits on sales of any products that may result from the collaboration none of the payments under the pfizer collaboration agreement are refundable simultaneously with the entry into the pfizer collaboration agreement the company entered into a share purchase agreement the “pfizer equity agreement” and together with the pfizer collaboration agreement the “pfizer agreements” with cp pharmaceuticals international cv an affiliate of pfizer the “pfizer affiliate” pursuant to the terms of the pfizer equity agreement the pfizer affiliate purchased  of the company’s ordinary shares the “shares” at a purchase price of  per share for an aggregate purchase price of  million the company did not incur any material costs in connection with the issuance of the shares under the pfizer collaboration agreement the parties agreed to collaborate during the fouryear research term during the research term the company is responsible to use its commercially reasonable efforts to advance up to five programs through to the selection of clinical candidates at that stage pfizer may elect to license any of these pfizer programs exclusively and to have exclusive rights to undertake the clinical development of the resulting clinical candidates into products and the potential commercialization of any such products thereafter in addition the company receives a nonexclusive royaltybearing sublicenseable license to use pfizer’s hepatic targeting technology in any of the company’s own hepatic programs that are outside the scope of the collaboration the “wave programs” if the company uses this technology on the wave programs pfizer is eligible to receive potential development and commercial milestone payments from the company pfizer is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on sales of any products that include pfizer’s hepatic targeting technology pfizer nominated two hepatic targets upon entry into the collaboration in may  in august  pfizer nominated the third hepatic target under the collaboration and has the option to nominate two additional targets by november   the collaboration is managed by a joint steering committee in which both parties are represented equally which will oversee the scientific progression of each pfizer program up to the clinical candidate stage during the fouryear research term and for a period of two years thereafter  the company has agree d to work exclusively with pfizer with respect to using any of the company’s stereopure oligonucleotide technology that is specific for the applicable hepatic target which is the basis of any pfizer program the stated term of the pfizer collaboration agreement commenced on may   and terminates with respect to each pfizer program on the date of the last to expire payment obligations and expires with respect to each wave program on a programbyprogram basis accordingly pfizer may terminate its rights related to a pfizer program under the pfizer collaboration agreement at its own convenience upon  days’ notice to the company the company may also terminate its rights related to a wave program at its own convenience upon  days’ notice to pfizer the pfizer collaboration agreement may also be terminated by either party in the event of an uncured material breach of the pfizer collaboration agreement by the other party during the three months ended march   the company recognized revenue of  million under the pfizer collaboration agreement  deferred revenue amounted to  million   at march   of which  million is included in current liabilities        net loss per ordinary share the company applies the twoclass method to calculate its basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders as its series a preferred shares are participating securities the twoclass method is an earnings allocation formula that treats a participating security as having rights to earnings that otherwise would have been available to ordinary shareholders however for the periods presented the twoclass method does not impact the net loss per ordinary share as the company was in a net loss position for each of the periods presented and holders of series a preferred shares d o not participate in losses basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weightedaverage number of ordinary shares used in computing net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders the company’s potentially dilutive shares which include outstanding share options to purchase ordinary shares and series a preferred shares are considered to be ordinary share equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share when their effect is dilutive the following ordinary share equivalents presented based on amounts outstanding at each period end were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders for the periods indicated because including them would have had an antidilutive effect       as of march

taxation in the united states japan ireland and singapore during the three months ended march   and  the company recorded a tax provision of  million and a tax benefit of less than  million respectively the increase in the tax provision is a result of additional income earned in the united states under a contract research agreement between our us and singapore entities during the three months ended march   and  the company recorded no income tax benefits for the net operating losses incurred in japan ireland and singapore due to its uncertainty of realizing a benefit from those items the company’s reserves related to taxes and its accounting for uncertain tax positions are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the company in its tax filings or positions is morelikelythannot to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit       related parties the company had the following

form q unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise indicates references to “wave” the “company” “we” “our” “us” or similar terms refer to wave life sciences ltd and our wholly  owned subsidiaries overview we are a genetic medicines company with an innovative and proprietary synthetic chemistry drug development platform that we are using to design develop and commercialize a broad pipeline of firstinclass or bestinclass nucleic acid therapeutic candidates for genetically defined diseases nucleic acid therapeutics are a growing and innovative class of drugs that have the potential to address diseases that have historically been difficult to treat with small molecule drugs or biologics oligonucleotides are comprised of a sequence of nucleotides that are linked together by a backbone of chemical bonds we are initially developing oligonucleotides that target genetic defects to either reduce the expression of diseasepromoting proteins or transform the production of dysfunctional mutant proteins into the production of functional proteins the nucleic acid therapeutics we are developing are stereopure a stereopure oligonucleotide is comprised of molecules with atoms precisely arranged in threedimensional orientations at each linkage we believe controlling the position of the sulfur atom in the phosphorothioate “ps” moiety will optimize the pharmacological profile of our therapeutics by maximizing therapeutic effect while minimizing the potential for side effects and safety risks the stereopure therapies we are developing differ from the mixturebased  nucleic acid therapeutics currently on the market and in developme nt by others our preclinical studies have demonstrated that our stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics may achieve superior pharmacologic properties as compared to mixturebased nucleic acid therapeutics our platform is designed to enable us to rationally design optimize and produce stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics which were previously thought to be too difficult to make and too expensive to manufacture further our platform has the potential to design therapies that use any of the major molecular m echanisms employed by nucleic acid therapeutics including antisense ribonucleic acid interference “rnai” splicing and exon skipping our goal is to develop diseasemodifying drugs for indications with a high degree of unmet medical need in genetically defined diseases we are focused on designing singlestranded nucleic acid therapeutics that can distribute broadly within the human body allowing us to target diseases across multiple organ systems and tissues through both systemic and local administration in addition to our current programs in development we are also leveraging our platform to explore the next generation of stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics that have the potential to selectively target certain cell types our core focus for our whollyowned proprietary programs is neurology which we broadly define as genetic diseases within the central nervous system the “cns” and neuromuscular system we expect to initiate six development programs by the end of  these programs include our three most advanced programs which are in huntington’s disease “hd” and duchenne muscular dystrophy “dmd” and three additional development candidates which we expect to select by the end of  further details regarding our programs are set forth below   • in hd we have two separate programs wve and wve each targeting a different diseaseassociated single nucleotide polymorphism “snp” within the huntingtin gene rs “htt snp” and rs “htt snp” snps are naturally occurring variations within a given genetic sequence and in certain instances can be used to distinguish between two related copies of a gene where only one is responsible for causing production of a defective protein which causes disease it has been shown that by targeting htt snp or htt snp the production of diseasecausing proteins associated with hd can be reduced we expect to initiate clinical development of both wve and wve in mid   • in dmd we have developed wve which targets exon  a region within the ribonucleic acid “rna” transcribed from the dystrophin gene dmd is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene that results in dysfunctional dystrophin protein we expect to initiate clinical development of wve in the second half of    • in may  we entered into a collaboration with pfizer focused on the advancement of genetically defined targets for the treatment of metabolic diseases bringing together our proprietary drug development platform across antisense and singlestranded rnai modalities along with galnac and pfizer’s hepatic targeting technology for delivery to the liver the collaboration seeks to leverage our stereochemistry platform across antisense and rnai modalities and may incorporate galnac and pfizer’s hepatic targeting technology under the terms of the agreement pfizer will select and we will advance up to five targets from discovery through to the selection of clinical candidates at which point pfizer may elect to exclusively license the programs and undertake further development and potential commercialization two targets were declared upon initiation of the agreement including apolipoprotein ciii in the third quarter of  pfizer nominated its third target per the terms of the agreement pfizer is entitled to nominate the remaining two targets by november  we have never been profitable and since our inception we have incurred significant operating losses our net loss was  million and  million in the three months ended march   and  respectively as of march   and december   we had an accumulated deficit of  million and  million respectively we expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future recent developments on april   we closed a followon underwritten public offering of  ordinary shares for gross proceeds of  million  net proceeds to us from the offering are expected to be approximately  million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses we intend to use the proceeds from this offering to further advance our three lead programs in hd and dmd advance the development of our next three therapeutic candidates into the clinic increase internal cgmp manufacturing capacity support continued investment in the platform to drive the discovery and advancement of additional therapeutic candidates and for general corporate purposes  financial operations overview revenue we have not generated any product revenue since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products for the foreseeable future our revenue during the three months ended march   represents revenue earned under the pfizer collaboration agreement that we entered into in may  operating expenses our operating expenses since inception have consisted primarily of research and development costs and general and administrative costs research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities including our discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates which include   • employee salaries benefits and other related costs including sharebased compensation expense for personnel in our research and development organization   • expenses incurred under agreements with third parties including contract research organizations “cros” that conduct research and preclinical activities on our behalf as well as contract manufacturing organizations “cmos” that manufacture drug products for use in our preclinical trials   • costs of thirdparty consultants including fees sharebased compensation and related travel expenses   • the cost of sponsored research which includes laboratory supplies and facilityrelated expenses including rent maintenance and other operating costs and   • costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements we recognize research and development costs as incurred we recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred and are reflected in our financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses our primary research and development focus since inception has been the development of our innovative and proprietary synthetic chemistry drug development platform we are using our platform to design develop and commercialize a broad pipeline of nucleic acid therapeutic candidates our direct research and development expenses are tracked on a programbyprogram basis and consist primarily of cros cmos consultants and other external costs incurred in connection with our preclinical studies and regulatory fees however we do not allocate the cost of sponsored research on a programbyprogram basis because these costs are deployed across multiple product programs under development and as such are classified as costs of our research the cost of sponsored research includes laboratory supplies equipment repairs and

due to the increased size and duration of laterstage clinical trials we expect that our expenses related to salaries bonuses and other related benefits costs will increase in the future as we attract and maintain additional personnel we  expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we initiate clinical tria ls for certain of our product candidates continue to discover and develop additional product candidates and pursue later stages of clinical development of our product candidates general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries bonuses and other related benefits costs including sharebased compensation for personnel in our executive finance corporate business development legal and administrative functions general and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to intellectual property and general corporate matters expenses associated with being a public company professional fees for accounting auditing tax and consulting services insurance costs travel expenses other operating costs and facilityrelated expenses we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future primarily due to additional compensation including salaries benefits incentive arrangements and sharebased compensation awards as we increase our employee headcount to support the expected growth in our research and development activities and the potential commercialization of our product candidates additionally we expect our facilityrelated expenses to increase related to the lease we entered into in  for space in lexington massachusetts which we intend to use primarily for our cgmp manufacturing as well as for additional laboratory and

income taxes we are a multinational company subject to taxation in the united states japan ireland and singapore during the three months ended march   and  we recorded a tax provision of  million and

in the united states of america the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities costs and expenses revenue and related disclosures our critical accounting policies are described under the caption “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results

the accounting policies with respect to revenue recognition and income taxes involve the most judgment and complexity during the three months ended march   there were no material changes to our

by in the united states under a contract research agreement between our us and singapore entities during the three months ended march   and  we recorded no income tax benefits for the net operating losses incurred in japan ireland and singapore due to uncertainty regarding future taxable income in these jurisdictions liquidity and capital resources to date we have primarily funded our operations through private placements of debt and equity securities public offerings of our ordinary shares and collaborations through march   we have received an aggregate of approximately  million net proceeds from these transactions we received  million in net proceeds from private placements of our debt and equity securities  million in net proceeds  million gross proceeds from our initial public offering inclusive of the overallotment exercise and  million under the pfizer agreements including  million as an upfront payment under the pfizer collaboration agreement and  million in the form of an equity investment on april   we closed a followon underwritten public offering of  ordinary shares for gross proceeds of  million  net proceeds to us from the offering are expected to be approximately  million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses since our inception we have not generated any product revenue and have incurred recurring net losses as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling  million and an accumulated deficit of  million and restricted cash of  million related to letters of credit for our leased premises in cambridge massachusetts and lexington massachusetts we expect that the capital resources available to us as of march   along with the net proceeds from our april   public offering together with anticipated milestone payments under our existing collaboration with pfizer will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into mid we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect in addition we may elect to raise additional funds before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans until we can generate significant revenue from product sales if ever we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private equity or debt financings or other sources which may include collaborations with third parties on january   we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s which was declared effective by the sec on february   on which we registered for sale up to  million of any combination of our ordinary shares debt securities warrants rights purchase contracts andor units from time to time and at prices and on terms that we may determine after the closing of our followon underwritten public offering on april   approximately  million of securities remains available for issuance under this shelf registration this shelf registration statement will remain in effect for up to three years from the date it was declared effective adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all our inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability and we may never do

connection with our ongoing research and development activities and the establishment of our internal cgmp manufacturing capabilities we anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we   • file clinical trial applications with global regulatory agencies and initiate clinical studies for our two programs in huntington’s disease and our program in duchenne muscular dystrophy   • conduct research and continue preclinical development of the discovery targets and advance additional programs into development   • make strategic investments in expanding our rd platform capabilities and in optimizing our manufacturing processes and formulations   • develop manufacturing capabilities through outsourcing and establishing a scalable manufacturing facility   • maintain our intellectual property portfolio and consider the acquisition of complementary intellectual property   • seek and obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates and   • establish and build capabilities to market manufacture and distribute our product candidates we may experience delays or encounter issues with any of the above including but not limited to failed studies complex results safety issues or other regulatory challenges because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of drug candidates or followon programs and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for development of product candidates is unknown we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development for our therapeutic programs our future capital requirements for our therapeutic programs will depend on many factors including   • the progress and results of conducting research and preclinical and clinical development within our therapeutic programs and with respect to future potential pipeline candidates   • the cost of manufacturing clinical supplies for our product candidates   • the costs timing and outcome of regulatory review for our product candidates   • the costs and timing of future commercialization activities including manufacturing marketing sales and distribution for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval   • the revenue if any received from commercial sales for our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval   • the costs and timing of preparing filing and prosecuting patent applications maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual propertyrelated claims   • the effect of competing technological and market developments and   • the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses products and technologies including entering into licensing or collaboration arrangements for product candidates identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a timeconsuming expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales in addition our product candidates if approved may not achieve commercial success our product revenue if any will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years if ever accordingly we will need to obtain substantial additional funds to achieve our business objectives adequate additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms when we need them or at all we do not currently have any committed external source of funds except for possible future payments from pfizer if milestones under the pfizer collaboration agreement are achieved on january   we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s which was declared effective by the sec on february    the “ shelf” on which we registered for sale up to  million of any combination of our ordinary shares debt securities warrants rights purchase contracts andor units from time to time and at prices and on terms that we may determine on april   we closed a followon underwritten public offering of  for gross proceeds of  million under the  shelf following that closing approximately  million of securities remains available for issuance under the  shelf this registration statement will remain in effect for up to three years from the date it was declared effective to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities the ownership interest of our existing shareholders will be diluted and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our shareholders additional debt  financing and preferred equity financing if available may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and may require the issuance of warrants which could potentially dilute our shareholders’ owners hip interests if we raise additional funds through collaborations strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies future revenue streams research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us if we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed we may be required to delay limit reduce or terminate our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves contractual obligations and commitments there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments set forth under the heading “management’s discussion and

information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements and the expected impact on our consolidated financial statements see note  “significant accounting policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report on form q item  quantitative and qual itative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as to a lesser extent inflation and capital market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk in the ordinary course of our business our cash and cash equivalents are held in readily available checking and money market accounts foreign currency risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in the value of the japanese yen which is the currency in which our japanese subsidiary conducts its business as of march   and december    and  of our assets respectively were located in japan additionally  and  of our general and administrative expenses were transacted in japanese yen during the three months ended march   and  respectively furthermore  and  of our research and development expenses were transacted in japanese yen during the three months ended march   and  respectively when the us dollar strengthens relative to the yen our us dollar reported revenue and expense from nonus dollar denominated income and operating costs will decrease conversely when the us dollar weakens relative to the yen our us dollar reported revenue and expenses from nonus dollar denominated income and operating costs will increase changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and in some instances could materially adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows our foreign currency sensitivity is affected by changes in the japanese yen which is impacted by economic factors both locally in japan and worldwide a hypothetical  change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our historical financial position or results of operations inflation risk we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations for the three months ended march   and   capital market risk we currently have no product revenues and depend on funds raised through other sources one possible source of funding is through further equity offerings our ability to raise funds in this manner depends in part upon capital market forces affecting our share price item  controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

informationanalyst coveragecorporate governanceshareholder servicesculture  careersoverviewwho we arecurrent openingsabout   platform nucleic acid therapeutics are poised to radically change the medical landscape offering the potential to treat numerous serious often devastating genetically defined diseases that until now have proven “undruggable” to date nucleic acid therapeutics have been comprised of complex mixtures of hundreds of thousands of chemical entities known as stereoisomers some stereoisomers in these mixtures have therapeutic effects while others are less beneficial or contribute to undesirable side effects uncontrolled stereoisomer drug mixtures can lead to suboptimal efficacy and increased risk and safety concerns our novel chemistry platform eliminates these complex chemical mixtures giving us control over the pharmacology of our stereopure medicines in development rationally designed our stereopure nucleic acid therapies precisely target underlying disease biology and in our proofofconcept studies they have demonstrated improved activity stability specificity and immunogenicity compared with stereoisomer mixtures as a result we believe we will be able to maximize therapeutic effect while minimizing the potential for side effects and safety risks by doing so our goal is to unleash the true and vast promise of nucleic acid therapeutics to treat numerous diseases from complex to pure our approach for designing exceptional nucleic acid medicines for patients pure composition nucleic acid therapeutics are a large and innovative class of drugs that can modulate the function of target ribonucleic acid or rna to ultimately affect the production of diseaseassociated proteins each nucleic acid therapeutic is made up of strings of nucleotides each held together by chemical linkages the orientation of atoms at each linkage occurs randomly using conventional synthesis adopting either an “up” or “down” orientation because a nucleic acid therapeutic has multiple linkages an enormous numbers of permutations are possible often resulting in over halfamillion different molecules in every dose wave is the first company to fully control the orientation of the linkages and develop stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics precise design nucleic acid therapies employ various molecular mechanisms to carry out their function these mechanisms include those that promote degradation of the target rna like antisense and rnai and those that involve binding to the target rna and modulating its function like exon skipping nucleic acid therapies that promote degradation of the target rna utilize very specific naturally occurring enzymes for instance antisense therapies rely on the enzyme rnase h whereas rnai therapeutics rely on ago in each case the nucleic acid therapeutic makes specific interactions with the enzyme by controlling the orientation of the linkages wave is able to optimize the interaction between a nucleic acid therapy and various enzymes to improve pharmacology our goal exceptional outcomes for patients we have shown in proofofconcept studies that wave chemistry enables improvements in activity stability and specificity compared to mixturebased approaches and that it can be utilized across any target sequence at wave we are focused on developing optimally designed nucleic acid therapies that will be safer and more effective for patients using our chemistry and approach our aim is to develop targeted treatments for a broad spectrum of rare serious and previously untreatable

clinical trials week  wave life sciences ltd nasdaqwve a biotechnology company focused on delivering transformational therapies for patients with serious geneticallydefined diseases announced the initiation of the companys precisionhd program which includes precisionhd and precisionhd the companys two phase ba clinical trials evaluating wve and wve respectively for patients with huntingtons disease hd see also neurodegenerative diseases and conditions  huntington disease waves precisionhd program is the first to target the underlying cause of huntingtons disease with an allelespecific approach said michael panzara md mph neurology franchise lead of wave life sciences obtaining approvals to initiate these global studies as part of our first clinical program marks an important milestone for wave more importantly these investigational compounds have the potential to address a critical unmet need for the hd patient community where no diseasemodifying treatments are currently approved precisionhd and precisionhd are phase ba multicenter randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled studies that will primarily evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of wve and wve respectively administered intrathecally in hd patients additional exploratory objectives include assessing the impact that each compound has on the toxic mutant protein known to cause loss of brain cells in hd as well as evaluating potential clinical effects and impact on brain atrophy as measured by magnetic resonance imaging mri both precisionhd trials will follow the same protocol and each will target a single nucleotide polymorphism or snp that marks a separate and distinct location on the mutant huntingtin htt gene transcript wave intends to enroll approximately  patients globally in each of the two studies through multiple sites in canada initially with europe and the united states to follow the precisionhd trials for wve and wve will include adult patients with early manifest hd who carry a snp at the rs snp or the rs snp location respectively potential hd patients for the precisionhd program will be prescreened for the presence of snp or snp and directed to the appropriate study upon qualifying for entry approximately twothirds of all hd patients are expected to carry either snp snp or both in association with the hd gene snps are a common type of genetic variation that normally occur in all humans but may also act as biological markers to aid in locating genes associated with a particular disease previous hd research has identified multiple snps that are associated with the diseasecausing expanded cytosineadenineguanine cag repeat which is an abnormality present in all hd patients that results in the production of mutant huntingtin protein and causes hd therefore wave is utilizing common snps to precisely target the underlying cause of the disease keywords for this news article include chorea dementia genetics dyskinesias clinical research

reblogsharetweetsharecambridge massbusiness wirewave life sciences ltd wve a genetic medicines company focused on developing targeted therapies for patients impacted by rare diseases today announced financial results for the first quarter ended march  “the beginning of  was marked by continued advancement of our lead programs in hd and dmd and substantial progress in our collaboration with pfizer our two hd programs and our dmd program remain on track to enter the clinic in  and we will announce our next three pipeline candidates later this year” said paul bolno md mba president and chief executive officer of wave life sciences “we have also made significant advancements within our discovery platform deepening our knowledge and capabilities in both existing antisense and exon skipping and new ssrnai and splicing modalities and we are exploring new approaches to identify and target specific cell populations as we look ahead to our next set of pipeline candidates”first quarter business update lead programs and pipeline expansion on track in wave’s two lead programs in huntington’s disease “hd” and one lead program in duchenne muscular dystrophy “dmd” are on track to advance into clinical trials in  in hd wve and wve are expected to enter the clinic in mid in dmd wve is expected to enter the clinic in the second half of  in addition wave intends to select an additional three program candidates in  and is on track to deliver six development programs by the end of  manufacturing facility development underwayin  wave entered into a lease agreement for a manufacturing facility of approximately  square feet in lexington ma wave continued its substantial progress with the buildout during the first quarter and the company plans to occupy the facility by the end of the second quarter the facility will provide wave with current good manufacturing practice “cgmp” capabilities and increase the company’s control and visibility of its drug product supply chaininvestment in broad manufacturing capabilities is intended to grant wave and its current and future partners greater independence and flexibility in bringing multiple products to market the company expects its internal expertise in cgmp manufacturing will support growth of clinical drug product for its current and future development activities and could support commercialscale manufacturing accessing new tissue areas and cells with expanding discovery platformintrathecal administration of wave’s compounds in nonhuman primates demonstrated broad distribution in the central nervous system “cns” as wave’s portfolio of programs expands into additional neurological disorders wave is exploring the ability to target specific celltypes and regions ie astrocytes microglia spinal motor neurons of the cns using chemical modifications while also characterizing cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking relevant to antisense rnai and splicing modalities for example in q  wave entered into a collaboration with nlife therapeutics to access their conjugate chemistry platform and support some of wave’s enhanced discovery efforts additionally wave continues to explore therapeutic areas outside of neurology including liver eye and skin with external collaborators in these areas wave has demonstrated productive distribution invivo to key cell types in the liver hepatocytes via galnac conjugation in the eye rpe and the trabecular meshwork via intravitreal and intracamaral injections and in the skin suprabasal layer keratinocytes topical mm financing completed in april to support manufacturing and platform developmentin april  wave raised  million in gross proceeds in its first followon public offering with these additional proceeds wave is well positioned to support its continued investment in manufacturing independence with the potential for fullscale commercial readiness and to pursue its previously stated goal of delivering six development programs by the end of  in furtherance of these objectives wave is focused on advancing the additional three programs to be named later this year and continuing to invest in its platform to drive the discovery and advancement of future therapeutic candidates first quarter  financial results and financial guidancewave reported a net loss of  million for the first quarter of  as compared to a net loss of  million for the first quarter of  the increase in net loss for the first quarter was mainly due to increased research discovery and development expenses as well as increased salary and benefits expenses as wave continues to attract key talent and grow its organization to support its corporate goalsresearch and development expenses were  million for the first quarter of  as compared to  million for the same period in  the increase in research and development expenses yearoveryear was largely due to increases in supplies and services expenses related to the continued development of wave’s three lead programs as well as its discovery and platform activities along with increases in its salary and benefits expenses due to the increase in headcountgeneral and administrative expenses were  million for the first quarter of  as compared to  million for the same period in the  the increase in general and administrative expenses yearoveryear was driven by increases in salary and benefits expenses due to an increase in headcount as well as increases in other general and administrative expensesas of march   which was prior to the closing of the followon offering discussed above wave had cash and cash equivalents totaling  million as compared to  million as of december   the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of wave’s first quarter net losswave expects that the cash and cash equivalents available as of march   along with the net proceeds from the april  public offering together with anticipated milestone payments under its existing collaboration with pfizer will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into midabout wave life sciencesat wave life sciences we are driven by an unwavering passion and commitment to

collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our current and future product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs as a result our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering as of june   we had cash of  million we believe that the net proceeds from this offering together with the approximately  million in net proceeds raised from the sale and issuance of our series b preferred shares in august  and our cash and related interest we earn on these balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least  we will need to raise substantial additional funds before we can expect to commercialize any products we may satisfy our future cash needs through the sale of equity securities debt financings working capital lines of credit corporate collaborations or license agreements grant funding through interest income earned on cash balances or a combination of one or more of these sources pending use of our net proceeds from this offering we plan to invest the proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments including investmentgrade interestbearing instruments we cannot predict whether the net proceeds will yield a favorable return the pharmaceutical marketplace is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products while we believe that our expertise in nucleic acid therapeutics scientific knowledge and intellectual property estate provide us with competitive advantages we face potential competition from many different sources including major pharmaceutical specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions governmental agencies and public and private research institutions not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on nucleic acid therapeutics but any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development manufacturing preclinical testing conducting clinical trials obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do these competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies huntington’s disease there are no approved treatments available to slow the progression of huntington’s disease we believe based on publicly available information that i isis pharmaceuticals and roche phase  and sangamo biosciences preclinical are developing therapies that directly target the huntingtin rna and ii a number of other companies are developing drugs to treat symptoms associated with huntington’s disease including auspex pharmaceuticals and teva pharmaceutical industries which have submitted an new drug application or nda to the fda prana biotechnology phase  siena biotech phase  raptor pharmaceuticals phase  omeros corporation phase  pfizer phase  and ipsen phase  among others duchenne muscular dystrophy there are no therapies approved for the treatment of dmd in the united states we believe based on publicly available information that i ptc therapeutics biomarin pharmaceuticals and sarepta therapeutics are each developing exon skipping nucleic acid therapies to specifically target the diseaseassociated exons of the dystrophin rna and all have submitted an nda to the fda and ii a number of other companies including summit therapeutics phase  are developing or have approval to market drugs that can alter the progression of the disease in patients inflammatory bowel disease there are a limited number of drugs available for the treatment of ibd either uc or cd including mesalazine azathioprine budesonide and vedoluzimab we believe based on publicly available information that i celgene is developing a nucleic acid therapy to target cd phase  and ii other companies either are developing or have approval to sell drugs to treat the symptoms of ibd including johnson  johnson receptos pfizer eisai mylan novartis takeda and valeant pharmaceuticals among others company description we are a preclinical biopharmaceutical company with an innovative and proprietary synthetic chemistry drug development platform that we are using to design develop and commercialize a broad pipeline of firstinclass or bestinclass nucleic acid therapeutic candidates nucleic acid therapeutics have the potential to address diseases that have been difficult to treat with small molecule drugs or biologics currently there are two nucleic acid therapeutics that have received regulatory approval by the us food and drug administration or fda and others are in development we are initially developing nucleic acid therapeutics that target genetic defects to either reduce the expression of diseasepromoting proteins or transform the production of dysfunctional mutant proteins into the production of functional proteins the nucleic acid therapeutics we are developing are stereopure meaning they are comprised of molecules having atoms uniformly arranged in threedimensional orientations which we believe is advantageous for making drugs with consistent pharmacologic properties the stereopure therapies we are developing differ from the mixturebased nucleic acid therapeutics currently on the market and in development by others those therapies are mixtures of many thousands of molecules each having varying threedimensional atomic arrangements such variations may lead to potentially differing pharmacologic properties with some constituent molecules producing therapeutic effects and others being less beneficial or even contributing to undesirable side effects building upon the innovative work of our scientific founders gregory l verdine phd and takeshi wada phd our preclinical studies have demonstrated that our stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics may achieve superior drug properties as compared to mixturebased nucleic acid therapeutics our platform is designed to enable us to rationally design optimize and produce stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics further it has the potential to be used to design therapies that utilize any of the major molecular mechanisms employed by nucleic acid therapeutics including antisense ribonucleic acid interference or rnai and exon skipping as described below our goal is to develop diseasemodifying drugs for indications with a high degree of unmet medical need in both orphan and broad diseases we are initially focused on designing singlestranded nucleic acid therapeutics that can distribute broadly within the human body allowing us to target diseases across multiple organ systems and tissues through both systemic and local administration our most advanced therapeutic programs are in huntington’s disease duchenne muscular dystrophy or dmd and inflammatory bowel disease or ibd  in huntington’s disease we have programs targeting two diseaseassociated single nucleotide polymorphisms or snps within the huntingtin gene – htt snp and htt snp snps are naturally occurring variations within a given genetic sequence and in certain instances can be used to distinguish between two related copies of a gene where only one is responsible for causing production of a defective protein and causing disease it has been shown that by targeting htt snp and htt snp the production of diseasecausing proteins associated with huntington’s disease can be prevented we have selected a lead product candidate in our htt snp program and we expect to select a lead candidate in our htt snp program in early  we expect to file investigational new drug applications or inds with the fda for our candidate targeting htt snp in late  and our candidate targeting htt snp in early   in dmd we have a program targeting exon  a region within the ribonucleic acid or rna transcribed from the dystrophin gene dmd is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene including those in exon  that result in dysfunctional dystrophin protein and it has been shown that production of functional dystrophin protein can be restored by targeting exon  we have selected a lead product candidate in our exon  program and expect to file an ind with the fda for this candidate in late   in ibd we have a program targeting the rna transcribed from the smad gene overproduction of the smad protein has been shown to increase gastrointestinal or gi inflammation and exacerbate ibd it has also been demonstrated that by targeting the rna transcribed from the smad gene the overproduction of the smad protein can be suppressed thereby decreasing gi inflammation we expect to select a lead candidate in our smad program in early  we expect to file an ind with the fda for this candidate in  we also have latestage discovery programs in epidermolysis bullosa simplex or ebs and in dmd  in ebs we are targeting krt snp and krt snp ebs is caused by mutations in the krt gene which result in the production of defective krt proteins that manifest the symptoms of ebs krt snp and krt snp are diseaseassociated snps within the krt gene and we have shown in preclinical experiments that by targeting these snps selective reduction in the expression of the disease associated gene can be achieved we expect to identify lead candidates in our krt snp and krt snp programs in   in dmd we are also developing therapies targeting activin receptor type iib or acriib that can promote skeletal muscle growth it has been shown that such muscle growth can be promoted by silencing the rna transcribed from the gene encoding acriib we believe that targeting acriib could be beneficial in cases where dmd has progressed to a state of advanced muscle damage where exonskipping therapies including the candidates we are developing in our exonskipping dmd program may be less effective we expect to identify a lead candidate in our acriib program in  furthermore we believe that based on our initial selection criteria of novel and fastfollower opportunities our platform can potentially be used in the nearterm to design treatments for approximately  other potential target indications mostly consisting of orphan indications with an initial focus on orphan neuromuscular and central nervous system disease targets we believe that we have a strong intellectual property position relating to the development and commercialization of our stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics our intellectual property portfolio includes filings designed to protect stereopure oligonucleotide compositions generally as well as filings designed to protect stereopure compositions of oligonucleotides with particular stereochemical patterns for example that affect or confer biological activity oligonucleotides are chemically modified shortlength strands of rna or deoxyribonucleic acid or dna our portfolio also includes filings on both methods and reagents that are designed to protect various features of the chemical methodologies that enable production of such stereopure oligonucleotide compositions our portfolio also includes filings designed to protect methods of using stereopure oligonucleotide compositions and filings designed to protect particular stereopure oligonucleotide products such as those having a particular sequence pattern of nucleoside or backbone modification or both pattern of backbone linkages and pattern of backbone chiral centers a chiral center is an atom that is bonded to a defined set of pendant groups arranged in threedimensional space in a way that is not superimposable on its mirror image we believe that our technology provides us with a unique position in the therapeutic oligonucleotide marketplace due to prior or expected patent expirations and patent invalidations we believe that a variety of useful and effective oligonucleotide chemistries such as certain backbone and sugar modifications that have been developed in the industry will be available to the public prior to when we expect our drugs will be commercialized therefore we believe that we can readily incorporate these chemistries or other chemistries into our stereopure drugs moreover our strategy does not require or rely on a particular chemistry or any particular nucleotide sequence thus permitting us to navigate the intellectual property landscape in the field while developing our novel and proprietary oligonucleotide drugs  wave life sciences pte ltd registration no g was
