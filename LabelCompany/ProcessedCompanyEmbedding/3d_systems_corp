systems manufactures stereolithography sla selective laser sintering sls colorjet printing cjp fused deposition modeling fdm multijet printing mjp and direct metal printing dmp each technology takes digital input from threedimensional data to create threedimensional parts through an additive layerbylayer process the systems vary in their materials print capacities and applications stereolithography or sla was invented by d systems’ founder chuck hull stereolithography describes the method and apparatus for making solid objects in a vat of liquid photopolylmer using ultraviolet curable material and a laser to trace the digital design sla systems print with supports and are advantageous due to the speed and possible size of prints size depends on the build volume of the particular machine sla systems can also rapidly manufacture parts of different geometries at the same time and are designed to produce prototypes patterns or enduse parts of versatile sizes and applications sla parts are strong enough to be machined and can be used as master patterns for injection molding thermoforming blow molding and various metal casting processes selective laser sintering or sls is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles together material options are wide including plastic metal ceramic nylon polystrene or glass powders in many cases sls is an efficient process because large numbers of parts can be printed in one session sls does not require any support structures as parts are surrounded by unsintered powder at all times color jet printing uses inkjet technology to deposit a liquid binder across a bed of powder powder is released and spread with a roller to form each new layer this technology was originally developed by z corporation fused deposition modeling is handled by d systems hobbyist level printer line these printers use a heated extruder to deposit a thermoplastic along complex toolpaths one layer at a time a good visual model of this is using a hot glue gun to build a d model the hot glue gun a hand powered extruder would have to build things one layer at a time depositing a string roughly the width of the extruder orifice once a layer has cooled and hardened the next layer can be built until the model is complete fdm limitations include time it must travel along complex toolpaths color only one color can be printed at a time and durability interlayer adhesion is analogous to a cold solder this is generally the least expensive type of printer available multijet printing refers to the process of depositing liquid photopolymers onto a build surface using inkjet technology high resolution is attainable with a support material that can be easily removed in post processing unlike fdm these parts are generally too brittle for snapfits however lower durometer softer parts are possible with newer model mjp printers this allows the user to create rubbery or hard plastic parts for more diverse applications direct metal sintering refers to the d systems metal printing process this process spreads fine powders of diverse metal alloys out onto a printbed and fuses geometries together using an overhead laser beam this technology is used primarily in medical and aerospace applications where low volumes of unique and complex models are needed products

systems is a closedsource company relying on inhouse innovation for product development and improvement and a protective shield of patents to advantage its technologies over competitors critics of the closedsource model have blamed seemingly slow development and innovation in d printing not on a lack of technology but on a lack of open information sharing within the industry supporters of the closed source model argue that the right to patents inspires and motivates higherquality innovations leading to a better and more impressive final product in november  d systems filed a lawsuit

selective laser sintering or sls is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles together material options are wide including plastic metal ceramic nylon polystrene or glass powders in many cases sls is an efficient process because large numbers of parts can be printed in one session sls does not require any support structures as parts are surrounded

selective laser sintering or sls is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles together material options are wide including plastic metal ceramic nylon polystrene or glass powders in many cases sls is an efficient process because large numbers of parts can be printed in one session sls does not require any support structures as parts are surrounded

conclusions that we believe defamed the company and its reputation and resulted in losses to our shareholders one offending article was removed as a result sequential increases in earnings from actual sales and steady climbs in stock price per share provide reasonable cause for skepticism towards this report in january  it was announced that d systems had acquired the burbank cabased collectibles company gentle giant ltd gentle giant ltd designs develops and manufactures threedimensional representations of characters from a variety of franchise properties with worldwide name recognition including star wars the matrix harry potter the simpsons hellboy animated disney dragonkind animated pirates of the caribbean lord of the rings red star terminator charlie and the chocolate factory

highest quality of polyresin resin plastic pvc and abs utilizing the most advanced laserscanning techniques and a team of incredibly talented artisans gentle giant digitally captures the likenesses of actors props and scenery to accurately recreate these images for fans and collectors everywhere in july  d systems announced an acquisition of israeli medical imaging company simbionix for us in september  d systems acquired the belgian company layerwise the terms of the acquisition were not disclosed by the companies the company is based in leuven a town in belgium close to brussels it is a principal provider of services in the area of direct metal d printing and manufacturing the company was a spinoff of the university of leuven the takeover adds belgium to the list of countries where d systems has active locations in january  d systems acquired the d printer manufacturer botobjects the first company to commercialize a printer using the fused deposition modeling technique in april  d systems announced it acquired the easyway group of companies in china creating d systems china easyway is a chinese d printing sales and service provider with key operations in shanghai wuxi beijing guangdong and chongqing technologyedit d systems manufactures stereolithography sla selective laser sintering sls colorjet printing cjp fused deposition modeling fdm multijet printing mjp and direct metal printing dmp each technology takes digital input from threedimensional data to create threedimensional parts through an additive layerbylayer process the systems vary in their materials print capacities and applications stereolithography or sla was invented by d systems’ founder chuck hull stereolithography describes the method and apparatus for making solid objects in a vat of liquid photopolylmer using ultraviolet curable material and a laser to trace the digital design sla systems print with supports and are advantageous due to the speed and possible size of prints size depends on the build volume of the particular machine sla systems can also rapidly manufacture parts of different geometries at the same time and are designed to produce prototypes patterns or enduse parts of versatile sizes and applications sla parts are strong enough to be machined and can be used as master patterns for injection molding thermoforming blow molding and various metal casting processes selective laser sintering or sls is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles together material options are wide including plastic metal ceramic nylon polystrene or glass powders in many cases sls is an efficient process because large numbers of parts can be printed in one session sls does not require any support structures as parts are surrounded by unsintered powder at all times color jet printing uses inkjet technology to deposit a liquid binder across a bed of powder powder is released and spread with a roller to form each new layer this technology was originally developed by z corporation fused deposition modeling is handled by d systems hobbyist level printer line these printers use a heated extruder to deposit a thermoplastic along complex toolpaths one layer at a time a good visual model of this is using a hot glue gun to build a d model the hot glue gun a hand powered extruder would have to build things one layer at a time depositing a string roughly the width of the extruder orifice once a layer has cooled and hardened the next layer can be built until the model is complete fdm limitations include time it must travel along complex toolpaths color only one color can be printed at a time and durability interlayer adhesion is analogous to a cold solder this is generally the least expensive type of printer available multijet printing refers to the process of depositing liquid photopolymers onto a build surface using inkjet technology high resolution is attainable with a support material that can be easily removed in post processing unlike fdm these parts are generally too brittle for snapfits however lower durometer softer parts are possible with newer model mjp printers this allows the user to create rubbery or hard plastic parts for more diverse applications direct metal sintering refers to the d systems metal printing process this process spreads fine powders of diverse metal alloys out onto a printbed and fuses geometries together using an overhead laser beam this technology is used primarily in medical and aerospace applications where low volumes of unique and complex models are needed products and patentsedit as part of d systems effort to consolidate d printing under one logo its products span a range of d printers and print products to target users of its technologies across industries d systems offers both professional and production printers in addition to printers d systems offers content creation software including reverse engineering software and organic d modeling software following a razors and blades business model d systems offers more than one hundred materials to be used with its printers including waxes rubberlike materials metals composites plastics and nylons d systems is a closedsource company relying on inhouse innovation for product development and improvement and a protective shield of patents to advantage its technologies over competitors critics of the closedsource model have blamed seemingly slow development and innovation in d printing not on a lack of technology but on a lack of open information sharing within the industry supporters of the closed source model argue that the right to patents inspires and motivates higherquality innovations leading to a better and more impressive final product in november  d systems filed a lawsuit against prosumer d printer company formlabs and the kickstarter crowdfunding website over formlabs attempt to fund a printer which it claimed infringed its patent on “simultaneous multiple layer curing in stereolithography” d systems has applied for patents for the following innovations and technologies the rapid prototyping and manufacturing system and method radiation curable compositions useful in image projection systems compensation of actinic radiation intensity profiles for d modelers apparatus and method for cooling part cake in laser sintering radiation curable compositions useful in solid freeform fabrication systems apparatus for d printing using imaged layers compositions and methods for selective deposition modeling edge smoothness with low resolution projected
