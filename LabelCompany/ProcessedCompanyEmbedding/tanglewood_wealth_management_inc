a welcome game changer start your day with houston business journal news in your inbox sign up for morning edition here when charles schwab launched its intelligent portfolios service it also heralded the launch of an institutional version of the service targeting registered investment advisors sometime in the second quarter its this new offering that has firms like tanglewood eager with anticipation we’re actually thinking about using it said merrill merrill said it would come into consideration for the firms retail accounts for which tanglewood doesnt have the discretion to manage typically offshoots from the firms  millionplus wealth management accounts it would make us more efficient by letting us focus on the discretionary accounts that we manage said merrill the new platform would fit into tangelwoods broader strategy of streamlining different account types the large wealth management accounts investment management accounts which vary in size starting at roughly  and the smaller retail accounts that are less than  the smallest of the three is where an automated system could come into play tanglewood ranked th on the houston business journals list of largest houstonarea money management firms with  million in assets under management in truth tanglewood would rather spend less time on accounts that dont give the firm managerial discretion as would most wealth managers in houston said merrill the addition of a schwablike roboadviser to tanglewoods platform wouldnt even be something the firm would necessarily advertise but rather just have in the back pocket to make that particular service leaner and more selfsufficient everyone who wants to play in that area smaller retail accounts good luck yall have fun said merrill we’re going to focus on true
