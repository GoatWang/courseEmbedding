growth in revenues to  billion and an earnings per share of  which was four cents better than expected also the company reported an operating margin of  percent which was better than the  percent he had expectedlimited downsidegarcha continued that while netapps revenue and eps guidance fell short of expectations there is reason to believe revenue can grow the analyst noted that in the recent quarter product revenue grew  percent yearoveryear and while this growth rate will decelerate moving forward the relative balance of strategic offering at twothirds of total product revenues versus mature offering at onethird implies revenue growth could be more achievablegarcha further argued that although concerns over netapps growth profile remains the analyst has confidence in the companys

which is worrisome the  eps beat was more driven by a  benefit from lower rd than from revenue which was at the midpoint of guidance that said management has cut significant costs accelerated the

auction rate securities some companies have settled claims with clients and agreed to purchase back the auction rate securities stockbroker fraud and stockbroker arbitration there are a number of ways a stockbroker or financial advisor can break laws surrounding investment practices stockbroker fraud or negligence can include misrepresenting stocks or the risks associated with those investments recommending unsuitable stocks charging excessive transaction fees or failing to diversify an investors portfolio it is a stockbrokers responsibility to consider his clients best interest in all investment transactions clients who believe their stockbroker has acted improperly may be able to file an arbitration against the broker and possibly the financial firm the broker works for stock options and erisa complaints erisa employee retirement income security act regulates employee benefit and pension plans both of which can be tied into stock options employees and retired employees can file a lawsuit against a company andor its officers for breaching fiduciary responsibilities and putting stock options and pension plans at risk issues involved in erisa include wrongfully canceling or breaching employee stock options denying an employee rights granted by a stock option agreement misrepresenting the value of the stock failing to act in the best interests of stock option plans failing to act prudently in conducting and managing investments or lying about the number of options employees will be given furthermore it is a violation of erisa for an employer to take deductions from an employees paycheck for benefits but then not make those payments into the benefits plan under erisa it is illegal for an employer to discharge fine suspend expel discipline or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan… claims have been made alleging that employees were terminated or discriminated against when the employer suspected that the employee was about to make a claim under a benefits plan in such situations the employee must prove that the action taken against him was done so primarily to prevent him from accessing benefits and not that the loss of benefits was simply a consequence of the action taken companies that have had erisa complaints filed against them
