now and dont have one negative thing to say the apartment building is clean and nice this is including the front area hallways and laundry room the building manager is so amazing she contacts you when you have a package notifies maintenance promptly and remembers everyone by name another thing i love about this building is the  emergency maintenance they have i came home from work at am to my power not being on i called them and they had it fixed within  minutes also at my old apartment i had to mail my check in before the st if it got to the office a day later they would charge me here all i have to do is hand the check in to deborah by the first quick and easy especially when you have a crazy schedule if you get the chance to rent through them i highly recommend it i previously lived at  n sheridan rd and had an awful experience the building has roaches and bed bugs the property manager was rude and performed half assed work i stayed on the th floor and every time i went into the trash room i saw roaches running around i had to have exterminators come to my place numerous times for bug issues do not move into this building i lived at  n sheridan rd for two years and for the last four months the kopley group has allowed the elevators for a ninestory highrise malfunction without proper repair every other day id come home from work and find myself having to make a sixstory walk up to my apartment after working on my feet for ten hours deb the landlady kept saying theyre working on getting a new elevator but kopley would never let the residents know of the actual plans or progress many elderly and disabled residents were affected by this elevator outage on a regular basis with no remedy when i gave notice of moving out deb did not let me know that the freight elevator would only be operating one day of that weekend until five days beforehand forcing me to scramble to find new moving plans marco the superintendent and handyman refuses to accommodate the needs of the tenants and leaves people with no leeway for alternate plans the kopley group is ultimately just another unethical and negligent landlord dont expect anything else terrible experience nancy stanley kopey group has been unresponsive it takes  weeks to hear from her terrible experience our place continues to floodmold and nancy is unresponsive when we eventually connect she tells us to pay our full rent find another property to rent i lived at the  sheridan rd location for a year from  to  the staff was friendly and helpful the  doorman and engineer were a nice touch and both moving in and moving out was stress free i definitely recommend the kopley group to people looking for affordable edgewater housing my only complaint is that the elevators were badly in need of a renovation the second of the two elevators broke down over the winter and was never repaired during the time i lived at the building speaking of elevators the freight elevator is very old and finicky there arent even buttons just a dial for up and down so be aware of that the kopley group was wonderful to rent from  and trust me over the past  years i have dealt with some real nightmares nancy was wonderful to work with throughout my time with their company i rarely had any issues with my unit but if i did they were there to repair right away i wish more chicago management companies realized the importance of customer service  the kopley group surely does i would rent from them again in a heartbeat their building at  sheridan has a bad bed bug infestation as other online reports will confirm i found bugs in my unit right after moving in i also caught the management talking to an exterminator about another infested unit and then i met another tenant with bed bugs who had just moved in she lived on the other side of the building from me i found out all of this after living there for two weeks and i wasnt even trying to investigate i then got into a big confrontation with two managers when they refused to reimburse me for a mattress cover for the bed bugs even though i had a document stating that they would they simply said that document was old and they will now go back and delete any copies i had just received that paper a couple of weeks prior one then started saying i should just move out and then she shut the window on me if you do not encounter beg bugs in your unit the managers will seem like your best friends but there seems to be a good chance you will get bed bugs in this building and then you quickly see another side of the office ladies as with most rental companies your experience will depend partly on your location personally the kopley group has been the most professional responsive and organized of the rental companies ive used in chicago with the nicest cleanest safest building i rented a studio at the  n sheridan sheridanpratt location last year i secured the place online sightunseen from out of state the company made this very easy and luckily there were no nasty surprises when i came to move in the building was large with laundry and a management office onsite which made it possible to drop rent off rather than mail itthe manager was a pleasant enough craggy old woman who was generally very responsive and helpful the maintenance guy marco was also very pleasant and did good work i was always notified way ahead of time when the building was having work done when exterminators were coming in etc a monthly newsletter with recipes and other cute random tidbits was slid under the door i never saw any bugs other than spiders on the outside of the windowsill the studio i rented was huge tworooms with a separate kitchen and a walkin closet that a friend used as a guest room for a week seriously this place was practically a onebedroom at the time it was  utilities included except internet for the space and utilities it was a great deal now the neighbors on one side were loud and suspicious i called the cops on them when i heard slapping and crying they hid most of the family when the police came pretending there was only two of them living in the apartment but i never felt unsafe the building was secure the water pressure in the bathroom was spotty especially during the morning when everyone was getting ready for work the water would shift from hot to cold wildly and annoyingly but everything worked i didnt think the apartment was a great lucky deal at the time i had it however in the last few years i have rented some true shitholes with truly negligent rental companies if you are a studio renter with a limitied budget you can stand to do a lot lot worse than kopley i lived in this apartment building for about  years while i was going to school nearby it was the nicest and most reasonable out of all the apartments i looked at in the area the staff was friendly and professional and the apartment was a lot bigger than the other studios i looked at in the area the only issues i ever had were the lights going out quite often when i had the microwave going and too many lights or the tv on that was somewhat annoying i also had a few instances when strangers knocked on my door asking for moneyother than that i felt pretty safe as a young girl living along int the city can feel the  right below is also nice i would recommended taking a tour of their apartments and seeing if they are a right fit for you i have never rented from a better company i had a place at  n sheridan the landlady deborah is incredibly nice and helpful she has an office on the first floor so you can just drop in during business hours to take care of rent or let her know of any problems if there is a problem one of the maintenance guys was at my place within the hour to fix it i had one loud neighbor but the walls in the building are so thick it wasnt too bad of a problem the building had a very friendly vibe  much more so than any other place i ever lived we can probably attribute this to deborah the building itself was i believe a luxury hotel from the s the lobby kind of has that feeling which is fun i cant recommend them enough i just wish they rented apartments closer to my new job so i could keep doing business with kopley when my roommate and i decided to go our separate ways from our rogers park apartment i decided to find a studio i rented from the  n sheridan building and was set to move in mid september  since the apartment would not be ready until then i moved in on a saturday but wednesday i realized i was getting bit as i was finally about to start unpacking i found a weird bug in the closet i took pics of it and searched online it looked similar to a bed bug but it was brown i went to sleep that night and woke up to more bites the next day i found more information online about the life cycle of bed bugs i realized the bedbug i found was brown because it wasnt full of blood i called the building management and told them about finding bed bugs and that i needed to move how scarey is that to move into a new apartment and to get bit by bugs less than a week later they let me out of my lease and i moved the following saturday was only in the apartment for a week i was so paranoid after that that i ended up throwing away a third of my stuff in fear of taking them to my new apartment including my  month old new dresser i was very paranoid for a long time my roommate and i did not have bed bugs in our building and this new building tried to make it seem as though theyve never had bed bugs told me that they didnt have any report of them in that unit excuse me they can crawl through the walls maybe they came from the apartment next to mine of from the ones above or below when i looked on bed bug registry website i saw  reports for that address from  and  all in all i found about  bed bugs as i started to pack up my apartment i collected them and showed the building manager he still told me that they did not find any bed bugs as he had someone to inspect my apartment during the time i went to pick up my truck when i moved out lies i showed him the ones i collected in a bowl i would never rent from this management company ever again it was one of the most stressful experience in my life i hated that they acted as though their building didnt have bed bugs they are extremely hard to get rid of and from my research i found out that they can live in the walls with no food supply for up to  months they did not give me a straight answer and avoided to answer all together when i asked if they ever had bed bugs also as i asked other tenants whether or not they had bed bugs one guy was visiting his girlfriend and told me that she had bed bugs  years ago but they got rid of them obviously they didnt rid of all of them i had high hopes for this apartment because it was a nice sized studio with two huge closets and it was a good deal with all utilities included with a bus stop right in front i was looking forward to living here but because of the bed bugs i started getting stressed the aftermath affected my semester in school i lost a weeks worth of rent and had to move last minute into an apartment that was higher than what i wanted to pay and threw away approximately  worth of stuff weve lived in two apartments from kopley not high quality there are cords and wires sticking out in strange places and everything is covered in a thick coat of blinding white paint and parts of the floorboards underneath the radiators are rotting out the location is great though dealing with kopley has at times been great and at others infuriating when we have had maintenance problems in the bathroom and a bedbug scare they responded immediately the maintenance man is great however some of the personnel in the main office particularly whoever is in charge of billing etc are monsters they gave us such a hard time when we first rented from them that almost made us both cry they attempted to cash two of my rent checks as one months rent they do not respond timely to rent issues and they are frankly rude and unpleasant to deal with bed bug infestations were reported on at least three floors of one of their buildings management chose to do treatments with chemicals purchased at the hardware store rather than call professionals and the problem is just as bad and no doubt spreading dont rent with these people they will not take care of their responsibility they will even argue that vermin control is not their responsibility but chicago law states otherwise as a management company i could not recommend them more highly they were great to work with from the very start friendly courteous and very fair i felt valued as a tenant which says a great deal nick my building manager was incredible very quick to respond to any need whatsoever we rent through them and theyre great theyve been super nice about everything and very helpful definitely would recommend them the kopley group inc unclaimed this business has

follow julia d stop following julia d  i lived at  n sheridan rd for two years and for the last four months the kopley group has allowed the elevators for a ninestory highrise malfunction without proper repair every other day id come home from work and find myself having to make a sixstory walk up to my apartment after working on my feet for ten hours deb the landlady kept saying theyre working on getting a new elevator but kopley would never let the residents know of the actual plans or progressmany elderly and disabled residents were affected by this elevator outage on a regular basis with no remedywhen i gave notice of moving out deb did not let me know that the freight elevator would only be operating one day of that weekend until five days beforehand forcing me to scramble to find new moving plans marco the superintendent and handyman refuses to accommodate the needs of the tenants and leaves people with no leeway for alternate plans the kopley group is ultimately just

badly in need of a renovation the second of the two elevators broke down over the winter and was never repaired during the time i lived at the building speaking of elevators the freight elevator is

review compliment send message follow victor s stop following victor s  their building at  sheridan has a bad bed bug infestation as other online reports will confirm i found bugs in my unit right after moving in i also caught the management talking to an exterminator about another infested unit and then i met another tenant with bed bugs who had just moved in she lived on the other side of the building from me i found out all of this after living there for two weeks and i wasnt even trying to investigate i then got into a big confrontation with two managers when they refused to reimburse me for a mattress cover for the bed bugs even though i had a document stating that they would they simply said that document was old and they will now go back and delete any copies i had just received that paper a couple of weeks prior one then started saying i should just move out and then she shut the window on meif you do not encounter beg bugs in your unit the managers will seem like your best friends but there seems to be a good chance you will get bed bugs in this building and then you quickly see another side of the office ladies was this review … useful  funny cool erika p chicago il  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow erika p stop following erika p  as with most rental companies your experience will depend partly on your location personally the kopley group has been the most professional responsive and organized of the rental companies ive used in chicago with the nicest cleanest safest building i rented a studio at the  n sheridan sheridanpratt location last year i secured the place online sightunseen from out of state the company made this very easy and luckily there were no nasty surprises when i came to move in the building was large with laundry and a management office onsite which made it possible to drop rent off rather than mail itthe manager was a pleasant enough craggy old woman who was generally very responsive and helpful the maintenance guy marco was also very pleasant and did good work i was always notified way ahead of time when the building was having work done when exterminators were coming in etc a monthly newsletter with recipes and other cute random tidbits was slid under the door i never saw any bugs other than spiders on the outside of the windowsill the studio i rented was huge tworooms with a separate kitchen and a walkin closet that a friend used as a guest room for a week seriously this place was practically a onebedroom at the time it was  utilities included except internet for the space and utilities it was a great deal now the neighbors on one side were loud and suspicious i called the cops on them when i heard slapping and crying they hid most of the family when the police came pretending there was only two of them living in the apartment but i never felt unsafe the building was secure the water pressure in the bathroom was spotty especially during the morning when everyone was getting ready for work the water would shift from hot to cold wildly and annoyingly but everything worked i didnt think the apartment was a great lucky deal at the time i had it however in the last few years i have rented some true shitholes with truly negligent rental companies if you are a studio renter with a limitied budget you can stand to do a lot lot worse than kopley

building for about  years while i was going to school nearby it was the nicest and most reasonable out of all the apartments i looked at in the area the staff was friendly and professional and the apartment was a lot bigger than the other studios i looked at in the area the only issues i ever had were the lights going out quite often when i had the microwave going and too many lights or the tv on that was somewhat annoying i also had a few instances when strangers knocked on my door asking for moneyother than that i felt pretty safe as a young girl living along int the city can feel the

share review embed review compliment send message follow phil s stop following phil s  i have never rented from a better company i had a place at  n sheridan the landlady deborah is incredibly nice and helpful she has an office on the first floor so you can just drop in during business hours to take care of rent or let her know of any problems if there is a problem one of the maintenance guys was at my place within the hour to fix iti had one loud neighbor but the walls in the building are so thick it wasnt too bad of a problem the building had a very friendly vibe  much more so than any other place i ever lived we can probably attribute this to deborahthe building itself was i believe a luxury hotel from the s the lobby kind of has that feeling which is funi cant recommend them enough i just wish they rented apartments closer to my new job so i could keep doing business with kopley was this review … useful funny  cool t j chicago il  friend  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow t j stop following t j  when my roommate and i decided to go our separate ways from our rogers park apartment i decided to find a studio  i rented from the  n sheridan building and was set to move in mid september   since the apartment would not be ready until then  i moved in on a saturday but wednesday i realized i was getting bit as i was finally about to start unpacking i found a weird bug in the closet  i took pics of it and searched online  it looked similar to a bed bug but it was brown  i went to sleep that night and woke up to more bites  the next day i found more information online about the life cycle of bed bugs i realized the bedbug i found was brown because it wasnt full of blood i called the building management and told them about finding bed bugs and that i needed to move how scarey is that to move into a new apartment and to get bit by bugs less than a week later they let me out of my lease and i moved the following saturday was only in the apartment for a week  i was so paranoid after that that i ended up throwing away a third of my stuff in fear of taking them to my new apartment including my  month old new dresser  i was very paranoid for a long time my roommate and i did not have bed bugs in our building and this new building tried to make it seem as though theyve never had bed bugs told me that they didnt have any report of them in that unit excuse me they can crawl through the walls maybe they came from the apartment next to mine of from the ones above or below when i looked on bed bug registry website i saw  reports for that address from  and   all in all i found about  bed bugs as i started to pack up my apartment i collected them and showed the building manager he still told me that they did not find any bed bugs as he had someone to inspect my apartment during the time i went to pick up my truck when i moved out lies i showed him the ones i collected in a bowl  i would never rent from this management company ever again it was one of the most stressful experience in my life  i hated that they acted as though their building didnt have bed bugs  they are extremely hard to get rid of and from my research i found out that they can live in the walls with no food supply for up to  months  they did not give me a straight answer and avoided to answer all together when i asked if they ever had bed bugs  also as i asked other tenants whether or not they had bed bugs one guy was visiting his girlfriend and told me that she had bed bugs  years ago but they got rid of them  obviously they didnt rid of all of them i had high hopes for this apartment because it was a nice sized studio with two huge closets and it was a good deal with all utilities included with a bus stop right in front  i was looking forward to living here but because of the bed bugs i started getting stressed the aftermath affected my semester in school i lost a weeks worth of rent and had to move last minute into an apartment that was higher than what i wanted to pay and threw away approximately  worth of stuff was this review … useful funny cool k j la crosse wi  friends  reviews  photos share review embed
