invesco’s world of quality growth opportunities invesco international and global growth a world of opportunities  about risk depositary receipts risk depositary receipts involve many of the same risks as those associated with direct investment in foreign securities in addition the underlying issuers of certain depositary receipts particularly unsponsored or unregistered depositary receipts are under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications to the holders of such receipts or to pass through to them any voting rights with respect to the deposited securities derivatives risk the value of a derivative instrument depends largely on and is derived from the value of an underlying security currency commodity interest rate index or other asset each referred to as an underlying asset in addition to risks relating to the underlying assets the use of derivatives may include other possibly greater risks including counterparty leverage and liquidity risks counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative as a result an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative which may make the funds returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price this risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions during which the fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions derivatives may also be harder to value less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the funds ability to use certain derivatives or their cost also derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits particularly during adverse market conditions developingemerging markets securities risk the prices of securities issued by foreign companies and governments located in developingemerging market countries may be affected more negatively by inflation devaluation of their currencies higher transaction costs delays in settlement adverse political developments the introduction of capital controls withholding taxes nationalization of private assets expropriation social unrest war or lack of timely information than those in developed countries foreign securities risk the funds foreign investments may be affected by changes in a foreign countrys exchange rates political and social instability changes in economic or taxation policies difficulties when enforcing obligations decreased liquidity and increased volatility foreign companies may be subject to less regulation resulting in less publicly available information about the companies geographic focus risk from time to time the fund may invest a substantial amount of its assets in securities of issuers located in a single country or a limited number of countries if the fund focuses its investments in this manner it assumes the risk that economic political and social conditions in those countries will have a significant impact on its investment performance the funds investment performance may also be more volatile if it focuses its investments in certain countries especially emerging markets countries growth investing risk growth stocks tend to be more expensive relative to their earnings or assets compared with other types of stock as a result they tend to be more sensitive to changes in their earnings and can be more volatile investing in the european union risk many countries in the european union are susceptible to high economic risks associated with high levels of debt notably due to investments in sovereign debts of european countries such as greece italy and spain one or more member states might exit the european union placing its currency and banking system in jeopardy the european union faces major issues involving its membership structure procedures and policies including the adoption abandonment or adjustment of the new constitutional treaty the european unions enlargement to the south and east and resolution of the european unions problematic fiscal and democratic accountability efforts of the member states to further unify their economic and monetary policies may increase the potential for the downward movement of one member states market to cause a similar effect on other member states markets european countries that are part of the european economic and monetary union may be significantly affected by the tight fiscal and monetary controls that the union seeks to impose on its members management risk the investment techniques and risk analysis used by the funds portfolio managers may not produce the desired results market risk the prices of and the income generated by the funds securities may decline in response to among other things investor sentiment general economic and market conditions regional or global instability and currency and interest rate fluctuations preferred securities risk preferred securities may include provisions that permit the issuer in its discretion to defer or omit distributions for a certain period of time if the fund owns a security that is deferring or omitting its distributions the fund may be required to report the distribution on its tax returns even though it may not have received this income further preferred securities may lose substantial value due to the omission or deferment of dividend payments small and midcapitalization risks stocks of small and midsized companies tend to be more vulnerable to adverse developments and may have little or no operating history or track record of success and limited product lines markets management and financial resources the securities of small and midsized companies may be more volatile due to less market interest and less publicly available information about the issuer they also may be illiquid or restricted as to resale or may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes all of which may cause difficulty when establishing or closing a position at a desirable price as of  iegax nav change    nas may appear until data is available data
