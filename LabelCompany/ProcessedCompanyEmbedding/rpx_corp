a multibillion dollar industry largely as a result of patent trolls due to their large numbers companies are forced to direct resources and attention towards lawsuitsrpx helps companies drastically reduce their litigation exposure with a unique business model that enjoys several durable competitive advantagesthe firms addressable market patent litigation defense  insurance remains largely untappedthe opportunity exists as most players within this space have a bad reputation as many utilize their portfolio of patents in order to extract settlementslicensing fees from companiesi believe rpx corporation is substantially undervalued at current levels with  upside even assuming no multiple expansion taking multiple expansion into consideration increases upside potential severalfoldlandscape of patent litigation intellectual property laws were created in order to promote progress the idea was that an inventor or creator would be deterred from performing their purpose inventing and creating if they did not have any protection of their works created when ip laws were created inventors and creators had sufficient incentive particularly incentive of the financial nature to come up with new products and services that would allow societal progress if an inventor created a product that was beneficial for society said product could be commercialized and the inventor could pocket the profit derived the model worked well for decades until recently patent trolling rapidly became infamous in the s patent trolls as they are pejoratively named discovered that they could purchase a portfolio of patents initiate lawsuits on the basis on patent infringement and pocket the settlement offered by the defendant typically the patent troll purchases patent from financiallydistressed companies thus allowing the patent troll to acquire intellectual property at cheap prices due to the presence of a cashstrapped and highly motivated seller this practice was highly lucrative resulting in a flood of patent trolls adopting a similar modus operandi suffice to say as the number of patent trolls increased patents became more expensive regardless the practice remains feasible from a financial standpoint although successful infringement lawsuits are few and far between the outsized payout as seen in the above from a single lawsuit continued to motivate patent trolls companies began to suffer from lawsuits initiated by patent troll most notably apple nasdaqaapl is the  target for patent trolls having received over a hundred lawsuits in recent years patent trolling is clearly a big problem the curious reader would probably have the following question in mind cant companies defend against these lawsuits to that question the answer is a resoundingly yes however not only does legal defense not come cheap patent lawsuits tend to distract management from their core operations additionally settlement costs are equally huge combined legal defense and settlements costs to the industry have grown from b in  to b in  as seen below furthermore the defendant is in no position to countersue given that the plaintiff patent troll typically does not create or sell their own products and services hence there is no legal basis for a countersuit rpx corporation nasdaqrpxc offers a solution enter rpx corporation the companys business model is rather simple to understand rpxc offers two solutions a defensive patent aggregation solution and insurance to cover the costs of patent litigation simply put rpxc first acquires a portfolio of patents thus aggregating them and then provides their clients with licenses to these patent assets hence protecting said clients from potential litigation exposure in a nutshell the company acts as a middleman between its clients and patents additionally the company also offers patent litigation insurance which serves as a natural addon to its core patent risk management solution source rpx corporation the firms core patent risk management solution is a tremendous valueadd to its clients the rationale here is simple essentially rpxc helps its clients dramatically reduce the cost of patent litigation the patent market is highly irrational due to the presence of huge deadweight losses primarily legal costs nonpracticing entities npes a more palatable term for patent trolls use litigation to transfer value between patent owners and users litigation costs are substantial source rpx corporation source rpx corporation rpxc is able to buy highquality patent assets cheaply x and x for prelitigation and litigation acquisition respectively before they become a costly problem whether prelitigation or during litigation as seen above due to the fact that it shares the cost amongst its large clientele over  clients and growing which increases their overall negotiating leverage in the absence of these lawsuits litigation costs decrease substantially licenses are less expensive as they are negotiated and not litigated in a nutshell rpxc can settle litigation issues for its clients at  or  of the cost in addition the clients management team can focus their effort on their core operations instead of lawsuits suffice to say rpxc adds substantial value to its clients the business makes money from its patent risk management solution through subscription fees collected from its clients from the licensing of patent assets these fees are typically calculated as a percentage of the clients topline or operating income thus allowing rpxc to not only participate in the financial success of its clients but also ensures the alignment of interests for both parties as for the insurance solution rpxc adopts a cookiecutter insurance model collecting premiums upfront and distributing payouts contingent on certain events reducing litigation exposure with a business model that enjoys durable competitive advantages barriers to entry to this space are formidable rpxc derives its competitive advantages from the following sources capital requirements reputation  track record scale and network effects purchasing one or two patents is just not going to cut it the value proposition for such companies looking to manage patent litigation exposure is just not there as a result a newcomer looking to enter the space would require substantial amounts of capital in order to purchase a diverse portfolio of patent assets rpxc spends m annually to acquire patents  to date the company has spent nearly b resulting in the creation of a meaningful barrier to entry however acquiring these patent assets is not enough reputation and track record matters the new challenger would need to spend months or even years rpxc mentioned its sales cycle may span over a year convincing a potential client that it can be trusted as a service provider the reasoning for this is simple the potential client has no idea if the new entrant would simply do a baitandswitch since the new entrant would have a portfolio of patents and litigate the client therefore reputation and track record counts for a lot rpxc has been in operation for  years and to the best of my knowledge the company has maintained a pristine track record of never litigating its clients even if capital requirements reputation and track record were not an issue without a large installed base of clients providing a steady stream of subscription fees the challenger would need to operate at a loss for many years before they achieve scale finally network effects are particularly prominent in this space there is only a limited number of patents issued every year and patents do expire usually within  years from date of issue major players such as rpxc who possess a portfolio of  highquality diverse applications across their clientele patent assets present a compelling proposition to existing and potential clients as the company expands its client base new patents that are acquired from the addition of clients can be licensed to existing clients resulting in value enhancement for the entire network with each incremental addition additionally as the network grows its negotiating leverage grows in tandem as purchases of patent assets are made by a consortium not a single entity in a nutshell we have a business that provides a highly compelling value proposition to companies that face patent litigation exposure ie nearly every technology company possesses extremely durable competitive advantages stemming from formidable barriers to entry which manifests from the presence of capital requirements scale reputation  track record and network effects and generates highlyrecurring cash flows derived from a large installed base of subscribers and consistent cash inflow from insurance premiums not many businesses share these characteristics rpxc is without a doubt a great business as always qualitative discussion is all well and good but the numbers need to back up the narrative in this case they do competition theory tells us that the greater the barriers to entry the higher the profit margins the incumbent can earn and the longer the incumbent can maintain said profit margins rpxc has consistently earned  ebitda margins per morningstar data that have remained remarkably stable in the past halfdecade subscription fees and insurance premiums revenue streams that are highlyrecurring  renewal rates form the entirety of the companys revenue base the firms addressable market patent litigation defense  insurance remains largely untapped due to its rather unique business model rpxc can grow in several ways i believe the most plausible ways are continued additions to its client base results in increased subscription fees and insurance premiums collected and improvement in financial performance of its network of clients as subscription fees are tied to revenuesoperating income of rpxcs customers earlier i emphasized the fact that rpxc helps companies reduce litigation costs in two key areas  prelitigation and during litigation it follows that the market opportunity for rpxc in the latter area can be quantified by a metric that measures the volume of litigation  specifically the number of active npe campaigns source rpx corporation as seen above the number of active npe campaigns have been growing at a rapid pace  the  number is more than double that in  this effectively illustrates the size of the market opportunity that is available to rpxc to put things in perspective rpxc was able to obtain sublicenses for  campaigns in  compared to a total of  campaigns this represents a mere  penetration supporting my belief that the companys addressable market within the prelitigation and litigation areas remains largely untapped new campaigns will always be filed as more patents get approved but due to rpxcs tremendous valueadd discussed earlier its clients would either exit those actions or never encounter them in the first place it is good to be an rpxc client due to the companys highly attractive value proposition and the prevalent nature of npe campaigns i expect rpxcs penetration to increase meaningfully in the nearterm network effects will play a huge role in enticing new clients to come on board this is not a mere hypothetical  it is already happening the company managed to add an increasing number of clients year after year client additions were   and  for the years   and  in q fy alone the company added  new clients on a net basis indicating that network effects are everstrengthening source rpx corporation the market potential within the patent litigation insurance space is similarly untapped to date the company has  policyholders they only began selling policies late as seen above management has identified that there are possibly over  companies that require such insurance although one can make the argument that other insurance companies as insurance is largely a commodity can acquire market share in the patent litigation insurance space the argument does not hold this is because underwriting insurance policies in this area is largely unheard of due to the inability of insurers to estimate the likelihood of payouts in order to price premiums correctly in the case of rpxc the company has been able to compile proprietary data sets on the frequency of npe litigations and the cost of said litigations this is thanks to their core patent risk management solution which provides rpxc with an underwriting advantage thus allowing the firm to estimate likelihood of payouts and price premiums very accurately other insurers are simply unable to do this  they do not have the data this underwriting advantage is likely to be durable as the company expands its data sets over time as a result rpxc currently faces next to no competition in the area of patent litigation insurance and should soon see increasing penetration due to network effects detailed earlier going forward source rpx corporation additionally as subscription fees derived from the companys core patent risk management solution is structured as a percentage of the revenueoperating income of its clients rpxc can benefit from improvements in the operating performance of their clients as seen above the firms client network is highly diversified within the technology sector the sector is likely to experience massive growth in the nearterm due to the trends in cloud computing big data social ecommerce and mobile rpxc will tag along with this growth source rpx corporation this tagalong is likely to benefit rpxc hugely as the companys clients are major players that participate in fastgrowing markets mentioned above they include heavyweights such as cisco nasdaqcsco ebay nasdaqebay linkedin lnkd ibm nyseibm microsoft nasdaqmsft and many more valuation note that capital expenditures are not assumed to be constant thus it is left blank in the key assumptions tab and varied within the model itself i have modeled out the companys free cash flows as seen above fy revenue growth is expected to be in the high singledigits which is inline with management estimates from fy i expect rpxc to be able to continue growing revenue at mid to high singledigit growth rates i believe this growth will be driven by greater penetration within the markets patent risk management  insurance that the firm serves along with client operating performance improvements ebitda margins are expected to be flat at  this is due to the fact that formidable barriers to entry as outlined earlier are able to deter new entrants for entering the space and forcing margins down i will address this point further in a later section i believe this is a conservative estimate as the company managed  operating margins in q fy compared to the normal  in prior quarters if this margin expansion is sustainable upside potential will be far greater source rpx corporation capital expenditures include net acquisition spending on patent assets i have modeled this line item to decline meaningfully as a percentage of sales as the company begins to benefit from increased scale as a result of the addition of more clients to its network this is further supported by the companys historical net acquisition spend as seen above utilizing a terminal growth rate of  and a  discount rate my model implies substantial upside  from current levels additionally this analysis does not include the upside potential as a result of margin expansion as a result i believe the company is severely undervalued at current trading prices stagnant profitability one potential bone of contention that investors might have with the company is its apparentlystagnant gaap profitability net income has remained at m throughout  however i believe that net income is not a reasonable metric to measure the companys performance as a byproduct of rpxcs business model amortization charges have been the primary contributor to a flat net income over the period mentioned i opine that examining cash flow metrics is a better indicator of the firms performance over the  period cash from operations doubled thus i believe that the company actually benefits from its huge amortization expenses which allow it to reduce pretax income thus leading to lower taxes paid why this opportunity exists and risks to the thesis historically npes have a rather bad reputation not only are their practices controversial their business models are highly volatile and thus unattractive to investors due to their reliance on large and essentially forced licensing deals and settlements that they can extract from the companies they litigate or threaten to litigate rpxc gets lumped together with npes due to the fact that both parties compete with one another in the patent acquisition market it follows that rpxc is underfollowed as investors may dismiss the company as an npe due to its activity in the patent acquisition market further prominent npes such as acacia research nasdaqactg trade at multiples that are drastically higher than that of rpxc for reference rpxc currently trades at about x ebitda while actg trades at about x ebitda i believe the reason why actg trades at such a premium multiple is due to their presumably sizable backlog of pending litigation activity which investors feel may result in large payouts either in the form of settlements of licensing deals i believe that the primary risk to the bull case is the threat of competition if one considers rpxcs coveted ebitda margins it is not a stretch to assert that the threat of competition should be on every investors mind however i believe this risk is heavily mitigated by several factors explained below the model that actg and intellectual ventures another highprofile npe adopts is not sustainable without frequent external capital infusions these companies can go a long time without pocketing a large payout one need only examine actg falling revenues as evidence of this the npe has been executing lesser agreements whether settlement or licensing in recent years with the number of new agreements executed falling from  to  over the  period in addition the companys cashflow streams are slowly drying up as the number of licensing and enforcement programs that generate revenue fell from  to  over the same period actg reported a net loss for  and is also cashflow negative a side effect of this unprofitability is that actg is unlikely to be able to meaningfully compete with rpxc in the area of patent asset acquisition as actg is cashstrapped and rpxc is not as rpxc is able to syndicate capital through its network of clients substantially increasing its financial strength to buy patents actg is unlikely to be able to bid higher than rpxc for patent assets a similar case can be made for other patent trolls clearly the patent troll model is not built to last in contrast rpxcs business model is built with longterm durability in mind the firm does not rely on huge onetime payouts or shortlived annuity streams to finance further growth instead its cashflow is generated from the subscription fees collected from its clientele and insurance premiums that it collects from underwriting patent litigation insurance without a doubt rpxcs business model is clearly better therefore i opine that the company is likely to experience meaningful multiple expansion as investors begin to realize the difference between the rpxc model and the patent troll model the clever reader would then pose the following question cant npes transition into a model similar to rpxc at first sight this seems to be possible after all many npes possess substantial patent assets particularly intellectual ventures which has consistently been ranked in the top  patent owners in the us however if one examines further they would come to the conclusion that such a transition is nearly impossible the reasoning is simple these npes have a history of litigating companies in order to extract huge payouts as elaborated earlier reputation and track record counts for a lot in this space it would be a huge stretch to posit that potential clients would be willing to work with a former npe instead of rpxc given the npes tainted track record other competitive advantages which mitigate the threat of competition such as capital requirements scale and network effects have been explained in earlier paragraphs substantially undervalued middleman in the patent litigation industry rpxc is a pioneer in the field of patent litigation and adopts a business model that enjoys several highlydurable competitive advantages new entrants would have a tough time entering the industry thus allowing the rpxc to maintain its  ebitda margins going forward furthermore it would be nigh impossible for existing competitors that compete with the company in the market for patent assets to transition to the rpxc model the potential for growth remains largely untapped whether in patent risk management or in patent litigation insurance as detailed earlier rpxc is severely undervalued even if we assume that the company would not be able to experience multiple expansion in the future something that i view is highly unlikely i have little doubt that rpxc is a terrific business due to its numerous competitive advantages and thus the firm deserves a premium multiple rpxc is a highly attractive long candidate for the investor with a longterm horizon the company is poised to acquire market share with little threat of competition and thus is likely to trade at a steep multiple in the future its defensive endmarket exposure patent litigation is unlikely to be hugely affected by ebbs and flows in the economy should mitigate cyclicality couple this with its strong cash flow conversion the firm should offer solid fcf yield even if it trades at higher multiplesthe firm is also substantially undervalued at current levels with  upside per my dcf thus i highly recommend a long position in rpxc after all it is not every day one finds a firm generating  ebitda margins that are likely to remain stable going forward with largelyuntapped growth potential trading at x ebitda disclosure i amwe are long rpxc i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving
