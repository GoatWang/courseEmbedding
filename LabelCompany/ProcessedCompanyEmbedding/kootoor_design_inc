thistwitterfacebooklinkedin leave a comment posted in top underwriters prominence is the key concept with the sec’s new guidance for earnings releases posted on july    leave a comment this earnings season will be the first since the sec’s may th revised cdis compliance and disclosure interpretations guidance regarding the presentation of gaap and nongaap measures in earnings releases sec chair white recently spoke of having noteworthy concerns about issuers who present nongaap measures “too far and beyond what is intended and allowed by the sec’s rules” and “troublesome practices which can make nongaap disclosures misleading” lets tag them as the bad nongaaples the sec is aware that just a few bad nongaaples have ruined the whole batch to address this the sec has issued new and updated cdis regarding nongaap measures the new and revised cdis do not represent a formal rule change however they are a warning signal to issuers and absolutely demonstrate the sec’s concerns regarding inappropriate adjustments presented by companies on their nongaap financial measures the sec is watching earnings releases closely much of the new guidance is strategic if not “philosophical” around the actual measures that an issuer uses to calculation their earnings and guidance that’s for the audit committee to work on tactically the sec calledout some nongaap disclosure presentation practices that are common in earnings releases the bottomline is that issuers cannot disclosure their results in manner that places undue prominence on the nongaap numbers “prominence” is the key concept here earnings release practices that the sec has specified as nonacceptable include presenting a nongaap measure before its most directly comparable gaap measure – including within an earnings release headline or caption presenting a nongaap measure using a style of presentation eg bold larger font that emphasizes the nongaap measure over the comparable gaap measure omitting comparable gaap measures from an earnings release headline or caption that includes nongaap measures presenting a full income statement of nongaap measures or presenting a full nongaap income statement when reconciling nongaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures providing discussion and analysis of a nongaap measure without a similar discussion and analysis of the comparable gaap measure in a location with equal or greater prominence to mitigate risk of noncompliance issuers that plan to present nongaap financial measures in their earnings releases may need to modify their disclosure practices chair white strongly urged issuers to consider the updated guidance and “revisit their approach to nongaap disclosures” although the sec is uberfocused on earnings releases with this new guidance the sec also urges issuers to uphold these new guidelines in their nonearnings edgar filed shareholder communications such as in presentations to investors and analysts annual reports and ir websites issuers should communicate with shareholders in a consistent manner – the stock narrative told outside of the sec filings should be the same as the narrative found within in the issuer’s sec filings by now hopefully iros have had indepth conversations with their corporate securities lawyers niri members should listen to the educational webinar share

the wall street journal ran an article titled companies forgot about mom­and­pop investors …until now you can read it hereif you are subscribed last thursday’s virtualinvestorconferencescom event brought  investors online to listen to ceo’s as well as to an education breakout session on the impact of brexit for individual investors during these online roadshow presentations over  questions were asked by investors directly to ceos does this type of activity fit the grant woodesque “momandpop” narrative no it does not – nor has it ever since we launched our online nondeal roadshow portal in   conferences ago since then we’ve had k plus investors login and pose questions to hundreds of companies ranging from megacap to new generation rega registrants what we have experienced since  we refer to this audience as individual investors or if feeling casual “main street” investors juxtaposed to “wall street” we dropped the label “retail investors” as it implied a “shopping mentality” rather than a strategic persona we changed the name of the portal from “retailinvstorconferences… to virtualinvestorconfeences to demonstrate the leveling of all investors since  our exclusive study of “how investors consume investor relations content” has received  unique answers from individual investors you can request the  report here a major stock exchange and a global adr bank both recognizing the impact any investor can have on a stock use our portal to bring their listed clients to the online investing public in defense of the wsj their article was great it spoke about how individual investors can be a critical constituency during a contested proxy battle it reinforces the point that even though main street investors are a small percentage of your holding parties taking a small effort to build a relationship with them may save management individual investors generally vote with management looking for a smart example of corporate dedication towards individual

july    leave a comment from a simple marketing perspective an investor relations website is not dissimilar to a trade show booth you never know when a prospect is going to walk by and make a purely visceral judgment in the case of an institutional investor it must be a surfacelevel emotional “kickingofthetires’ as they already have access to all your past performance data as well as indepth analysts’ reports they want to understand how you represent your “financial brand” combine this information with the first question in our study and there is no question about the need to have an ir

social media control – but of consistency posted on july     comment  this is more of an update rather than a core discussion by now investor relations have expressed their collective “meh” for using social media with any of the verve demonstrated by their comrades on pr or marketing teams mostly the ir consensus is that their audience is not using social media as a corporate information point the attitude often written in this blog towards ir and social media has been steadfast it’s a tile in the mosaic of shareholder communications to keep on the topic from the headline above this discussion hits on the sec’s  guidance accepting social media as a reg fd disclosure point this month there are two wrinkles that have impact on “if” social media is a tool in a corporate disclosure policy facebook… …has adjusted their algorithm “to help make sure you don’t miss the friends and family posts you are likely to care about we put those posts toward the top of your news feed” this means any consistent posting to facebook is effectively annulled facebook is not a linear timebased news feed you can never prevent – or confirm – that investor a is not seeing your news before investor b this may not be selective disclosure by intent but is it rather flibberty jibberty yahoofinance… …has removed twitter and stocktwits from their newly designed portal this is disappointing for a few reasons  the sheer amount of cashtagged traffic of your news and shareholdershared discussions will noticeably drop our weekly ipo traffic has already experienced that as we use cashtags weekly the “conversations” although labeled with a social media cashtag seem to simply be the yahoo chat boards – which as always are ripe with unmonitored pumpanddump… …which stocktwits did not allow in their feed in fact they proactively police their feedportal their members are passionate daytraders not pumpers  neither of these two points will have any meaningful impact on most ir teams however it does clearly demonstrate that social media platforms are independent businesses – and their businesses are not interested in consistent – not to mention simultaneous – disclosure of material information to

kinda sorta posted on july    leave a comment excellent recap of reg a in the wsj “according to the securities and exchange commission  companies had filed to raise a total of  billion under reg a as of early june of those  offerings seeking to raise a total of  million have qualified to raise funds and just a few have actually completed their offerings the low tally highlights some of the challenges that small companies continue to face as well as the jobs act’s limited progress in achieving its objectives but the weak market for initial public offerings hasn’t helped   among the biggest problems for the companies trying to raise funds is that they aren’t prepared for the amount of marketing needed to attract a big enough pool of potential investors” that last paragraph is the most germane to this blog vintage is the  reg a filing agent by far we’ve seen our share of companies file their a… and many have yet to meet their expectations and that word – expectations – is certainly where the problem may lay rega is just a year old to imagine seasoned “players” to walk out of the corn is not the expectation to set rega is not the new shell or reverse merger… there is no “getrichquick” path here it’s called a miniipo for a simple reason – it requires the same business fortitude found with traditional ipo form s event that said let’s look at a year by the numbers  companies  billion  offerings qualified a few have actually completed their offerings  companies is one every  business days  raised every business day that seems like great progress for a oneyearold   it’s much too soon to judge a “completion” rate – as he vast amount of variables that propel any company’s success is vast marketing management products and promise but the top of the funnel is strong coincidentally ahem one company that is the poster child for reg a success is presenting live today to an audience of live online investors at virtualinvestorconferencescom elio motors has put

baseball metaphors a reg a filing was not built to be a home run at best it’s a base hit – and management needs to work diligently to bring the “miniipo” runner home base by base communication by

regulations marketing and investor relations twin sons of different mothers posted on july    leave a comment we recently published a whitepaper discussing what in marketing parlance is called “earned” media generally speaking earned media is news mentions social media shares  reposts and services reviews this is always placed in discussion alongside paid media ads etc and owned media corporate website etc for marketing a company earns “earned” by creating great content blogs infographics videos press releases webinar and whitepapers that their audience proactively share a simple and artery damaging example is when you liked and shared that video recipe for buffalo chicken stuffed baked potato skins recipe in facebook how does this relate to investor relations in context to “content” investor relations departments are the quintessential content marketers– specifically because they cannot embellish from the facts at all they cannot buy ads paid media promising benefits what ir does is tell their corporate story – generally by offering a mosaic of facts past performance introduce the drivers senior management and then sit back and hope the customer the investor buys let’s compare the tools in our marketing whitepaper two graphs illustrated what  cmos told us about the effectiveness of their communications lead generation and brand building  as you see a lot of stuff in the marketing mosaic what is obvious is that the marketing tools deemed most effective by cmos – upper right quadrant – are the same tools that iros have always used this became very apparent when the marketing vocabulary is replaced with ir vocabulary the charts with the orange dots are the original marketing charts clicking on any of the four charts will enlarge them same chart with superimposed ir vocabulary extra stuff removed same chart with superimposed ir vocabulary extra stuff removed the mosaic theory is not new to ir it is newer to us product marketers mostly as social media has given us a stronger opportunity to build our own publishing network in balance with existing traditional channels thank you interwebs if you are interested in what media your investors favor i suggest this whitepaper and yes i appreciate the irony of this earned media in a blog about earned media share thistwitterfacebooklinkedin leave a comment posted in investor relations how to engage with investors in the age of the activist dealing with ceo compensation posted on july    leave a comment investors have learned that it pays to be aggressive when it comes to boardroom fights as a result companies are preparing for activist campaigns well in advance this is part five of a series read part four question  publishing ceo compensation and its ratio to “regular employees” goes into effect next year what risks – and subsequent mitigation – are you expecting to address lex suvanto  first of all ceo compensation already gets a lot of scrutiny for companies with management teams that are paid high salaries or salaries that are much higher than peer companies they get a lot of attention – it’s a big reputational issue the new rule regarding the ratio of ceo pay to employee pay isn’t going to put ceo compensation into the limelight all of a sudden because it already is in the limelight the ratio is going to make it more so however and it is going to make it easier to compare companies applestoapples it’s also going to give stakeholder groups and constituents such as employees and labor groups more ammunition for negotiations and generating media attention i think ceos and boards are going to be more sensitive as a result of this rule they are probably going to use it as an opportunity to think more carefully about how they communicate this information and what the substantiation is for it kai haakon e liekefett  like many practitioners i think this rule is a very good example of a wellmeant regulation that causes nothing but an enormous amount of work and a significant waste of money when you calculate the amount of money that corporate america is going to spend on this you’d be shocked companies will have to determine what a “regular employee” is and while that’s easy when you have  employees it is much more challenging when you have  employees worldwide on very different compensation scales you also need to figure out what you count as compensation for both the ceo and employees it’s an enormous calculation that will cost millions for large companies and the output is an arbitrary number that says    something like that which is going to be used primarily for one reason – for activists to argue that the ceo is overpaid activists are all over this and will use it to undermine the credibility of management in their pursuit of profit chris ruggieri  one certainty when it comes to the ceo compensation ratio is that there will be some stark differences between industries if you take an industry like fast food where you have a lot of entrylevel jobs you’re going to have a much bigger multiple than in certain other industries so like any type of data it has to be interpreted – you have to put the number in context it will provide additional information in the marketplace however  just like with the “say on pay” rule people will be looking for outliers and if they see them it will begin to stimulate some discussion i suspect you will have some kneejerk reactions and outrage over certain multiples that appear to be very high on the other hand the board should be asking questions if they observe differences between companies in their industry peer group it’s like any information – you’re going to analyze it and if you notice trends or differences it’s going to cause you to ask questions i think it is incumbent upon executive management and the board to be mindful of that jason m halper  one of the main risks regarding the ceo compensation ratio is the question of whether to provide additional narrative around the disclosure you are permitted to do so under the sec rule but if you do provide additional narrative you need to be careful not to make any false or misleading statements you also need to consider whether you’re opening up a further can of worms by devoting more pages to it since the rule is not in effect yet companies don’t know how they’re going to compare with their peers so there is a lot of uncertainty regarding whether to put narrative around it – you have to be careful at least in the first year you do it initially i think any optional disclosure would be on the side of explaining the elements that led to the number so for a company that has many seasonal workers for instance that may drive the ratio higher that is a factbased disclosure that could be made as opposed to a more qualitative or highlevel disclosure   share thistwitterfacebooklinkedin leave a comment posted in investor relations ← older posts newer posts → follow compliance
