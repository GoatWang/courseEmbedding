legal spending emphasizes the push for intelligent value posted on february     comment  in  corporate legal spending increased for the second straight year according to a new survey the study also reported that increased or changing regulatory requirements is the top challenge general counsel face huron legal’s annual law department benchmarking survey found that on average corporate legal department spend rose  percent in  down from ’s  percent increase bret baccus managing director of consilio which owns huron legal said he expects “…legal spend will likely decline because there are now more programs in place within corporate law departments to help manage budgets and reduce legal spend those programs include mattermanagement ebilling technology increased use of alternative fee agreements that achieve cost predictability and increased collaboration between law departments and law firms” in context to the study liam power president of vintage emphasizes the importance of cost predictability for inside counsel as well as their supporting securities law firms “eliminating legal overspending on the finite service of regulatory sec compliance is a number one reason for our continued growth and why we were ranked a top three provider in  along with merrill and rr donnelley a key attribute for delivering what we titled ‘intelligent value’ – fast turns and spoton execution – is cost predictability… our transparent billing practices no surprise fees when the job is done i am often amazed at how much time inside counsel save by not having to sort out complex invoices or explain unexpected increases” finished power from bloomberg amar sarwal vice president and chief legal strategist at the association of corporate counsel said the costcutting measures the report cited mirror what he’s seen in the industry chief executive officers and chief financial officers are ordering acrosstheboard reductions and law departments are responding to renewed scrutiny “there’s a ruthless search for inefficiencies to root through no doubt about it” sarwal said “i don’t think lawyers are immune from those pressures” share thistwitterfacebooklinkedin  comment posted in vintage the workflow of creating an earnings release posted on february    leave a comment now that we’re past the bulk of this season’s earnings a view of how these disclosures get created is warranted the points below don’t discuss what is in a release but more who internally gets to participate in the workflow additionally although the timeframe of the process is not defined below it begins the day after the previous quarter’s release is sent you’ll certainly have a ton of “fresh input” and “constructive criticism” to consider step one iro the cycle begins with the investor relations department that team will be responsible for directional navigation of the release and of course its complete execution drafting of initial messaging define the overall “tone  tenor” assemble all supportive data and documents coordinate the editing and review workflow   step two internal teams these internal resources may supply the data and discussions to fill out the quarter’s narrative for shareholders sales management important  material deals sector  client perspectives fee structure  macroeconomic factors technology rd discussions industry directions technical descriptions product development new

quarter to quarter reporting consistency reconciling gaap v nongaap   step four the csuite this is a final “the buck stops here” review  sarbanesoxley regulation has made the ceo and the cfo both personally responsible for the content they both need to be  clear and confident on each word and number they are signing a sec document confirming their understanding   step five iro send to pr

understanding “plain english” when filing with the sec posted on february    leave a comment the irony of the sec defining “plain english” is not lost on me read any regulation our annual guidebooks are great for that and you’ll understand that said regulations are complex for the protection of both issuer and investor it’s not the most transparent version of english however here is how plain english is defined for proxy materials per rule d under the securities act presentation of information in prospectuses to enhance the readability of the prospectus you must use plain english principles in the organization language and design of the front and back cover pages the summary and the risk factors section you must draft the language in these sections so that at a minimum it substantially complies with each of the following plain english writing principles short sentences definite concrete everyday words active voice tabular presentation or bullet lists for complex material whenever possible no legal jargon or highly technical business terms no multiple negatives in designing these sections or other sections of the prospectus you may include pictures logos charts graphs or other design elements so long as the design is not misleading and the required information is clear you are encouraged to use tables schedules charts and graphic illustrations of the results of operations balance sheet or other financial data that present the data in an understandable manner any presentation must be consistent with the financial statements and nonfinancial information in the prospectus you must draw the graphs and charts to scale any information you provide must not be misleading if you’re  designing your proxy materials and have any visual questions ask your vintage representative to see past samples of our work if you have vocabulary questions – ask your securities lawyer x share thistwitterfacebooklinkedin leave a comment posted in sec regulations investor relations to increase focus on retail investor by  in  posted on february    leave a comment each year those of us in the trenches of shareholder communications look forward to bny mellon’s global trends in investor relations a survey analysis of ir practices worldwide this year the study slicesanddices responses from  public companies working out of  countries… pinpointing uptodate trends in investor relations the full  report is available here one area they annually benchmark is ir’s appetite for communicating with individual investors note i tend to use the pc term “individual” rather than “retail” either term encompasses any stakeholder longterm or daytrader that buys and sells equities themselves it does not include pumpanddumpers there is no pc word for them guys from bny mellon  net  is a meaningful amount of increased desire to identify and court individual investors this could be a factor why virtual investor conferences click here has had such a stellar february we have had  online nondeal roadshows viewed in our platform so far this month another prominent indicator of the growing importance of individual investors is that both the otc markets and deutsche bank dr group regularly use our environment to connect their issuers directly with active investors proudly we’re in our th year with these conferences one last adjacent factor for virtual events may be the actual decline in the number of physical nondeal roadshows companies are holding the average number of brokerdriven roadshow days has declined from ’s  days down to just  days in  although that is one less week of roadshow traveldays for a ceo and senior executives the number of oneonone meetings have increased by thirty meetings – unknown amount of actual days safe to assume several meetings in one day certainly virtual roadshows are very useful for “prequalifying” these oneonones no planes or limos needed share thistwitterfacebooklinkedin leave a comment posted in
