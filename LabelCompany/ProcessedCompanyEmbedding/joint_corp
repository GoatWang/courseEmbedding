growth for small businesses by armand aponte share on google plus share on facebook savvy business owners looking to expand their revenue channels will keep a watchful eye for opportunities leading to growth profitability and additional market share amongst the various growth strategies available some business owners may want to consider a joint venture although joint ventures are often associated with large companies or international deals if used under the right circumstances they can be effective for small business owners as well key elements of a joint venture a joint venture is created when two or more established businesses agree to pool their resources and respective talents to achieve a particular goal typically joint ventures are formed for a limited period of time in order to accomplish a specific business goal you create a joint venture by entering into a contract with another business or party there is no formal state or federal filing required under a joint venture arrangement each party contributes cash property assets or other resources to the business venture and then the parties agree on how profits losses management and control of the venture will be divided although a joint venture shares many of the same characteristics as a partnership the key difference is that a joint venture is based on a single business transaction for a limited time period whereas a partnership usually involves a longterm ongoing business relationship there are two ways to set up a joint venture one option is for two businesses to agree to join forces and cooperate with each other in a limited and specific way for example one business might want to sell its product through another company’s distribution network the two companies would enter into a contract setting out the terms and conditions of how this would work alternatively two businesses might decide to set up a separate and independent business to handle the joint venture work or project for example two business owners might decide to form a corporation limited liability company or partnership to produce and sell a new product through their joint arrangement however you decide to set up your joint venture you will need a clear legal agreement setting out how the joint venture will work benefits  risks of a joint venture businesses often decide to enter into a joint venture because they believe that combining resources with another business will lead to better growth and profitability than either business could achieve operating on its own some of the benefits that businesses can provide to each other in a joint venture arrangement include access to new markets and distribution channels added specialized expertise and resources including research and development and additional financing and purchasing power by taking advantage of another business’s strength in an area where your business is weak and offering a complementary benefit to the other business a joint venture arrangement can be beneficial to both businesses for example if you have a product you want to sell but no sales force or presence in that market you could establish a joint venture with a business that has an existing distribution channel or sales force capable of reaching customers for your product through the joint venture arrangement you immediately gain access to customers and expand your market presence without having to hire a sales force take on debt seek outside investors or otherwise commit your own resources in turn having a new product to market to an existing customer base is a complementary benefit that you provide to the other company joint ventures are also useful where there are licenses and regulatory requirements to do business a standard hurdle for companies trying to access foreign markets a joint venture allows the business trying to access a regulated market to leverage another business’s established presence without having to go through the licensing and regulatory paperwork that would otherwise be required a potentially enormous benefit to the party trying to gain access to that market as good as this may sound even under ideal circumstances there are risks with starting a joint venture business partnerships are complicated be realistic about your expectations and think about whether this type of arrangement is the best option for you you will want to make sure that your joint venture partner complements your own business strengths and weaknesses and that you offer something to the other business as well performing a swot strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats analysis can help identify potential areas where you might want to align your resources with another firm you can also look at what other similar businesses have done and try to identify what they did to partner successfully finding the right fit takes time and effort but is a crucial step in the process while something may look good on paper don’t underestimate the importance of a good working relationship to the ultimate success of your venture tips for success success in a joint venture depends on thorough research and an analysis of the joint venture’s aims and objectives and the parties involved in the transaction ultimately the joint venture must be beneficial for both parties to succeed here are some tips for success ensure the goals and expectations of the venture are clear and agreed to by all parties balance levels of expertise and investment contributed by the different parties identify and integrate cultures and management styles of the partnering firms provide sufficient leadership and support particularly in the early stages and make sure the staff and everyone involved understands the purpose of the joint venture joint venture agreement like any business transaction the terms and conditions of your joint venture should be clearly laid out in a written agreement key provisions in a joint venture agreement should include the business objectives of the joint venture the structure of the joint venture whether it will be a separately formed enterprise or operated through the existing businesses each party’s contributions to the venture including cash property or asset contributions management and control of the joint venture how profits losses and liabilities will be shared the role of employees in the joint venture how intellectual property created by the joint venture will be treated dispute mechanism between the parties its duration or procedures to terminate the joint venture and a confidentiality clause to protect any commercial secrets a formal contract is necessary for all parties’ protection and to make sure everyone understands the terms and conditions of the venture

determines that there is no genuine issue of material fact to be tried and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law see rule c fedrcivp anderson v liberty lobby inc  us   sct   ledd   the substantive law governing the case identifies those facts that are material on a motion for summary judgment see anderson  us at   sct at  a court must grant summary judgment if the pleadings depositions answers to interrogatories and admissions on file together with affidavits if any show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact  rule c see miner v glens falls  fd

was at all times during his relationship with jmpc an individual resident of texas doing business as surgical specialist with his principal place of business in houston texas see defs stat mat facts about which there is no genuine issue hereinafter defs stat ¶  until jmpc merged with j  j in  it was a delaware corporation authorized to do business in connecticut with its principal place of business in stamford connecticut see id ¶  prior to its merger with j  j jmpc sold human joint replacement devices to hospitals and surgeons see aff c anthony whittingham hereinafter whittingham aff ¶  its principal product was a totalhip prothesis for use in partial or total hip joint replacement surgery id jmpc marketed its products through a network of independent distributors who were assigned a territory and compensated on a commission basis see id ¶  these distributors did not purchase jmpc products for resale see id ¶  rather they maintained an inventory of jmpc products on a consignment basis id when a distributor sold a product jmpc would bill the customer based on paperwork submitted by the distributor and then pay the distributor a commission id in november  forbes began selling jmpcs prosthetic hip and knee implants to hospitals and surgeons for use in knee and hip replacement surgery see aff larry d forbes hereinafter forbes aff ¶  these products were particularly wellsuited for revision surgery in which the product is used to replace a previously inserted implant that has worn out over time id jmpc initially assigned forbes to the san antonio texas area but by  his territory included southeast texas and southwest louisiana see whittingham aff ¶  every year forbes received new quotas for his territory and signed a new distributor agreement see id ¶  according to the  agreement which forbes signed on february   jmpc had the right to terminate its relationship with forbes at any time it stated the distributor agreement is for an indefinite term is at the will of each of the parties to it and jmpc has the right to recall all consigned inventory and terminate the distributor agreement at any time first am compl ex  at  the agreement further provided that if jmpc merged with another company it would allow distributors in good standing to continue selling under the current agreement for a specified number of months depending on how long the distributor had been employed by jmpc see id at  the agreement specified that any disputes arising under it would be governed by the law of the state of connecticut see id at  stating that by entering into the distributor agreement the distributor stipulates to jurisdiction of the courts in the state of connecticut over any dispute between jmpc and the distributor on april   jmpc notified forbes that it had agreed to merge with j  j and that unless notified otherwise  all  present agreements will remain in effect first am compl ex b then by letter dated july   jmpc terminated forbess distributor agreement and offered him an additional six months to continue selling its products ie until january   see id ex c on september   forbes commenced this law suit discussion in count one forbes alleges that jmpc terminated his alleged franchise agreement without good cause in violation of conn genstat § e see first am compl count one in count three he alleges that this termination of the agreement breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing the defendants claim that summary judgment should enter as to counts one and three because while connecticut law governs this dispute the connecticut franchise act the act is not applicable to individuals such as forbes who do not maintain a place of business in connecticut the court agrees the act prohibits franchisors from inter alia canceling or failing to renew a franchise agreement without good cause see conn genstat § fa however the act only applies to a franchise agreement the performance of which contemplates or requires the franchisee to establish or maintain a place of business in this state conn genstat ann § h west  forbes argues that the provision in the distributor agreement which states that connecticut law shall apply to any disputes arising from the agreement affords him the protections of the act he claims that the parties included a clause stating that connecticut law applied to potential future disputes because they specifically contemplated that the act would apply to their franchise agreement however without deciding whether forbes was actually a franchisee as defined by the act a fair reading of both the act itself and the case law interpreting it lead the court to conclude that only franchisees who have established or maintained a place of business in connecticut are covered by the act forbes did not maintain a place of business in connecticut under the parties agreement jmpc assigned him a territory in texas thus the performance of his agreement with jmpc did not contemplate or require the franchisee to establish or maintain a place of business in connecticut conn genstat ann § h west  the provision of the agreement which states that connecticut law applies to future disputes merely governs which states laws applies to such disputes not whether the jurisdictional prerequisites of a specific statute have been satisfied a plain reading of the act reveals that it does not protect forbes because his agreement with jmpc did not contemplate or require that he maintain a business in connecticut furthermore it is doubtful that the connecticut franchise law applies extraterritorially hj inc v itt corp  fd   th cir citing carlos v philips bus sys inc  fsupp   edny holding the act does not have extraterritorial effect the court can find no authority supporting the proposition that the act was intended to protect franchisees outside of connecticut id rather the act only applies to connecticut franchisees who present evidence that they contemplated establishing or maintaining a place of business in connecticut see auto parks inc v stanley works civ a no   wl  at  edpa july   without such evidence the act is inapplicable id here the evidence shows and the parties do not dispute that forbes maintained his business and conducted his marketing activity in texas cf chemtek inc v general motors corp  fsupp  dconn holding that the act was applicable to an alleged franchisee who maintained its place of business in connecticut regardless of where the franchisee focussed its marketing activity thus forbes is not covered by the act and summary judgment must enter as to count one as to count three forbes argues that because a franchise relationship existed between forbes and jmpc jmpcs termination of forbes in violation of the franchise act was also a violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing pls opp defs mot summ j at  he claims that the provisions in the distributor agreement which state that the agreement is terminable at the will of the parties or if jmpc merges with another company do not trump the provisions of the act which state that a franchise agreement may not be terminated without good cause see id at  however because the court has held that forbes is not protected by the provisions of the act this count must also fail in addition there is nothing in the record to contradict the specific provisions of the distributor agreement which allow jmpc to terminate forbes if it merges with another company accordingly summary judgment must also enter as to count three conclusion for the foregoing reasons the defendants motion for summary judgment doc   is granted forbes is directed to file an amended complaint within thirty  days of this ruling which shall include only counts two
