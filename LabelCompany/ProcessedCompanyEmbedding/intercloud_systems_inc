their ceo mark munro again “for healthcare organizations network vulnerability can quickly become an issue of life and death traditional perimeterbased network protection solutions are efficient today but do not provide the necessary level of protection due to the complex nature of health care networks and vulnerable applications our product provides an automated way to segment survey and protect a healthcare facility and hospital campus not only from the outside threats but also from the internal networking objects already penetrated by hackers” xbarrier is a part of intercloud’s group of network management and automation products for nextgen software defined networks sdn and legacy network environments xbarrier targets the network security vulnerability of the healthcare vertical according to the company xbarrier utilizes a new approach to network threat detection which is based on machine learning ml and artificial intelligence ai analysis of network connection data

selflearning approach to data analysis and constantly adjusts its detection models intercloud systems inc otcmktsicldd is coming back down to earth a little bit and that is probably because traders
