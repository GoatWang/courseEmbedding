please find an excerpt below view this special report recent wall street transcript special reports ernest s pinner chairman president and chief executive officer of centerstate banks inc began his banking career at  at state bank of haines city while attending high school in haines city fla after graduation from the university of florida and at  he became president of the bank which eventually was acquired by first union national bank at first union mr pinner served as area president over five counties in central florida after retiring from first union he established the first centerstate bank in april  currently centerstate operates through two subsidiary banks with a branch network in  counties throughout central florida mr pinner is active on the polk state college board of trustees and the polk state college foundation he is a past member of the board of governors of the polk museum of art and the imperial symphony orchestra he is a past director of the heart of florida educational foundation and the polk county industrial development authority in  he was chosen one of the ten best industryloved bank ceos by thestreet publication twst please begin with a historical sketch of this company that will put centerstate banks into context what do you see as its business today mr pinner centerstate banks csfl is a consolidation of a group of small florida community banks that merged around  previously there were three banks that had been individually chartered and operating prior to that time but they had kinsmanship by way of the chairman and the board i knew all the bankers and was previously involved with them for years at the time when i left first union we chartered a new bank and agreed to form a multibank holding company together that would be publicly traded we merged the three banks into the new holding company around  later we merged the new bank into the holding company today it is basically that holding company with two banks the lead bank which is about a  billion company and one other small  million bank we had acquired both banks will be merged in the next few months and it will become one bank owned by a publicly traded florida multibank holding company we function as a community bank in the center part of the state of florida with correspondent offices in alabama georgia and north carolina we operate the business day to day as if it is locally oriented locally owned and locally controlled in each of these communities the vision is to continue to grow this company with a goal to be  billion in the next three to five years were pursuing that goal aggressively twst what are some of the key trends or issues the banking industry particularly community banks are facing today that you believe will have an impact on centerstate over the next few years mr pinner i think the one that jumps off the page is all the new financial compliance rules that are coming via doddfrank and similar new rules in my opinion its going to be very hard for a community bank that is not at least  million in size to be able to survive financially over the next few years when you consider there are new costs being forced on us for compliance reasons it is just going to be financially unrewarding to be a small bank i am not sure investors when considering roe will rush in to invest in small banks this theory could vary geographically although i am of the opinion its probably countrywide i think it is more difficult in some of the areas like the southeast where weve just gone through this tremendous real estate bubble so youve got the credit issue thats hindering banks and then compounded with the compliance issues and the cost its going to be difficult for small community banks to survive and provide an acceptable return to their investors unless one merges or consolidates so a size can be attained that allows better competition at one time there were six banks in this company and we saw the need for consolidation and began to merge over the last three years there is a need to be a larger bank yet we still try to deliver customer service as small bank customers expect and deserve twst would you think of a largescale economic demographic or public policy factor in addition to doddfrank that may affect centerstate in the next few years mr pinner in florida the credit issue is still going to be very difficult to manage this business cycle has been a major recession that in my opinion is a balancesheet recession not a pampl recession a pampl recession can allow one to bounce back fairly quickly but when you destroy peoples balance sheets thats a longterm healing process so i think for the next three to five years the credit cost associated with the past real estate bubble that continues to push itself through the southeast and especially florida is going to be a major impact on small community banks the remainder of this  page us banking report an investor can be
