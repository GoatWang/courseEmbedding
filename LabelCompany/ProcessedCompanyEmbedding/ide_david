modelmost people think that the business of businesses is making money and while profit is at the heart of entrepreneurship in many cases a business can be about so much moretake the example of ide’s wholly owned subsidiary hydrologic in cambodia untreated water and poor sanitation cause an estimated  million cases of diarrhea and  deaths each year mostly in rural areas among children under the age of five after talking with those rural customers ide launched a program in  to introduce affordable water treatment options for years the program operated on a partial costrecovery basis using revenue generated from water filter sales to cover production and distribution costs and using grants to cover marketing and backoffice costs however by  it was clear that the program had potential to operate sustainably as a private enterprise but what business would be interested in manufacturing distributing and selling water filters to the most rural and poorest segments of the populationbridging the “last mile”hydrologic’s directsales approach saves rural families the time and expense of traveling to a store to buy water filters rather sales agents visit communities to conduct group presentations and take orders they return a few days later to deliver the productphoto by david grahamidesometimes ide identifies existing enterprises to work with but in this case it was necessary to create something new before ide began the water filter program no business sold an affordable water treatment system as ide considered how to convert our program into a business several options came to light includingtransferring ownership to a cooperative consisting of program staffselling the business to an entrepreneur through a bidding processtraining and equipping a number of smallscale ceramic enterprises to produce and distribute filterstransitioning operations to an autonomous social enterprisemultiple factors influenced the decision in favor of the social enterprise approach one was the general low level of development of the existing ceramics industry in cambodia because the water filters were a healthrelated product quality control was of the utmost importance production and distribution functions were complex and had to be able to scale effectively finally the business needed to intrinsically protect consumer interests as there was not a strong regulatory environmentthe social enterprise approach was deemed the most practical option for achieving sustainability while maintaining positive social impactas of  hydrologic was formally registered in cambodia as a wholly owned subsidiary of ide hydrologic expanded its production capacity established a rural sales force partnered with a microfinance institution and became certified to generate and sell carbon credits the enterprise  became profitable in  and has remained so each year sinceto date hydrologic has sold over 4 water filters because more than  percent of its customers earn less than  a day the ability to finance the cost of the system has been integral to hydrologic’s success since  hydrologic has facilitated  filter loans worth  million with a repayment rate of more than  percent  photo by david grahamidemuch more than the profit hydrologic delivers benefits in improved health income environment and gender equity dramatically improving the lives of over two million
