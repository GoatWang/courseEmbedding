afterwards a warehouse was built which housed a small dining room that catered to market men and the crews of ships anchored in boston harbor around  years ago one of the customers eldridge park bought the restaurant with local merchants john durgin and john chandler although both mr durgin and mr park died with in a few years of purchasing the restaurant their partner retained their memory by naming it durginpark mr chandler spent the next  years running durginpark with his son and grandson jerry chandler when jerry was killed in wwii the restaurant was sold to james hallett who put the poem just a boy on the back of the menu to honor jerry and all the fallen soldiers of that war it remains there to this day james hallett and his infamous staff of playfully shorttempered waitresses served the freshest fish meats and produce one could find in boston not to mention the famous boston baked beans in  he sold durginpark to the kelleysolimondo family who toned down the waitresses to
