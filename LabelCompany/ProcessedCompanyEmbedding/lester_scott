lesterscottcarilloncom lester scotts articles maintaining the human touch in hospitality by lester scott managing director carillon miami beach coming up in the august online hotel business review  feature focus food  beverage multiplicity and diversity are key the challenge for hotel food and beverage operations is to serve the personal tastes and needs of an increasingly diverse population and at the same time to keep up with everevolving industry trends in order to accomplish this restaurateurs and hoteliers have to flex their creative muscles and pull out all the stops to satisfy their various audiences one way to achieve this is to utilize existing food spaces in multiple ways at different times of the day lunch can be casual and fast while dinnertime can be more formal and slower paced the same restaurant can offer counter service by day but provide table service by night with a completely different menu and atmosphere changes in music lighting uniforms and tabletop design contribute to its transformation this multi purpose approach seeks to meet the dining needs of guests as they change throughout the day today�s restaurants also have to go to great lengths to fulfill all the diverse dietary preferences of their guests the popularity of plantbased paleo vegan and gluten and allergenfree diets means that traditional menus must evolve from proteinheavy carbloaded offerings to those featuring more vegetables and legumes chefs are doing creative things with vegetables such as experimenting with global cuisines or incorporating new vegetable hybrids into their dishes another trend is an emphasis on bold and creative flavors from chili oil to sriracha to spicy maple syrup entrees desserts and beverages are all being enhanced with spice and heat the august issue of the hotel business review will document the trends and challenges in the food and beverage sector and report on what some leading hotels are doing to enhance this area of their business

haven for sun seekers carillon miami beach is a member of the leading hotels of the world and leading spas carillon miami beach is a portfolio company of z capital partners llc would you talk about the heritage of carillon miami beach the property made its debut as the beautiful carillon hotel in 5 it was iconic back in its day with regular guests including the rat pack who would hang out and have improv performances at the tambourine bar and lounge in the mids it transitioned into more of a modern hotel until it was acquired by lehman brothers to create the canyon ranch which was a health and wellness destination z capital partners acquired the property in january 05 after canyon ranch struggled to find themselves in the miami area taking the property back to its original name and the grandeur that went with it we have infused a new spirit into carillon miami beach that celebrates the resort’s past in a retro style fit for today’s luxury traveler this spring we will begin a renovation to bring back some of carillon’s iconic 5 features including the tambourine bar and lounge where our signature cocktail will be something frank sinatra himself would sip on a carillon beachfront room how valuable is having an allsuite product we’re very fortunate to have the largest room product of any hotel in the area offering 50 one and twobedroom suites which range between  and  square feet our spacious suites feature a sleek modern design and are outfitted with amenities that allow guests to have the comforts of home in a lavish oceanfront setting complementing our spacious accommodations is the carillon’s squarefoot private beach – one of the largest in miami in addition to our allsuite style accommodations what really makes the carillon unique is our health and wellness component we have medical doctors on staff as well as exercise physiologists and nutritionists who lead lecture series on health wellness nutrition healthy living and longevity we have personal trainers on staff the largest spa on the east coast with  treatments rooms and 0 square feet of fitness and spa space the carillon sunrise pool what makes for a successful food and beverage component and does the restaurant need to tie them into the health and wellness theme an essential component of the carillon miami beach’s rebrand project was the opening of thyme tying into the project’s vision to revive the carillon name the inspiration of thyme links directly to the carillon’s symbolic meaning of “turning the hands of time” led by worldrenowned executive chef fritz zwahlen guests can enjoy fine dining with a menu that features a progressive take on american cuisine with fresh seasonal ingredients with a slight asian influence in addition we strive to create experiences that enable guests to look better feel better and live better through wellness offerings menus and programs focused on mindfulness nutrition and overall lifestyle improvements how critical has it been to attract the staff and to implement the right training with an overall goal to create the best lifestyle hotel in the miami area we train our staff with a focus on delivering personalized service since launching our new employee training six months ago we have watched our employee retention rate grow tremendously and our tripadvisor scores rise to number two out of 06 hotels when this opportunity presented itself did you know it was a good fit and what excited you about taking it on when the opportunity to join the carillon miami beach team presented itself i was busy overseeing the capella operations in china i never envisioned the day i would leave capella however after meeting with z capital and gaining insight about the carillon i knew this was a fantastic project that i had to be a part of with the carillon we are creating a brand not just one hotel through this new role i am able to use my expertise and passion to make an impact on the hospitality industry with a focus on personalized service we created the carillon brand’s pillars hotel health and wellness culinary and residential using these pillars as the fundamental components we have plans to recreate the carillon’s signature experience worldwide we recently bought a second hotel in switzerland located in a thriving ski area with strong historical ties to the region – the perfect sister hotel to carillon miami beach has your role become more about finance and how do you avoid losing the hospitality piece in the past we never saw the true hotel owner on a regular basis the evolution now is that the owner is more present they may live at the hotel or in the same city allowing them to have a stronger involvement with the daytoday operations like any business the owner wants the strongest return on their investment to achieve this most hoteliers lead their teams with a businessminded management style focusing on sales investors and other outside factors i prefer to lead the carillon differently focusing on the guest first we want to make sure that every visitor we touch intends to return to the carillon or will recommend us to their friends and family by establishing a personal connection with our guests this allows us to maximize the customer spending willingly on the products and services we offer i personally stand in the lobby and talk with guests and i encourage my employees to engage with the customer throughout every touch point• click here to download a pdf of an interview with lester l scott managing director carillon miami beach see other features from
