editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member library worldwide smallpox virus is considered one of the most significant threats for use as a biowarfare agent due to complications from vaccination mass immunization of the populace is contraindicated our current research seeks to develop effective antipoxvirus drugs using vaccinia virus vv as a model system the goal of our currently funded work is to determine whether the l cysteine proteinase or the l metalloproteinase encoded by vv is the pox virus core protein proteinase vcpp that is essential for viral maturation and production of infectious progeny we have recently demonstrated that the l cysteine proteinase is the vcpp byrd et al  and will continue to study the role of this enzyme during virus growth given this information however we are also positioned to launch a concerted effort to identify and develop l inhibitors as candidate antiviral drugs the specific goals of the experiments outlined in this report are to  overexpress and purify enzymaticallyactive l proteins  develop both biochemical and tissue culture assays to measure l activity  utilize a combination of rational drug design and high throughput screening procedures to identify potential l inhibitors and  to test candidate inhibitors for their ability to inhibit poxvirus replication in infected cells and appropriate animal models successful completion of these experiments will identify l inhibitors that can be advanced into preclinical and clinical development as antiviral drugs such drugs will be an essential addition to our pharmaceutical armamentarium against the deliberate or accidental introduction of a pathogenic poxvirus into our environment in order to protect members of the armed forces or the general populace evaluation of orally delivered st as postexposure prophylactic and antiviral therapeutic in an aerosolized rabbitpox rabbit model  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide orthopoxviruses such as variola and monkeypox viruses can cause severe disease in humans when delivered by the aerosol route and thus represent significant threats to both military and civilian populations currently there are no antiviral therapies approved by the us food and drug administration fda to treat smallpox or monkeypox infection in this study we showed that administration of the antiviral compound st to rabbits by oral gavage once daily for  days beginning h postexposure pe resulted in  survival in a lethal aerosolized rabbitpox model used as a surrogate for smallpox furthermore efficacy of delayed treatment with st was evaluated by beginning treatment on days    and  pe although a limited number of rabbits showed less severe signs of the rabbitpox disease from the day  and day  pe treatment groups their illness resolved very quickly and the survival rates for these group of rabbits were  and  respectively but when the treatment was started on days  or  pe survival was  and  respectively this work suggests that st is a very potent antiviral compound against aerosolized rabbitpox in rabbits and should be investigated for further

highthroughput informatics for antibodies   abstract smallpox virus andor geneticallyengineered orthopoxvimses are considered one of the most significant threats for malevolent use as potential agents of bioterrorism because smallpox was eliminated from the us population in the s prophylactic immunization was discontinued the subsequent  years have produced a population that is immunologically naive and highly susceptible to orthopoxvirus infection due to the small but significant risk of serious complications from vaccination mass immunization of the populace is contraindicated therefore the focus of the experiments outlined in this proposal is to develop an effective antipoxvirus drug for use in treating or preventing human disease caused by pathogenic poxviruses the target of our antiviral drug development efforts will be the poxvirus proteinase responsible for core protein maturation a step which is absolutely essential for the production and spread of infectious virions this project will be carried out as a partnership between an academic group at oregon state university with a long history of research in various aspects of poxvirus proteolysis and a biopharmaceutical company siga research laboratories which is actively engaged in the development of proteinase inhibitors as anti infectives together these groups will identify the viral gene product responsible for catalyzing core protein maturation and use genetic approaches to validate it as an antiviral target expression vector technology will be used to express and purify the large quantities of the core protein proteinase the purified proteinase will serve as the starting material for a twopronged approach to the identification of potential inhibitors l structurefunction analysis coupled with rational drug design and  development of an in vitro cleavage assay appropriate for use in highthroughput screening against limited libraries of potential proteinase inhibitors lead compounds identified by either approach will be tested for the ability to inhibit the replication of various orthopoxviruses in tissue culture cells if necessary lead compounds will be subjected to iterative chemistry to improve bioavailability specificity and potency the most promising optimized lead compounds will then be selected and advanced into preclinical and toxicology studies in preparation for in vivo testing in a murine andor primate challenge in collaboration with niaid and usamriid investigators it is anticipated that the results of these experiments will identify one or more antiviral drugs as development candidates to provide a rapidresponse defense against the deliberate introduction of a pathogenic poxvirus into the environment an event which we all hope never transpires but for

antibodies   abstract viruses provide a novel and powerful paradigm for the experimental examination of eukaryotic posttranslational regulatory mechanisms unique amongst the dna viruses the poxviruses complete their replicative cycle entirely within the cytoplasmic compartment of infected cells virion assembly is complicated by the fact that poxviruses produce several different infectious forms imv intracellular mature virus iev intracellular enveloped virus cev cellassociated enveloped virus and eev extracellular enveloped virus all of which may play distinct roles in vivo the structure and protein composition of the poxvirus virion also appears to dictate whether it is able to productively interact with the cytoskeleton of the infected cell in order to effect its propulsion by polymerizing actin rockets and subsequent egress from the infected cell thus in order to productively replicate poxviruses must be able to express activate localize and concentrate their numerous  encoded gene products at the correct intracellular sites to support viral transcription replication of the viral genome and the assembly of infectious progeny virions to help direct viral protein traffic poxviruses such as vaccinia virus vv have adopted many of the same protein modification activation and targeting pathways used by their cellular hosts including glycosylation phosphorylation proteolytic processing and in particular acylation remarkably our laboratory has discovered that vv encodes at least a dozen acylproteins modified either by palmitylation or myristylation the previous grant period was primarily spent completing an identification of the palmitylated vv gene products and demonstrating that these proteins require this posttranslational modification in order to functionally participate in acquisition of the iev envelope in the experiments detailed for the upcoming grant period we propose to shift our focus to the vv myristylproteins myristylation is a particularly interesting modification as it can occur in two different forms typical nterminal myristylation and atypical internal myristylation conferring a number of different phenotypic properties to the modified protein including membrane affinity protein multimerization enzyme activity and a reversible regulatory switch a detailed structurefunction analysis of the vv myristylproteins encoded by the lr al l gr er and al genes will be undertaken with the dual goals of i understanding the biochemistry and functional significance of the myristyl modification and ii elucidation of the biological function of the encoded gene product and what role it plays in the viral replicative cycle the results of these experiments should extend our knowledge of the vv replicative process and enhance our understanding of the biology of acylproteins in general   funding agency agencynational institute of health nih institutenational institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid
