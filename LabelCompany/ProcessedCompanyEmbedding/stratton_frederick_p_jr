preference for gasoline engines enthusiasm waned rapidly at management level for diesel engines daihatsu briggs  stratton dbs – in an effort to stave off japanese competition during the s briggs  stratton entered a  joint venture with the daihatsu motor company in japan located in shiga prefecture  miles  km from osaka japan construction on the thensquarefoot  m plant began in december  and was completed in april  this joint venture was notable for the manufacture of vertical and horizontal crankshaft engines from  to  hp  kw under the vanguard brand today the plant employs roughly  people on two shifts and manufactures vanguard vtwin engines ranging from  to  hp  kw the mitsubishi agreement – the vanguard line initially consisted of three singlecylinder engines and several vtwin engines the vtwins made by dbs had sold very well but the singlecylinder engine models originally produced at briggs  strattons menomonee falls wisconsin plant didnt fare so well briggs  stratton needed to solve this problem so following discussions with several japanese engine manufacturers it entered into an agreement with mitsubishi heavy industries ltd of tokyo japan briggs  stratton produced only certain parts for the engines while mitsubishi was responsible for overall production and shipping the completed singlecylinder vanguard engines were shipped directly to customers worldwide briggs  stratton had exclusive marketing rights only in north america europe and australianew zealand mhi had exclusive marketing rights under their own brand name in malaysia taiwan south korea and japan in other countries both companies competed with the same product under their own brand names which led to considerable friction and together with escalating production costs in japan caused this otherwise successful relationship to fail briggs  stratton commenced marketing alternative usmade singlecylinder engines under the vanguard brand in early  the komatsu zenoah venture – in may  briggs  stratton entered into an agreement with yet another japanese company executing a year contract with the komatsu zenoah company of tachikawa japan under the terms of the contract komatsu would manufacture a cycle  hp  kw engine in which briggs  stratton would purchase and distribute in the united states europe australia and new zealand said fred stratton this venture was not successful because the rising price of the yen made the engine too expensive in the us the toro agreement – in  briggs  stratton made a license agreement with the toro company of bloomington minnesota usa to produce the toro rtek piston ported version of their e series stroke engine aka lawnboy duraforce for use in toro snow throwers the rtek engine was a cc  cycle that produced from  hp to  hp with only the need to adjust the rpms ranging from  rpms to  rpms and ran using a gas  oil mix of  a high out put hp model was made engine model  for the use in heavier duty snow throwers such as the single stage snow commander    stage power max te  the extra  horse power was obtained using transfer ports in the piston  cylinder wall and ran at the same operating speed as the  hp engines rpms production stopped in  innovationsedit the aluminum engine – this was introduced in  as a means of having a lighterweight engine for applications such as rotary lawn mowers it was improved five years later in  with the introduction of the koolbore all aluminum and sleevebore aluminum with a cast iron cylinder liner easyspin starting – this compression release implemented as an extra hump on the intake lobe of the camshaft was introduced in  to reduce the effort required to start an engine in  a new us federal safety regulation required lawnmower blades to stop spinning within three seconds of the operator letting go of the handle the least costly most common way of complying with the new regulation was to put a flywheel brake on the mower engine to stop the engine and therefore the blade immediately when the handle was released briggs  stratton engineers found engines with the easyspin camshaft were unacceptably difficult to restart after being braked to a quick stop the easyspin lobe hump was moved to the exhaust valve but this reduced engine performance the intakeside easyspin remained in use on briggs  strattons engines larger than those used on mowers subject to the brake requirement but was discontinued in  due to tightening emission regulations the synchrobalanced engine – this  innovation was designed to attenuate vibration caused by the reciprocating mass of a singlecylinder engine the design was a series of counterweights opposing the crankpin the twin cylinder engine – this engine was introduced in  as a means of competing with briggs  strattons rivals particularly japanese firms like honda who were cutting into traditional briggs  stratton markets by producing lawn mower engines and later complete lawn mowers these first models were rated  hp  kw and displaced  cubic inches  cc but were joined in  by  cubic inch  cc models rated at  hp  kw the original price for the  hp  kw version was  lower at us than their singlecylinder castiron version bearing the same power rating industrialcommercial ic – this series of engines initially ranging from  to  hp  kw was introduced in  as briggs  strattons answer to high quality commercialduty engines produced by competitors these engines include heavyduty features such as stellite exhaust valves upgraded bearings cast iron sleeved cylinder bores and highcapacity air cleaners briggs  stratton hybrid – in  at the tail end of the energy crisis briggs  stratton developed the first gasolineelectric hybrid automobile the hybrid was designed by brooks stevens and powered by a twincylinder  hp  kw briggs  stratton engine and a large electric battery magnetron ignition – this solid state ignition system introduced by briggs  stratton in  eliminated the points and condenser system the performance of which steadily degraded between required periodic maintenance service magnetron was made available for retrofitment to briggs  stratton engines made since  competitor tecumseh had made a capacitor discharge ignition setup since  for their cast iron engine models expanding its availability and making it standard equipment on vertical shaft engines powering lawn mowers in late  five years before the advent of the briggs magnetron defunct competitor clinton engines commercialized a piezo spark pump ignition without breaker points in the early s logo historyedit the briggs  stratton logo was always a masthead but it has been changed several times over the course of the companys plus years pre war logos – – this logo started off with a diamond shape and read briggs  stratton and its home city of milwaukee wis usa below it in the middle it had the words  cycle on the top mast and the words gasoline motor and phrase made in usa on the bottom mast about  briggs  stratton added the more familiar shape of a diamond split across the center with a banner gold logo – – this logo had the name briggs stratton and its home city of milwaukee wis usa below it in the middle it had the words  cycle on the top mast and the words gasoline engine and phrase made in usa on the bottom mast gold logo ii – – although similar to the last logo this had differently arranged wording the name briggs stratton was written in a new logotype however this design also included the horsepower rating above the gold logo in the white field its city of location were in the middle as before only this time the patent numbers were eliminated if you look at a decal on a production engine from the bottom portion of the mast there were some engines produced until  that used the prior logo from  the red white and black logo –present – this is the companys current logo the logo has the name briggs stratton in black letters on the white midsection of the masthead the words  cycle engine are on the red top portion of the mast and the city line milwaukee wisconsin usa is written on the black bottom portion of the mast although the logo hadnt been changed much since then the wording on the top and bottom sections of the mast were removed in  although the company continued to use these two sections with the respective wordings original red section and

external links historyedit launched in  in milwaukee wisconsin the company is based today in wauwatosa wisconsin briggs  stratton engines are commonly used on lawnmowers as well as pressure washers electrical generators and a wide variety of other applications their original castiron engines were known for their durability but the companys success was established following the development of lightweight aluminum engines in  the aluminum engine was the perfect solution for the recently invented rotary lawnmower due to its lighter weight and lower cost the company started in  as an informal partnership between stephen foster briggs and harold m stratton sf briggs was born in watertown south dakota and graduated from south dakota state college now south dakota state university in brookings in  the idea for his first product came from an upperlevel engineering class project at sdsc this first product was a sixcylinder twocycle engine which stephen foster briggs developed during his engineering courses at south dakota state after his graduation he was eager to produce his engine and enter the rapidly expanding automobile industry bill juneau a coach at south dakota state knew of briggs ambition and the entrepreneurial interests of harold m stratton a successful grain merchant who had a farm next to juneaus farm so he introduced the two in  their fledgling company set a record in the automotive industry selling the briggs  stratton flyer the red bud at record low prices of us eventually briggs and stratton settled on manufacturing automotive components and small gasoline engines briggs purchased an engine patent from ao smith company and began powering early washing machines and reel mowers as well as many other types of equipment the company went public on the new york stock exchange in  during world war ii briggs  stratton produced generators for the war effort some prewar engines were made with aluminum which helped the company develop its expertise in using this material this development along with the postwar growth of s suburbs and lawns helped secure briggs  strattons successful growth throughout the s and s stephen briggs went on to purchase evinrude and johnson outboards and start the outboard marine corporation frederick p stratton sr the son of harold stratton served as chairman of briggs  stratton until his death in  frederick p stratton jr served as chairman until his retirement in  in  briggs  stratton sold the automotive component business the resulting company is strattec security corporation in  the company acquired its consumer generator business from the beacon group and formed briggs  stratton power products the beacon group had previously purchased the consumer products division of generac corporation now generac power systems in  in  the company added simplicity manufacturing inc and snapper inc to the briggs  stratton power products line murray inc one of its largest customers collapsed owing the company  million and to minimize the loss briggs  stratton purchased the name marketing rights and product designs of that company in  briggs  stratton announced it would be acquiring the victa lawn care business from gud holdings limited australia for a million acquisitions agreements and joint venturesedit farymann diesel gmbh – – based in lampertheim near mannheim in germany this was the first foreign acquisition briggs  stratton had ever made and was a poor fit with the companys acknowledged expertise in high volume low cost production they officially completed the acquisition on may   despite investing in new production methods briggs  stratton never understood the very low volume highly customized nature of the aircooled diesel engine market after considering adding italys lombardini to increase its presence in the diesel market as well as a failed attempt to develop its own designs briggs  stratton accepted defeat and sold the company to a private investor for a minimal amount to avoid further liabilities since the energy crisis had not affected the us markets preference for gasoline engines enthusiasm waned rapidly at management level for diesel engines daihatsu briggs  stratton dbs – in an effort to stave off japanese competition during the s briggs  stratton entered a  joint venture with the daihatsu motor company in japan located in shiga prefecture  miles  km from osaka japan construction on the thensquarefoot  m plant began in december  and was completed in april  this joint venture was notable for the manufacture of vertical and horizontal crankshaft engines from  to  hp  kw under the vanguard brand today the plant employs roughly  people on two shifts and manufactures vanguard vtwin engines ranging from  to  hp  kw the mitsubishi agreement – the vanguard line initially consisted of three singlecylinder engines and several vtwin engines the vtwins made by dbs had sold very well but the singlecylinder engine models originally produced at briggs  strattons menomonee falls wisconsin plant didnt fare so well briggs  stratton needed to solve this problem so following discussions with several japanese engine manufacturers it entered into an agreement with mitsubishi heavy industries ltd of tokyo japan briggs  stratton produced only certain parts for the engines while mitsubishi was responsible for overall production and shipping the completed singlecylinder vanguard engines were shipped directly to customers worldwide briggs  stratton had exclusive marketing rights only in north america europe and australianew zealand mhi had exclusive marketing rights under their own brand name in malaysia taiwan south korea and japan in other countries both companies competed with the same product under their own brand names which led to considerable friction and together with escalating production costs in japan caused this otherwise successful relationship to fail briggs  stratton commenced marketing alternative usmade singlecylinder engines under the vanguard brand in early  the komatsu zenoah venture – in may  briggs  stratton entered into an agreement with yet another japanese company executing a year contract with the komatsu zenoah company of tachikawa japan under the terms of the contract komatsu would manufacture a cycle  hp  kw engine in which briggs  stratton would purchase and distribute in the united states europe australia and new zealand said fred stratton this venture was not successful because the rising price of the yen made the engine too expensive in the us the toro agreement – in  briggs  stratton made a license agreement with the toro company of bloomington minnesota usa to produce the toro rtek piston ported version of their e series stroke engine aka lawnboy duraforce for use in toro snow throwers the rtek engine was a cc  cycle that produced from  hp to  hp with only the need to adjust the rpms ranging from  rpms to  rpms and ran using a gas  oil mix of  a high out put hp model was made engine model  for the use in heavier duty snow throwers such as the single stage snow commander    stage power max te  the extra  horse power was obtained using transfer ports in the piston  cylinder wall and ran at the same operating speed as the  hp engines rpms production stopped in  innovationsedit the aluminum engine – this was introduced in  as a means of having a lighterweight engine for applications such as rotary lawn mowers it was improved five years later in  with the introduction of the koolbore all aluminum and sleevebore aluminum with a cast iron cylinder liner easyspin starting – this compression release implemented as an extra hump on the intake lobe of the camshaft was introduced in  to reduce the effort required to start an engine in  a new us federal safety regulation required lawnmower blades to stop spinning within three seconds of the operator letting go of the handle the least costly most common way of complying with the new regulation was to put a flywheel brake on the mower engine to stop the engine and therefore the blade immediately when the handle was released briggs  stratton engineers found engines with the easyspin camshaft were unacceptably difficult to restart after being braked to a quick stop the easyspin lobe hump was moved to the exhaust valve but this reduced engine performance the intakeside easyspin remained in use on briggs  strattons engines larger than those used on mowers subject to the brake requirement but was discontinued in  due to tightening emission regulations the synchrobalanced engine – this  innovation was designed to attenuate vibration caused by the reciprocating mass of a singlecylinder engine the design was a series of counterweights opposing the crankpin the twin cylinder engine – this engine was introduced in  as a means of competing with briggs  strattons rivals particularly japanese firms like honda who were cutting into traditional briggs  stratton markets by producing lawn mower engines and later complete lawn mowers these first models were rated  hp  kw and displaced  cubic inches  cc but were joined in  by  cubic inch  cc models rated at  hp  kw the original price for the  hp  kw version was  lower at us than their singlecylinder castiron version bearing the same power rating industrialcommercial ic – this series of engines initially ranging from  to  hp  kw was introduced in  as briggs  strattons answer to high quality commercialduty engines produced by competitors these engines include heavyduty features such as stellite exhaust valves upgraded bearings cast iron sleeved cylinder bores and highcapacity air cleaners briggs  stratton hybrid – in  at the tail end of the energy crisis briggs  stratton developed the first gasolineelectric hybrid automobile the hybrid was designed by brooks stevens and powered by a twincylinder  hp  kw briggs  stratton engine and a large electric battery magnetron ignition – this solid state ignition system introduced by briggs  stratton in  eliminated the points and condenser system the performance of which steadily degraded between required periodic maintenance service magnetron was made available for retrofitment to briggs  stratton engines made since  competitor tecumseh had made a capacitor discharge ignition setup since  for their cast iron engine models expanding its availability and making it standard equipment on vertical shaft engines powering lawn mowers in late  five years before the advent of the briggs magnetron defunct competitor clinton engines commercialized a piezo spark pump ignition without breaker points in the early s logo historyedit the briggs  stratton logo was always a masthead but it has been changed several times over the course of the companys plus years pre war logos – – this logo started off with a diamond shape and read briggs  stratton and its home city of milwaukee wis usa below it in the middle it had the words  cycle on the top mast and the words gasoline motor and phrase made in usa on the bottom mast about  briggs  stratton added the more familiar shape of a diamond split across the center with a banner gold logo – – this logo had the name briggs stratton and its home city of milwaukee wis usa below it in the middle it had the words  cycle on the top mast and the words gasoline engine and phrase made in usa on the bottom mast gold logo ii – – although similar to the last logo this had differently arranged wording the name briggs stratton was written in a new logotype however this design also included the horsepower rating above the gold logo in the white field its city of location were in the middle as before only this time the patent numbers were eliminated if you look at a decal on a production engine from the bottom portion of the mast there were some engines produced until  that used the prior logo from  the red white and black logo –present – this is the companys current logo the logo has the name briggs stratton in black letters on the white midsection of the masthead the words  cycle engine are on the red top portion of the mast and the city line milwaukee wisconsin usa is written on the black bottom portion of the mast although the logo hadnt been changed much since then the wording on the top and bottom sections of the mast were removed in  although the company continued to use these two sections with the respective wordings original red section and service parts black section until  modelsedit cast iron modelsedit

was a resident at the date on which the petition in this case was filed of milwaukee wisconsin an estate tax return for decedents estate was filed with the internal revenue service at milwaukee wisconsin on march   at the date of his death decedent owned  shares of stock of briggs  stratton corporation b  s after giving effect to a for stock split payable to shareholders of record on may   which was paid on june   the b  s stock at all times relevant to this case was listed and traded on the new york stock exchange exchange on june   the mean price between the high and low quoted prices for b  s stock on the exchange was  per share on june   b  s had issued and outstanding  shares of common stock adjusted for the stock split at the date of his death decedent was chairman of the board of b  s his son frederick p stratton jr is a director and member of the executive committee of b  s and at the time of the trial of this case was its president all of the b  s stock owned by decedent at the date of his death is subject to federal security laws restrictions on sale and transfer because of the status of decedent and his estate and of the b  s shares held by the estate the estate could have sold during any month period a number of b  s shares equal to the average weekly trading volume in b  s stock on the exchange during the previous week period sales pursuant to security and exchange commission sec rule  would have permitted the estate to sell b  s shares on the exchange only pursuant to unsolicited brokerage transactions and provided that adequate market information was available to the investing public the use of sec rule  to effect sales of restricted stock requires the filing of form  with the sec as evidence of the transaction the average weekly trading volume of b  s stock on the exchange for the  weeks preceding june   was  shares the average weekly trading volume of b  s stock for the week period preceding the week beginning july   was  shares when trading volume increases during a month period additional sales under sec rule  may be permitted based on increased volume as a result of an increase in the trading volume following the date of decedents death the estate sold  shares of b  s stock on the exchange in the period from the date of decedents death to december   at prices ranging from  to  per share the estate sold an additional  shares of b  s stock on the exchange during april may and august  also pursuant to sec rule  at prices ranging from  to  per share an additional  shares have been sold in private transactions to family members of the stratton family at the mean of the high and the low exchange quoted price on the date of the sale such sales were made based upon standard investment representations common in private placement transactions neither decedent nor his estate had any agreement with b  s and the estate has never acquired a right of any kind to have the restricted b  s shares held by the estate be the subject of a registration statement by b  s which would allow a public distribution of the restricted shares since june   and for  years prior thereto there has been no registration of b  s shares of any kind in march  b  s agreed to and did register with the sec for sale in a secondary underwritten offering  shares of its common stock for the benefit of the estate of elizabeth stratton mcgregor who died on march   mrs mcgregors husband armin s mcgregor was the personal representative of mrs mcgregors estate the shares held by mrs mcgregors estate represented approximately  percent of the outstanding shares of b  s at the time of mrs mcgregors death neither mrs mcgregor nor any personal representative of her estate was affiliated as an officer or director with b  s at the time of mrs mcgregors death the estate faced an acute cash shortage chiefly caused by death tax requirements and had a compelling need to sell b  s stock the representatives of mrs mcgregors estate attempted to obtain an sec ruling that registration was not necessary prior to sale but such a ruling was refused to the estate by the sec the initial registration statement with respect to the stock held by mrs mcgregors estate was filed with the sec on february   on february   b  s traded  shares on the exchange and the price range was ¾ high ½ low and ¾ close on march   the amended registration statement incorporating the secs comments was filed on that date b  s traded  shares on the exchange with a price range of ¼ high ¼ low and ½ close the b  s stock price gradually sank pending the secondary offering notwithstanding the dow jones industrial average repeatedly hitting new highs on march   the registration statement became effective at noon and wires to that effect were sent around the country to the exchange to b  s and to brokers on that date the b  s stock price ranged from ¼ high  low  close with  shares trading at the close the bid was ¾ ask  the secondary offering established by the underwriters on march   was at  per share prior to the offering date the underwriters had committed to no specified price which is typical in offerings of this type the estate of mrs mcgregor was able to provide a single buyer for  shares at the price of  a share the high and low on the day the offering became effective was ½ and  and the mean was  since the  price was higher than the market price of  this price required the approval of the board of governors of the exchange which was obtained on the basis of the agreement of the single buyer for  shares to that price the underwriters fees commissions or discount in connection with the sale of the restricted b  s stock in a registered underwritten public offering of such stock would be approximately  percent of the sale price of the stock the normal brokerage commission for b  s stock in sales on the exchange on june   would not have exceeded onehalf percent of the value of the stock the costs of flotation of a registered offering of  shares of the restricted b  s stock in  including revenue stamps listing fees underwriters and directors indemnity bond printing and legal and accounting costs but not including underwriters discount would be  the b  s restricted shares could be registered only if the board of directors agreed to file a registration statement with the sec no more than one stratton served on the nineman board of directors of b  s at any time relevant to the issue involved in this case the offices of president and chief executive officer were not held by a stratton at any time relevant to the issue involved in this case from the date of decedents death through  the office of chairman of the board of b  s had not been held by a stratton at the date of decedents death frederick p stratton jr was neither an officer of b  s nor a member of its board of directors no other member of the board of directors at the date of mr strattons death was related to either the decedent or frederick p stratton jr for several years prior to decedents death b  s had refused sec requests that the annual sec form k break out separate sales and profit information for its two divisions one of which was the lock division and the other the engine division the lock division had four major customers which were the four largest auto manufacturers at the time of decedents death the japanese were beginning to enter the engine market for the types of engines manufactured by b  s b  s operates its business with the use of as small a staff as is feasible for its work participation in a registered secondary offering by b  s would have required the assignment to its preparation of personnel who would otherwise have been engaged in other work for b  s the likely result of a registered secondary offering of  shares of b  s stock would be to depress the current market price for the stock the estate did not need to sell any b  s stock in excess of the quantity salable under sec rule  in order to meet death taxes debts administrative expenses or any other expenses of the estate the estate had other liquid assets the estate did not need to sell any b  s stock as a matter of fiduciary duty because both decedents will and a pourover trust specifically exempted the personal representatives and trustees from the usual diversification rules with respect to the b  s stock a purchaser of the restricted shares from the estate in a private placement would be required to take those shares for investment and without a view to sale or other distribution such a purchaser could not sell the restricted shares on the exchange for  years after purchasing them since the provisions of sec rule  would be inapplicable to such a purchaser for  years after the year period the purchaser could only sell the stock on the exchange in accordance with sec rule  and could never sell the shares in a registered secondary offering without the agreement and participation of b  s the price at which petitioner could have sold the  restricted shares in a private placement without registration rights at the date of decedents death would have been  per share since some time would be consumed in the preparation of a registration statement the earliest time at which the restricted b  s shares could have been sold in a registered secondary public offering was from  to  months following decedents death the restricted shares if they were sold pursuant to a registration statement would have a diminished value because of the risk inherent in the inability of the estate to sell the shares during this tomonth period the closing price of b  s stock on the exchange on june   was  a share on the estate tax return the estate reported the value of the  shares as follows  shares at    shares at    the explanation of the method of valuing was that the  shares which could have been sold under sec rule  were valued at the mean between the high and low price on the exchange on june   the date of decedents death the following was stated with respect to valuation of the remaining shares accordingly the quoted market price does not accurately reflect the date of death value of the block of briggs  stratton corporation stock consisting of those shares  which could not be disposed of pursuant to sec rule  the value of this block is equal to the quoted market price  less  or  per share this valuation is based upon the estimated results of disposing of this block of stock through an underwritten registered offering which would be the most advantageous method of selling it respondent in his notice of deficiency increased the reported value of the  shares of b  s stock by  with the following explanation it is determined that the fair market value at the date of decedents death of  shares of common stock of briggs  stratton was  per share instead of only  shares at  per share as reported on the estate tax return accordingly the value of this stock is increased  it is determined that the fair market value at the date of death of  shares of the common stock of briggs  stratton corporation was  a share instead of  a share as reported on the estate tax return accordingly the reported value of this stock is increased  in the petition petitioner alleged that the valuation in the estate tax return based on a valuation of the stock in registered form was higher than it properly should be and in an amended petition petitioner alleged that the valuation should be based on a private placement and not a sale through a secondary registration since under all the factual circumstances present a secondary registration of the stock could not have been obtained opinion petitioners primary position is that the facts in this case show that the board of directors of briggs  stratton would not have consented to a secondary registration of the stock and therefore the stock should be valued at the price it would bring in a private placement sale alternatively petitioner contends that the value of the stock of b  s should be discounted if it were sold in registered form by the registration costs of  by a risk factor for time delay of  percent by an underwriters discount of  percent and by a discount of  cents a share from the closing market price on june rather than the mean market price in this manner they arrived at  per share rather than the price of  per share used in the return respondents position is that since the most advantageous method of selling the stock was in registered form the stock should be valued as though it would be sold as registered stock and that although there would be a flotation cost of the stock and an underwriters discount these amounts should be considered as in the nature of selling costs and should not be used to adjust the value of the stock respondent also contends that any discounts taken should be from the mean between the high and low price on june   and not from the closing price on that date and that the risk factor for time delay is overstated by petitioner respondent contends there is no basis for the  cents a share discount claimed by petitioner respondent contends that the value of the  shares at the date of decedents death is  per share the first issue to be determined is whether the b  s stock should be valued on the basis of private placement or as if it were sold in registered form pursuant to a secondary registration only if we agree with respondent that we should value the stock as if it were sold in registered form do we reach the issues of the proper discount under such circumstances frederick p stratton jr testified that since there was no necessity for the estate to sell any of the stock to pay taxes or expenses of administration and no necessity to sell the stock for the purposes of diversification he would have had no basis for requesting a secondary registration and to do so would have violated his duty as a director of b  s responsible to the stockholders as a whole he further testified that since there was no reason for the estate to sell the b  s stock in his opinion the board of directors would not have consented to go through with the secondary registration two other members of the board of directors who were not related to the stratton family testified that they as directors would not have agreed to a registration of the b  s stock held in the stratton estate unless the representatives of the estate were able to make a showing that there was a real need in the estate to sell the stock both of these witnesses as well as mr stratton jr pointed out that it would have been very disadvantageous to b  s to have to separately disclose the sales of its lock division and its engine division since such a separation would effectively disclose to its principal lock division customers the four big auto manufacturers its profits on locks and would disclose to its japanese competitors its profits or earnings on engines the witnesses pointed out that the sec had been attempting to get b  s to disclose this information on its form k report filed with sec and that b  s had been able to successfully resist making this disclosure they further testified that they would have had to furnish this information in connection with a secondary registration statement both of the other directors and mr stratton jr testified that the time used by the personnel in preparing the registration statement even though the cost would be borne by the estate would be disruptive to the ordinary work of b  s and that in their view to sell a block of  shares of b  s stock in a secondary registration would have depressed the market for b  s stock and therefore would have been disadvantageous to other b  s stockholders however both of the other directors who testified stated that if mr stratton jr had come to the board and shown a necessity for the estate to sell the b  s stock it held and in their view the need was real they would have approved a secondary registration in order to permit the estate to satisfy the real need from the testimony of the witnesses in this case we conclude that the board of directors would not have approved a secondary registration of the b  s stock absent any need in the estate to sell such stock the record shows that because of other liquid assets in the estate and no requirement for diversification of the assets of the estate or the trust in which much of the estate was placed the estate had no need to sell any of the b  s stock other than that which could be sold under sec rule  in fact the parties in this case stipulated that — the parties agree that petitioner had no need to sell b  s stock in excess of the quantity saleable under sec rule  to meet death taxes debts or estate administration expenses or any other expenses of the estate due to other assets in the estate available for these purposes the record clearly shows that there was no need for sale of the stock for the purposes of diversification the question of whether a taxpayer could obtain a registration statement is one of fact which must be determined from the record as a whole estate of piper v commissioner dec   tc    based on the record in this case we conclude that it would not have been feasible for the estate to obtain a secondary registration of the b  s stock it held and therefore the proper method of valuing the stock is on the basis of a private placement sale the value of restricted stock that may be sold only through a private offering to persons who take the stock subject to the same restriction is significantly lower than the value of unrestricted stock bolles v commissioner dec   tc    petitioner offered the testimony of two expert witnesses as to the fair market value of the stock at the date of decedents death in a private placement sale both of these experts concluded that the valuation of the stock on such a basis would require a  percent discount the only difference in their valuation was whether the  percent discount should be applied to the mean between the high and low price of the stock on the exchange on the date of decedents death or to the closing price of the stock on the exchange on that date if the  percent discount is applied to the mean between the high and low price the resulting value of the  shares of b  s stock held by the estate on june  is  per share if the  percent discount is applied to the closing price the value of the  shares of restricted b  s stock is  per share petitioners expert witness who used the mean between the high and low price to which to apply the discount testified that in his opinion the  percent discount would be necessary in order to sell the  shares of b  s stock in a private placement and that this  percent discount should be applied to the mean price on the exchange on the date of decedents death this witness was a well qualified witness and had prepared and presented to the court a written report analyzing in detail the reasons for his conclusion he pointed out that there is always a substantial discount in a private placement of stock which is restricted in the purchasers hands however he stated that the discount is greater in a company the stock of which is sold over the counter than in a company like b  s the stock of which is listed on the exchange he pointed out that the discount of restricted shares in smaller companies is higher than in larger companies and gave the results of certain studies made with respect to discounts paid by institutional buyers for restricted shares in his report he pointed out that b  s was viewed in the investment community in  as a small blue chip company he stated that for these reasons b  s stock probably would not sell in a private placement at as great a discount as stocks of less financially sound corporations he stated however that because of the length of time the potential customer would be required to hold the stock he considered a  percent discount to be necessary in order to sell the stock in a private placement viewing the  percent discount from the sellers standpoint this witness concluded that because the return on the b  s stock was not as high as might be received on other investments had the seller determined that it was advantageous to sell the stock in order to diversify the assets of the estate a  percent discount would seem reasonable to him because of the higher return that might be received on other investments in our view this witness is a well qualified appraiser and his appraisal was based on sound reasoning also normally in determining a discount from the value of stock listed on the exchange the value to which the discount is applied is the mean between the high and low price therefore we accept the valuation of the b  s stock on the basis of a private placement as testified to by this expert which is  per share respondent offered no expert testimony with respect to the valuation of the stock on the basis of a private placement and in fact in his crossexamination did not seriously question the valuation of the expert witness on whose testimony we have relied because of our conclusion that the  shares of b  s stock are to be valued on the basis of a private placement sale we do not reach respondents contention that the exchange value of the stock should not be reduced by the agreed  percent underwriters costs and the costs of registration since the items should be considered as selling expenses or the amount of appropriate discount for any other items in a sale of the stock as registered stock decision will be entered under rule  footnotes  by order of the chief judge this case was reassigned from judge sheldon v ekman deceased to judge irene f scott for disposition  the parties agreed for the purpose of this case and in order to settle the issue between them that  of the shares of b  s stock owned by decedent at the date of his death should be valued at the mean exchange market price on june   or  per share this is the number of shares of b  s stock which could have been sold within the month period following the death of frederick p stratton if advantage had been taken of the opportunity for maximum volume sales under sec rule  because of this stipulation the issue in this case involves only the value of the  remaining shares the parties also agree that there are only two methods by which these remaining shares could be sold one method would be a sale in a private placement of the stock pursuant to a representation by the purchaser that the shares were taken for investment and not with a view to sale or other disposition and the other method of sale would be pursuant to a registered offering which might have been available to petitioner within several months after decedents death if b  s agreed to prepare and file an appropriate registration statement with sec  the parties agree that in valuing the restricted shares sold pursuant to a secondary registration of the stock a discount for this risk factor should be allowed but disagree as to the amount of such discount respondent contends that this discount should be  percent and petitioner contends it should be  percent the parties disagree as to whether a discount for the  percent underwriters commission and the cost of registration should be made petitioner contending it should and respondent contending it should not  see also estate of sophia p brownell v commissioner dec m tc memo  comment your name your email comments
