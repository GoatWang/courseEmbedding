technology  neurona therapeutics select page technology approach the central nervous system cns contains both excitatory cells primarily neurons that express glutamate and inhibitory cells primarily neurons that express gaba normal brain and spinal cord function depends on a delicate balance between these two types of neurons this balance is normally established during embryonic development and just after birth when the nervous system is still assembling and developing neurologic connections during this time neurons are born migrate to proper locations and form connections or synapses creating complex circuits that are maintained into adulthood problems arise when genetic mutations andor external traumas result in aberrant development andor degeneration of particular cns cell types leading to the dysregulation of neural circuits epileptic seizures neuropathic pain spasticity and certain types of cognitive impairments and psychoses can be symptomatic of dysregulated neural activity because the genesis of new neurons and synapses or plasticity is limited in the adult cns these diseases persist and lack effective treatment notably effective drugs are lacking for many patients with neuropathic pain and onethird of epilepsy patients do not respond to current antiepileptic drugs neurona’s founders have discovered that transplantation of specialized neurons in the
