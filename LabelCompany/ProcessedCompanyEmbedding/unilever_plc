donovan jones ipos tech alternative investments ceo venturedealcomventuredealsummaryconsumer products giant unilever and iri have invested an undisclosed amount in machinevantagemachinevantage is developing machinelearning and aienabled algorithms to maximize consumer product development and marketingunilever which has already piloted machinevantages system stands to gain faster product development and better marketing roiby adopting aidriven consumer marketing that discovers unconscious consumer drives on a product basis unilever risks consumer charges of manipulatory practices quick take unilever ventures ul and iri have teamed up to invest in marketing machine learning and artificial intelligence firm machinevantage machinevantage is developing advanced aidriven methods to more effectively discover and market consumer goods products unilever hopes to expand the use of machinevantage’s ai insights into unconscious consumer demand drivers but should proceed carefully lest it provoke a consumer backlash against ai manipulation investee company berkeley californiabased machinevantage was founded in  to provide consumer products firms with improved methods of discovering product innovation potential and improving their digital and retail point of sale messaging management is headed by founder ak pradeep who says he has ‘pioneered the field of neuromarketing the application of advanced neuroscience to marketing’ machinevantage aims to provide three main services trend spotting – a ‘scientific approach’ to the product innovation ideation process product innovation – discover important variables that result in successful product design messaging – assists in the development of a metamarketing model that is ‘preemptive not reactive’ investment terms and rationale the amount of the financing round was not disclosed by the participants and given machinevantage’s young age i suspect it was likely for under  million as part of the investment iri will integrate machinevantage’s algorithms with its liquid data platform to create a combination that can be used by brand marketers such as unilever on a greater scale unilever had previously worked with machinevantage with ‘several of unilever’s largest brands operating across many of the countries where those brands are wellestablished consumer favorites including in emerging markets’ as stan sthanunathan evp consumer  market insights at unilever stated in the deal announcement it is crucial to understand consumer trends and preferences and to determine how our brands can best respond to peoples evolving needs we are already using artificial intelligence and machine learning to gain insights that our product development and marketing teams can translate quickly and effectively into innovations a year of working with machinevantage convinced us of the unique power of their technology and the value of our investment with unilever’s  brands worldwide it seeks to garner earlymover opportunities with the implementation of machine learning and ai to improve its brand development innovation timetomarket and consumer messaging however i’m concerned about the potential for abuse with machinevantage’s technologies as its ceo says ‘what makes machinevantage stand out is our deep understanding of the foundational principles driving consumer purchase behavior combined with our unique algorithms that process information that consumers imbibe under the threshold of conscious consumption’ italics mine so essentially machinevantage a play on the phrase ‘machine advantage says it can determine the unconscious drives and processes that consumers exhibit and adjust a company’s messaging to take advantage of that knowledge at the point of sale in many countries subliminal advertising or marketing is either illegal or considered speech that is not protected while i’m not asserting that machinevantage’s technologies meet the full definition of subliminal if its ‘digital and creative messaging’ services take advantage of that greatly improved knowledge of ‘information that consumers imbibe under the threshold of conscious consumption’ the company or its clients will be armed with far greater power to manipulate the consumer unconscious by virtue of their machinelearning technologies unilever and other consumer product marketers would be wise to tread carefully in their use of artificial intelligence to achieve their sales goals if consumers feel manipulated by an everincreasing artificial intelligence the results could be unpredictable i write about ma deals

positive relationship with the way they look – helping them raise their selfesteem and realize their full potential dove our vision dove employs the use of advertising for their own products to display their messages of positive selfesteem in september  dove created a real beauty campaign focusing predominately on women of all shapes and colour later in  this campaign furthered itself to include women of all ages this campaign consisted mostly of advertisements shown on television and popularised by the internet dove fell under scrutiny from the general public as they felt the dove advertisements described the opinion that cellulite was still unsightly and that womens ageing process was something to be ashamed of lynxaxe axe known as lynx in the united kingdom the republic of ireland australia and new zealand is a toiletries brand marketed towards young men between the age of  and  its marketing is a tongueincheek take on the mating game suggesting that women are instantly drawn to men using the products unlike doves long running beauty campaign lynx advertising often creates mini series of advertisements based around a singular product rather than communicating an overarching idea this advertising campaign thrives on controversy using images which the company knows will receive complaints about garners the brand more free publicity and notoriety a wide variety of these adverts have been banned in countries around the world in  lynxs clean balls advert was banned this advert designed for television shows an attractive young woman cleaning various sport balls

its remaining rainforest each year having the fastest deforestation rate of any country the united nations environmental programme stated that palm oil plantations are the leading cause of deforestation in indonesia furthermore indonesia was the fourteenth largest emitter of greenhouse gases largely due to the destruction of rainforests for the palm oil industry which contributed to  of global green house gas emissions according to greenpeace palm oil expansion was taking place with little oversight from central or local government as procedures for environmental impact assessment

criticised for not offering producers minimum or guaranteed price therefore leaving them vulnerable to market price variations the alternative certificate fairtrade has however received similar

to life advertisingedit dove dove describes itself as being dedicated to help  women develop a positive relationship with the way they look – helping them raise their selfesteem and realize their full potential dove our vision dove employs the use of advertising for their own products to display their messages of positive selfesteem in september  dove created a real beauty campaign focusing predominately on women of all shapes and colour later in  this campaign furthered itself to include women of all ages this campaign consisted mostly of advertisements shown on television and popularised by the internet dove fell under scrutiny from the general public as they felt the dove advertisements described the opinion that cellulite was still unsightly and that womens ageing process was something to be ashamed of lynxaxe axe known as lynx in the united kingdom the republic of ireland australia and new zealand is a toiletries brand marketed towards young men between the age of  and  its marketing is a tongueincheek take on the mating game suggesting that women are instantly drawn to men using the products unlike doves long running beauty campaign lynx advertising often creates mini series of advertisements based around a singular product rather than communicating an overarching idea this advertising campaign thrives on controversy using images which the company knows will receive complaints about garners the brand more free publicity and notoriety a wide variety of these adverts have been banned in countries around the world in  lynxs clean balls advert was banned this advert designed for television shows an attractive young woman cleaning various sport balls in  in the uk lynxs shower gel campaign was banned the poster for lynx shower gel showed a woman in an undone bikini under a shower at a beach with the headline the cleaner you are the dirtier you get both advertising campaigns make stark comparisons between how women and their sexuality are portrayed in advertising and sales efficiency lynx commonly portrays the women in their visual advertisements as hyper sexual flawless and stereotypically attractive who are aroused by the men of all ages and stature for their use of the lynx product their target audience are men between the ages of  who are single environmental recordedit unilever has declared the goal of

the united nations environmental programme stated that palm oil plantations are the leading cause of deforestation in indonesia furthermore indonesia was the fourteenth largest emitter of greenhouse gases largely due to the destruction of rainforests for the palm oil industry which contributed to  of global green house gas emissions according to greenpeace palm oil expansion was taking place with little oversight from central or local government as procedures for environmental impact assessment landuse planning and ensuring a proper process for development of concessions were neglected plantations that were offlimits by law for palm oil plantations were being established as well as the illegal use of fire to clear forest areas was commonplace unilever as a founding member of the roundtable on sustainable palm oil rspo responded by publicising its plan to obtain all of its palm oil from sources that are certified as sustainable by  it claims to have met this goal in  and is

tea products by the rainforest alliance scheme the company has stated that at least  of the tea in its products originates from certified farms compared to the alliances  minimum entry point unilever decided on the scheme over fairtrade because according to the companys analysis fairtrade might lack the scale and the organizational flexibility to certify industrial tea estates criticismedit main article rainforest alliance § criticism and response the rainforest alliance certification scheme has been criticised for not offering producers minimum or guaranteed price therefore leaving them vulnerable to market price variations the alternative certificate fairtrade has however received similar criticism as well the rainforest alliance certification has furthermore been criticised for allowing the use of the seal on products that contain only a minimum of  of certified content which according to some endangers the integrity of the certification july  september  salmonella

currency impacts acquisitions and brand disposals  rose  annually during the third quarter up from  growth in the second quarter unilever attributed that growth to a strong ice cream season in southern europe a competitors recall in north america and the phasing of latin american sales between the third and fourth quarters  of unilevers sales come from emerging markets unlike its usbased

potential dove our vision dove employs the use of advertising for their own products to display their messages of positive selfesteem in september  dove created a real beauty campaign focusing predominately on women of all shapes and colour later in  this campaign furthered itself to include women of all ages this campaign consisted mostly of advertisements shown on television and popularised by the internet dove fell under scrutiny from the general public as they felt the dove advertisements described the opinion that cellulite was still unsightly and that womens ageing process was something to be ashamed of lynxaxe axe known as lynx in the united kingdom the republic of ireland australia and new zealand is a toiletries brand marketed towards young men between the age of  and  its marketing is a tongueincheek take on the mating game suggesting that women are instantly drawn to men using the products unlike doves long running beauty campaign lynx advertising often creates mini series of advertisements based around a singular product rather than communicating an overarching idea this advertising campaign thrives on controversy using images which the company knows will receive complaints about garners the brand more free publicity and notoriety a wide variety of these adverts have been banned in countries around the world in  lynxs clean balls advert was banned this advert designed for television shows an attractive young woman cleaning various sport balls in  in the uk lynxs shower gel campaign was banned the poster for lynx shower gel showed a woman in an undone bikini under a shower at a beach with the headline the cleaner you are the dirtier you get both advertising campaigns make stark comparisons between how women and their

the united nations environmental programme stated that palm oil plantations are the leading cause of deforestation in indonesia furthermore indonesia was the fourteenth largest emitter of greenhouse gases largely due to the destruction of rainforests for the palm oil industry which contributed to  of global green house gas emissions according to greenpeace palm oil expansion was taking place with little oversight from central or local government as procedures for environmental impact assessment landuse planning and ensuring a proper process for development of concessions were neglected plantations that were offlimits by law for palm oil plantations were being established as well as the illegal use of fire to clear forest areas was commonplace unilever as a founding member of the roundtable on sustainable palm oil rspo responded by publicising its plan to obtain all of its palm oil from sources that are certified as sustainable by  it claims to have met this goal in  and is

tea products by the rainforest alliance scheme the company has stated that at least  of the tea in its products originates from certified farms compared to the alliances  minimum entry point unilever decided on the scheme over fairtrade because according to the companys analysis fairtrade might lack the scale and the organizational flexibility to certify industrial tea estates criticismedit main article rainforest alliance § criticism and response the rainforest alliance certification scheme has been criticised for not offering producers minimum or guaranteed price therefore leaving them vulnerable to market price variations the alternative certificate fairtrade has however received similar criticism as well the rainforest alliance certification has furthermore been criticised for allowing the use of the seal on products that contain only a minimum of  of certified content which according to some endangers the integrity of the certification july  september  salmonella

describes itself as being dedicated to help  women develop a positive relationship with the way they look – helping them raise their selfesteem and realize their full potential dove our vision dove employs the use of advertising for their own products to display their messages of positive selfesteem in september  dove created a real beauty campaign focusing predominately on women of all shapes and colour later in  this campaign furthered itself to include women of all ages this campaign consisted mostly of advertisements shown on television and popularised by the internet dove fell under scrutiny from the general public as they felt the dove advertisements described the opinion that cellulite was still unsightly and that womens ageing process was something to be ashamed of lynxaxe axe known as lynx in the united kingdom the republic of ireland australia and new zealand is a toiletries brand marketed towards young men between the age of  and  its marketing is a tongueincheek take on the mating game suggesting that women are instantly drawn to men using the products unlike doves long running beauty campaign lynx advertising often creates mini series of advertisements based around a singular product rather than communicating an overarching idea this advertising campaign thrives on controversy using images which the company knows will receive complaints about garners the brand more free publicity and notoriety a wide variety of these adverts have been banned in countries around the world in  lynxs clean balls advert was banned this advert designed for television shows an attractive young woman cleaning various sport balls in  in the uk lynxs shower gel campaign was banned the poster for lynx shower gel showed a woman in an undone bikini under a shower at a beach with the headline the cleaner you are the dirtier you get both advertising campaigns make stark comparisons between how women and their sexuality are portrayed in advertising and sales efficiency lynx

indonesias rainforests by  indonesia was losing  of its remaining rainforest each year having the fastest deforestation rate of any country the united nations environmental programme stated that palm oil plantations are the leading cause of deforestation in indonesia furthermore indonesia was the fourteenth largest emitter of greenhouse gases largely due to the destruction of rainforests for the palm oil industry which contributed to  of global green house gas emissions according to greenpeace palm oil expansion was taking place with little oversight from central or local government as procedures for environmental impact assessment landuse planning and ensuring a proper process for development of concessions were neglected plantations that were offlimits by law for palm oil plantations were being established as well as the illegal use of fire to clear forest areas was commonplace unilever as a founding member of the roundtable on sustainable palm oil rspo responded by

scheme the company has stated that at least  of the tea in its products originates from certified farms compared to the alliances  minimum entry point unilever decided on the scheme over fairtrade because according to the companys analysis fairtrade might lack the scale and the organizational flexibility to certify industrial tea estates criticismedit main article rainforest alliance § criticism and response the rainforest alliance certification scheme has been criticised for not offering producers minimum or guaranteed price therefore leaving them vulnerable to market price variations the alternative certificate fairtrade has however received similar criticism as well the rainforest alliance certification has furthermore been criticised for allowing the use of the seal
