executive of activision blizzard with images of characters from the skylanders series one of the company’s successful franchises credit j emilio flores for the new york times people who love video games love to hate bobby kotickmr kotick the ceo of activision blizzard the world’s largest video game publisher inspired a stocky auburnhaired character named money sack who in a game created by a competitor and a former employee wields a wide grin and an automatic weapon in another video mr kotick pops up from behind a fortified wall and in a husky ominous voice says he’ll set the price of his biggest game call of duty to “your soul” — a dig at its cost then fiery lasers shoot out of his eyes wreaking havoc on an apocalyptic fantasy world in several online photographs he is depicted as the devil with red horns against a hadeslike backgroundon this particular sunday it’s those photoshopped horns that really irk mr kotick he is seated at a corner table in the cavernous breakfast room of the pierre hotel across the street from central park shaking a leg nervously and whispering in a conspiratorial hush“think about what it’s like for my dating life when the first picture that comes up is me as the devil” says mr kotick who is recently divorced “you see all this chatter and you realize that they game the search results these supersophisticated yearolds are smarter than our expensive pr firm” his publicist steven rubenstein shrugs sheepishlymr kotick  has reason to be annoyed not since the music industry’s heyday has there been a business with such a wide disparity between the popularity of its products and its customers’ perception of the chief executive who made those products possible video games are among the most successful segments in the entertainment industry and the disdain heaped on mr kotick in video game blogs is second only to the admiration for him on wall street advertisement continue reading the main story he bought the company that is now activision in  when it was nearly bankrupt and when analysts dismissed video games as fads but in his  years as ceo he has built activision into a company with a stock market value of  billion almost three times that of its top rival electronic arts continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story mr kotick isn’t the most technologydriven executive he still prefers a blackberry and he doesn’t get into the weeds of creative storytelling he leaves that to the studios activision has acquired but like david geffen who never played a musical instrument well but signed bob dylan joni mitchell and the eagles mr kotick has a knack for identifying hit after blockbuster hit he wakes up each day thinking about those hits — some would say obsessing about them — and how activision can lavish games like call of duty diablo and world of warcraft with ever more bells and whistles to keep customers happy and ensure that the next release is a big success toothe latest edition of activision’s biggest game the shoot’emup megahit call of duty black ops ii was released nov  and had sales of  million in its first  hours and more than  billion in the first  days that fell short of some analysts’ expectations but was nevertheless more than the total domestic boxoffice revenue of “avatar” the highestgrossing movie of all timebut expensive immersive games now face a challenge as free online games from companies like zynga and rovio compete for users’ attention retail sales of video games in the united states totaled  billion from january to october down  percent from the same period in  according to the npd groupin response activision is doubling down on a handful of games with high margins the strategy is to have customers pay  or more to traverse for hundreds of hours through story lines with orchestral soundtracks and realistic hologramlike heroes and heroines with each new version “we need more resources more time and our development schedule has to get longer” mr kotick says “how do you make the games better each year”developers of call of duty took the risky step of bringing the mostly historical war series into the notsodistant future of  david s goyer cowriter of the story for “the dark knight rises” was a cowriter on the story for the latest call of duty trent reznor the nine inch nails singer who won an oscar for the soundtrack of “the social network” did the theme song oliver l north served as an adviser for the game which features a virtual david h petraeus the former central intelligence agency directorthe activision strategy relies heavily on the holiday season “this is a nailbiting time for us” said brian g kelly mr kotick’s longtime business partner who is cochairman of the activision blizzard boardin the three months ended sept  activision exceeded analysts’ expectations and increased its earnings by  percent to  million or  cents a share even as video game console sales declined slightly advertisement continue reading the main story mr kotick’s compensation is tied to the company’s performance he made more than  million in  and has an estimated net worth of over  billion fans have complained that activision rakes in revenue by increasing the prices of their beloved games — though the company says the new call of duty costs around  the same price as previous releases fans also bemoan its practice of releasing only a few franchise games a year“he gets wealthy if investors get wealthy and that’s why investors really like the guy and most gamers hate the guy” michael pachter an analyst at wedbush securities said of mr kotickin an industry that is equal parts glitz and gritty computer programming mr kotick has always fit firmly among the former he made a cameo in “moneyball” the  film as a cheapskate baseball team owner his beverly hills home is filled with abstract expressionist art and he recently flew his helicopter to pick up his friend jeffrey katzenberg for a los angeles lakers gamemr kotick’s games may regularly make more money than the movies but his moviestar lifestyle doesn’t sit well with some gamersbut mostly mr kotick has never lived down a  forbes magazine article that praised his business acumen but said he did not play video games a claim that he says was inaccurategamers went ballistic “it’s doubtful he even knows the name of azeroth” the video game writer ben kuchera said of mr kotick a reference to the fantasy world in world of warcraft an online multiplayer activision blizzard game with more than  million subscribersmr kotick dismisses such accusations “when you dig down and look at the people who are vocal in their criticism of me it’s a small number” mr kotick says he holds out his thumb and says he had calluses from playing too much defender a s arcade game set on a fictional planet that requires users to protect astronauts by shooting aliens today he says he mostly plays activision’s newest series skylanders with his yearold daughter“people criticize me for not being passionate about the products but i am” he saysbut even if it wasn’t about playing his own games there’s something about robert a kotick a brassy long islander turned hollywood mogul who strikes some critics as the type of moneyed outgoing jokester who would have teased obsessive gamers in high school advertisement continue reading the main story he once spotted antonio villaraigosa the mayor of los angeles surrounded by security guards and jokingly put him in a chokehold from behind“is that bobby kotick” mr villaraigosa said without turning around according to a person who was standing with the mayor bobby kotick is that kind of guyeven in high school in roslyn ny he had a taste for showmanship picking up friends in a chauffeured limo to take them to

activision” mr wynn said “is that good bobby”“it’s good if you own a million and a half shares” mr kotick replied“i sat at my desk speechless” mr wynn recalled recently while on board his private jet a bombardier global express en route to monte carlo “the kid was telling me i had  million i didn’t know about”mr wynn was henceforth known as uncle stevebut it was another steve steven p jobs of apple who persuaded mr kotick to drop out of college mr jobs had heard about the jane software package and visited mr kotick and mr marks in ann arbor he told them that they were wasting their time in

later sued electronic arts for recruiting mr west and mr zampellathe lawsuit enraged the game world mr kotick was painted as an evil capitalist and the developers as creative heroes but mr kotick says the decision to let the developers go was a nobrainer “you find out two executives are planning to break their contracts keep the money you gave them and steal  employees what do you do you fire them” he saysrobert m schwartz a lawyer for mr west and mr zampella said mr kotick had “falsely promised huge bonuses and franchise control” to his clients jeff brown a spokesman for electronic arts said mr kotick’s “history of suing developers and competitors” appears to be “a fundamental part of his business model” advertisement continue reading the main story call of duty may look like a movie but mr kotick has little interest in turning it into one — and has turned down several studios’ requests he says movies based on video games rarely please devoted fans and could taint the brand“he’s a very very careful thinker about how value is created in the business” says bruce hack who was chief executive of vivendi games when it merged with activision he says that most silicon valley companies meanwhile haven’t figured out how to make money on free online gamesbut analysts caution that even the most popular brands reach saturation call of duty which makes up an estimated onethird of activision’s more than  billion in annual revenue faces a potential threat from the electronic arts shooter game battlefield in  activision stopped making guitar hero the game that lets users become livingroom rock stars after the market became flooded with it and related knockoffs since then activision has lacked a game that widely appeals to women “guitar hero was much more about us not innovating in a way that was appealing to audiences” mr kotick says “it’s not about oversaturating the market”last year activision released the first version of skylanders a video game with accompanying figurines it’s aimed at young boys mr kotick giddy about an entirely new concept in a company based mostly on old reliables showed off a stack of prototype skylanders action figures to friends“we’re at some fancypantsy restaurant and he has a shopping bag with him” mr katzenberg recalls “i’m trying to be polite but everyone is staring at us like we’ve lost our minds here are two grown men playing with toys”mr katzenberg a prominent donor in democratic party politics says he’s close to mr kotick despite their political differences mr kotick who calls himself a libertarian voted for mitt romney for president and in  and  donated a combined  to the national republican senatorial committee according to the center for responsive politicsmr kotick’s restlessness and competitiveness lead his friends to speculate about what he will do next and whether it will be at activision or elsewhere“i like what i’m doing” mr kotick says “if i didn’t like what i was doing i’d be doing something else” advertisement continue reading the main story mr wynn for one doesn’t see his surrogate nephew sitting still“he’s got to decide what to do with the rest of his life” says mr wynn from somewhere over the atlantic he compares mr kotick to the millionaire bank robber who tested his luck with a second heist in “the thomas crown affair” — the  version with faye dunaway and

february   est three years ago a group of senior activision executives led by ceo bobby kotick met with stephane kurgan and riccardo zacconi the heads of mobile gaming company king it was says kotick a social engagement two powerhouses of the global games industry shooting the breeze in a fancy restaurant during an investor call this week however zacconi talked about the “mutual fear and respect” at the table executives don’t meet like this for fun they were sizing each other up on monday activision announced that it would be acquiring king creator of the massively successful candy crush saga game – as well as other more modest smartphone hits – for bn predictably the revelation sent shockwaves through the industry it’s a hefty sum – more than disney paid for legacy entertainment companies marvel and lucasfilm what was activision thinking of course the basic strategy was obvious although activision is big in console games with its call of duty destiny and skylanders brands and has might in pc gaming thanks to the blizzard titles diablo starcraft and warcraft it has largely failed to make an impact in the explosive smartphone gaming sector purchasing king would bring it an experienced workforce plenty of proven ip and a vast global audience stretching far beyond the traditional “hardcore” gaming demographic but analysts were quick to question the deal king shares have consistently traded below the asking price set at the company’s disastrous ipo in march  the latest accounts showed an  yearonyear fall in revenue candy crush saga has probably peaked and although titles like pet rescue and farm heroes have performed well they’re not doing well enough to replace candy crush saga as the sugar rush fades in a coruscating article on the deal the journalist rob fahey wrote “in all likelihood activision has just paid a huge premium for a company which is past the peak of its greatest hit title and into a period of managed decline not to mention a company with which its core businesses simply don’t fit in any meaningful way” the ihs digital analyst piers hardingrolls added “the mobile games market is highly unpredictable even with a strong set of games franchises and brands success is far from guaranteed” so what does bobby kotick make of all this activision’s boss the pantomime villain of gamers everywhere is the longeststanding ceo in the tech industry in  he took control of a fading games company and over the next  years turned it into an entertainment giant with a brand – call of duty – that could dwarf hollywood box office takings unsurprisingly he has a different view on the deal “look here’s my immodesty” he says via a phone call from activision’s hq in santa monica “but if you look at the growth in operating profits and the return on invested capital that we’ve generated for our shareholders we are really good at prioritising opportunities we have now gotten to a place where we’ve seen mobile as an opportunity we’ve prioritised it evaluated a variety of alternatives both building and buying and we came to the conclusion that king does the best job of any team that we’ve come across in the creation of franchises in sustaining those franchises in commercialising those franchises and thinking about new franchises today mobile is a bn market king supports audiences in  countries we felt very confident that they were the right partner for us” but then traditional game publishers have floundered in the past when they tried to buy their way into the mobile industry electronic arts paid m for jamdat in  m for social gaming specialist playfish in  and m for bejeweled creator popcap games in  while the latter still exists as a brand the others have faded and disappeared is this not a stark lesson in how the gears grind when very different development cultures meet “well if you look at the history of our company we don’t do a lot of acquisition” says kotick “the reason is we need to see that people are culturally and philosophically aligned with the way that we approach the business at the end of that first meeting with riccardo and stephane i said to the other activision participants ‘that team is aligned with the way we operate the business if we can someday figure out how to do something with them we should’ it’s very rare that you find people who have the same commitments and the same commercial instinct” kotick also shrugs off concerns about king’s reliance on candy crush “they had product concentration and so mr market looks at that and says ‘hey you know is that a onetrick pony’ but when we looked at king we saw four great franchises with lots of potential one super franchise and a fantastic pipeline that got us really excited” from king’s point of view the deal makes sense in that it gives them activision’s proven ip with which to build new smartphone titles but again there’s another question is the world ready for call of duty saga destiny soda skylanders rescue the latter is the most obvious brand for rethinking into the casual smartphone space and call of duty should be a useful asset in the growing “midcore” sector of more challenging mobile gaming experiences but is that what this is about “just reskinning games with our intellectual property is not an appealing prospect for opportunity” assures kotick “that isn’t something that creates longterm value for shareholders” indeed you get the sense that what really interests activision – or at least its ceo – is sheer numbers “we now have  million players in  countries around the world” he says with barely contained zeal “in the past our business was largely concentrated around middleclass consumers who could afford  or  for a dedicated game console or  for a pc now with the introduction of highquality mobile devices we’re looking at everybody being a consumer and one of the things i love about king is  percent of their consumer base is female there are more opportunities now than we’ve ever had before” that’s the thing really over the last five years the console games industry has grown to resemble its younger smartphone sibling the future is about what he calls “perpetual franchises” the old model of annual boxed copy iterations is coming to an end call of duty with its scheduled dlc drops destiny with its endless feed of new content – it’s about building communities and engagement now it’s about finding new models for a growing audience that now thinks about games in a different way king was able to rise up within the densely crowded smartphone space with an “audience first revenue later” approach that activision now covets “from activision’s point of view the relatively slow burn of this generations console market and the transition towards increasingly digital delivery is major risk for their business – like any traditional publisher – so it makes sense to consolidate their position by acquiring one of the giants of mobile gaming” says smartphone industry veteran oscar clark now at unity “leaving king as a separate entity is a smart move but if activision is to really benefit they have to really learn from them and be willing and able to adapt themselves” one thing’s for sure kotick is never off duty he has drawn the ire of core gamers with activision’s endless cycle of moneyspinning brands the dlc packs the vast number of skylanders toys the expense of keeping up to date with destiny but the monster rolls on regardless you can bet when he sat across the table from those king executives three years ago he wasn’t seeing two guys he was seeing a new audience of many many millions in parts of the world even call of duty never reached and right now according to him that’s all he cares about “look the way we see it this audience is investing in our content right now” he says “whether they’re paying for it or not is not really relevant they’re investing a significant amount of time in our content at some point commercial opportunities will materialise for greater percentages of that audience” time will tell if the numbers convert into revenue but for activision whatever you think of the company the numbers usually do topics games

screen the same money is chasing the same relatively finite crowd isnt it kotick not really in fact what you find is theres actually a lot of crossownership but these new products that will come out into the marketplace have dramatically new features i have been in this business for now almost  years i have never seen the kind of improvements were seeing graphically youre going to — for the first time — see highdefinition display capabilities and audio capabilities cavuto are you doing that are you doing that or is microsoft doing that kotick well microsoft msft and sony sne make the hardware but we make the software that supports it cavuto i got you when you say that theres crossownership are you saying that people own an xbox they own a sony playstation they own activision are they all together kotick well remember today youre looking at probably  percent of american households with children have one active video game system and we really dont care which system you have because we make software for all of the systems cavuto you will make it for everybody right right right i know you had pursued — if im getting this out of context please correct me — maybe advertising hidden in some of the games is that true kotick were in the early sort of exploration phase and the catalyst for that is when you look at television watching habits — and this is some data that we commissioned from nielsen — but about a year ago we looked at the  year and what it turned out is that television watching to  to yearold males in the us was roughly  billion hours and video game playing was roughly the same  billion hours advertisers spent over  billion on tv to the  to yearold males in the us alone but spent negligible amounts of money advertising in video games and yet were delivering cavuto but when you say advertising in video games is it product placement which i dont think most people would have a problem with or is it an outright ad either before the start of the game during a game after the game what kotick its primarily really tightly integrated product placement making sure that the products have an appropriateness to our audiences but i mean you think about the power of — in a tony hawk game — going from level three to level four and having to drink a cocacola or a pepsi youre reaching millions of consumers hundreds of hours per consumer its a really positive association so we see you know four or five years from now this being a potentially big opportunity cavuto all right thank you very much bobby kotick of activision good seeing you kotick likewise neil
