trustworthy yet an inside look at whats changed after a year of microsoft trustworthy computing download on the eve of john w thompsons arrival at symantec in april  the rev jesse jackson came to silicon valley to complain about the dearth of minority leaders in it no one was more dismayed at the timing than the northern california companys new chief executive granted thompson also encouraged fellow africanamericans to consider it careers but as he correctly predicted the news media seized on the coincidence john very much wanted to be accepted into this new position as the best choice which he absolutely was but because of jesse jackson being there half the stories focused on the racial aspect of the appointment recalls rs steve miller ceo of bethlehem steel and the symantec board member who recruited thompson thompson still generates a lot of press but these days its because of the direction hes steering his companyone that defies conventional wisdom and for the moment appears to be working full name john wendell thompson age  education ba business administration florida am university ms management science mits sloan school of management personal married five years to sandi a lawyer two grown children from a previous marriage first paid job cutting neighborhood lawns at age  best part of current job the opportunity to lead a team thats passionate about what theyre doing and where theyre going favorite book doesnt have one but enjoys tom clancy novels words to live by enjoy what youre doing because if you dont it makes for a miserable existence since taking the helm from founder gordon eubanks thompson has turned symantec from a  million consumer software company to a  billion enterprise security market leader almost every fortune  firm and fourfifths of the global  use symantec products according to the company through numerous acquisitions symantec has doubled its workforce to  since  it has one of the lowest employee attrition rates in the country says thompson and probably the highest morale in our history but symantecs horizon is not without clouds numerous industry observers have criticized thompson for overpaying for acquired companies and technologies others question his strategy for longterm growth but such criticism only bolsters thompsons resolve at this stage in his life he could comfortably retire after three decades with ibm taking his three hunting dogs out more often or perfecting one of his many gourmet dishes instead he spends most of his waking hours attempting to turn symantec into a security industry superpower who is this guy im certainly more than happy with the path ive chosen thompson says from his hillside estate in woodside calif his porsche and bmw are parked in the garage he wears ermenegildo zegna suits at board meetings he personally selects the right wine to go with meals he supports democratic causes and candidates like presidential contender sen john kerry of massachusetts but insists he wants no part of professional politics himself this is a sensitive area for thompson people have written that he might have political designs based on his cozy relationships with certain politicos and recent appointment to the national infrastructure advisory committee by president bush let me be clear i have no aspirations for politics none whatsoever he says the words carefully wrapped in a polite but dismissive tone some also speculate that last years appointment of john schwarz as president and coo signaled that thompson may be ready to move on from his position as ceo and chairman of the board but that hasnt proved true not yet at least hes very dedicated to staying here and i hope he finishes out his career with symantec miller says but i bet his phones ringing with offers every week early challenges thompson grew up the son of a postal worker and schoolteacher in west palm beach fla middle class but mindful of the segregation that permeated southern states in his youth my mom and dad believed very much in the concepts of working hard for what you want and making sure youre properly prepared for what your pursuits are he recalls we were a loving bunch but a very competitive bunch my sister was a smart lady and always pushed the envelope on grades grades werent the same priority to young thompson though and college didnt come easy especially after he married at  and soon became a father but professors took an interest in him including one who convinced him to work for ibm after graduation thompson proved to be a quick study by the early s hed trimmed what hes called his eightpound afro shaved his mustache dumped the leisure suitand started to seal impressive deals as an ibm salesman in tampa the company saw thompsons potential and by  he was general manager of ibm americas a  billion unit with  employees people wondered if thompson might someday replace former ceo louis gerstner in the late s symantec was showing signs of trouble by accident or design eubanks who founded the company in  as a security software vendor and took it public in  had wandered into a number of unrelated software businesses the scattershot buys had left symantec bloated its business strategy blurred change was needed even eubanks knew it board member miller had met thompson during a business trip and been impressed with his reputation for taking calculated risks that paid off he made sound decisions and stuck by them he was ambitious but affable he was well connected with incredible persuasive powers people seemed to like or at least respect the guy and he was from the outside clearly he was the bestqualified person miller says but symantec was a hard sell thompson had just remarried and loved living in westport conn leaving the only company hed ever worked for might look like disloyalty leaving it to run a much smaller firm might be seen as a step down symantec though offered something ibm wouldnt a chance to truly lead to be the boss and eubanks was supportive which made for a smoother transition thompson says he wanted to put into play all the skills hed acquired at ibm its one thing to be a part of a great team recognized as doing well in the industry its another to be a leader of the team trying to create an image for the company and its product he explains he yearned for the latter onestop shop symantecs revitalization came at a cost first thompson ordered the company to return to its roots security that meant selling off or shutting down unrelated software businesses such as the act personal management tool and visual café a software development platform having already gained a strong foothold in the consumer av market with its norton product line the company decided to go after the more lucrative but cutthroat enterprise space those who werent up to the challenge were shown the door half of the companys original  employees were replacedincluding almost all of top management the turnover hinted at the initial internal turmoil under thompsons leadership not everyone shared the companys new vision nor its ceos new more corporate approach it was traumatic for the organization miller remembers his predecessor had been with it since its inception and in comes this guy wanting to change a cozy entrepreneurial environment into a billiondollar corporation in addition to the turnover another  joined symantecs ranks through  acquisitions that cost the company  billion the biggest buy was a  million stock deal for firewall and ids manufacturer axent technologies in  a considerable chunk of change even in those heady days the purchase is still questioned by industry experts who point to the low profile of axents technologies in symantecs product portfolio most recently symantec last summer spent  million for security management software maker mountain wave ids vendor recourse technologies managed security service provider riptech and securityfocus best known for its security alerts and popular bugtraq mailing list critics also questioned the acquisition price of these firms which in one case approached  times annual revenue even more daring than the price tags for some of these sprees has been symantecs new business model the company is gambling on becoming an allinone security source that may explain some say why symantec picks up products that arent always considered best of breed aside from a philosophical departure is a practical one in addition to convincing customers that an integrated system of enterprise security technologies is superior to picking the best solution for each need symantec must rely less on resellers and more on direct sales which hasnt been the companys strong suit there are numerous other software firmsnetwork associates and secure computing come to mindthat failed to capitalize on the security suite approach but thompson believes symantec can do better by building on brand loyalty our approach is about delivering an integrated set of offerings that reduce the complexity and costs of securing the environment he explains we will either prove that is the right approach or not and im betting my personal reputation on the fact that were right a rebel with a cause thompson enjoys being seen as different even if he looks like just another blue suit and therein lies the rub in a field overwhelmingly occupied by white men thompsons race makes him stand out judging from the low number of africanamericans entering it that isnt going to change any time soon its a position hes sometimes uncomfortable accepting let alone promoting yes i am africanamerican its undeniable but i dont think of myself in that context he told the san francisco chronicle last year when asked for the umpteenth time about the race factor many of the awards and accolades hes received over the past several yearsfrom times digital  in  to last months list of businessweeks top managers for have nothing to do with the color of his skin those were awarded for his business acumen and influence but others express appreciation and honor thompsons accomplishment as one of the nations top africanamericans in it cnncom for instance profiled him along with celebrities like oprah winfrey and comedian chris rock during last februarys black history month blackengineercom deemed him one of the  most important africanamericans in technology in  technology project manager chris williams of denver has followed thompsons career since he worked under him years ago at ibm williams who now works for a consultancy and holds office in the nonprofit black data processing associates considers thompson the ideal role model hes certainly someone you can emulate in the way hes handling his career he says hes a real stickler for preparation and risk taking and believes that old adage no risk no reward thompsons voice no longer drips with irritation when asked about his role and responsibilities as a black leader he speaks regularly at conferences and historically black colleges and is working with jacksons rainbow coalition to recruit more africanamericans to it and help them reach management positions they certainly have the intellect and wherewithal to do it we just need to make ourselves known to them and the opportunities we can offer he says the need for more mentors is keyat least based on his own experience i had the belief that if i could produce good results the rest would take care of itself but along the way i also was fortunate enough to have support from some really wellplaced people who took an interest in my career success though comes more from who you are than whom you know its a combination of hard work and good support structure that helps to get you going but its determination along the way that keeps you

years away he accepted an offer to become head of symantec—a leading software company located in californias silicon valley it was the kind of challenge that he was ready to tackle while his first years had their ups and downs through his vision and determination the company renewed its focus and goals thompson was born april   in fort dix new jersey and raised in west palm beach florida his father was a postal worker and his mother was a teacher thompson claims to have had an early education in business when he accompanied his father as he collected rent on some apartments the family owned his parents inspired a strong work ethic in thompson he described his family when he talked to anne saita of information security my mom and dad believed very much in the concepts of working hard for what you want and making sure youre properly prepared for what your pursuits are we were a loving bunch but a very competitive bunch thompson went to college on a music scholarship at florida am university where he studied business administration although he played clarinet and saxophone he did not want to become a musician his goal was to become a businessman he just did not know what kind of business he wanted to pursue toward the end of his college career during which he had married and had a child thompson was encouraged by one of his professors to apply to ibm he started out in  as a salesman for the company in the beginning he was determined to be his own person he eschewed the traditional look of corporate culture and sported a mustache a large afro hairstyle and wore leisure suits the plan that thompson had laid out for himself was to work for ibm for two years and then apply to law school as it happened he and his wife at the time had a second child and he was promoted several times his winning and charismatic style helped him work his way up the corporate ladder he worked as general manager to develop and market ibms operating system os he also helped

thompsons door founder gordon eubanks was stepping down as head of the company and a search was on for a new leader one who had to be from outside the company at the time symantec was strong but lacked focus and did not seem to know what direction in which to head thompson seemed like the best candidate and he was up for the task thompson and his second wife sandi relocated from connecticut to california and began another phase in their lives sandi who had worked for ibm as well returned to school and earned a law degree thompson took on the mantle of chairman president and chief executive officer of symantec he wasted no time implementing changes at the floundering company one of his first moves was to replace twothirds of the senior executives he also increased the number of employees by  percent as part of a new focus on corporate customers thompson sold off several divisions including internet tools and its visual cafe as well as act contact manager software besides the challenges he faced within the company thompson was faced with other challenges in  reverend jesse jackson came to silicon valley with his rainbowpush coalition to address the issue of diversity in the hightech industry the coincidental event ended up creating a great deal of speculation on whether or not thompson had been hired because he was african american thompson was upset by the conjecture he explained to karl schoenberger of the new york times im not here to create an image of myself as some black messiah in silicon valley but ive learned some things im willing to share as long as i dont miss a beat in my no  priority of running a company  they will never say i failed because i was distracted and theyll never be able to say i succeeded because i was black thompson worked with jackson to change the name of the conference from digital divide to digital connections with the hope of switching its focus to inclusiveness many of the changes that took place when thompson took over symantec made his investors nervous in his first couple years he faced criticism and concern over his decisions in order to shore up symantecs resources for corporate customers the company bought many smaller companies during a time when most other software companies had withdrawn from such acquisitions but by  symantec had hit a revenue goal of having  percent of its sales coming from corporate accounts a switch from its previous focus on individual users symantecs health was given a boost by thompsons extensive list of contacts from his former ibm associates who had always considered him trustworthy in his personal life thompson enjoys both the finer things in life as well as simple pleasures his father taught him to shoot a gun when he was a child on one hand thompson is an avid hunter who owns three hunting dogs he primarily hunts duck which he then takes home and prepares in gourmet fashion speaking to george v hulme of information week thompson had this to say about his hobbies i enjoy hunting and what i catch gives us something to cook hunting ties together my two hobbies on the other hand he owns a bmw and a porsche and has his suits tailormade by designer ermenegildo zegna thompson took a bold step in  leaving the comfort and security of ibm to take the helm of symantec his efforts have helped the company achieve sales in  that reached  billion he credits his success to his determination and focus as well as mentoring he explained to information security s saita its a combination of hard work and good support structure that helps to
