to your estate if you die without a will in ma publication irrevocable trusts  the current federal estate tax irc  friend or foe january   by kristina leave a comment the following is a repost of a blog recently written by attorney dale krause of krause financial services attorney krause is also a fellow member of the national academy of elder law attorneys naela the original version can be found here an irrevocable trust can offer a grantor lifetime control over his or her assets of the trust is established with the following provisions all taxable income shall be disbursed to the grantor the grantor shall have the right to direct how the trust assets are held or reinvested and the grantor shall have a limited power of appointment over the final distributions of the trust this power shall be in favor of a limited class of beneficiaries consisting of the grantor’s children and grandchildren the disbursements do not have to be in equal amounts or shares after the trust is established totally funded and  months passes the grantor can qualify for medicaid benefits none of the trust assets will be included in the grantor’s medicaid application in that they are outside of the  month lookback period for uncompensated transfers the grantor will qualify for medicaid benefits with generally his or her personal property a prepaid funeral plan and  or less of cash assets medicaid eligibility will require that the grantor pay substantially all of his or her monthly income to the nursing home including that received from social security any pension and the trust the only monthly income retained by the grantor is a personal needs allowance which amount is designed to provide him or her with toiletries and other personal items nationally the personal needs allowance ranges between  to  from an income tax viewpoint in that the grantor retained all the taxable income and a limited power of appointment over the final distributions of the trust the trust is deemed a “grantor trust” see irc  grantor trusts do not pay any income taxes instead the income flows directly out of the trusts to the grantor to be placed on their personal income tax returns for many the end result is a lower total tax in that the trust tax rates for individuals are much lower than those for nongrantor trusts from an income planning standpoint in that the grantor retained the right to direct the investment of trust assets the income taxes can be minimized or totally eliminated if the trustee is directed to invest the trust assets in taxdeferred annuities no income is recognized from a taxdeferred annuity until the trustee either elects to take a withdrawal or annuitize the product from a gift tax viewpoint again since the grantor retained all taxable income and a limited power of appointment over the final distributions of the trust these provisions prevent the funding of the trust from being treated as a “completed gift” see irc a the end result is that without a taxable gift no gift tax will be due nor the requirement that a gift tax return be completed and filed finally from an estate tax viewpoint in that the transaction is being treated not as a completed gift the trust assets will be included in the grantor’s gross estate the end result is that certain trust assets will receive an automatic stepup in basis see irc a for example if a grantor paid  for a house and made lifetime improvements of  his or her cost basis is  at the time of the grantor’s death assuming it occurred prior to  if the house was worth  the beneficiaries would receive a tax basis of  thus if they later sold it for  or less they would not owe any capital gains tax the sale would be taxfree however as a result of irc a being repealed on december   the aforementioned tax result will not take place instead if the grantor’s death occurs in  the beneficiaries will receive a tax basis of  – which is likely to result in the payment of capital gains tax when the property is later sold the present law states that each trust asset will receive a basis equal to the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the grantordecedent or its fair market value on the grantordecedent’s date of death whichever is lesser see irc  filed under estate plan review estate taxes family federal estate taxes trusts uncategorized tagged with capital gains tax estate tax
