search  reasons vector group ltd is not a top dividend stock is this even a cigarette company anymore can it continue to pay out such a big dividend brian stoffel tmfcheesehead dec   at pm at first blush it might actually seem like a fairytale investment for those nearing or in retirement a company hawking an incredibly addictive product a  dividend yield and a yearly stock dividend that nets an additional  gain but if you dont dig into vector groups nysevgr full story you could be making a big mistake the maker of ultradiscount cigarettes like pyramid grand prix and ecigarette zoom isnt as solid as the stocks  jump in  might have you believe some of vector groups most popular discount brands source vector group  here are three big reasons why investors need to be cautious when it comes to buying shares of this cigarette company discount cigarettes are in steep decline for most of its life as a publicly traded company vector was one of the few players focused on the ultradiscount brands of cigarettes it worked fairly well for them since bigger players like altria and reynolds american focused on the pricing power of upscale brands and the rest was left to vector but times have changed competition is heating up for discount cigarettes and vector is having trouble keeping pace while the companys domestic market share topped out at  in   following six straight years of increases  it has declined to  over the past twelve months within the discount cigarette industry rivals have begun capturing more customers vectors cigarette business recorded a  drop in volume during the third quarter and its market share within the subindustry fell from  in  to  last year its not just cigarettes anymore many retirees  and dividend investors in general  are comforted by buying shares of companies that produce things they understand while buying shares of vector group might lead you to believe you are mainly investing in a cigarette company that is quickly changing perhaps sensing the decline in the discount cigarette market vector management began branching out a few years back into the realestate business through its wholly owned subsidiary new valley vector has a  stake in one of new york citys biggest residential realestate companies douglas elliman from a purely financial standpoint that decision has actually been a boon for investors and helps explain why shares are up  this year despite declining cigarette volumes the amount of adjusted ebitda the realestate division has brought in has boomed over the past three years in  it accounted for just  of adjusted ebitda over the past twelve months that percentage has mushroomed to  at first glance this isnt a terrible development but it requires extra due diligence on the part of investors and a realization that any trouble in the nyc realestate market could wreak havoc on this cigarette companys cash flow an unsustainable dividend but perhaps the most damning evidence that vector group isnt a top dividend stock is the simple unsustainability of its dividend in the end theres a reason todays yield sits at about  investors dont think its that safe consider the fact that free cash flow fcf  the amount of cash a company puts in its pocket every year minus capital expenditures  is the lifeblood of any dividend paying company over the past four years vectors free cash flow has come nowhere near being able to cover the companys payouts vector groups unsustainable dividend create infographics it should be noted that in last quarters investor presentation management showed how proforma fcf was much higher than in the chart above but that these numbers represented proforma adjusted ebitda less proforma capital expenditures unfortunately the whole reason to analyze a companys fcf  instead of earnings or pro forma adjusted ebitda  is because it represents the real amount of money a company took in during a year minus what it spent on capital expenditures by using pro forma adjusted ebitda we simply dont get the same kind of reliability add these three factors together and i think there are definitely better places for your investment dollars today   brian stoffel has no position
