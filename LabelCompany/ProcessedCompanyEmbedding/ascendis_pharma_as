deficiency ghd  at endotwo posters described the clinical development program for transcon growth hormone including results of the pediatric ghd phase  trial which provided the foundation for the ongoing phase  programfor the first time ascendis researchers also presented data regarding the companys proprietary autoinjector device showing that data collected from  patients caregivers and healthcare professionals found the autoinjector easytouse  with multiple features designed to create a patientcentric experience the autoinjector will be used in the extension phase of the height

pediatric patients with ghd said aristides k maniatis md faap pediatric endocrinologist from rocky mountain pediatric endocrinology and an investigator in the height trial  the phase  data demonstrated similar efficacy safety and tolerability of transcon growth hormone compared to daily growth hormone therapy and i am pleased to be participating in this important phase  studytranscon

over a hour period helping to address limitations of available therapiestwo posters at endo reviewed the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of transcon pth in animal modelspreclinical data in two separate models demonstrated the infusionlike profile of transcon pth following oncedaily administration  studies in healthy monkeys also showed transcon pth increased serum calcium while reducing urinary calcium excretion  in the latebreaking poster a study in rats who were pthdeficient following thyroparathyroidectomy showed transcon pth normalized serum calcium and phosphorus this was compared to a higher daily dose of pth a currently available pth replacement therapy which did not additionally the data suggested positive effects on bone turnover at evaluated doseswe are excited about the potential of transcon pth which may more fully control all aspects of hypoparathyroidism and its underlying disease pathophysiology said david b karpf md ascendis pharmas vice president of clinical development and a practicing endocrinologist at stanford university  clinical trials have demonstrated that an infusionlike profile is superior to once or twice daily injections of pth  transcon pth has the potential to become a true pth replacement therapy as it is designed to maintain physiologic pth levels around the clock potentially offering patients a significant treatment

reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two

these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive

cannot take progress for granted we cannot take progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn
