spirit and opportunities that the “open data” movement spread throughout the united states and the united kingdom is offering to the business worldwe operate in a scenario marked by the massive spreading of digital technologies and the need to reconfigure the modalities in which we communicate and relate with companies institutions and citizensin this context we believe that the “open” sharing of corporate data canimprove the market in which we operate accelerating the confrontation between the companies competing in the liberalised energy market and supporting the decisionmaking processes inside and outside our companyincrease transparency giving greater visibility to our activity and making the dialogue with citizens institutions and local authorities more involving sharing economic and financial data and other information regarding corporate sustainability means increasing participation and fully facing the great challenges of the energy generation market in italy and in the worldfavour technological innovation that represents a major drive for the country’s economic growth making corporate data available means encouraging the development and spreading of new applications mashups and viewing systems capable of improving important aspects of our daily life and that can help us face the issues associated with environmental sustainabilitywith these objectives
