the assets pay a fixed rate and will not be hedged as such fitch has stressed the transaction structure using its aaa and aa liborup stress assumptions evolving wholesale market the us wholesale vehicle market has been normalizing following strong performance in recent years fitch expects that increasing offlease vehicle supply and pressure from increased production levels will lead to decreased residual realizations during the life of the transaction quality of origination underwriting and servicing platform world omni demonstrates adequate abilities as originator underwriter and servicer as evidenced by historical delinquency credit loss and residual value rv loss performance of the managed portfolio and securitizations rating sensitivities unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles andor increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and would likely result in declines of ce and loss coverage levels available to the notes hence fitch conducts sensitivity analyses by increasing the transactions initial base case rv and credit loss assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes the increases to the base case losses are applied such that they represent moderate x and severe x stresses respectively and are intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to unexpected deterioration of a trusts performance the presale report is available to all investors on fitchs web site at wwwfitchratingscom
