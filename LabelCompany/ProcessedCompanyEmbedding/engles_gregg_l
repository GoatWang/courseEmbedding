officer april – sidelights gregg l engles serves as chief executive officer and board chair of dean foods the numberone processor and distributor of milk and milk products in the united states little known outside of the dairy world engles almost singlehandedly consolidated that industry in the s as he bought and merged dozens of small regional producers he credits his lawschool background as one of the keys to his success in negotiating deals i never wanted to be a lawyer he told cathy sivak a writer for dairy field  but i thought it was good general training for the business world born in  in durant oklahoma engles came from a family with an ardent devotion to educational pursuits his father a doctor was one of four physicians among his five brothers their mother had once been a teacher and in her later years ran an informal preschool for her grandchildren out of her home she was totally committed to the notion that education would be what would separate people in the future in terms of personal success engles recalled in the interview with sivak for dairy field  engles moved to the denver colorado area with his family when he was eight years old and earned his undergraduate degree from dartmouth college in new hampshire he went on to yale university school of law and served a clerkship—an internship of sorts for law school students or new graduates—with anthony kennedy a judge with the united states court of appeals ninth circuit in san francisco kennedy would later be appointed to the us supreme court engles however was unsure about his own longterm prospects in the field he took and passed the bar exams for colorado and texas and practiced briefly but realized that most of the young attorneys a few years his senior did not seem to derive much satisfaction from their jobs the entrepreneurs he came to know by contrast were enthusiastic and energized by their careers engles took a job in the office of a dallas investor in order to gain some practical experience his first idea for a business venture involved a scheme to sell timeshares for corporate aircraft but he was unable to convince enough potential investors the plan proved slightly ahead of its time for similar ventures in the late s catering to the executive class in need of access to a private jet became extremely popular in  engles joined with a business partner and began to make investments in texas real estate a few years later the local market fell into a slump and engles lost a great deal of money but he and the business partner had better luck with their next scheme they borrowed nearly all of the  million purchase price for a packagedice company in texas that was the original product for the company that became the southland corporation owners and franchisers of  stores southland was heavily in debt at the time and forced to sell off a few subsidiaries including reddy ice after acquiring reddy ice in  engles began buying other small regional ice companies and folding them into the business within a few years reddy ice became the largest packagedice company in the united states a business mentor who had worked in the dairy industry for many years then suggested that the milk business might be a good candidate for the same type of consolidation both products needed reliable refrigerated transportation and had been dominated by local companies for decades moreover the us supermarket industry was undergoing a wave of consolidation and the larger companies that were coming to dominate the market were interested in dealing with one major dairy supplier instead of several small regional ones engles followed the advice and bought suiza dairy of san juan puerto rico in  soon merging it with reddy ice and folding a newly acquired florida dairy velda farms into the operations as well over the next few years engles began buying more dairies and consolidating operations until the newly renamed suiza foods corporation became a publicly traded company in  it reached the  billion sales mark a year later and engles decided to sell off the ice business to concentrate solely on the dairy market between  and  suiza bought  more dairy producers in deals that engles negotiated personally then in december of  he bought dean foods and merged it with suiza in a  billion deal the chicagobased dean foods was the only other dairy company besides suiza that had a national presence and engles decided to keep the dean brand name for the newly merged company which cornered almost onethird of the us milk market it also posts strong sales in the milkalternative market with its silk soy milk and lactaid lactosereduced milk products and makes a raft of other grocerystore items as well such as horizon organic dairy products international delight coffee creamers and morningstar foods frozen products married with one child engles presides over a dallasbased company with  employees and  revenues of  billion often the dairies that came under the suiza or dean foods umbrella were familyrun businesses but many of the next generation wanted to go off and do new things engles explained to rocky mountain news journalist janet forgrieve it turned into a great thing all around he also felt that he was involved in a business with a legacy of strong intergenerational values not unlike the ones with which he was raised when sivak the dairy field writer asked him what the favorite part of his job was he replied that it was the wholesomeness of it and i dont mean just the product the industry is just chock full of really nice people with outstanding personal and professional values he did admit however that the same factor also presented the most challenging part of his job noting that dairy farmers regularly get up long before dawn to start the days milking engles told sivak that i hate the feeling that i spend between  to  am catching up with people who have already finished their day sources dairy field  october  forbes

dean foods company  mckinney avenue suite  dallas texas  httpwwwdeanfoodscom ■ gregg engles presided over a consolidation of the dairy industry first as head of suiza foods corporation and then as chairman and chief executive officer of dean foods company dean foods company became the largest processor and distributor of milk in the united states early years in colorado although born in oklahoma gregg engles grew up in the denver colorado area he attended dartmouth college and studied law at yale university after graduation in  engles worked as a law clerk for judge anthony kennedy who at the time was serving on the united states court of appeals ninth circuit and later became an associate justice of the united states supreme court in  while a clerk engles attempted to form a timeshare business for corporate aircraft but was unable to raise funds engles was ahead of his time because jet timeshares later became a huge business engles was admitted to the colorado state bar in  and to the state bar of texas in  but he decided not to practice law while pursuing his unsuccessful aircraft timeshare venture engles had met entrepreneurs who impressed him as being fully engaged in their work in contrast many of the young lawyers seemed unenthusiastic about their jobs even though they were buying new cars and homes engles decided that his biggest personal risk was getting hooked on a lifestyle that would handcuff him to a job according to june eichbaum and victoria reese of chief legal officer  pursues entrepreneurial career engles went to work for an investor in dallas texas who made investments in private companies through the business he met a partner bob kaminski and began investing in real estate in  again engless timing was off the texas real estate market was poised for a major downturn the ventures went so poorly that engles and his partner were almost bankrupt in  the southland corporation which later became eleven had excessive debt because of a management buyout and needed to raise cash engles and kaminski paid  million almost entirely borrowed for the southland subsidiary reddy ice group a producer of packaged ice using reddy ice engles and his partners began acquiring other ice companies and consolidating the local ice industry gayle beshears who had led the ice operations for eleven advised engles by  reddy ice had acquired  ice plants beshearss brother cletes tex beshears was a semiretired veteran of the dairy industry he suggested that the larger dairy industry could be consolidated as reddy ice had consolidated the ice business acquires suiza dairy in  engles and his partners acquired suiza dairy in san juan puerto rico as the first step in their dairy consolidation plan engless strategy was to buy the leading producer in a region acquire other nearby producers and then consolidate operations to capitalize on the economies of scale and increase profit in the dairy industry engless timing was right engles had an advantage in the consolidation of the dairy industry because his customers in the grocery industry were going through a similar consolidation the large grocery companies wanted to reduce the number of vendors and preferred dealing with a large dairy that had a national presence in addition changes in processing and transportation technologies increased the shelf life of dairy products and processors became able to ship greater distances in  engles management corporation bought velda farms another dairy and in  engles merged reddy ice into the dairy acquisitions to form suiza foods corporation in  suiza foods corporation went public providing additional capital for growth and spurring further acquisitions suiza foods reached sales of  billion in  suiza foods sold reddy ice in  to focus on the dairy operations suiza foods made more than  more acquisitions from its initial public offering through  when suiza foods became the nations largest dairy processor and distributor that year suiza foods was named dairy supplier of the year by walmart because of a large sales increase a  percent ontime delivery record and innovative marketing programs at the acquired companies engles attempted to preserve the entrepreneurial spirit of the local management and made bonuses dependent on performance joining suiza foods was an attractive option for many local and familyheld businesses the family and employees could continue in the dairy business yet have greater access to capital new technologies and branded products suiza foods corporation becomes dean foods company in december  suiza foods corporation acquired dean foods company and suiza foods corporation changed its name to dean foods company after the dean foods acquisition the new company had a  percent share of the milk market engles became chairman when howard dean retired in april  dean foods company sold dairy products under more than  different brands including country fresh medal gold alta dena and garelick farms and was the only milk company that could serve as a sole supplier to national retailers the company also encompassed silk soy milk horizon organic dairy products and juices international delight coffee creamers and maries dips and dressings the company licensed the brands hersheys land o lakes and folgers for use on its milks and milkshakes creamers and milk and coffee beverages dean foods company was also one of the nations largest pickle processors engless transformation of the dairy industry was analogous to what herb kellehers southwest airlines accomplished in air transportation and what sam waltons walmart did in retailing the dairy business will never be the same wrote shad rowe of d—dallasft worth  william heuslein writing for forbes  quoted food analyst william leach describing engles as a visionary after the acquisition of dean foods company engles and the company entered a new phase much of the plan for consolidation of the dairy industry through acquisitions had been completed dean foods companys strategy turned toward increasing branded products and producing higher margins management style in addition to his fulltime role at dean foods company engles remained a partner in engles urso follmer capital formed in  engles served as a director of one of the groups portfolio companies evercom which provided pay phones in prisons in  engles urso follmer capital purchased the vacuum cleaner company electrolux and engles served as a director of that private company engles continued to seize opportunities despite poor timing and missteps in his early endeavors he told eichbaum and reese many lawyers let knowledge of risk paralyze them they focus exclusively on risk while entrepreneurs focus primarily on opportunity the person who can simultaneously perceive the opportunity and the risk has a competitive advantage rowe described engless career path as follows a smart capable person becomes consumed by a business opportunity so big that both the business and the individual grow to levels unimaginable once even to him rowe also noted people who meet engles frequently describe him as scary smart engles himself saw his strengths as doing deals and attracting wellqualified people engles served on the boards of directors of a number of charitable and industry organizations include the grocery manufacturers of america southern
