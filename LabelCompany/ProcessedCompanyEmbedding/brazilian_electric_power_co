the question should you buy brazils electric utilities for their high yield the short answer is a maybe but not yet one needs to defer the purchase recognize the risks limit exposure and determine the

investment candidates although i am focused on building a highyield portfolio some of these highyield investment candidates are struggling  both from an ebita and shareprice perspective the dividend

usdshare for  and  from a dividend yield perspective there is definitely a pattern government controlled generally yields in the  range  large private sector is around  and small private sector is at the two extremes  either little or no dividend or  this is not to propose that this is all that you need to make your investment decisions  additional research should include income statement eg earnings growth and profitability and balance sheet eg debt levels  and all of these electric utilities have substantial debt levels assessments as a subsequent step lets examine the shareprice performance for each of the  categories note all graphs courtesy of cibc investors edge government controlled whether state or federally controlled this year chart shows that the two governmentcontrolled largecaps share prices peaked in  and  and subsequently are not faring well eletrobrás the lower darkgreen line is on a slippery slope down and cemig the heavygold line is trading near its  price as we can see from the oneyear chart below the electric utility share prices fell sharply after the governmentinstituted electricity price cuts in the autumn of  copel the purple line is the only one of the utilities which has seen a partial shareprice recovery light the thin gold line was declining more slowly than the others but has fallen precipitously in the past few weeks from a personal investment perspective i would like to coown a utility with the government of brazil the benefits include guaranteed solvency dividends and often generous rate increases the problem is that the negative growth reduced dividends increased payroll and retirement costs other taxation and government pricing impacts are probably not yet fully reflected in their share prices from a macroeconomic perspective the impending currency gdp inflation regulatory and other problems are probably not yet fully reflected in the brazilian stock market large private sector as can be seen from the year chart the  largecaps which are not controlled by the federal or state governments are doing relatively well tractebel seems to have been trading with an upward trajectory and attained a plateau price since the end of  cpfl peaked in early  and seems to have found support in the  zone the year charts show a trading range for both of these largecapitalization privatesector electric utilities tractebel is outperforming cpfl but is has a  yield compared to  from cpfl so the overall return is probably similar small private sector i was able to provide  examples for the year chart for the small private sector category equeypk had outlier data which flatlined the graphs for other securities and epumyob was not eligible for graphing mpx outperformed aes tiete and cteep while the latter two were steady eddies over the period the year chart includes equatorial which substantially outperformed the others over this period aes tiete is the middleofthe road and cteep is the underperformer aes tiete and cteep fell off a cliff in september  at the time of the government intervention in electricity pricing and both have found a new lower trading range relative results finally lets compare representative securities from each of the  groupings this year graph shows cpfl the thinorange line  the private large cap  as the best performer for most of the timeframe governmentcontrolled cemig the thickgold line is the nextbest performer with cteep the thinblue line as the generally worst performer  except for when the securities were recovering from the  financial crisis the year chart follows the same trend as the longterm one with lower trading ranges for all securities  least so for cpfl  since the september  state intervention on electricity prices of course none of these graphs include the impact of dividends upon investor returns despite this the graphs do demonstrate that investors require an excellent yield to compensate for the priceperformance of the securities and the economic risks of the brazilian economy conclusion depending upon your investment timehorizon and yield requirements you may find certain brazilian electric utility investment opportunities attractive given a lowgrowth developed world that said as was previously discussed the macroeconomic situation in brazil is deteriorating with increased inflation and declining gdp there are conflicting government policies and taxation which should impact investors decisions external factors are also exacerbating brazils stagflation a recent example of an external factor is an appreciating us dollar has caused brazil to remove a tax on foreign investment inflows which they hope will moderate the plunge in their currency the currency has depreciated from a march  high of  brazilian reals to the usd to its current price of around brl or an  drop recently increased electric utility industry and other regulation and taxation will dampen investor returns from this perspective investments in brazil generally and electric utilities specifically should be deferred based on the general direction of the graphs and the brazilian economy it appears that one should wait for an additional    decline in share prices before purchasing positions dividend yield is a critical component of my personal investment decision as brazil has high inflation and the electric utilities generally have had falling share prices this past year i suggest that one needs to recover over  from dividend yields to consider these investments from both a dividend yield and technical perspective my  future stock picks are all in the private sector  aesaypk cpl and ctpzypk  abbreviation  name approx yield reasoning  year div growth category  aes tiete sa  consistently

brazil and paraguay on the paraná river natural gas generation is second in importance representing about  of total capacity close to the  goal for  established in  by the ministry of energy and mines this reliance on abundant hydroelectric resources allegedly reduces the overall generation costs however this large dependence on hydropower makes the country especially vulnerable to supply shortages

energy has decided to generate  of new supplies from hydropower  from wind and biomass such as bagasse and  from gas and other sources wind in the northeast is strongest during the dry season when hydropower plants produce less so the two energy sources are seasonally complementary hydroelectric plantsedit brazil has an untapped hydropower potential of  mw including about  mw in protected regions for which there are no development plans the government expects to develop the rest by  most new hydropower plants are runofriver plants that are less damaging to the environment because their reservoirs are small however they are more vulnerable to droughts and less efficient because only a fraction of their capacity can be used during the dry season the national agency for electricity

thermoelectric power is somewhat jeopardized by the lack of secure gas supplies in fact having a secure gas contract is a prerequisite to build a new thermoelectric plant and to participate in a new

continue to grow at a quick pace the income elasticity of demand for electricity is estimated by eletrobras at above unity between  and  electricity demand increased on average by  per cent per year while gdp grew by  per cent on average per year investment is therefore needed to boost generation and transmission capacity because there is limited excess supply despite the reduction in demand following the energy rationing program implemented in  in response to the energy crisis access to electricityedit brazil together with chile is the country with the highest access rate in latin

energy and mines mme has the overall responsibility for policy setting in the electricity sector while aneel which is linked to the ministry of mines and energy is the brazilian electricity regulatory agency created in  by law  aneels function is to regulate and control the generation transmission and distribution of power in compliance with the existing legislation and with the directives and policies dictated by the central government the national council for energy policies cnpe is an advisory body to the mme in charge of approving supply criteria and structural projects while the electricity industry monitoring committee cmse monitors supply continuity and security aneel and the ministry of environment play almost no part in which investment projects go ahead but they only influence how projects are executed once the decision has been taken both have had their bosses resign rather than supporting infrastructure projects in the amazon the operator of the national electricity system ons is a nonprofit private entity created in august  that is responsible for the coordination and control of the generation and transmission installations in the national interconnected system sin the ons is under aneels control and regulation the power commercialization chamber ccee successor of mae mercado atacadista de energia electrica is the operator of the commercial market the initial role of the operator was to create a single integrated commercial electricity market to be regulated under published rules this role has become more active since now ccee is in charge of the auction system the rules and commercialization procedures that regulate ccees activities are approved by aneel finally the power research company epe was created in  with the specific mission of developing an integrated longterm planning for the power sector in brazil its mission is to carry out studies and research services in the planning of the energy sector in areas such as power oil and natural gas and its derivates coal renewable energy resources and energy efficiency among others its work serves as input for the planning and implementation of actions by the ministry of energy and mines in the formulation of the national energy policy the brazilian electricity model is fully deregulated which allows generators to sell all of their assured energy via freely negotiated contracts with consumers above mw or via energy auctions administered by ccee see energy auctions below  under this model distributors are required to contract  of their expected

the electricity sectoredit the situation prior to the reforms the statedominated modeledit the power sector in brazil was essentially in governments hands until the early s the sector had seen remarkable development in the s however by the late s the stateownership model was on the verge of collapse this delicate situation was the result of heavily subsidized tariffs and a revenue shortfall in the sector of about us billion which led to the delay in the construction of about  large hydro plants due to lack of funds for investment efforts to address the deterioration of the sector were not successful a situation that further intensified the need for deep reforms a major commitment was made by president cardoso to carry out a substantial reform of the brazilian electricity sector the first reforms introduced in the power sector were aimed to allow the participation of private capital and also to improve its economic situation the s reformsedit the project for restructuring the brazilian electric sector reseb which laid down the first steps for the implementation of the power sector reform was initiated in  during the administration of president cardoso the objective of the reform was to build a more competitive power sector with the creation of a level playing field for private sector participation in addition stateowned utilities and assets were privatized although transmission assets were not privatized most of the expansion of the transmission network has been carried out by private capital this reform also led to the creation in  of aneel brazils national electricity regulatory agency a quasiindependent regulatory body in charge of overseeing the electricity sector however the main restructuring steps were taken with the enactment of the  law law  those steps included the creation of an independent operator of the national transmission system ons and an operator of the commercial market mae which did not become operational until  as a result of the reforms of the power sector new capital was attracted both in terms of privatization and greenfield projects some of the stateowned generation capacity was acquired by foreign investors such as tractebel aes prisma energy el paso and duke which became significant producers in addition local investors such as industrial groups large customers utilities and pension funds also invested heavily in the national generation sector other companies such as edf électricité de france endesa and chilectra focused on the distribution segment a segment in which privatization brought improved quality of service and a reduction of theft nonpayments and technical losses however the reforms were not successful in preventing the energy crisis that was to unfold in  installed capacity expanded by only  per cent during  whereas electricity demand increased by  per cent in  as the power shortage was already foreseen the president cardoso administration made efforts to increase private investment in the electricity sector through a priority thermal power program ppt that aimed at the expeditious construction of more than  gasfired thermal plants unfortunately the needed investment did not materialize and the crisis became unavoidable the  crisis and the governments responseedit brazil was faced with one of the most serious energy crises in its history in  the crisis was the direct result of a sequence of a few years drier than average in a country with over  of hydroelectric generation capacity additionally several delays in the commissioning of new generation plants and transmission problems in the third circuit from the itaipu hydropower plant accounted for a third of the energy deficit reservoir levels reached such low levels that supply could not be ensured for more than four months it was soon clear that strict demand reduction programs would be needed to avoid widespread blackouts in june  the government created the crisis management board cge chaired by president cardoso himself the cge received special powers among which was the authority to set up special tariffs implement compulsory rationing and blackouts and bypass normal bidding procedures of the purchase of new plant equipment instead of resorting to rolling blackouts the government chose to apply a quota system quotas were established for all the consumers based on historical and target consumption level applying bonuses for consumption well below the prescribed level penalties for overconsumption and some freedom for the large users to trade their quotas in a secondary market the governments goal of reducing historical consumption levels by at least  for an eightmonth period was successfully achieved with the government having to pay over us million in bonuses to residential industrial and commercial customers this achievement allowed the system to overcome that long period without blackouts and brownouts and proved the potential of demandside management and energy efficiency efforts which were able to create a virtual capacity of mw helping the country to bridge the supply demand gap in a very economic way in addition the government launched a program for contracting emergency generation capacity with bids for a total of mw of new thermal capacity accepted however the crisis affected numerous actors generators and distributors experienced a  reduction in their revenues due to the contraction in consumption this situation was eventually addressed by an increase of tariffs approved by the government the financial situation of distributors was also damaged with customers also suffering from the increase in electricity prices  in nominal terms between  and  the  reforms energy auctionsedit in january  the new administration led by luiz inácio lula da silva took over among criticism of the reforms introduced in the electricity sector by the administration of president cardoso supporting a model in which the system should be fully regulated the pending privatizations of three generation subsidiaries of the large stateowned utility eletrobras were stopped however despite initial expectations the new administration opted for a model that clearly aims to attract longterm private investment to the sector and that heavily relies on competition in addition the existing institutions were preserved and in some cases strengthened with a new company epe created with the specific mission of developing an integrated longterm planning for the power sector in brazil the new legislative framework was defined by law  which established clear stable and transparent rules aimed at ensuring supply and the continuous expansions of the intrinsic sector activities generation transmission and distribution the expansion was linked to a fair return on investments and to universal service access together with tariff adjustments decree  approved the regulatory framework for the power sector specifying specific provisions to achieve the objectives of the reform  one of the defining elements of the model adopted by the new administration is the establishment of energy auctions as the main procurement mechanism for distribution companies to acquire energy to serve their captive consumers this initiative assisted in the introduction of competition in the power sector and also helped to address some of the existing market imperfections under this system auctions of capacity from new generation projects will be held three to five years in advance of delivery dates the ministry of mines and energy wants to ensure that the totality of future expansion needs is met and that plants are only built once they have won bids in energy auctions and are guaranteed longterm contracts the first auction was held in december  with contracts for a total of about gw traded tariffs and subsidiesedit tariffsedit average electricity tariffs for the different sectors in  were as follows residential  us¢kwh industrial  us¢kwh

private actors in the power sector between  and  amounted to us million in  projects however despite brazils deregulation and higher tariffs in the new energy auction system investment particularly in generation has slowed significantly this situation is not considered to be the result of concerns about the regulatory model or auction pricing caps but it reflects the lack of available projects the existing delays in granting environmental licenses and the uncertainties on the bolivian gas supply explain to a great extent the lack of hydroelectric and gasfired thermoelectric projects respectively the investment required in power generation over the next  years is r billion or around us billion april   this high investment will only be realized if the government succeeds in

accounting for the total and nonrenewable unit exergy costs and specific co emissions of brazilian electricity is performed by flórezorrego et al  comprising thermal nuclear hydro wind farms and biomassfired power plants the analysis starts from the fuel obtainment and continues through the different stages of construction fuel transportation and processing operation and decommissioning of the plant with electricity generation as the desired output this approach allows the calculation of direct co emissions as well as the upstream and downstream emissions which play an important role in some technologies in this way a better comparison between the utilization of different fuels in the electricity generation can be achieved an iterative calculation procedure is used to determine the unit exergy costs of electricity and processed fuels since both electricity and processed fuel are used in their own production routes as it was expected fossilfired power plants presents the highest specific co emissions with the coalfired power plants leading the group however even though fossilfired power plants presents the most marked environmental impacts their total unit exergy costs are much lower than that presented by sugar cane bagassefired power plants this shows that although almost renewable the typical configurations of sugar cane bagassefired power plants are far from being efficient technologies hydro and wind farms present the lowest specific co emissions as well as the lowest unit exergy cost due to the high participation of renewable sources in the production of electricity near to  of the total brazilian electricity mix emissions are found to be  and  times lower than europe and world electricity mixes also owed to the higher efficiency of hydroelectric power plants which contribute to the major part of the electricity generation in brazil the total unit exergy cost is lower and thus exergy efficiency of electricity generation is higher if compared with countries based on fossil fuels for electricity generation apparently total exergy cost of wind and naturalgas fired technologies are almost the same but contrarily to the wind power plants the nonrenewable unit exergy costs of ngfired power plants is practically equal to the total cost it should be noted that this result is a consequence of the efficiency assumed for wind power plants if energy storage is to be taken into account for intermittent technologies such as wind farms the total exergy cost could be slightly increased the upstream and downstream co emissions in the coal route represent a very small part of the total co emissions if compared with the direct emissions of coal burning in the power plant finally it is pointed out that controversies related to the flooding dams of vast zones with complex ecosystems should be carefully analysed since according to the results reported by dones et al the ghg emissions could be increased up to achieve emission levels comparable to those of gas combined cycles power plants external assistanceedit interamerican development bankedit the interamerican development bank idb is currently april  supporting several projects and

reform was to build a more competitive power sector with the creation of a level playing field for private sector participation in addition stateowned utilities and assets were privatized although transmission assets were not privatized most of the expansion of the transmission network has been carried out by private capital this reform also led to the creation in  of aneel brazils national electricity regulatory agency a quasiindependent regulatory body in charge of overseeing the electricity sector however the main restructuring steps were taken with the enactment of the  law law  those steps included the creation of an independent operator of the national transmission system ons and an operator of the commercial market mae which did not become operational until  as a result of the reforms of the power sector new capital was attracted both in terms of privatization and greenfield projects some of the stateowned generation capacity was acquired by foreign investors such as tractebel aes prisma energy el paso and duke which became significant producers in addition local investors such as industrial groups large customers utilities and pension funds also invested heavily in the national generation sector other companies such as edf électricité de france endesa and chilectra focused on the distribution segment a segment in which privatization brought improved quality of service and a reduction of theft nonpayments and technical losses however the reforms were not successful in preventing the energy crisis that was to unfold in  installed capacity expanded by only  per cent during  whereas electricity demand increased by  per cent in  as the power shortage was already foreseen the president cardoso administration made efforts to increase private investment in the electricity sector through a priority thermal power program ppt that aimed at the expeditious construction of more than  gasfired thermal plants unfortunately the needed investment did not materialize and the crisis became unavoidable the  crisis and the governments responseedit brazil was faced with one of the most serious energy crises in its history in  the crisis was the direct result of a sequence of a few years drier than average in a country with over  of hydroelectric generation capacity additionally several delays in the commissioning of new generation plants and transmission problems in the third circuit from the itaipu hydropower plant accounted for a third of the energy deficit reservoir levels reached such low levels that supply could not be ensured for more than four months it was soon clear that strict demand reduction programs would be needed to avoid widespread blackouts in june  the government created the crisis management board cge chaired by president cardoso himself the cge received special powers among which was the authority to set up special tariffs implement compulsory rationing and blackouts and bypass normal bidding procedures of the purchase of new plant equipment instead of resorting to rolling blackouts the government chose to apply a quota system quotas were established for all the consumers based on historical and target consumption level applying bonuses for consumption well below the prescribed level penalties for overconsumption and some freedom for the large users to trade their quotas in a secondary market the governments goal of reducing historical consumption levels by at least  for an eightmonth period was successfully achieved with the government having to pay over us million in bonuses to residential industrial and commercial customers this achievement allowed the system to overcome that long period without blackouts and brownouts and proved the potential of demandside management and energy efficiency efforts which were able to create a virtual capacity of mw helping the country to bridge the supply demand gap in a very economic way in addition the government launched a program for contracting emergency generation capacity with bids for a total of mw of new thermal capacity accepted however the crisis affected numerous actors generators and distributors experienced a  reduction in their revenues due to the contraction in consumption this situation was eventually addressed by an increase of tariffs approved by the government the financial situation of distributors was also damaged with customers also suffering from the increase in electricity prices  in nominal terms between  and  the  reforms energy auctionsedit in january  the new administration led by luiz inácio lula da silva took over among criticism of the reforms introduced in the electricity sector by the administration of president cardoso supporting a model in which the system should be fully regulated the pending privatizations of three generation subsidiaries of the large stateowned utility eletrobras were stopped however despite initial expectations the new administration opted for a model that clearly aims to attract longterm private investment to the sector and that heavily relies on competition in addition the existing institutions were preserved and in some cases strengthened with a new company epe created with the specific mission of developing an integrated longterm planning for the power sector in brazil the new legislative framework was defined by law  which established clear stable and transparent rules aimed at ensuring supply and the continuous expansions of the intrinsic sector activities generation transmission and distribution the expansion was linked to a fair return on investments and to universal service access together with tariff adjustments decree  approved the regulatory framework for the power sector specifying specific provisions to achieve the objectives of the reform  one of the defining elements of the model adopted by the new administration is the establishment of energy auctions as the main procurement mechanism for distribution companies to acquire energy to serve their captive consumers this initiative assisted in the introduction of competition in the power sector and also helped to address some of the existing market imperfections under this system auctions of capacity from new generation projects will be held three to five years in advance of delivery dates the ministry of mines and energy wants to ensure that the totality of future expansion needs is met and that plants are only built once they have won bids in energy auctions and are guaranteed longterm contracts the first auction was held in december  with contracts for a total of about gw traded tariffs and subsidiesedit tariffsedit average electricity tariffs for the different sectors in  were as follows residential  us¢kwh industrial  us¢kwh

private actors in the power sector between  and  amounted to us million in  projects however despite brazils deregulation and higher tariffs in the new energy auction system investment particularly in generation has slowed significantly this situation is not considered to be the result of concerns about the regulatory model or auction pricing caps but it reflects the lack of available projects the existing delays in granting environmental licenses and the uncertainties on the bolivian gas supply explain to a great extent the lack of hydroelectric and gasfired thermoelectric projects respectively the investment required in power generation over the next  years is r billion or around us billion april   this high investment will only be realized if the government succeeds in

accounting for the total and nonrenewable unit exergy costs and specific co emissions of brazilian electricity is performed by flórezorrego et al  comprising thermal nuclear hydro wind farms and biomassfired power plants the analysis starts from the fuel obtainment and continues through the different stages of construction fuel transportation and processing operation and decommissioning of the plant with electricity generation as the desired output this approach allows the calculation of direct co emissions as well as the upstream and downstream emissions which play an important role in some technologies in this way a better comparison between the utilization of different fuels in the electricity generation can be achieved an iterative calculation procedure is used to determine the unit exergy costs of electricity and processed fuels since both electricity and processed fuel are used in their own production routes as it was expected fossilfired power plants presents the highest specific co emissions with the coalfired power plants leading the group however even though fossilfired power plants presents the most marked environmental impacts their total unit exergy costs are much lower than that presented by sugar cane bagassefired power plants this shows that although almost renewable the typical configurations of sugar cane bagassefired power plants are far from being efficient technologies hydro and wind farms present the lowest specific co emissions as well as the lowest unit exergy cost due to the high participation of renewable sources in the production of electricity near to  of the total brazilian electricity mix emissions are found to be  and  times lower than europe and world electricity mixes also owed to the higher efficiency of hydroelectric power plants which contribute to the major part of the electricity generation in brazil the total unit exergy cost is lower and thus exergy efficiency of electricity generation is higher if compared with countries based on fossil fuels for electricity generation apparently total exergy cost of wind and naturalgas fired technologies are almost the same but contrarily to the wind power plants the nonrenewable unit exergy costs of ngfired power plants is practically equal to the total cost it should be noted that this result is a consequence of the efficiency assumed for wind power plants if energy storage is to be taken into account for intermittent technologies such as wind farms the total exergy cost could be slightly increased the upstream and downstream co emissions in the coal route represent a very small part of the total co emissions if compared with the direct emissions of coal burning in the power plant finally it is pointed out that controversies related to the flooding dams of vast zones with complex ecosystems should be carefully analysed since according to the results reported by dones et al the ghg emissions could be increased up to achieve emission levels comparable to those of gas combined cycles power plants external assistanceedit interamerican development bankedit the interamerican development bank idb is currently april  supporting several projects and

electricity industry monitoring committee cmse monitors supply continuity and security aneel and the ministry of environment play almost no part in which investment projects go ahead but they only influence how projects are executed once the decision has been taken both have had their bosses resign rather than supporting infrastructure projects in the amazon the operator of the national

such as power oil and natural gas and its derivates coal renewable energy resources and energy efficiency among others its work serves as input for the planning and implementation of actions by the ministry of energy and mines in the formulation of the national energy policy the brazilian electricity model is fully deregulated which allows generators to sell all of their assured energy via

accounting for the total and nonrenewable unit exergy costs and specific co emissions of brazilian electricity is performed by flórezorrego et al  comprising thermal nuclear hydro wind farms and biomassfired power plants the analysis starts from the fuel obtainment and continues through the different stages of construction fuel transportation and processing operation and decommissioning of the plant with electricity generation as the desired output this approach allows the calculation of direct co emissions as well as the upstream and downstream emissions which play an important role in some technologies in this way a better comparison between the utilization of different fuels in the electricity generation can be achieved an iterative calculation procedure is used to determine the unit exergy costs of electricity and processed fuels since both electricity and processed fuel are used in their own production routes as it was expected fossilfired power plants presents the highest specific co emissions with the coalfired power plants leading the group however even though fossilfired power plants presents the most marked environmental impacts their total unit exergy costs are much lower than that presented by sugar cane bagassefired power plants this shows that although almost renewable the typical configurations of sugar cane bagassefired power plants are far from being efficient technologies hydro and wind farms present the lowest specific co emissions as well as the lowest unit exergy cost due to the high participation of renewable sources in the production of electricity near to  of the total brazilian electricity mix emissions are found to be  and  times lower than europe and world electricity mixes also owed to the higher efficiency of hydroelectric power plants which contribute to the major part of the electricity generation in brazil the total unit exergy cost is lower and thus exergy efficiency of electricity generation is higher if compared with countries based on fossil fuels for electricity generation apparently total exergy cost of wind and naturalgas fired technologies are almost the same but contrarily to the wind power plants the nonrenewable unit exergy costs of ngfired power plants is practically equal to the total cost it should be noted that this result is a consequence of the efficiency assumed for wind power plants if energy storage is to be taken into account for intermittent technologies such as wind farms the total exergy cost could be slightly increased the upstream and downstream co emissions in the coal route represent a very small part of the total co emissions if compared with the direct emissions of coal burning in the power plant finally it is pointed out that controversies related to the flooding dams of vast zones with complex ecosystems should be carefully analysed since according to the results reported by dones et al the ghg emissions could be increased up to achieve emission levels comparable to those of gas combined cycles power plants external assistanceedit interamerican development bankedit the interamerican development bank idb is currently april  supporting several projects and

electricity industry monitoring committee cmse monitors supply continuity and security aneel and the ministry of environment play almost no part in which investment projects go ahead but they only influence how projects are executed once the decision has been taken both have had their bosses resign rather than supporting infrastructure projects in the amazon the operator of the national

specific mission of developing an integrated longterm planning for the power sector in brazil its mission is to carry out studies and research services in the planning of the energy sector in areas such as power oil and natural gas and its derivates coal renewable energy resources and energy efficiency among others its work serves as input for the planning and implementation of actions by the ministry of energy and mines in the formulation of the national energy policy the brazilian electricity model is fully deregulated which allows generators to sell all of their assured energy via

the electricity sectoredit the situation prior to the reforms the statedominated modeledit the power sector in brazil was essentially in governments hands until the early s the sector had seen remarkable development in the s however by the late s the stateownership model was on the verge of collapse this delicate situation was the result of heavily subsidized tariffs and a revenue shortfall in the sector of about us billion which led to the delay in the construction of about  large hydro plants due to lack of funds for investment efforts to address the deterioration of the sector were not successful a situation that further intensified the need for deep reforms a major commitment was made by president cardoso to carry out a substantial reform of the brazilian electricity sector the first reforms introduced in the power sector were aimed to allow the participation of private capital and also to improve its economic situation the s reformsedit the project for restructuring the brazilian electric sector reseb which laid down the first steps for the implementation of the power sector reform was initiated in  during the administration of president cardoso the objective of the reform was to build a more competitive power sector with the creation of a level playing field for private sector participation in addition stateowned utilities and assets were privatized although transmission assets were not privatized most of the expansion of the transmission network has been carried out by private capital this reform also led to the creation in  of aneel brazils national electricity regulatory agency a quasiindependent regulatory body in charge of overseeing the electricity sector however the main restructuring steps were taken with the enactment of the  law law  those steps included the creation of an independent operator of the national transmission system ons and an operator of the commercial market mae which did not become operational until  as a result of the reforms of the power sector new capital was attracted both in terms of privatization and greenfield projects some of the stateowned generation capacity was acquired by foreign investors such as tractebel aes prisma energy el paso and duke which became significant producers in addition local investors such as industrial groups large customers utilities and pension funds also invested heavily in the national generation sector other companies such as edf électricité de france endesa and chilectra focused on the distribution segment a segment in which privatization brought improved quality of service and a reduction of theft nonpayments and technical losses however the reforms were not successful in preventing the energy crisis that was to unfold in  installed capacity expanded by only  per cent during  whereas electricity demand increased by  per cent in  as the power shortage was already foreseen the president cardoso administration made efforts to increase private investment in the electricity sector through a priority thermal power program ppt that aimed at the expeditious construction of more than  gasfired thermal plants unfortunately the needed investment did not materialize and the crisis became unavoidable the  crisis and the governments responseedit brazil was faced with one of the most serious energy crises in its history in  the crisis was the direct result of a sequence of a few years drier than average in a country with over  of hydroelectric generation capacity additionally several delays in the commissioning of new generation plants and transmission problems in the third circuit from the itaipu hydropower plant accounted for a third of the energy deficit reservoir levels reached such low levels that supply could not be ensured for more than four months it was soon clear that strict demand reduction programs would be needed to avoid widespread blackouts in june  the government created the crisis management board cge chaired by president cardoso himself the cge received special powers among which was the authority to set up special tariffs implement compulsory rationing and blackouts and bypass normal bidding procedures of the purchase of new plant equipment instead of resorting to rolling blackouts the government chose to apply a quota system quotas were established for all the consumers based on historical and target consumption level applying bonuses for consumption well below the prescribed level penalties for overconsumption and some freedom for the large users to trade their quotas in a secondary market the governments goal of reducing historical consumption levels by at least  for an eightmonth period was successfully achieved with the government having to pay over us million in bonuses to residential industrial and commercial customers this achievement allowed the system to overcome that long period without blackouts and brownouts and proved the potential of demandside management and energy efficiency efforts which were able to create a virtual capacity of mw helping the country to bridge the supply demand gap in a very economic way in addition the government launched a program for contracting emergency generation capacity with bids for a total of mw of new thermal capacity accepted however the crisis affected numerous actors generators and distributors experienced a  reduction in their revenues due to the contraction in consumption this situation was eventually addressed by an increase of tariffs approved by the government the financial situation of distributors was also damaged with customers also suffering from the increase in electricity prices  in nominal terms between  and  the  reforms energy auctionsedit in january  the new administration led by luiz inácio lula da silva took over among criticism of the reforms introduced in the electricity sector by the administration of president cardoso supporting a model in which the system should be fully regulated the pending privatizations of three generation subsidiaries of the large stateowned utility eletrobras were stopped however despite initial expectations the new administration opted for a model that clearly aims to attract longterm private investment to the sector and that heavily relies on competition in addition the existing institutions were preserved and in some cases strengthened with a new company epe created with the specific mission of developing an integrated longterm planning for the power sector in brazil the new legislative framework was defined by law  which established clear stable and transparent rules aimed at ensuring supply and the continuous expansions of the intrinsic sector activities generation transmission and distribution the expansion was linked to a fair return on investments and to universal service access together with tariff adjustments decree  approved the regulatory framework for the power sector specifying specific provisions to achieve the objectives of the reform  one of the defining elements of the model adopted by the new administration is the establishment of energy auctions as the main procurement mechanism for distribution companies to acquire energy to serve their captive consumers this initiative assisted in the introduction of competition in the power sector and also helped to address some of the existing market imperfections under this system auctions of capacity from new generation projects will be held three to five years in advance of delivery dates the ministry of mines and energy wants to ensure that the totality of future expansion needs is met and that plants are only built once they have won bids in energy auctions and are guaranteed longterm contracts the first auction was held in december

electricity near to  of the total brazilian electricity mix emissions are found to be  and  times lower than europe and world electricity mixes also owed to the higher efficiency of hydroelectric power plants which contribute to the major part of the electricity generation in brazil the total unit exergy cost is lower and thus exergy efficiency of electricity generation is higher if compared with countries based on fossil fuels for electricity generation apparently total exergy cost of wind and naturalgas fired technologies are almost the same but contrarily to the wind power plants the nonrenewable unit exergy costs of ngfired power plants is practically equal to the total cost it should be noted that this result is a consequence of the efficiency assumed for wind power plants if energy storage is to be taken into account for intermittent technologies such as wind farms the total exergy cost could be slightly increased the upstream and downstream co emissions in the coal route represent a very small part of the total co emissions if compared with the direct emissions of coal burning in the power plant finally it is pointed out that controversies related to the flooding dams of vast zones with complex ecosystems should be carefully analysed since according to the results reported by dones et al the ghg emissions could be increased up to achieve emission levels comparable to those of gas combined cycles power plants external assistanceedit interamerican development bankedit the interamerican development bank idb is currently april  supporting several projects and
