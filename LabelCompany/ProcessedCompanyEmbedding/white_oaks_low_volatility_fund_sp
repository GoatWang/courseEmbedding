some not all  white oaks wealth advisors   client center select page lost decade for some not all a turbulent ten years the s gave us remarkable opportunity and remarkable volatility they tested our patience and many investment strategies they taught us to hold on hang in there and diversify stocks was it really a “lost decade” it depends on how you were invested yes the dow ended the s at  and ended the s at  amounting to a  slip the sp  lost  in the same interval if you had invested a lump sum into an index fund tracking the sp  on december   and left those assets untouched for ten years you would have ended up with a sizable loss well that sounds dismal – but how many of us actually invest this way very few of us make one lump sum investment and just watch it for ten years thanks to diversification rebalancing and constant inflows of new money quite a few investors were able to grow their assets andor outperform the sp  in the past decade particularly if the used broad based diversification the fact is five sectors of the sp  gained  or more across the s health care  utilities  materials  consumer staples  and energy  few articles about the “lost decade” mention this notable factoid the russell  advanced  during the s mutual funds that focused on buying undervalued smallcompany stocks gained an average of  annually in the s outside america developing stock markets shattered all expectations while the developed markets mirrored american performance look at the decadelong gains in key indices in some of the bric nations as measured by cnbccom china  india  brazil  russia  compare all that with the benchmark indices in japan  france  great britain  and germany  in the past decade emerging market mutual funds gained an average of  per year in the last ten years commodities it was a decade of amazing gains in the broad commodities market from the end of  to the end of  gold advanced  how about silver and copper silver gained  and king copper rose  crude oil rose  during the s how great a decade was it for the commodities sector only one notable commodity posted a tenyear loss from  to  that was palladium which retreated  on the other hand we know that  commodities gained  or more across the decade the two biggest gainers during the s were a pair of crops sugar  and cocoa  highs and lows we are  years past the bursting of the tech bubble march  will mark the th anniversary of the nasdaq’s alltime high of  and of course a decadedefining geopolitical event rocked the markets  months later general motors and chrysler filed for bankruptcy protection in  at the start of the decade so did enron – the company that fortune magazine ranked as “most innovative” each year from  in  lehman brothers morgan stanley goldman sachs merrill lynch and washington mutual either folded mutated or were bought up while aig freddie mac and fannie mae were bailed out the dow hit a new high of  in january  a post closing low of  in october  and then ended  at  as the djia gained  that year while the dollar lost  the dow hit new peaks of  on october   and  on october   a close of  on july   officially marked the start of a bear market from march   closing lows to the end of the year the dow shot up  and the sp  advanced  this led to some to entertain tantalizing thoughts about the birth of a new bull market or it is simply a cyclical bull in a secular bear the jury is still out as the saying goes we can hope for the best what did we learn the s taught us lessons about irrational exuberance companies that had never made a dime were probably not worth billions and lessons about the value of diversifying your portfolio we also learned lessons in perseverance those who stayed invested have seen their portfolios make a strong recovery the s put investors through some seemingly unimaginable financial headlines it was a rare decade an aberrant one in stock market history for example the dow hadn’t had a negative decade since the s and it had advanced  over the s and  for the s will we see it make a double or tripledigit advance in the next ten years we don’t know past performance is no indicator of future success yet the awesome potential of the stock market and commodities markets should not be dismissed and with economies healing the world over it is clearly time to look forward and stay invested robert klosterman robert
