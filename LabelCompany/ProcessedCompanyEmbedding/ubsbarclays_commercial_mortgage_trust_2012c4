combination are subsumed within its responsibilities as master servicer under the pooling and servicing agreement for the ubsbarclays c transaction rialto capital advisors llc is the special servicer of the mortgage loans serviced under the pooling and servicing agreement and the  harbor boulevard mortgage loan as a result rialto capital advisors llc is a “servicer” as defined in item aiii of

knows of no material pending legal proceeding involving the trust or any party related to the trust other than routine litigation incidental to the duties of those respective parties and the following with respect to ubs real estate securities inc as sponsor and us bank national association as trustee certificate administrator and custodian ubs real estate securities inc “ubsres” is currently engaged in litigation with respect to various legacy residential mortgagebacked securities transactions some litigants are seeking the repurchase of mortgage loans by ubsres from certain residential mortgage securitization trusts on the basis that the loans are allegedly in breach of contractual representations and warranties in governing transaction documents other litigants are alleging violations of federal andor state securities or common law for alleged misrepresentations and omissions in offering documents in connection with the issuance andor distribution of residential mortgagebacked securities no assurance can be given that one or more of the foregoing actions will not result in material liability to ubsres since  various plaintiffs or groups of plaintiffs primarily investors have filed claims against us bank national association “us bank” in its capacity as trustee or successor trustee as the case may be under certain residential mortgage backed securities “rmbs” trusts the plaintiffs or plaintiff groups have filed substantially similar complaints against other rmbs trustees including deutsche bank citibank hsbc bank of new york mellon and wells fargo the complaints against us bank allege the trustee caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors mortgage loan sellers and servicers for these rmbs trusts and assert causes of action based upon the trustees purported failure to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties concerning loan quality the complaints also assert that the trustee failed to notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and that the trustee purportedly failed to abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default currently us bank is a defendant in multiple actions alleging individual or class action claims against the trustee with respect to multiple trusts as described above with the most substantial case being blackrock balanced capital portfolio et al v us bank national association no  ny sup ct class action alleging claims with respect to approximately  trusts and its companion case blackrock core bond portfolio et al v us bank national association no cv sdny some of the trusts implicated in the aforementioned blackrock cases as well as other trusts are involved in actions brought by separate groups of plaintiffs related to no more than  trusts per case there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any of the litigation or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the rmbs trusts however us bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the rmbs trusts in good faith that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors and that it has meritorious defenses and it intends to contest the plaintiffs’ claims
