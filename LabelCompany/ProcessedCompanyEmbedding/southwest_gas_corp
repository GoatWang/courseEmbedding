jan   billing sw gas is a rip off organization here in pima county azthey overbill even when nobody is home using their service i left tucson for a month zero usage and was still billed over  dollars for that span of time they also blackmail their so called late payment customers requiring an additional deposit or they will cut off service something needs to be done with this out control utility vafisher send email   dec   service was scheduled to have gas turned on today between  am and noon my youngest daughter and i left at about  to get me to work apparently service tech showed up never knocked on door just left a door hangar i have a  month old grandbaby and  other grandchildren in the home and we are expecting snow not only that two of the grandchildren are getting colds and i have a cold i called to find out what was going on the service rep tells me there is nothing they can do we will be without gas until dec th angrywithswg send email   aug   illegal trespass in a previous complaint dr p stated that southwest gas had illegally entered his property via scaling a block wall separating the property from the alley on  at approximately  am i experienced the same situation i came home from running errands to find two men carrying a ladder which they used to scale the block wall from the alley southwest gas defended their actions by claiming they have an easement that allows them access to their equipment without permission i too feel this was unprofessional and unethical as to the legality of the situation i am not trained in law and dont know if their actions were legal or not i do know that even if these men were acting legally they certainly were acting dangerously they could have potentially injured themselves on my property they could have been attacked by the family dog i keep a gun in the house for defense which could provide potenetial danger to these men any of these situations had the potential to end with disastrous results a simple phone call would have prevented any problems but i was told that swg doesnt have the time to schedule appointments nor are they required to do so dr p send email   apr   southwest gas corpillegal property entry southwest gas corp operates under the authority of the arizona corporation commission and is subject to rules r b a andr d i am filing this complaint under rule r a on april  i was away from home from  am until  pm on arrival home i found a small handwritten note on scratchpaper attached to my mailbox  see attached photo  on entry to my home i immediately heard noise was alerted to find a strange man in my fully enclosed yard who said he was from southwest gas and was doing a routine inspection for gas leaks he had no authorization did not have appropriate identification and was accompanied by another man in the alley with a vehicle marked only as heath consultants truck  he said he gained entrance by climbing over the  foot concrete block wall  despite warning signs see attached photos  i immediately called the police on  at  pm the man was adrian ruiz and his accomplice was brian contreras both working for heath consultants which is a contractor for southwest gas this was unprofessional unethical and probable illegal trespass  i was told these men could rather whimsically enter my private property any time they wanted for any reason because the gas company had an easement under ars title   which in no way provides for such illegal entry   i have requested in the least a formal written acknowledgment and apology from both southwest gas corporation and from heath consultants but to date have received nothing i wish this complaint to be made part of the permanent record liz rapuano send email   jan   gas leak next door i have had headaches and have been dizzy for the past  months this past week there were all kinds of south west gas trucks up and down my street i finally asked what was going on the employee of s w gas said there was a gas leak and the home next door to me was evacuated i said oh is that why ive been sick for the past  months the employee laughed i have not had headaches and the dizziness is almost gone since the leak was fixed i should have at least been notified about the situation how did this go undetected for so long will i have lasting effects of this poisoning mr john send email   jan   billing i recently most into a house and was told by my realator southwest gas was my provider i contacted them the want three hundred dollars to set up and another hundred for something else i payed both i checked my bank account so i know they got the payments  still no gas and no hookup its been a month of cold showers and microwave dinners i pretty miserable and almost five hundred poorer they did send me another bill all service charges of course user send email   mar   billing practices i am outraged by southwest gas attempt to charge me a deposite for payng late i am contacting the public utilitys commission i will go solar if nothing else i am low income and they think they can take advantage of that also irish and we fight back user send email   mar   billing practices i agree with all i moved  years ago from one resident to another i had my mother nlaw with me on the account that was her bill to pay there was a balance that i needed to pay in order to have her named removed off the account when i moved into my new place they had me under the belief that this was all one account  but they gave me a new account which i just realized when all this surfaced and when i went to make a payment on the old account they applied to the new account so it shows as if i never made a payment towards old account well one day recent im calling to pay my bill they tell me that i have a balance from my old account  years later so you mean to tell me  years later you people are billing me for something that i thought i paid while im current on my new account they turn my service off for an old account i figure if your not billing for the new address how can you turn me off for an old address and thats their fault for not being current on their billing i never received a bill in the old account that i need to pay they have my address why didnt they send me a bill  years ago even  year ago but their expecting you to pay an old bill and a new bill how can that be fair usbeachbums send email   feb   billing practices i became a southwest gas customer in november  during that time i have been late with my payment several times let me explain why they send out a bill from las vegas to litchfield park arizona  days before it is due back to las vegas if you are one day late it is considered delinquent i think it is completely unreasonable for southwest gas to mail a bill for instance this month on the th and it is due back on the th i live in a suburb of phoenix and they do not deliver the mail every day i got the bill on the rd and with the holiday the th was the first day i could mail it and i have to hope it makes it back to vegas in  days or it’s considered late twice i was traveling i travel for my job the bill came the week i was gone and when i returned it was already late i received a letter dated march   stating that a  deposit is required because i have been delinquent with my payment last month i asked for an explanation of how i was delinquent never been disconnected paid every month and how  was determined to be the amount that was required for a deposit my monthly bill has not been over  and they require almost  times that for a deposit when i signed up for service i sent them a letter from my previous gas company showing that in over a year i was never delinquent i did not receive a response from my request last month all i received was my next bill telling me that the deposit had to be paid by the th or the gas would be disconnected with my payment this month i informed them again that i disputed the deposit i also filled out their customer service form to ask how the deposit was calculated and still i have received no response it’s unreasonable to give someone  days from the day the bill is printed to have the payment back to las vegas it is also unreasonable to demand a deposit and not show how it was calculated i think these are unfair practices that southwest gas is using to get deposits from people who would normally not have had to give a deposit and then they get to use our money without paying interest on it chip send email   feb   billing practices if southwest gas gets  nsf nonsufficient funds in your account in a one year period they will suspend your ability to make any electronic payment for  months  they want cash or western union only  for  months when i told them this was ridiculous the rep actually got rude
