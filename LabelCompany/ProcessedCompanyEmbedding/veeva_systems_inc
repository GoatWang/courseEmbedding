search search veeva systems inc buy at the high the stock is undeniably expensive heres why that shouldnt stop you brian stoffel tmfcheesehead apr   at am the story behind veeva systems nyseveev is pretty simple peter gassner founder of the company used to be an executive at salesforcecom nysecrm while he was convincing companies to try out salesforces cloud solutions he realized that the pharmaceutical industry had some very unique needs that salesforces buildityourself infrastructure couldnt meet so in  he decided to strike out on his own leaving salesforce to found veeva his first product for the market was veeva crm customer relationship management which helped drug companies track what their sales force was doing and who was buying their drugs the company then expanded out to veeva vault  focused on recording storing sharing and abiding by regulatory laws the strategy has worked and the stock has responded in kind veev data by ycharts if you want a piece of the company now it might seem like youve missed the boat does that mean you should avoid buying shares while theyre at alltime highs or should you bite the bullet and pay up for quality heres how to think about it theres no denying this is expensive without a doubt veeva is expensive by almost every traditional metric shares are pricey consider the following and compare it to veevas much larger peer salesforce  company forward pe pfcf peg ratio veeva    salesforce    data source yahoo finance etrade while the two look comparable in terms of what theyll earn in  veeva trades at a  premium in terms of free cash flow and a  premium relative to its growth rates and this completely ignores how veeva is valued relative to the typical sp  stock while the average stock in the sp  trades for about  times trailing earnings veevas pe ratio is over   image source getty images the bottom line is this veeva stock is expensive any troubles the company might experience with competition weakerthanexpected outlooks or even increased investments for the future could cause the stock to drop somewhat dramatically at least over the short run thats why i dont think its wise to back up the truck at this point but theres so much going in the companys favor at the same time veeva has so much going for it chief among everything else is the companys moat when a drug company signs on to veeva crm it would be loath to switch to another crm provider doing so would not only be expensive but it would be cumbersome and likely lead to lots of headaches we call that kind of a moat high switching costs and if switching costs with a crm platform seem high imagine how much higher it would be if a company like veeva was storing all of your missioncritical data from clinical trials thats why once a company signs on with veeva and starts using multiple products they will likely only switch away if  the service becomes awful or  it becomes prohibitively expensive therefore its important to see what kind of business momentum veeva has going for it since  revenue has grown at a compounded rate of  per year that alone speaks to the companys success but if you still arent convinced its worth taking a look at how many drug companies are signing up to use veevas services data source veeva annual report and keep in mind this is just a single years growth crm used to be the companys bread and butter and vault has only been available at scale for a little over three years now and all of this ignores the huge announcement veeva made last year it is looking to offer its cloud solution outside of the pharmaceutical market specifically the company will be offering a solution called vault qualityone the service will be focused initially on industries that tend to be heavily regulated like chemicals manufacturing or consumer packaged goods as a recent interview with the motley fool by veeva president matt wallach highlights this move has the potential to drastically expand veevas total addressable market so how should you approach the situation i suggest that if youre truly interested in this highgrowth highmoat business you should open a starter position and set aside cash for buying at better and better value points in the future such value points might not necessarily mean lower share price but instead a lower pfcf ratio or some other measure by doing so you have skin in the game to keep you exposed to the upside while still having some dry powder to use should the stock fall thats my approach now veeva makes up  of my reallife holdings but i would have no problem increasing that significantly if the market gave me the opportunity brian stoffel owns shares of veeva systems the motley fool owns shares of and recommends veeva systems the motley fool recommends
