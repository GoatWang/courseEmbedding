why of all the spaces in your home injecting your own personality and style into your bedroom can be the most rewarding designing the perfect bedroom is about more than selecting your bedroom colours bed and duvet covers – choosing the right layout is just as important as fabric wallpaper and accessories that said the bedroom is a sensory space so the tactile quality of your options can be an important factor when deciding on bedroom furniture bed linen lighting and flooring and of course the right wardrobes and storage will hold your design together by keeping your bedroom free of clutter

nowhere do you feel more at home than in your kitchenview my projectsview more prosnext pagehow do i choose the right bed and mattressthere is only one unavoidable element to your bedroom and that is the bed so selecting the right one is crucial the bed is the focal point but make sure to choose one that still allows for easy movement around the bedroom whether that is a double queen or king size a four poster bed is the grandest statement of all but really requires a large room with high ceilings to avoid feeling cramped wrought iron bed frames can be both striking and elegant whereas upholstered beds have a beautifully soft finish that add warmth to any bedroom if you are truly working in a tight space a storage bed might be your best option once you have selected a frame by looking at bedroom design ideas look to invest in a great mattress the difference a highquality mattress will make to your night’s sleep and back health makes this a critical choice – whether you prefer a memory foam mattress or the pocket sprung variety the recommended shelf life of a mattress is five to seven years although a top quality mattress may last up to ten the great news is that a price tag and fancy terminology don’t necessarily reflect the quality of a mattress so it really is worth doing your researchhow should i layout my bedroomit’s a good idea to decide first on builtin or freestanding furniture – fitted wardrobes are great for a tidy streamlined use of available space but lovingly chosen pieces such as a beautiful chest of drawers or a vintage dressing table will add originality and personality to your room the bed is the centrepiece of a bedroom so make sure the area surrounding it is not obstructed once you have planned your bedroom layout statement furniture such as ottomans chaises longues and window seats are luxurious bedroom ideas that will add value to any roomwhat is the best way to design a small bedroomhappily there are many spacesaving bedroom ideas that will avoid further cramping what should be a restful space just as clutter is the enemy of small bedrooms underbed storage is your knight in shining armour if you’re lacking space then skip the lowrise platform bed frames and opt for a high bed with lots of room for boxes and rolling underbed storage if you don’t have room for a chest of drawers wallmounted shelves can be a compromise solution fitted wardrobes on either side of the bed can create much needed space for hanging clothes whilst creating a cosy nook to sleep in ensuring your furniture choices are multipurpose is another great way to save space for example a dressing table can double as a work space and a dressing stool with a liftup lid offers hidden storage if you have a really small bedroom bedroom design ideas such as swapping your bed for a comfortable sofa bed futon or even a wall bed can work and opt for sliding wardrobe doors which require less room in front visually pale and simple bedroom colours create space so avoid busy patterns on bedspreads and choose light layered fabrics over bulky curtains and duvets for easy breezy appeal wallpapering a whole room with a pattern can make it feel cramped so choose bedroom wallpaper that’s simple and clean or opt for one feature wall with a pattern of your choicehow do i select bedroom colours bedding and decoration for my bedroomas a starting point using your ideabooks to create a mood board is an important part of the design process and will help you keep your bedroom ideas organised and onpoint if you are looking for a relaxed atmosphere then calming bedroom colours such as pastel blues greens greys and lilacs are all great choices white is also great for the bedroom although consider opting for creamy shades that will keep the room feeling warm if you are looking for a more energetic vibe to your bedroom then bright colours like pinks and oranges are great choices to wake up to and these bolder shades can make the perfect feature wall – choose to paint with one vibrant colour select a wall sticker or pick out some bright bedroom wallpaper choose bedding sets that complement your chosen bedroom colour to carry the theme across the room sumptuous bed linen is one of life’s great luxuries so cocoon yourself in quality fabrics thread count will give you an idea of a bed sheet’s smoothness and durability and for guaranteed comfort go for the highest quality  egyptian cotton weaves determine the texture of bedding – plain weaves are crisp and smooth whereas sateen linens have a silky smooth finish linen silk and rayon are excellent allnatural alternatives to cotton that offer temperatureregulating benefits finally soft furnishings – lampshades rugs pillows and throws in a combination of colours and textures – can be used to complement your bedroom design ideas with pops of colour and texturetake a look through all the bedroom ideas from grand to small bedrooms on houzz and save the ones that
