nowgo»continental resources has upside of at least nov  about continental resources clr detroit bear deep value special situations longterm horizon valuedetroit bear on twittersecular growth is hard to find as the us gdp continues to chug along growing at least  however there is one place with an abundance of growth and that is the us domestic energy production sector the largest leaseholder in the bakken continental resources looks cheap and i believe shares have  as a standalone company and  upside in the event of an acquisition a quick snapshot of continental continental resources nyseclr is exposed to the hottest still upandcoming area in the us economy though the company has been around for several decades beginning as a wildcat driller in oklahoma the company acquired its first  acres in the bakken in  and in just a decade it became the largest single leaseholder in the region with over  million net developable acres in burgeoning region image source clr k production is growing rapidly new product continues to gush out of the continentals wells production during the third quarter rose a whopping  yearoveryear to  million boe or  boe per day more importantly  of this product was oil which carries a much more favorable profitability profile than natural gas yeartodate the company has produced  million boe thus i expect fullyear production to total nearly  million boe in  going forward continental resources anticipates production growth of  in  with  of the mix coming in the form of crude oil this is only year  of the companys fiveyear plan to triple production and proved reserves in other words continental resources growth phase still has plenty of room to run image source clr upon completion of its fiveyear plan the firm should triple its proven reserves to  mboe while its production jumps to  mboe per day these figures would seem overly optimistic however i think continentals lease profile favors longterm production growth because the firm has a strong balance sheet it will be able to increase production on the  net acres of undeveloped acreage that is set to expire within the next three years if production does not begin total debtebitdax earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and exploration costs stands slightly below the industry average of  so i think continental will be able to easily raise more capital if it is necessary to capitalize on the undeveloped acreage production costs are under control image source clr q  investor presentation in oil and most resource production depreciation and amortization are huge components of the gaap accounting costs so it is more useful to look at cash costs in this respect continental resources is doing an incredible job of executing cash costs per boe are  yeartodate resulting in a cash margin of  peers like whiting petroleum and hess have cash costs per boe in the low range so i consider continental one of the premier operators in the region even more impressive continentals cash costs have held steady outside of its interest expense in other words the actual cost of production without financing costs has remained flat to mostly flat with production costs remaining low all incremental production gains should lead to terrific cash flow generation which continental can plow back into more production oil price risk is possible but not crippling continentals low production costs also provide a buffer against a decline in oil prices even when realized oil prices were just  per bbl in  continental generated a cash margin of  though production costs are slightly higher today the firm would still generate a cash margin of  in the event that oil prices reverted to  levelsthough i dont see oil prices falling that low unless there is another global financial crisis whether the resource is coal oil or gold the largest risk to commodity producers are exogenous price moves with such robust margins continental mitigates much of the commodity price risk thus making it a name im comfortable holding in any economic environment a supermajor will want continental resources its no secret that the oil supermajors like exxon mobil nysexom conocophillips nysecop bp nysebp and chevron nysecvx were late to the bakken party exxon in particular is having a difficult time replenishing proven reserves the cohort in general has a bleak outlook for future production growth continental already has strong proved reserves with a high likelihood that those reserves will increase over the next several years continental resources would therefore be a wonderful strategic fit for exxon and the company is fully capable of making an offer exxon has already spent  billion on capital investment in fy and it has repurchased  billion worth of stock the market currently assigns continental resources an enterprise value of  billion yeartodate continental has generated  billion in ebitdax and i believe it is capable of achieving  billion in ebitdax for fy generating an evebitdax multiple of  the table below displays the range of takeover values for continental based on different scenarios image source detroit bear estimates as we can clearly see the range of takeover premiums could be pretty large depending on multiples and actual ebitdax growth i think fy would be prime for a takeover while interest rates remain low and the future potential for oil price appreciation remains moderate realistically the median of my estimates would occur with  ebitdax growth possible considering management anticipates production growth of  valuing the company at x ebitdax less net debt of  billion i come up with a market capitalization of  billion yielding appreciation potential of  within the next  months assuming no dilution while it is difficult to find a comparable deal buffett and g capital paid x trailing ebitda to acquire the mature heinz for  billion a highgrowth slamdunk investment for a supermajor should easily be able to achieve a valuation of x evebitdax in my opinion what are the risks to continental resources the primary risk to continental resources is a decline in oil prices not only would it hurt profitability but it would also damage the premium an acquirer is willing to pay since the estimated return on investment would decline considerably another risk to the firm is that acreage yields lower than expected reserves fellow contributor richard zeits has noted that continental has been conservative in its estimates and new fracking technology makes it likely that if anything the firm will find greater reserves than it anticipates still oil and gas projects do fail from timetotime so i do not believe investors should feel betterthanexpected proved reserves are a slamdunk an understated but looming risk involves the ability to transport shale out of the bakken region refiners like phillips  demanded and received discounts on shale product because oil and gas companies were extracting resources from the ground at a faster rate than the transportation infrastructure could handle however the moving product from the bakken will be extremely profitable and companies like enbridge have invested heavily in the surrounding pipeline infrastructure michael fitzsimmons wrote extensively about the bakken development and since his article i have noticed that the amount of advantaged discounted crude that refiners were receiving has not grown significantly i am not sure how the keystone pipeline development will play out but if the government ever allows phase  to be developed then i believe a great deal of transportation risk disappears continental resources will thrive even if it isnt acquired although i believe the odds of an acquisition are high given the favorable financing environment that could soon be ending as well as the lack of proved reserve growth at the oil supermajors i think shareholders will be pleased with continentals performance even if it isnt acquired the company remains a low cost operator has an enviable lease position and has shown the ability to grow ebitdax at a robust pace fy ebitdax was  billion fy ebitdax was  million from a valuation perspective shares are trading at just x  earnings compared to expected earnings per share expansion of  shares of exxon currently sell for x  earnings even though earnings per share growth is only expected to be  whiting petroleum expects earnings to grow  and shares trade at x  earning continental is currently receiving only a slight premium even as its earnings per share growth and longterm prospects look far superior going forward in the event that continental resources is not acquired my  price target is  based on x fy earnings implying  upside from current levels in a market that mostly looks fairly valued i think  share price appreciation is fantastic further i expect earnings per share to grow at least  for the next five years which should lead to wonderful share appreciation the market seems to have materially mispriced this wonderful growth story disclaimer the detroit bear is not a registered investment advisor so please perform your own due diligence

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
