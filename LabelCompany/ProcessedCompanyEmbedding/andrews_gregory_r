gregory andrews received a bs degree in mathematics from stanford university in  and a phd degree in computer science from the university of washington in  from  he was an assistant professor at cornell university since  he has been at the university of arizona where he is currently professor of computer science from  he chaired the department in  he received a distinguished teaching award greg has been on the editorial board of information processing letters since  he was the general chair of the twelfth acm symposium on operating systems principles in  and has been on the program committees of numerous conferences from  he was on advisory committees for the computing directorate of the national science foundation since  he has been on the board of directors of the computing research association cra gregs research interests include all aspects of concurrent programming a longterm project has been the design and implementation of the sr programming language current work focuses on the development of filaments a software package that provides efficient finegrain parallelism on a variety of parallel machines abshow more back cover copy foundations of multithreaded parallel and distributed programming covers and then applies the core concepts and techniques needed for an introductory course in this subject its emphasis is on the practice and application of parallel systems using realworld examples throughout greg andrews teaches the fundamental concepts of multithreaded parallel and distributed computing and relates them to the implementation and performance processes he presents the appropriate breadth of topics and supports these discussions with an emphasis on performance features emphasizes how to solve problems with correctness the primary concern and performance an important but secondary concern includes a number of case studies which cover such topics as pthreads mpi and openmp libraries as well as programming languages like java ada high performance fortran linda occam and sr provides examples using java syntax and discusses how java deals with monitors sockets and remote method invocation covers current programming
