wealth management investment planning outofstate clients family office contact info sky investment group one financial plaza ste  hartford ct  tel  equity management our approach to managing equity portfolios is based on the premise that the ultimate driver of share price appreciation is a companys underlying earnings growth our objective is to acquire companies when they are selling below their intrinsic value and to allow the underlying earnings growth to drive share prices higher investment candidates tend to be distributed across major economic sectors the commitment we make to a particular sector is based on our view of the opportunities and valuations within the sector balanced against our desire to reduce risk and preserve capital generally we try to maintain exposure to the major economic sectors although if the risk of loss seems excessive we will cut back or eliminate our position in a particular area our equity holdings tend to be highly profitable financially strong and abundant generators of operating and free cash flow we also look closely at a companys record of capital allocation  companies that utilize their cash resources wisely tend to make better investments than those that are less disciplined equity investment strategy over the course of the economic cycle different companies and sectors tend to move into and out of favor we use these periods to enhance our clients portfolios by adding to positions which are temporarily out of favor and reducing positions that seem excessively valued these changes tend to be incremental not dramatic it has been our experience that sudden changes in portfolio strategy increase the risk of permanent loss our equity holdings tend to be highly profitable financially strong and abundant generators of operating and free cash flow we also look closely at a companys record of capital allocation companies that utilize their cash resources wisely tend to make better investments than those that are less disciplined if youre interested in more information please contact  charitable endowments investment support  charitable endowments investment management ct  sky investment group llc
