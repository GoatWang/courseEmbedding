schaffer llp consulate general of algeria in new york defendant represented by eric william ruden  duane morris llp opinion and order of dismissal henry pitman magistrate judge this matter is before me on the parties joint application to approve the parties settlement docket item  all parties have consented to my exercising plenary jurisdiction pursuant to  usc § c the plaintiff formerly worked for the consulate general of algeria in new york the consulate as a chauffeur seeking overtime premium pay and damages for wrongful termination the overtime claims are brought under the fair labor standards act flsa  usc §§  et seq and the new york labor law plaintiffs wrongful termination claim is asserted under the new york city human rights law nyc admin code §§  et seq plaintiff also asserts claims under the labor law based on defendants alleged failure to maintain certain records and to provide certain notices and defendants allegedly making unlawful deductions from plaintiffs wages plaintiff alleges that he was employed as the personal driver of the general counsel of the consulate from november   through january   plaintiff claims that he received a set monthly salary of  with no overtime premium pay despite the fact that according to plaintiff he routinely worked  hours per week plaintiff claims that he is owed  in unpaid overtime liquidated damages under the flsa in the amount of  liquidated damages under the labor law in the amount of  and  for wage notice violations plaintiffs submissions do not quantify the amount due as a result of the allegedly illegal deductions from plaintiffs wages plaintiffs wrongful termination claim arises from incidents that occurred in late december  and early  on december   plaintiff drove home in the consulates car plaintiff claims he began experiencing chest pains on the way home stopped at the emergency department of interfaith medical center in brooklyn and was subsequently admitted to new york methodist hospital for a heart attack plaintiff underwent open heart surgery on december   plaintiff states that he was unable to return to work until february  and that he was wrongfully terminated due to his disability on january   plaintiff seeks wrongful termination damages of  defendant takes issue with the complaint on multiple grounds first the consulate claims that hiring a chauffeur does not constitute commercial activity within the meaning of the foreign sovereign immunities act  usc §§  et seq fsia and that it is therefore entitled to sovereign immunity with respect to all of plaintiffs claims even if it were not immune the consulate claims that plaintiffs overtime claim is inflated in terms of both the hours plaintiff worked and his hourly rate the consulate claims that although plaintiff occasionally worked more than  hours per week plaintiffs claim that he routinely worked  hours per week is grossly overstated in addition the consulate claims that plaintiffs overtime claim is further overstated because plaintiff has calculated his regular hourly rate assuming that his salary was intended to compensate him for only  hours per week the consulate claims that the correct way to calculate plaintiffs regular hourly is to assume that the salary was intended to provide compensation for all the hours plaintiff actually worked using a regular work week of  hours per week which the consulate claims is still overstated the consulate claims that plaintiffs unpaid overtime wages are approximately  finally with respect to plaintiffs wrongful termination claim the consulate claims that plaintiff was terminated for taking the consulates car home without authorization and for being absent for an extended period of time without explanation the consulate contends that prior to his termination plaintiff never contacted the consulate to explain his absence to request an accommodation or to advise when he would be able to return to work the parties have agreed to a settlement in the total amount of  the proposed settlement further provides that plaintiffs counsel will receive  and that the balance of  will be paid to plaintiff the amount allocated to counsel appears to be comprised of the  filing fee plus onethird of the remaining settlement proceeds i e      the settlement agreement does not allocate the settlement figure between plaintiffs overtime claims and his wrongful termination claim i held a lengthy settlement conference on july   that was attended by the principals and their counsel although the parties did not settle at the conference they reported the settlement during a followup conference call on july   court approval of an flsa settlement is appropriate when the settlement is reached as a result of contested litigation to resolve bona fide disputes johnson v brennan no  civ   wl  at  sdny sept   if the proposed settlement reflects a reasonable compromise over contested issues the court should approve the settlement id citing lynns food stores inc v united states  fd   n  th cir  aqudelo v e  d llc  civ  hb  wl  at  sdny apr   baer dj generally there is a strong presumption in favor of finding a settlement fair because the court is generally not in as good a position as the parties to determine the reasonableness of an flsa settlement lliguichuzhca v cinema  llc  fsuppd   sdny  gorenstein mj inner quotation marks and citations omitted typically courts regard the adversarial nature of a litigated flsa case to be an adequate indicator of the fairness of the settlement beckman v keybank na  frd   sdny  ellis mj citing lynns food stores inc v united states  fd   th cir  the presumption of fairness in this case is bolstered by the caliber the parties counsel based upon their preconference submissions and their performance at the settlement conference it is clear to me that all parties are represented by counsel who are known to me to be extremely knowledgeable regarding all issues in the case and who are well suited to assess the risks of litigation and the benefits of the proposed settlement in wolinsky v scholastic inc  fsuppd   sdny  the honorable jesse m furman united states district judge identified five factors that are relevant to an assessment of the fairness of an flsa settlement in determining whether a proposed flsa settlement is fair and reasonable a court should consider the totality of circumstances including but not limited to the following factors  the plaintiffs range of possible recovery  the extent to which the settlement will enable the parties to avoid anticipated burdens and expenses in establishing their respective claims and defenses  the seriousness of the litigation risks faced by the parties  whether the settlement agreement is the product of armslength bargaining between experienced counsel and  the possibility of fraud or collusion inner quotations and citations omitted the settlement here satisfies these criteria the estimates of plaintiffs unpaid overtime damages range from  to  thus the settlement figure represents either a substantial multiple of plaintiffs unpaid overtime damages or a substantial fraction of those damages second the settlement will entirely avoid the burden expense and aggravation of litigation plaintiffs case rests largely on plaintiffs oral testimony and the reasons for his termination trial preparation would require several depositions to explore these issues the settlement avoids the necessity of conducting these depositions third the settlement will enable plaintiff to avoid the risk of litigation the consulates sovereign immunity defense appears to present a substantial obstacle to any recovery by plaintiff in crum v kingdom of saudi arabia no civ a   wl  ed va july   a chauffeur employed by the royal embassy of saudi arabia alleged that he had been terminated illegally and was the victim of discrimination on the basis of his national origin the court granted defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the action finding that the hiring of a chauffeur was not commercial activity within the meaning of the fsia and that defendants were therefore entitled to sovereign immunity although there are other authorities suggesting the opposite result on different facts see elhadad v united arab emirates  fd   n dc cir  the similarity between the facts here and the facts in crum demonstrate that defendants sovereign immunity defense is substantial fourth because i presided over the settlement conference at which the parties came close to the  settlement figure i know that the settlement is the product of armslength bargaining between experienced counsel both counsel represented their clients zealously at the settlement conference fifth there are no factors here that suggest the existence of fraud the settlement was reached after a mediation before the court and the settlement figure is not far off from the numbers discussed at that mediation these facts further negate the possibility of fraud or collusion the settlement agreement also provides that after deduction of outof pocket costs onethird of the settlement fund will be paid to plaintiffs counsel as a contingency fee contingency fees of onethird in flsa cases are routinely approved in this circuit santos v el tepeyac butcher shop inc  civ  ra  wl  at  sdny dec   abrams dj courts in

peace bloc its goal is to organize and make available to the public in the most systematic and up to date manner possible information about the factories and businesses that operate in settlements beyond the green line pre border and the products that they produce in  not long after the establishment of gush shalom we publicized information about settlement products based on data gathered by our activists in the intervening years that information for which we did not claim any copyright was widely disseminated – not only in the print and online versions that we publicized ourselves but also by many other individuals and organizations the information was copied and disseminated by various groups in the broad israeli peace movement and abroad and it was even read from the knesset podium by knesset member tamar zandberg of meretz httpisrablognanacoilblogreadaspblogblogcode httpmekomitcoil moreover – on several occasions the settlers themselves and their allies when calling upon their supporters to use settlement products also used the information that was publicized by gush shalom  verbatim including several typos… httpwwwkrcoilbrportalbrpjsparc constructing the project over the years many changes have taken place in the economic political and legal situation in general and in particular in the composition of the factories and businesses active in the settlements a considerable number of businesses that were located in the settlements in the s have since moved to within the green line or have ceased to exist some of these cases earned extensive media publicity many other cases were not as famous in recent months our activists undertook a systematic examination it should be stressed that all of the information that appears here was gathered by means of the voluntary activity of activists from gush shalom an ngo with limited resources and funds and which attn justice minister shaked receives no government support – neither from the government of israel nor from any foreign government we used the wikipedia software which is freely available online to anyone wanting to open their own wiki on any subject and in any field they wish we are grateful to wikipedia for providing us with this opportunity clicking on any word that appears in blue leads to a webpage with additional information httpwwwpcmagcomarticleasp httpwwwwikiacomspecialcreatenewwiki it should be mentioned that this is an ongoing project as the settlement products team continues its activity on this page you can view information about common settlement products and links to more extensive information about factories and businesses in settlements divided into subjects as well as according to areas of economic operations also available is other relevant information such as companies that are located within the green line but are active in marketing settlement products sources and methods of gathering information on settlement products to the material that was publicized by gush shalom in  and which was updated from time to time since then data was periodically added as it was provided to us by members and supporters who discovered settlement products in the course of their daily lives we are deeply grateful to everyone who has helped us in collecting this information in the framework of settlement products wiki we present below links to information that was gathered about factories that have left their locations in settlements and moved to within the green line businesses that have gone out of business and those whose continued existence and location remain in doubt we thank everyone who has helped us with these issues in the course of our work we found material that was previously gathered and publicized by other peace groups especially the who profits from the occupation project we are also grateful to peace now for the information that modan bags has closed down its plant in the settlement of shaked httpwwwwhoprofitsorg httppeacenoworgilcontentmodan in the course of gathering the data it was found that much varied information is publicized online by the settlers themselves not only do businesses and factories maintain their own websites there are two online directories that specifically cover factories and businesses in the settlements – dapei katom orange pages and the business community of samaria ariel jordan valley binyamin the editing and presentation of these directories have a clear and prominent ideological slant at the same time we saw fit to refer to them frequently in the course of our work and to crossreference the listings concerning different factories and businesses generally speaking we consider the listings of a business in those directories to be a reliable testimony to its existence and to its being active in a settlement and vice versa – when a business which is known to have been located at a certain settlement no longer appears in the current directories that are publicized by the settlers that constitutes evidence that the business has relocated or has ceased to exist httpwwwshopilcoil httpwwwdkatomcoil in addition to the above industrial zones in the settlements publicize detailed lists of the factories located within them the barkan industrial zone specifically publicizes a detailed and userfriendly list of the factories located there including their area of business contact people and telephone numbers httpwwwshomronorgiluploadsdbsattachedfilesmifalimpdf however it was found that such lists are not necessarily fully updated several phone numbers that appear on the barkan industrial zones website yield the automatic message the number you have reached has been disconnected the telephone number of the bar chairsunited systems furniture company is answered with a recording that announces that the company has moved to its new location in telaviv finally we must mention the immense benefit that our team reaped from dunsguide dun and bradstreets online directory of companies as well as from judicial portal takdin which comprises an extensive collection of court rulings in civil proceedings including those in which settlement companies are involved more than once details were found in these two resources that the companies themselves chose not to reveal in their websites and in the information that they provide to the media httpwwwdundbcoilprodasp httpwwwtakdincoil how to send us questions corrections and additional information the purpose of this project is not to harm anyone but rather to provide the public with accurate as possible information the information that appears in this project was collected by volunteers and although we made immense efforts to avoid mistakes it is possible that the project is not devoid of such in the event that any mistakes are found in the information they were done inadvertently and with no malicious intent anyone wishing to correct mistakes add details andor share new information can do so by emailing us at the address below in the event that new information is found to be reliable we undertake to correct any mistake and to add relevant information so that each and every user can make independent and informed decisions we can be contacted by email at the address settlementproductsgmailcom findings findings misleading and concealing the location of factories many factories and businesses that are located in settlements try to conceal or obscure their location – especially companies that export to other countries or maintain other international relations the information on the companies websites their advertisements in newspapers and on the packaging of their products is often incomplete or misleading many companies provide two addresses one in a settlement and one within the green line in a manner that makes it very difficult to ascertain their actual location click here for the compilation of the findings businesses that provide dual addresses  in settlements and within the green line settlement businesses that conceal their location  in advertisements on websites andor on packaging following are several examples the frid blanket manufacturing company is located in the barkan industrial zone the company publicizes a list of shops all over israel where its products are sold yet without mentioning the location of the factory where the blankets are made the same tactic is used by the furniture chain store beitili by keter plastic and by additional companies the meshek zuriel dairy markets products that come in part from the settlement shadmot mehola in the jordan valley and part come from plants in the galilee and the negev in many cases there is no transparency and no mention of the source of the product on the package another method of misleading is concealing the source of the product under a manufacturers code for example general mills ltd the israeli branch of a large us manufacturer of baked goods manufactures the brand pillsbury the package of the product pillsbury brownies – chocolate flavored balls reads produced for general mills ltd ramle by manufacturers code slgl a website operated by the ministry of the economy enables deciphering manufacturers codes of this type leading to the discovery that in the case at hand the product comes from the shalgal food ltd factory located in the atarot industrial zone in an area that was annexed to jerusalem in fact it is much closer to ramallah than to the center of jerusalem and is the site of numerous conflicts between the israeli military and the palestinian residents even though the code can be deciphered it is obvious that there is a huge discrepancy between the information provided in this manner on a product label and the fundamental commitment of a commercial company to provide the consumer with reliable and transparent information on the products that it markets httpisraelnewtechgovilfindmanufacturercodepagesdefaultaspx in the case of foods we often used the location of the rabbinate that issued the kosher certificate for products – information which the companies must provide on the package if they want to reach consumers who observe kashrut we adopted the reasonable surmise that the rabbinate that issues the certificate for a product is the rabbinate in the location or the area where the product was manufactured except in cases of ultraorthodox kashrut in which case the certificates are nationwide a kashrut certificate that was issued by the rabbinates in west bank locations such as ariel hebron the samaria region rabbinate the jordan valley rabbinate etc is reliable evidence that the products come from settlements at these locations thus for example a container of hummus produced by achva may provide an address in nes tsiona but the kashrut certificate from the ariel rabbinate testifies to the location of the factory where the hummus was manufactured the most blatant deception that our team found has to do with dates – especially medjool dates which are a major economic branch in the jordan valley settlements and a large portion of which are designated for export for example the jordan river company markets dates from the jordan valley in carton boxes on which there is no printing in hebrew nor any mention of the origin of the dates the writing on the boxes of dates is in english sometimes in other european languages german french spanish italian and sometimes also in arabic some of the jordan river boxes bear orientalist illustrations of camelriders against the background of an exotic city with mosque minarets which might create the impression for a superficial observer that they are an arab product however when marketed in israel a hebrewlanguage sticker is added to the packages that notes the origin of the dates as the jordan valley the name of the packaging plant gilgal tomer etc and the rabbinate that certified kashrut – the jordan valley rabbinate click here for more information about dates supplementary table dates as opposed to the examples above we should note the transparency policy of the sasson levinsky company which markets assorted dried fruits some of which are produced at its plant in kiryat gat and some at the packaging plant in the settlement gilgal in the jordan valley in this case the origin of the fruit is clearly noted on each and every package in a manner that allows – at least a knowledgeable consumer who checks labels – ascertaining the source of the product before purchasing findings companies that have left the settlements or have closed in recent years there have been several prominent examples of companies that were located in the settlements especially in the barkan industrial zone and relocated to within the green line often in connection with forming international relations and specifically the purchase of the company by an international company these examples include the barkan winery which moved from the industrial zone from which it takes its name to kibbutz hulda yardeni locks which moved from barkan to the bar lev industrial park in the galilee multilockwhich moved from barkan to yavne bagel  bagel which moved from barkan to safed and recently soda stream which relocated from mishor adumim to the negev following an unsuccessful attempt at a pr campaign starring scarlett johansson soon afterwards the cosmetics firm ahava announced that it was relocating from the mitspe shalem settlement to kibbutz ein gedi within the green line other cases which were less prominent in the media included intercosma cosmetics atarot industrial zone to ashdod childrens furniture company ikoo designs barkan to ashdod and nesher mbt biological laboratories that is owned by the pharmaceutical giant teva which quietly relocated from the atarot industrial zone to beit shemesh and the delta textile company which moved its warehouses from the atarot industrial zone to cesaria as mentioned above these companies are joined by the furniture company bar chairsunited systems which still appears in the barkan industrial zone directory but has set up an automatic message notifying of its relocation to telaviv see here for the full list factoriesbusinesses that have left the settlements another prominent case that has not yet been covered in the media is that of the adanim tea company which was established and operated in its first years in the settlement ofra the flagship of the nationalreligious ideological settlements according to the information that the team was able to gather around  the company moved from ofra to betheleheminthegalilee then from there to upper nazareth that was the time of the second intifada and at that time the company was starting to develop widespread activity in europe especially in france and germany information that we found online testifies to the long history of shoe polish company mavrik industries which was founded in the s in telaviv became the largest factory of its type in israel and in the entire middle east and engulfed  competing factories the company moved to the mishor adumim settlement industrial zone – which turned out to be an unlucky business choice that ended in its folding during the second intifada similarly atlas sweets which was one of the leading manufacturers of chewing gum in israel since the s relocated to the atarot industrial zone in east jerusalem and there faced serious business difficulties when the second intifada broke out the company ultimately folded and its equipment and brand were purchased by the mastix company from beit shemesh documents from the companies registrar and court rulings tell the story of abir textile industries abir thread industries sabrilon thread technology and hadoron textile marketing which were located in the barkan industrial zone became intertwined conducted intricate power struggles and ultimately nearly all of them went bankrupt and entered into receivership we can mention information that was uncovered about additional settlement companies that faced bankruptcy receivership and closure – including ariye plast from the maaleh efraim industrial zone mey tsurim from rosh tsurim in gush etzion the hebron settlers carpentry and several others for details click here settlement businesses that have folded or disappeared findings hebrew labor and palestinian workers since  the state of israel has maintained control over the palestinian economy the policies concerning economic development taxation customs import and export – are all controlled by the israeli government according to the economic interests of israel in general and of israeli companies in particular without the palestinians having any way to exert influence even the gaza strip from which the state of israel separated is still included within the customs envelope and constitutes a captive market israeli companies reap significant profits from exporting to the gaza strip part of the economic dependence which israel has enforced on the palestinians is the situation in which many palestinian workers must seek work in the settlement industrial zones where they serve as a pool of cheap labor even if the salaries are sometimes higher than those paid by palestinian employers in recent years the settlers have been portraying themselves as the patrons of the palestinian workers spokespersons for the settlers in the political arena routinely bemoan the fate of the palestinian workers in the settlements who might lose their jobs as the result of steps such as marking settlement products in europe however perusing the orange pages directory which is published by the settlers for the purpose of their own internal communications reveals a picture that is quite opposite httpwwwdkatomcoil many businesses that operate in the settlements prominently proclaim their policy of not employing palestinian workers this is done by means of employing the term hebrew labor and sometimes in a more blatant manner such as the work is performed by jewish workers only among the expressions used by settler businesses to describe themselves our team found hebrew labor exclamation points in the original hebrew labor from a to z produced by high quality hebrew labor do you require hebrew labor youve come to the right place reliability dedication good service and hebrew labor gracious service hebrew labor from the heart and also paradoxical statements such as hebrew labor french speaking it is obvious that among the target audience of this directory a business that employs only jews and has a policy of excluding arabs is attractive to potential clients in the framework of the consumer information here we saw fit to gather in a special table the settlement businesses that advertise and take pride in hebrew labor settlement business declaring jews only employment policy definitions and the political and legal background what is a settlement who is a settler who is listed here and why since  the terms settler andsettlement have become prevalent in the public and political discourse in israel however there is disagreement concerning the exact meaning of those terms often the word settlers is used to describe people who hold a religious radically nationalist outlook bordering on messianic who consider settling in judea and samaria to be a religious and national mission of the first order the realization of a divine promise and who set themselves apart by means of characteristic dress and lifestyle which are very different from the norm in israeli society in general as far as we are concerned settlements of this type are merely one type of the settlements that were established in the occupied territories since  our definition on the basis of which we decided which factories and businesses would be included in this project is a settlement is any civilian community that is designated for the residence of israeli citizens in the territories that were occupied by the idf in june  and which the state of israel continues to hold to the present day a settler is any person residing in such a settlement and especially relevant for the information that appears here – an industrial zone that is designated for israeli entrepreneurs and business people and which was established in the occupied territories is a settlement industrial zone we do not ignore the fact that the settlers are not a homogeneous public there are secular settlers pretty ordinary israelis who were drawn to locations such as maaleh adumim or ariel mainly because of the generously governmentsubsidized housing there orthodox settlers in places like beitar elite and modiin elite who would have just as easily moved to orthodox towns within the green line if any were built and labor movement settlers in the jordan valley and the golan heights who live in kibbutzim and moshavim there are secular settlers and religious settlers ideological settlers and nonideological settlers violent settlers who personally use force against their palestinian neighbors and nonviolent settlers who leave it to the idf soldiers to employ force in order to maintain settlements in occupied territory however all of the settlers – regardless of their personal motivation – are complicit in the settlement enterprise by the fact of their living there the settlement enterprises fundamental and proclaimed goal is to create facts on the ground to perpetuate israels rule over the territories that were occupied in  and to prevent the palestinian residents in those territories from establishing an independent state and living as a free nation in their land – without there being any intention of ever granting them israeli citizenship or the right to vote for the parliament and government that control their lives thus all of the settlers by the fact of their residing in settlements are complicit in violating international law which prohibits an occupying power from settling its citizens in the occupied territory all of the settlers are complicit in establishing and maintaining an obstruction that prevents israel and its citizens from achieving peace with our palestinian neighbors and with the arab states all of the settlers – whatever their personal motivation – are complicit in the continued deterioration of israel towards the future of an apartheid state a state that is quagmired in endless wars and bloodshed and which is denounced and treated as a pariah around the globe sometimes we are asked why do you hate the settlers the answer is unequivocal we do not hate the settlers the settlers are human beings just like us and israeli citizens just like us they love their families no less that we do ours like most human beings the settlers are fully and honestly convinced that their actions and lifestyle are right and just we do not hate the settlers we do consider them to be people who are performing an extremely significant political act by residing in occupied territory in our view that action is extremely damaging and dangerous to the future of all of us and especially to the future of the settlers themselves if the settlers cease and desist from this political act then from that moment on we will have no reason to argue with or confront them the lists here also include businesses that are physically located within the green line yet which contribute significantly to the settlement activity for example the shufersal supermarket chain which is a nationwide chain yet under its brand green it markets numerous products that originate in settlements or the meiron  salman law office which is located in telaviv but which describes itself thus our office specializes in real estate especially in the judea and samaria district our office has vast experience in handling issues vis a vis the authorities that regulate assets in judea and samaria including the civil administration the boycott law in  an event shook the political and legal systems in israel late at night and following an explosive debate the knesset passed the law known as the boycott law which prohibits israeli citizens from calling for a boycott of settlement products only a boycott of settlement products was prohibited not calling for any other type of boycott israeli citizens who are religious jews are permitted to call for a boycott of nonkosher restaurants the chief rabbinate of israel and the municipal rabbinates do this all the time on a large scale and with public funding social justice movements can call for boycotting products that are exorbitantly priced as they did in the course of the social protest in  vegetarians can call for boycotting animal products even the extreme right wing is allowed to call for a boycott against the arab citizens a settler organization called the samaria settlers committee recently did just that including publicizing a detailed list of the names and addresses of arabowned shops which the organization called to boycott – without the law enforcement authorities in israel considering taking any action against them httpwwwhaaretzcoilblogsmisgavpremium httpwwwynetcoilarticleslhtml as opposed to all the types of boycotts that are legal calling for a boycott of settlement products and only that specific call became the grounds for being sued for damages under israeli law gush shalom considers this legal and public reality as being unfair and a grave blow to the freedom of expression of israeli citizens together with many other movements and institutions we participated in protest demonstrations in the streets before and after the law was passed and also in petitioning the high court of justice to support our campaign unfortunately the judges of the high court of justice dashed our hopes and following deliberations that lasted several years they rejected all of the petitions against the the boycott law httpzopegushshalomorghomeheevents httpswwwfacebookcomgushshalomhebposts httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnithqlgxa httpwwwhaaretzcoilnewslawpremium considering this legal situation gush shalom clarifies for the avoidance of all doubt that the action of gathering information about factories and businesses in settlements and publicizing same through the settlement products wiki is by no means an intention to call for the boycotting of settlement products the purpose of gathering and publicizing the information is to provide the most reliable and accurate consumer information that we were able to gather in order to enable consumers – each and every one individually – to make wise and informed decisions according to their personal considerations as things stand in israel in march  there is no legislative or legal restriction on gathering and publicizing consumer information the source of the products that are offered for sale on shelves is essential and relevant consumer information – no less than their chemical and nutritional contents the working conditions of the workers who produced them the effect of their production on the environment or on animals and other factors that are currently considered to be material consumer considerations therefore the gush shalom movement takes full responsibility for the gathering and publication of the data that appears in settlement products wiki as a voluntary action for the public benefit table of common settlement products notes as far as we know there is no connection between the tvuot bar company that appears in this list and is located in the barkan industrial zone in the west bank and the tvuot company which is located in kibbutz maaleh hachamisha within the green line  samaria dairies machlevot hashomron that manufacture hashomron cheeses is not a settlement business and it is located in binyamina within the green line the word samaria shomron in the name of the business does not refer to judea and samaria as this term has been used since  rather to an earlier use whereby samaria was the term for the area of emek hefer hedera and binyamina note to english version these tables have been

used by the israeli military and is occupied by israeli settlers the settlements are scattered throughout the west bank and are interconnected by israeli exclusive roads these roads surround major palestinian cities such as bethlehem hebron jenin nablus ramallah jerusalem and jericho and thereby severing palestinian means of communication and migration between their major cities most palestinians that were born and raised in the west bank have never seen family residing in other major cities and have been denied religious pilgrimage to bethlehem and jerusalem  since the west bank no longer has a viable border the territory can no longer provide palestinians with a state israeli settlements are growing boycott the goods and services that are produced by settlers to protect yourself from supporting the occupation and the destruction of the last viable solution it is illegal for israelis to boycott goods and services from settlements such actions are prosecutable by

should not bother filing step  fill out the claim form once you have found settlements for which you are eligible click through to the settlement claim form fill out the online claim form which will usually require you to enter your name and address as well as the number of products you purchased and then submit your claim if you are confused regarding the eligibility for the settlement of the

email from the fund administrator advising that distribution will occur sometime this summer never do they say in a year i really don’t know who to believe anymore admin – hi mia feel free to send your email to us so we can check and see if it is the real thing you can send it to questionsclassactionrebatescom reply cynthia o says may   at  am is there any update regarding the distribution time frame admin – hi cynthia for some reason i recall reading first quarter of  reply tiffany says may   at  pm i was told by the administrator that they expect distribution no sooner that mid summer  into early fall  however on one of the websites for this class action stated that some checks went out spring of  httpwwwflexiblepolyurethanefoamsettlementcom this is what it said distribution settlement checks related to the vitafoam carpenter leggett  platt ffp fxi future foam hickory springs mohawk and woodbridge settlements were mailed on june   these checks were mailed following the court’s order approving distribution of settlement funds which is available for viewing under the “court documents” section of this website on march   a second settlement payment was mailed to eligible class members this payment represents funds received from hickory springs and woodbridge since the initial distribution in june  admin – hi tiffany when did you contact the admin for the settlement usually the best is to reach out in writing via email so you can get a written reply and see if they match reply tiffany says may   at  pm i emailed a couple of weeks ago and was told that there was no definite time of distribution but would likely no sooner than mid summer  the other information i posted was directly from a website hopefully they will distribute in june that would be

ever find out the difference admin – hi tb between this one httpwwwpolyfoamclassactioncom and this one httpwwwflexiblepolyurethanefoamsettlementcom  reply tb says june   at  pm yes admin – hi tb one

will take place in  to  weeks reply web says june   at  pm this is a copypaste from the polyfoamclassactioncom regarding sending of checks june   – important update the administrator is in the process of finalizing claims once complete a motion will be filed with the court for final approval of distribution we anticipate the distribution will occur in the next  to  weeks reply valerie aviles says july   at  pm willschecks be mail this week we be six weeks from june valst admin – hi valerie it appears that way i will update our facebook page when people start receiving checks reply tb says july   at  pm if you are getting a check they have not been issued and likely won’t be issued this week even though they anticipated  weeks from june st also unless you claimed an extremely large amount of

that to receive a response feeding me some lie about how the  was correct of course by then it will be too late to cash the original check class action lawsuits are a joke they’re just a way for lawyers to make millions by screwing the victims over a second time reply jason says july   at  pm update it’s been almost  months since i sent my appeal and i still have not received a response from the administrator of course they provide no way to contact them other than a po box that they don’t respond to i don’t fault ford for having faulty spark plugs…i’m sure they didn’t design them that way intentionally the real crooks here are the lawyers who are stealing the money that was rightfully awarded to me and others based on the terms of the settlement admin – hi jason the lawyers get a fixed amount reply steve says march   at  pm got my denial letter i guess i did not read the whole letter i had our family mechanic that we have used for  years replace the spark plugs and this

is precedent for that reply joe says march   at  pm does that mean if the administrator is dragging their feet or being unfair with their determination we have no recourse admin – hi joe sometimes

gave a written account to gs legal i will notify this board on my claim result when i get it since they would not tell me over my communication with them i think they are trying to make people forget about it become so frustrated they give up on it or something along that line… class actions are a joke admin – hi there when you are not comfortable with a class action you can ask to be excluded and take the company to court on your own reply shannan says april   at  pm does anyone have an email address for questions i received an insufficient info letter admin – hi shannon this is the email for

saying because it wasn’t a ford dealer i’m not covered absolutely bogus because i had my  f done about  years ago before all this started and all  plugs broke at k miles this is just a crock of crap

reply larry d hervey says february   at  pm when will the refunds be sent admin – hi larry refunds are commonly sent when a settlement is finalized and all the claims are processed reply barbra hurman says february   at  am my claim was filed on september   on line received receipt that shows my claim number and i have not received a notice or a refund from the class action lawsuit will it ever happen or was it just a ruse still waiting hi barbra i encourage you to read all the comments specifically the responses i have given other community members a class action settlement is not like a rebate where each instance is processed upon receipt you must wait until the whole settlement is finalized and all appeals have been completed and then you will receive monies in some instances this process takes years reply richard thistle says february   at  pm glad to see the full can of tuna my favorite tuna solid white in water sorry i had to file a claim reply billyjack says february   at  pm if you’re ever curious as to where to find greed in this country look no further than a class action lawsuit message board you people are demanding something that i’m sure you had no idea about until the news reported it some of you even said that you’re depending on either a  check or a  tuna voucher seriously go to a food bank if it’s that bad reply hungry for tuna says february   at  pm my food bank had a sign on a particular blank space on the shelf where you would find starkist tuna it said you should sign up for the class action suite reply john says february   at  pm when will payment or vouchers be sent out how can we check if claims have been processed admin – hi john we have no idea for example the red bull case closed in  and they are just barely paying it now be patient reply mike says february   at  am also submitted a claim and never got a refund reply heidi f says february   at  am i filed my claim for free cans in august  no refund no free tuna nothing so i no longer buy starkist reply stephen s says february   at  am i filed the claim…have not heard a thing — what gives reply kris says february   at  am hi admin i appreciate all the frustration that you must be feeling with the lack of information and the people questioning the status if they created a website to file the claim and get additional information it would be nice if they would provide claimants with the ability to check based the claim number it would make things less frustrating and would be something easy for them to do thank you for trying to keep on top of this the issue is with starkist and the attorney hi kris the situation with this settlement is not claimspecific by this i mean that nobody has yet received a check or coupons because the settlement is not quite at that stage if the admin was to set a system that allowed people to check by claim number the response for everyone would be pretty standard we are mainly dealing with consumers that are unfamiliar with the way a settlement works thus they get restless when the process does not advance as quick as they think it should reply linda s says february   at  pm what is the outcome of this claim i submitted my claim on  admin – hi linda a class action settlement is not based on the date of your submission it is based on the important dates set by the judge it may be a long time before any of us see a check reply cheryl tears says february   at  pm this lawsuit has taken so long i nearly forgot about it i need to update my address please let me know how to update my address it is sad when you are led to believe you are getting what you paid for only to find out it’s not true hopefully starkist has fixed this problem admin – hi cheryl this settlement has not taken long it is taking the type of time that most settlements take to update your address you must contact the class action administrator their address is available by scrolling up reply jeff says february   at  pm so will the judge’s rejection of the settlement mean that we will no longer get our voucherschecks will we have to resubmit our claims admin – hi jeff in reviewing the most recent documents i don’t see a rejection i see this httpswwwtunalawsuitcomdocumentsstipulationofsettlementpdf reply jeff says february   at  pm i saw this httpswwwundercurrentnewscomjudgemstarkistunderfillingsettlementunfairlylimitspossibilityoffurtherantitrustclaims admin – hi jeff this is actually good news to the consumer what it means is that in the terms it said that in the future you could not take action against the tuna manufacturer the judge did not find that to be fair he rejected the terms of the settlement not the settlement itself reply rhonda lane says february   at  pm i filed my claim before the deadline and still have not received my coupons what is going on with this admin – hi rhonda i encourage you to read our responses to other comments in short the checks or coupons have not been issued yet be patient reply hope joseph says february   at  pm we sent in a claimthe  is  quite a long time ago i retained the copy that it

not make million’s dollars admin – hi perry no tuna or money yet the judge rejected the terms of the settlement reply rich gibson says march   at  pm what is the story is this a scam or what i filled out all the info on  and received a claim number of  and told to retain for my records and i would get my  cash payment…got nothing yet admin – hi rich not a scam just delays in the process reply allen c says march   at  pm hello i noticed that reading some of the responses one of them stated that the terms of the settlement were rejected were they rejected by the judge presiding over the case and if so how will this affect the settlement i am not impatiently waiting for the vouchers i am just curious thank you admin – hi allen the judge presiding rejected the settlement because if hindered the consumer’s capacity to pursue future cases against the tuna packer basically the terms have to be revised and submitted to the judge for consideration this may take years eventually we will all see vouchers or money but it may take a long time reply cindy says march   at  pm i moved to a new address how do i change my address for the claim admin – hi cindy you send your notification to

march   at  pm looking for my starkist tuna refund is there a place where we can check the status thanks admin – hi teresa per the last update the judge rejected the terms of the settlement he did not feel the terms were fair to consumers it may be a while before this comes to a full resolution reply anne knauff says march   at  am teresa davis i saw your letter on starkest tuna class action i wanted to tell u that there going back to court on march   i applied online in october or nov  to get my cash refund for tuna fish if u like to write back send a message to me anne knauff reply wendy says march   at  am good god people read the comments posted by admin  if you need to change your address scroll to top or send it snail mail refunds have not been sent out yet could take upto  days after everything is checked double check and so on and this is a site for people who were unsuspecting and got ripped off by a major company  if you dont like then simple find some other form of entertainment  most of us dont mind paying for what we buy but thats just it we were over charged by actual weight of tuna  if you filled a claim before deadline sit back be patient  it is a virtue and just wait it will come  admin – hi wendy it appears it will take more than  days last i heard the judge rejected the terms of the settlement he found the terms to be unjust for the final consumer reply vicky says march   at  pm i would like the name of the judge in the lawsuit i think he needs to be disbarred i am beginning to think and for very good reason he was paid in…tuna profanity deleted time for everyone to boycott this tuna is probably coming from china and is probably really not tuna but maybe fido boycottcharlietuna hi vicky we commend your enthusiasm on this matter but before you move forward and start a national movement you may want to take a moment to read why the judge presiding denied the judgement in a nutshell he is protecting you and millions of consumers from unfair terms httppidpeastwestcenterorgpireportfebruaryhtm reply anne knauff says march   at  pm hi i filled out a claim in october  for hendricks vs starkest company to get a check refund for oo i feel its a scam too its march   today still no check in the mail when are they going to court again could u please email me back anne admin – hi anne i normally don’t email back but i am happy to give you the latest updates via this reply  not a scam  they are going reconvene on march  to address revised terms you can take a closer look at the reasoning behind the denial on this article httppidpeastwestcenterorgpireportfebruaryhtm reply how do you tuna fish says march   at  pm so the judge rejected the settlement but doesn’t define what they think is fair settlement i’m starting to think most of the people due settlements will either be dead or in nursing homes by the time they get their checksvouchers it would at least be nice if they revealed how many people made the deadline for cash and vouchers so at least we could determine if the final payments were fair consumers who joined the suit by the deadline obviously found the terms acceptable the only way it might not be if so many people signed up that the end results was something like  in cash or  in vouchers instead of    if the court released the numbers it would be easy to calculate  million in cash would mean no more than  people could have signed up for full  checks and for  million in vouchers no more than  could have signed up without resulting in reductions in the settlements admin – hi there the rejection does not have anything to do with the potential amount instead the judge is concerned with terms that were inserted after the initial approval that hinder your future ability to take legal action against the tuna packer reply anne knauff says march   at  pm when should we been getting our checks when they meet march   i check facebook often thank u for answering me anne admin – hi anne not anytime soon the judge will meet with the parties on march  to discuss the terms and then we shall see what happens reply theresa says march   at  am my god these people act like that  or  in coupons is there only source of income or way to eat i just got a check for a class action law suit and it was settled  years ago…stop worrying about it…it will come when it comesif it does think of it as a surprise in the mailbox and be thankful reply tracy says march   at  am exactly someone with some sense reply tunlife says march   at  am well said many people are asking about the money but i suspect they just want to know whats going on there isn’t much updates available through the web at least i couldn’t find any current news except for this thread with all the questionscomments about the rebate status its really sad to conclude they are just looking for an extra buck tuna for life reply how do you tuna fish says march   at  pm admin thanks for explaining why there is a delay it would still be nice if there was disclosure of how many people signed on to receive cash  vouchers – which was known several months go when the deadline for signing up for the class action suit passed of course there is nothing to prevent starkist from increasing their prices slightly or reducing amount in the cans by for example –  ounce and keeping the price the same in future years to compensate for the cost of the lawsuit and as long as they comply with amount of actual tuna minus liquid for a smaller can – its  legal with starkist  million  legal costs is small change to the parent company from south korea – dongwon industries that’s the way it is with all lawsuits – be they tuna companies car companies drug companies doctors or hospitals in the end the lawsuit costs are distributed across all consumers of the productservice the only exception being is if the lawsuit drives the entity out of business and they file bankruptcy companies in general are always shrinking the quantity in the package to keep prices the same one time i even caught the switchover years ago quaker granola bars were  to a box and then shrank to  bars to box and both sizes were on the shelf at the same time price was the same of course they know consumers are price sensitive and don’t notice less in the package as much as price breakfast cereal companies learned that a long time ago now some cereal comes in boxes less than  ounces they make the boxes taller and slimmer dominos sugar was  pound to a bag for as long i’ve been alive and a couple of years ago they finally reduced the size to  pounds while keeping price about the same of course as long as they are putting the stated weight in the package it legal i regularly check grocery shrink ray at the consumerist website for heads up on these things maybe i should start weighing my bags of sugar lol admin – hi there as you probably know i am not the admin of the settlement you may want to try giving them a call and see if the total number of applicants is a number they are willing to discuss i suspect participation was higher than expected just based on the amount of press coverage this case had reply tracy says march   at  am dear admin of this page you are doing a great job wow there are a lot of dumb people big hug for you because you have to see all of the idiocy for the rest of you if you would try reading you would find the answer to your question already posted on this page admin – hi tracy it can be challenging at times but we are always reminded that there is a person on the other side of the screen who deserves a response thanks for visiting our page reply rick says march   at  pm just found this thread not worried too much about the money but came across a saved email from when i filed a claim and thought “oh yeah where is that ” no updates on the claim page but this site was very informative and a little disheartening to see how much people fret over such a little thing thanks to whomever is running this site admin – hi rick you are quite welcome there are plenty of foodrelated class actions so keep checking with us have a fantastic week reply anne knauff says march   at  pm what happen today march   i heard they went to court what happened its says they finally settled the tuna fish settlement can u find out whats happening anne admin – hi anne until the press releases something i won’t have anything to share with you reply keith roux says march   at  pm i find it funny that big corporations can stall and stall and stall because they have the big bucks while us little people who spent their money on a product we took in stride to be right and are fraudulently trampled upon then you must wait for your result one thing is for certain be it starkist or kraft etc once you burn me your product does not seem to important to buy while there are so many others to choose from makes me sick reply ben says march   at  pm oh how cute another tuna recall…social media word of mouth…hopefully your company wont survive…horrible pathetic company…the word is out … admin – hi ben are you wishing for our destruction or starkist’s reply ken stockham says march   at  pm i applied online unless that was all a lie as well…have not heard a word……don’t buy starkest… admin – hi ken please take a moment to read the responses we have given to other community members class action settlements take time sometimes years reply andy says march   at  pm what is the news on the settlement have not recieved anything yet admin – hi andy we have not received information regarding the outcome of the march  meeting once we know something about it we will post it reply t says march   at  pm i haven’t received anything either i purchased some tuna recently and it was awful as much as i would like some free tuna now i wish i’d asked for the money now bumble bee is recalling theirs i tell you it’s enough to put you off tuna altogether if my voucher ever comes i’m not sure i’ll use it reply roberta marcheso says march   at  pm i have not received any reimbursement either and this is march   reply c joseph says march   at  pm so where is the settlement i filled everything out and haven’t received a settlement or a letter explaining anything about this lawsuit admin – hi c joseph if you take a moment to review the responses we have given to other community members you will note that the judge rejected the terms of the settlement forcing the defendants to present revised terms this took place on  presently we do not know the results of this meeting reply r says says march   at  pm filed a claim in august of  where is check from the settlement do i need to hire a lawyer to collect i have a claim number now what admin – hi r says now you wait this case may take longer than expected last we heard the terms of the settlement were rejected forcing the defendants to submit revised terms for the judge to assess and decide if the new terms are beneficial to consumers in the long run reply kenneth says march   at  pm well i guess its about time to contact the court to let them know starkist is refusing to live up to the settlement…and to ask for further damages be added to the settlement admin – hi kenneth unless you objected to the settlement you may not contact the court as disclosed in the long notice reply linda johnson says march   at  pm if i buy tuna it’s the albacore or a higher grade than the regular tuna the regular tuna i give to my cat these days reply jenni says march   at  am if all i had to do was wait for a  check or  in free tuna life would be good seriously they screwed people by misstating weight… yeah big nono i am in on the tuna settlement but i don’t watch my mailbox nor do i think about it much… reply dave malland says march   at  pm still waiting for compensation from hendricks on class action suit win against starkist submitted my claim online months ago i smell a rat criminals will call my congressman if this is not settled properly this month march admin – hi dave i am pretty confident this settlement will not reach a happy conclusion in march it may take a long while before the defendants present terms that the judge finds to be consumerfriendly reply richard says march   at  pm so has anyone received either the  or the tuna anyone at all in the entire country surely someone must have received it by now i know i haven’t admin – hi richard nobody has received their money or their tuna the settlement was rejected by the judge who found the terms to be unfair to you the consumer reply lisa richardson says march   at  pm reading all these comments has given me quite the laugh today and admin you have the patience of a saint and those of you who say you are going to start your own lawsuits that was some of the funniest stuff this is not the golden goose that is going to make you a millionaire you might get a few cans of tuna or a little cash forget about it get a life and just enjoy the results when you receive them not one of you is waiting on this law suit to eat dinner tonight i guarantee please read a book go for a walk go fishing even if your life is consumed with the results of this settlement i truly feel sorry for you sad life admin – hi lisa i love your suggestion to go fishing perhaps tuna fishing may just do the trick… thanks for visiting our website reply hannah says march   at  pm

presiding the case feels are fair to you and thousands of consumers reply rick says march   at  am since the judge shot it down do we automatically lose do we have to re file just curious i’m more of the go fishing type ha thanks admin – hi rick no need to file again you just need to wait until the defendant comes up with terms that the judge finds fair reply lyndall riedel says march   at  pm where’s my refund it’s been  dos admin – hi lyndall have you taken a moment to read my other responses if not please spend a little time reading the comments reply frank says march   at  am why did we agree to the  in tuna product or  in cash if the settlement was not finalized…the system is such as joke in this country…understand people they delay the funds so far  million or about  million in cash for a year or two or more so that starkist can make approximately half back in interest over the several year period people in the settlement die get sick move and don’t change their address and that’s money the corporation gets back and saves and it doesn’t pay out why did we waste time filling out forms and agreeing to the amounts if the settlement was not finalized it would seem that we would fill out forms agreeing to the final amounts when a final amount is reached admin – hi frank the judge is looking after consumers in general who are short sighted in their vision basically he wants to make sure that there is an option to take action against starkest should they decide to engage in business practices that are unfair or illegal reply lemonhed says march   at  pm reading these post was a fantastic way to relieve a little stress this afternoon i filed my claim some time ago and will sit patiently but am truly fascinated by all of the apparent damage this has caused to so many people’s wellbeing admin it was stated prior but i will say it again patience of a saint wow just wow admin – hi there thank you for your sweet words of encouragement some of the comments and

my own lawyer you people are insane  of you probably didn’t hear about this lawsuit until it was big news online in august and now you want to act like this  is going to solve all your financial problems in life get a grip if you need  that bad get in touch with me and i will let you mow my yard admin – hi charlie how large is your yard i charge a minimum of  🙂 reply patricia schumann says

provided in the main settlement page reply mili d s says april   at  am when do we get our refund or voucher admin – hi mili in the not so near future this case is taking longer than expected the next update will be on april st reply how do you tuna fish says april   at  pm trying to interpret all the lawyer babble in the filings is daunting its another reason why people don’t like dealing with lawyers they seem incapable of writing anything in plain english for any court document a “translator” should produce a summary that the average person can understand from what i can see the next important date is another hearing april st and its all about a couple of people on the plaintiff side involving a few words here and there about including antitrust once or twice and other minor word changes hopefully the judge will finally say what the language should be and get this over with was there any word on how many people actually signed up for the lawsuit so one could determine what the actual payout per person will be i’m guessing based on all the press last summerfall the amounts will be probably be cut in half or close to it especially since no proof was required in order to be eligible admin – hi hdytf you are correct on both counts participation was high so expect a smaller settlement and the next key date is april st reply marie jones says april   at  pm i don’t think we’re getitng anything if you can copy and paste this into your browser here’s a small excerpt from the article httpswwwundercurrentnewscomjudgemstarkistunderfillingsettlementunfairlylimitspossibilityoffurtherantitrustclaims february    pm tom seaman a us judge denied final approval of a  million settlement for consumers accusing starkist of selling underfilled cans of tuna stating the terms unfairly limit the possibility off future antitrust claims against the company although the court “recognizes the costs stemming from a denial of final approval in light of the reservations identified all of which were raised by objectors it cannot conclude that the “proposed settlement is fair reasonable and adequate” according to the court document filed on feb  admin – hi marie what this means is that the terms have to be revised to be more consumerfriendly reply nicole m says april   at  am does anyone know how we’ll be notified when the settlement is finalized and the vouchers will be sent out do we just need to keep checking back here admin – hi nicole best way to find out the latest is to follow our facebook page i am prompt to post updates as soon as i hear something reply nicole m says april   at  am also just started reading more of this thread and agree some of this quite sophomoric with that being said let me apologize if you had already answered my previous question i just didn’t have the time nor the patience to read through all of it i truly appreciate what you admin are doing thanks for wading through the muck and providing some answers reply william paul says april   at  pm just wait and see what the final results will be reply how do you tuna fish says may   at  pm what happened in court april st  weeks later and nothing no new court documents that i’ve seen did the hearing take place admin – hi hdytf i have not seen any updates on this case i suspect it won’t go forward until the judge receives terms that are fair to consumers in the longrun reply jeff says may   at  pm eh… those terms were fair…  bucks worth of free tuna for people   of whom myself included had no idea that they were getting “screwed” by starkist personally i think that sounds abundantly fair 🙂 reply how do you tuna fish says may   at  pm i guess we should all put a note in our wills as to who gets the checkcoupons since its likely most of us will be  feet under by the time they send out checksvouchers its been a month since the last hearing and nothing not even a filing regarding the results that i can find reply alane younger says february   at  pm it’s now feb  and have received no settlement or rebate has anyone received yet admin – hi alane this settlement was paid many months ago reply colleen ward says february   at  pm what was the final ruling  when will the notice of the settlement andor the settlement be sent out  admin – hi colleen everyone got a  check

pm i am interested in the final settlement of the starkist hearing  when will notification andor rebate be sent to everyone in the class action suit  admin – hi colleen this settlement was paid a year ago reply robin martin says february   at  pm i’ve not received mine either this was very poorly orchestrated reply john i says february   at  pm admin i have an official claim form receipt with a claim number from  no check or proceeds have ever been received all contact information on the claim form receipt is accurate where or with who can i follow up upon the nonreceipt of the settlement funds admin – hi john this settlement was paid many months ago i don’t think you have any recourse at this point reply linda stupar says february   at  pm i filed  and have a claim number but i have no product voucher or claim check please advise us who have not received our claims what are the next steps to take thank you admin – hi linda you are way too late this settlement was paid out months ago the window of opportunity to submit a request for investigation of missing checks is probably closed reply connie griesbach says february   at  am i haven’t received my settlement either  or  doesn’t matter i have received nothing but sounds lots of other folks didn’t either what gives admin – hi connie at this point there is very little you can do it has been a long time and the settlement no longer has funds reply barbara bower says february   at  pm i submitted a claim   to date have not seen a payment i have changed my address as of  and would like to know how to provide you with the change of address please email that information admin – hi barbara please wait a few months for an update these things take time reply joan grups says february   at  pm we filed a claim october   and have still not received a settlement is this still active i have our claim number admin – hi joan this was paid out months ago if you did not receive your check it was probably lost in the mail too much time has passed and there is no recourse reply william says february   at  pm something is awful fishy with recieving my invisible voucher from my claim reply real fishy says february   at  pm never saw a dime eat tuna a lot time to switch brands reply frank says february   at  pm i filed a claim last year and still haven’t received anything each time i checked it said to wait as things are still pending was this a scam admin – hi frank this was paid a few months ago there was a large number of participants and people received like  reply steve says february   at  am i don’t know who this “admin” person is who’s telling people here that ” this settlement was paid a year agoa year ago” because the settlement wasn’t finalapproved until octobernovember of  so obviously that is false information also there were no checks for  as the admin claims checks are only supposed to be for about  so again more false information i plan on calling starkist tomorrow to find out what’s going on as i too have not received any vouchers if they claim to have sent out the settlements then something underhanded is going on if this many people have not received any reimbursement perhaps we need file another class action lawsuit… reply laura says march   at  am did you ever find anything out i haven’t heard anything either and i filed a claim as well reply lois spurck says
