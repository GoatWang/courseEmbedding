results being provided to the public on  via the company’s quarterly press release i would like to analyze agncs bv as of  and provide readers a general direction on how i believe this recent quarter has panned out a previous threepart article i wrote laid the ground works for this bv projection in that article i projectedanalyzed the company’s income statement technically speaking its “consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the second quarter of  the links to that threepart projection article are provided below agnc investment corps q  income statement projection  part

technically speaking several years ago ai changed its “entity status from a reit to a ccorp per the internal revenue code irc however ai still maintained many “mreitlike characteristics including the type of investments held by the company and the amount of annual dividend distributions paid to shareholders in addition the following hybrid mreit companies had at least a modest portion of each

to one company but more so the agencyhybrid mreit sector as a whole this article will also include a brief bv discussionprojection regarding agncs affiliate mtge and the company’s sector peer nly overview of agncs projected bv as of  due to the fact that several figures needed to projectcalculate agnc’s bv as of  come directly from its consolidated statements of comprehensive income table  is provided below table  shows the company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income from a three monthsended time frame using table  below as a reference one must add certain account figures from the first and second quarters of  for purposes of projecting a suitable bv as of  table   agnc three monthsended consolidated statements of comprehensive income source table created entirely by myself partially using data obtained from agncs quarterly investor presentation slides having provided table  above we can now begin to calculate its projected bv as of  this projection will be calculated in table  below there will not be an identical sheet agnc provides that matches the data within table  i have gathered specific information derived from multiple tablescharts for a more detailed analysis of the companys bv as of  agnc through its quarterly investor presentation slides see link above only provides the public with a “book value roll forward” slide this specific slide uses information based only on a quarterly time frame i perform a more detailed quarterly bv calculationanalysis based on the entire year table   agnc three monthsended bv projection bv as of  source table created entirely by myself including all calculated figures and projected valuations using table  above as a reference let us take a look at the calculation for agncs projected bv as of  unless otherwise noted all figures below are for the “six months ended” time frame let us take a look at the following figures in corresponding order to the “ref” column shown in table  next to the june   column a operations b other comprehensive income loss ociocl c stockholder transactions and d capital share transactions a operations  increase in net common equity from operations estimate of  million range  million  confidence within range  moderate to high  see red reference “a” in table  above next to the june   column this “net increase decrease in net common equity from operations figure consists of the following amounts that come directly from the companys consolidated statement of comprehensive income see tables  and  above  net interest income  total other income loss  total expenses and  excise tax due to the fact i discussed these amounts in my previous threepart agnc consolidated statement of comprehensive income projection article see links near the top further discussion of this figure is redundantunwarranted b other comprehensive income loss ociocl  increase in net common equity from other comprehensive income oci estimate of  million range  million  confidence within range  moderate to high  see red reference “b” in table  above next to the june   column this “net increase decrease in net common equity from ociocl” figure consists of the following accounts that come directly from the companys consolidated statement of comprehensive income see tables  and  above  unrealized gain loss on availableforsale “afs” securities net and  unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments net upon reclassification to interest expense due to the fact i also discussed these accounts in my previous threepart agnc consolidated statement of comprehensive income article see links near the top further discussion of this figure is redundantunwarranted as well c stockholder transactions  decrease in net common equity from stockholder transactions estimate of  million range  million  confidence within range  high  see red reference “c” in table  above next to the june   column this “net increase decrease in net common equity from stockholder transactions” figure is agncs dividend distributions for the first and second quarters of  this figure includes activity in relation to the following types of outstanding shares of stock  common and  preferred  common stock prior to projecting agncs common stock dividend distributions for the second quarter of  let us first discuss how the number of the company’s outstanding shares of common stock could change during any given quarter agnc has the following four eventsprograms which could impact the number of outstanding shares of common stock it has when monthly dividends are declared  public offering of shares “bulk” issuance  atthemarket “atm” offering program  dividend reinvestmentdirect stock purchase program and  stock repurchase program on  the company priced its previously announced public offering of  million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of  million in addition agnc granted the underwriters the option to purchase an additional  million shares of its common stock within  days i am projecting the underwriters option was fully exercised as such i am projecting agnc’s outstanding shares of common stock increased  million shares from its recent public offering of shares even though agnc’s stock price throughout the quarter traded slightlytomodestly above its “tangible bv as of   per share i am making the assumption there was no activity within the companys atm offering or dividend reinvestmentdirect stock purchase programs during the second quarter of  my reasoning is mainly due to the may  equity offering described above when it comes to agnc’s repurchase program this was created in october  and was fairly recently amended in october  to allow the company to repurchase up to  billion of its outstanding shares of common stock through  as of  the company had  billion remaining under its stock repurchase program agnc intends to buy back outstanding shares of common stock only when the repurchase price is materially accretive to current tangible bv since the stock price traded modestlytomaterially above the company’s “tangible” bv as of  throughout the second quarter of  i believe management did not repurchase any outstanding shares of common stock the dividend declared on agncs common stock for the second quarter of  totaled  per share this was an unchanged dividend when compared to the prior quarter when calculated i am projecting agnc had dividend distributions to common shareholders of  million for the second quarter of  when combined i am projecting the company had dividend distributions to common shareholders of  million for the six months ended  now let us project the preferred stock dividend distributions  preferred stock the dividend declared on agnc’s “series a preferred stock” agncp and “series b preferred stock” agncb for the second quarter of  was  per share and  per depositary share respectively as such this was an unchanged dividend when compared to the prior quarter there were still  and  million outstanding shares of agncp and agncb as of  respectively exdividend date when calculated i am projecting agnc had dividend distributions to agncp and agncb shareholders of  and  million for the second quarter of  respectively when combined i am projecting the company had dividend distributions to preferred shareholders of  million rounded for the six months ended  after combining the common and preferred stock dividend distributions for the first and second quarters of  i am projecting agnc’s total “distributions to stockholders from estimated reit taxable incomeundistributed taxable income “uti”” and decrease in net common equity from stockholder transactions was  million rounded for the six months ended  see red reference “c” in table  above d capital share transactions  increase in net common equity from capital share transactions estimate of  million range  million  confidence within range  high  see red reference “d” in table  above next to the june   column as stated earlier on  agnc priced its previously announced public offering of  million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of  million in addition the company granted the underwriters the option to purchase an additional  million shares of its common stock within  days i am projecting the underwriters’ option was fully exercised this calculates to additional gross proceeds of approximately  million after accounting for all offering costs and the underwriters’ discount i am projecting agnc’s net proceeds from its may  equity offering was approximately  million in addition i am making the assumption no additional shares of common stock were issued under its atm offering or dividend reinvestmentdirect stock purchase programs during the second quarter of  also since there were no additional preferred stock equity offerings during the second quarter of  the following figures should have no activity  issuance of preferred stock and  preferred stock  per share liquidation preference since agnc officially internalized its management structure through its acquisition of american capital mortgage management “acmm” last year management may be partially compensated through the issuance of common stock subject to certain vesting options as such the company may have some minor amount of equity issuance through the following accounts  issuance of restricted stock andor  issuance of common stock under stockbased compensation program however due to the immaterial impact such restricted stock andor stockbased compensation would represent i have projected no amount within these two accounts during the second quarter of  any actual amount of restricted stock andor stockbased compensation during the second quarter of  through the issuance of new shares would only have a fractional per share impact on its bv as of  regarding agnc’s “repurchases of common stock” figure as stated earlier i am making the assumption management did not purchase any outstanding shares of common stock under its stock repurchase program during the second quarter of  therefore i am projecting the company had a “net common equity from capital share transactions” figure of  million for the six months ended  see red reference “d” in table  above mtge’s projected bv as of  when compared to agnc i am projecting mtge had a slightly more favorable bv per share fluctuation percentagewise for the second quarter of  each company’s agency mbs and derivatives portfolios as of  had several similarities which were discussed in my threepart agnc income statement projection article see links near the top however it should also be noted mtge had a much larger nonagency mbs portfolio with an attractive cost basis and has recently “branched out” to invest in skilled nursing facilities and seniors housing in comparison agnc has a very minor investment in aaa nonagency mbs and no exposure to the healthcare sector when taking all quarterly activities into consideration including additional data not discussed within this specific article i am projecting mtge will report the following bv per common share as of  mtge’s projected bv as of    per common share range  per common share nly’s bv as of  as was highlighted in my threepart agnc income statement projection article see links near the top of this article i discussed several differences between agnc’s and nly’s investment portfolio furthermore it was discussed each company had a different strategy regarding derivative instruments going into the second quarter of  most notably the difference between each company’s hedging coverage ratio as of  simply put nly’s lower hedging coverage ratio at the start of the second quarter of  was an advantage for the company when compared to agnc in addition it should also be noted management has recently broadened nly’s investment portfolio by allocating more capital into commercial debtreal estate preferred equity corporate debt and most recently middle market “mm” lending furthermore nly recently acquired a variablerate agency mreit hatteras financial corp nysehts generally speaking these asset classes when compared to fixedrate agency mbs performed similarly during the second quarter of  on  along with nly’s announcement of a july  equity offering the company provided preliminary results to the public regarding its second quarter of  along with several other operating performance metrics it announced an estimated bv as of  of  per common share within the following mbs pricing article dated  i projected nly’s bv as of  was  per common share when including the quarterly dividend accrual of  per common share which had yet to occur as of  the ex dividend date was  annaly capital and cys investments mbs pricing for q  includes current bv projections due to the negative relationship that existed between most mbs prices and derivative instrument valuations during the last two weeks of the quarter i projected nly’s bv as of  was  per common share prior to management providing quarterly results several readers privately asked for my projection which i provided as support as such i believe its preliminary estimated bv as of  was basically an exact match to my projected bv nly’s projected bv as of  prior to management’s disclosure of preliminary results on    per common share range  per common share nly’s estimated bv as of  per management’s disclosure of preliminary results on    per common share conclusions drawn to sum up all the information discussed above i am projecting agnc will report the following bv per common share as of  agnc’s projected bv as of    per common share range  per common share this projection is a  per common share decrease from its bv as of  this minor decrease can be attributed to two factors the first factor is in relation to the activity within the companys consolidated statement of comprehensive income i am projecting agnc will report a net loss of  million for the second quarter of  while reporting oci of  million when both figures are combined i am projecting agnc will report comprehensive income of  million for the second quarter of  the second factor is in relation to the activity within agnc’s equity section of the balance sheet the company paid foraccrued dividend distributions totaling  per common share during the second quarter of  in addition it paid foraccrued dividend distributions in regard to holders of the companys outstanding shares of preferred stock furthermore agncs may  equity offering resulted in some minor dilution when combined these two factors account for a projected quarterly bv decrease of  per common share when calculated i am projecting agnc’s bv per common share had a decrease of  during the second quarter of  i am also projecting the company generated an “economic return” dividends paidaccrued for and net change in bv of  for the second quarter of  similar to the prior quarter there was a more “neutralmuted” relationship between mbs prices and derivative instrument valuations during the second quarter of  “option adjusted spreads” or oas as such i believe most mreit peers will report only a minor less than  fluctuation in quarterly bv with that being said i believe most mreit stock prices have already “priced in” this more neutralmuted relationship when it comes to sector valuations i believe four key factors to analyze within the fixedrate agency mreit sector this quarter are the following  each company’s proportion of year mbs holdings versus year mbs holdings  each company’s hedging coverage ratio  each company’s proportion of longterm derivative instruments versus shortterm derivative instruments and  each company’s proportion of specified pools for instance harp and llb securities dependent upon these factors i believe results will slightly vary across most of the fixedrate agency mreit sector for the second quarter of  looking ahead to the third quarter of  mortgage interest rates first increased and then recently have reversed course through  the fixedpay rate on interest rate swaps and us treasury yields have also seen the same trend through  when compared to   however the forward libor curve has remained relatively unchanged in addition it should be noted the relationship between agency mbs pricing and derivative instrument valuations has been slightly positive through the first three weeks of july minor tightening of spreads through a detailed analysis that will be omitted from this particular article i am projecting agnc’s bv as of  has fluctuated between  and  per common share when compared to the company’s bv as of  this projection excludes the july  monthly dividend of  per common share exdividend is  my buy sell or hold recommendation from the analysis provided above including additional catalystsfactors not discussed within this particular article i currently rate agnc as a sell when i believe the company’s stock price is trading at less than a  discount to my projected bv as of  a hold when trading at or greater than a  but less than a  discount to my projected bv as of  and a buy when trading at or greater than a  discount to my projected bv as of  these ranges are unchanged when compared to part  of my income statement projection article approximately three weeks ago therefore i currently rate agnc as a sell however fairly close to my hold range since the stock is trading at less than a  discount to my projected bv as of  my current price target for agnc is approximately  per share this is currently the price where my recommendation would change to a hold the current price where my recommendation would change to a buy is approximately  per share along with the data presented within this article this recommendation considers the following mreit catalystsfactors  projected future mbs price movements  projected future derivative valuations and  projected nearterm dividend per share rates this recommendation also considers the high probability of multiple federal “fed” funds rate increases by the fomc during  this is a more hawkish view when compared to most of last year due to recent macroeconomic trendsevents this also considers the eventual “winddown” of the fed’s balance sheet final note each investors buy sell or hold decision is based on ones risk tolerance time horizon and dividend income
