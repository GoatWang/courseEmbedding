short  term and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the performance potential of the fund over varying market conditions or economic cycles risk considerations investors should consider the following risk factors and special considerations associated with investing in the fund which may cause you to lose money including the entire principal amount that you invest equity risk the value of the equity securities held by the fund will fall due to general market and economic conditions perceptions regarding the industries in which the issuers of securities held by the fund participate or factors relating to specific companies in which the fund invests risk of concentrating in the water industry adverse developments in the water industry may significantly affect the value of the securities held by the fund companies involved in the water industry are subject to environmental considerations taxes government regulation price and supply fluctuations competition and water conservation industrial sector risk the stock prices of companies in this sector are affected by supply and demand both for their specific product or service and for industrial sector products in general the products of manufacturing companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction government regulation world events and economic conditions may affect the performance of companies in the industrial sector companies in this sector may be at risk for environmental damage and product liability claims utilities sector risk the rates that traditional regulated utility companies may charge their customers generally are subject to review and limitation by governmental regulatory commissions rate changes ordinarily occur only following a delay after the changes in financing costs this factor will tend to favorably affect a regulated utility company’s earnings and dividends in times of decreasing costs but conversely will tend to adversely affect earnings and dividends when costs are rising foreign investment risk the fund’s investments in nonus issuers although generally limited to adrs may involve unique risks compared to investing in securities of us issuers including less market liquidity generally greater market volatility than us securities and less complete financial information than for us issuers small and mediumsized company risk investing in securities of small and mediumsized companies involves greater risk than is customarily associated with investing in larger more established companies concentration risk if the index concentrates in an industry or group of industries the fund’s investments will be concentrated accordingly in such event the value of the fund’s shares may rise and fall more than the value of shares of a fund that invests in securities of companies in a broader range of industries in addition the funds are subject to noncorrelation risk replication management
