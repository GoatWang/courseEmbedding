corporation is the worlds largest manufacturer of mobile phones serving customers in  countries nokia is divided into four business groups mobile phones multimedia enterprise solutions and networks the mobile phones group markets wireless voice and data products in consumer and corporate markets the multimedia segment sells mobile gaming devices home satellite systems and cable television settop boxes the enterprise solutions group develops wireless systems for use in the corporate sector wireless switching and transmission equipment is sold through the companys networks division nokia operates  manufacturing facilities in nine countries and maintains research and development facilities in  countries thcentury origins originally a manufacturer of pulp and paper nokia was founded as nokia company in  in a small town of the same name in central finland nokia was a pioneer in the industry and introduced many new production methods to a country with only one major natural resource its vast forests as the industry became increasingly energyintensive the company even constructed its own power plants but for many years nokia remained an important yet static firm in a relatively forgotten corner of northern europe nokia shares were first listed on the helsinki exchange in  the first major changes in nokia occurred several years after world war ii despite its proximity to the soviet union finland has always remained economically connected with scandinavian and other western countries and as finnish trade expanded nokia became a leading exporter during the early s nokia began to diversify in an attempt to transform the company into a regional conglomerate with interests beyond finnish borders unable to initiate strong internal growth nokia turned its attention to acquisitions the government however hoping to rationalize two underperforming basic industries favored nokias expansion within the country and encouraged its eventual merger with finnish rubber works which was founded in  and finnish cable works which was formed in  to form nokia corporation when the amalgamation was completed in  nokia was involved in several new industries including integrated cable operations electronics tires and rubber footwear and had made its first public share offering in  nokia set up a division to develop design and manufacturing capabilities in data processing industrial automation and communications systems the division was later expanded and made into several divisions which then concentrated on developing information systems including personal computers and workstations digital communications systems and mobile phones nokia also gained a strong position in modems and automatic banking systems in scandinavia oil crisis corporate changes s nokia continued to operate in a stable but parochial manner until  when it was affected in a unique way by the oil crisis years of political accommodation between finland and the soviet union ensured finnish neutrality in exchange for lucrative trade agreements with the soviets mainly finnish lumber products and machinery in exchange for soviet oil by agreement this trade was kept strictly in balance but when world oil prices began to rise the market price for soviet oil rose with it balanced trade began to mean greatly reduced purchasing power for finnish companies such as nokia although the effects were not catastrophic the oil crisis did force nokia to reassess its reliance on soviet trade about  percent of sales as well as its international growth strategies several contingency plans were drawn up but the greatest changes came after the company appointed a new ceo kari kairamo in  kairamo noted the obvious nokia was too big for finland the company had to expand abroad he studied the expansion of other scandinavian companies particularly swedens electrolux and following their example formulated a strategy of first consolidating the companys business in finland sweden norway and denmark and then moving gradually into the rest of europe after the company had improved its product line established a reputation for quality and adjusted its production capacity it would enter the world market meanwhile nokias traditional heavy industries were looking increasingly burdensome it was feared that trying to become a leader in electronics while maintaining these basic industries would create an unmanageably unfocused company kairamo thought briefly about selling off the companys weaker divisions but decided to retain and modernize them he reasoned that although the modernization of these lowgrowth industries would be very expensive it would guarantee nokias position in several stable markets including paper chemical and machinery productions and electrical generation for the scheme to be practical each divisions modernization would have to be gradual and individually financed this would prevent the bleeding of funds away from the allimportant effort in electronics while preventing the heavy industries from becoming any less profitable with each division financing its own modernization there was little or no drain on capital from other divisions and nokia could still sell any group that did not succeed under the new plan in the end the plan prompted the machinery division to begin development in robotics and automation the cables division to begin work on fiber optics and the forestry division to move into highgrade tissues rise of electronics s nokias most important focus was development of the electronics sector over the course of the s the firm acquired nearly  companies focusing especially on three segments of the electronics industry consumer workstations and mobile communications electronics grew from  percent of annual sales to  percent of revenues from  to  in late  nokia acquired salora the largest color television manufacturer in scandinavia and luxor the swedish stateowned electronics and computer firm nokia combined salora and luxor into a single division and concentrated on stylish consumer electronic products since style was a crucial factor in scandinavian markets the saloraluxor division was also very successful in satellite and digital television technology nokia purchased the consumer electronics operations of standard elektrik lorenz ag from alcatel in  further bolstering the companys position in the television market to the third largest manufacturer in europe in early  nokia acquired the data systems division of the swedish ericsson group making nokia the largest scandinavian information technology business although a market leader in scandinavia nokia still lacked a degree of competitiveness in the european market which was dominated by much larger japanese and german companies kairamo decided therefore to follow the example of many japanese companies during the s and korean manufacturers a decade later and negotiate to become an original equipment manufacturer or oem to manufacture products for competitors as a subcontractor nokia manufactured items for hitachi in france ericsson in sweden northern telecom in canada and granada and ibm in britain in doing so it was able to increase its production capacity stability there were however several risks involved those inherent in any oem arrangement nokias sales margins were naturally reduced but of greater concern production capacity was built up without a commensurate expansion in the sales network with little brand identification nokia feared it might have a difficult time selling under its own name and become trapped as an oem in  nokia reorganized its management structure to simplify reporting efforts and improve control by central management the companys  divisions were grouped into four industry segments electronics cables and machinery paper power and chemicals and rubber and flooring in addition nokia won a concession from the finnish government to allow greater foreign participation in ownership this substantially reduced nokias dependence on the comparatively expensive finnish lending market although there was growth throughout the company nokias greatest success was in telecommunications having dabbled in telecommunications in the s nokia cut its teeth in the industry by selling switching systems under license from a french company alcatel the finnish firm got in on the cellular industrys ground floor in the late s when it helped design the worlds first international cellular system named the nordic mobile telephone nmt network the system linked sweden denmark norway and finland a year after the network came on line in  nokia gained  percent control of mobira the finnish mobile phone company that would later become its key business interest as the nokia mobile phones division mobiras regional sales were vastly improved but nokia was still limited to oem production on the international market nokia and tandy corporation of the united states built a factory in masan south korea to manufacture mobile telephones these were sold under the tandy name in that companys  radio shack stores throughout the united states in  eager to test its ability to compete openly nokia chose the mobile telephone to be the first product marketed internationally under the nokia name it became nokias make or break product unfortunately asian competitors began to drive prices down just as nokia entered the market other nokia products gaining recognition were salora televisions and luxor satellite dishes which suffered briefly when subscription programming introduced broadcast scrambling the companys expansion achieved almost exclusively by acquisition had been expensive few finnish investors other than institutions had the patience to see nokia through its longterm plans indeed more than half of the new shares issued by nokia in  went to foreign investors nokia moved boldly into western markets it gained a listing on the london exchange in  and was subsequently listed on the new york exchange crises of leadership profitability in the late s and early s nokias rapid growth was not without a price in  as revenues soared the companys profits under pressure from severe price competition in the consumer electronics markets dropped chairman kari kairamo committed suicide in december of that year not surprisingly friends said it was brought on by stress simo s vuorileto took over the companys reins and began streamlining operations in the spring of  nokia was divided into six business groups consumer electronics data mobile phones telecommunications cables and machinery and basic industries vuorileto continued kairamos focus on hightech divisions divesting nokias flooring paper rubber and ventilation systems businesses and entering into joint ventures with companies such as tandy corporation and matra of france two separate agreements to produce mobile phones for the us and french markets in spite of these efforts nokias pretax profits continued to decline in  and  culminating in a loss of  million in  industry observers blamed cutthroat european competition the breakdown of the finnish banking system and the collapse of the soviet union but notwithstanding these difficulties nokia remained committed to its hightech orientation late in  the company strengthened that dedication by promoting jorma ollila from president of nokiamobira inc renamed nokia mobile phones ltd the following year to group president leading the telecommunications revolution mids and beyond forbess fleming meeks credited ollila with transforming nokia from a moneylosing hodgepodge of companies into one of telecommunications most profitable companies unable to find a buyer for nokias consumer electronics business which had lost nearly  billion from  to  ollila cut that segments workforce by  percent shuttered plants and centralized operations having divested nokia data in  nokia focused further on its telecommunications core by selling off its power unit in  and its television and tire and cable units the following year the new leader achieved success in the cellular phone segment by bringing innovative products to market quickly with a particular focus on ever smaller and easiertouse phones featuring sleek finnish design nokia gained a leg up in cellphone research and development with the  acquisition of the united kingdoms technophone ltd for  million the company began selling digital cellular phones in  ollilas tenure brought nokia success and with it global recognition the companys sales more than doubled from fim  billion in  to fim  billion in  and its bottom line rebounded from a net loss of fim  million in  to a fim  billion profit in  securities investors did not miss the turnaround nokias market capitalization multiplied ten times from  to  in late  and early  nokia suffered a temporary setback stemming from a shortage of chips for its digital cellular phones and a resultant disruption of its logistics chain the companys production costs rose and profits fell nokia was also slightly ahead of the market particularly in north america in regard to the shift from analog to digital phones as a result it was saddled with a great number of digital phones it could not sell and an insufficient number of analog devices nevertheless nokia had positioned itself well for the long haul and within just a year or two it was archrival motorola inc that was burdened with an abundance of phones it could not sell analog ones as motorola was slow to convert to digital as a result by late  nokia had surpassed motorola and claimed the top position in cellular phones worldwide aiding this surge was the november  introduction of the  series of digital phones this line proved immensely popular because of the phones small size similar to a slim pack of cigarettes light weight  ounces and superior battery life first introduced in the burgeoning mobile phone market in china the  soon became a worldwide phenomenon including the  and other models nokia sold nearly  million cellular phones in  net sales increased more than  percent over the previous year jumping from fim  billion  billion to fim  billion  billion operating profits increased by  percent while the companys skyrocketing stock price shot up more than  percent pushing nokias market capitalization from fim  billion  billion to fim  billion  billion not content with conquering the mobile phone market nokia began aggressively pursuing the mobile internet sector in the late s already on the market was the nokia  communicator a personal allinone communication device that included phone data internet email and fax retrieval services the nokia  mobile phone included the capability to access the internet in addition nokia was the first company to introduce a cellular phone that could be connected to a laptop computer to transmit data over a mobile network to help develop further products nokia began acquiring internet technology companies starting with the december   million purchase of ipsilon networks inc a silicon valley firm specializing in internet routing one year later nokia spent fim  million  million for vienna systems corporation a canadian firm focusing on internet protocol telephony acquisitions continued in  when a further seven deals were completed four of which were internetrelated meanwhile net sales increased a further  percent in  while operating profits grew by  percent riding the late s hightech stock boom the market capitalization of nokia took another huge leap ending the year at eur  billion  billion nokias share of the global cellular phone market increased from  percent in  to  percent in  as the company sold  million phones in  nokias ascendance to the top of the wireless world by the end of the s could be traced to the company being able to consistently over and over again come out with highmargin products superior to those of its competitors and in tune with market demands the continuation of this trend into the st century was by no means certain as the increasing convergence of wireless and internet technologies and the development of the third generation g of wireless technology which followed the analog and digital generations and which was slated to feature sophisticated multimedia capability were predicted to open nokia up to new and formidable competitors perhaps the greatest threat was that chipmakers such as intel would turn mobile phones into commodities just as they had previously done with personal computers the days of the  nokia phone were potentially numbered nevertheless nokias  percent profit margins were enabling it to spend a massive  billion a year on research and development and continue to churn out innovative new products concentrating on the various standards being developed for g wireless networks a twopronged approach in the st century mobile communications developed along two broad fronts during the first years of the century both of which played to nokias advantage ensuring that the company remained the leader of its industry the evolution of handsets into multimedia devices ushered in by g technology meant that nokia could continue to rely on marketing expensive sophisticated handsets the days of the  nokia phone gave way to the days of increasingly more expensive phones such as the nokia n a unit featuring a camera with carl zeiss optics videorecording capabilities and internet access nokia could count on a substantial share of the high end of the market a segment that continued to thrive midway through the decade but the companys greatest strength was in the lower end of the market in countries such as china brazil and india there was a tremendous demand for inexpensive mobile phones with analysts expecting  percent of the one billion handsets sold between  and  to be sold in developing economies industry observers believed there were only two companies in the world that could seriously compete for the estimated millionunitper year market for inexpensive handsets motorola and nokia rivals such as samsung sony ericsson and lg electronics preferred to confine their activities to the high end of the market while emerging lowcost producers lacked the manufacturing efficiencies enjoyed by nokia and motorola against the backdrop of favorable market trends supporting nokias entrenched position the company experienced a rare event in its modern history a change in leadership after a decadeandahalf at the helm ceo ollila announced his retirement effective june  his replacement was a year nokia veteran named ollipekka kallasvuo a lawyer by training whom fortune in that magazines october   issue described as so taciturn that he can seem like an extra from an ingmar bergman movie kallasvuo who was promoted from his position as the head of the handset division inherited an impressively capable company whose greatest challenge was contending with motorola for the low end of the market and beating back competitors for control of the high end of the market nokia is a dynamic company in a fastchanging and fluid environment kallasvuo said in a november   interview with the south china morning post i look forward to working together with our team to help nokia shape the future of mobile communications at a pivotal time for the industry

nasdaqaapl unstocks nokia corp nysenok products as patent dispute gets stocks apple inc nasdaqaapl unstocks nokia corp nysenok products as patent dispute gets ugly byandy parker december    share on facebook tweet on twitter products belonging to withings a subsidiary of nokia corp nysenok have been pulled from the shelves of apple inc nasdaqaapl brickandmortar retail stores as well as on the online stores this comes amidst a patent fight between the california cupertinobased tech giant and the finnish networking technology company on the web store the information that visitors get when searching for withings products reads as follows “looking for something we thought so however the product you’re looking for is no longer available on applecom” affected products among the products belonging to withings that apple has pulled from its stores are fitness trackers which have been a feature on the stores for more than two years some of the affected products include the smart body analyzer and the body cardio scale the row between the two companies started when nokia filed a lawsuit against apple accusing it of patent infringement in the suit nokia listed  patents as having been infringed by apple in a counter move an antitrust lawsuit was filed by apple against nine companies that are registered as the holders of the patents with the accusation that they are working in cahoots with nokia in an extortion attempt against apple a countersuit by apple was also filed against nokia frand rules in its lawsuit the argument that apple is using is based on frand rules which seek to promote making patents available to any firm at rates that are reasonable since they are important and necessary in developing devices that have become essential in life like smartphones the frand rules are favored by companies that want the patents but not by the companies that hold the patents since they limit the amount of revenue that can be generated from those in possession of the patents this is not the first time that the two tech companies are engaged in a patent dispute five years ago after an acrimonious battle the two firms reached a settlement where apple was to pay nokia a onetime payment and royalties for use of nokia’s smartphone technology the dispute comes just as nokiabranded phones running on the android operating system are about to be launched in early

controversiesedit nsns provision of intercept capability to iranedit in  nokia siemens networks a joint venture between nokia and siemens ag reportedly provided irans monopoly telecom company with technology that allowed it to intercept the internet communications of its citizens the technology reportedly allowed iran to use deep packet inspection to read and change the content of emails social media and online phone calls the technology enables authorities to not only block communication but to monitor it to gather information about individuals as well as alter it for disinformation purposes during the postelection protests in iran in june  irans internet access was reported to have slowed to less than a tenth of its normal speeds which experts suspected was due to the use of the interception technology in july  nokia began to experience a boycott of their products and services in iran the boycott was led by consumers sympathetic to the postelection protest movement and targeted companies deemed to be collaborating with the regime demand for handsets fell and users began shunning sms messaging nokia siemens networks asserted in a press release that it provided iran only with a lawful intercept capability solely for monitoring of local voice calls and that it has not provided any deep packet inspection web censorship or internet filtering capability to iran lex

delaware claiming that apple infringed on  of its patents related to wireless communication including data transfer apple was quick to respond with a countersuit filed in december  accusing nokia of  patent infringements apples general counsel bruce sewell went a step further by stating other companies must compete with us by inventing their own technologies not just by stealing ours this resulted in a legal battle between the two telecom majors with nokia filing another suit this time with the us international trade commission itc alleging apple of infringing its patents in virtually all of its mobile phones portable music players and computers nokia went on to ask the court to ban all us imports of the apple products including the iphone macintosh and ipod apple countersued by filing a complaint with the itc in january  in june  apple settled with nokia and agreed to an estimated one time payment of  million and royalties to nokia the two companies also agreed on a crosslicensing

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
