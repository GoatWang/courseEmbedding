madisons east side this summer lindsay christians  the capital times  lchristiansmadisoncom  lindsayc lindsay christians  the capital times feb   john mleziva expects to open state line distillery at  northern ct this summer  photo by john mleziva the near east side of madison could have its own little distillery district as soon as this summer state line distilling currently slated to open in june at  northern ct is the longtime dream of john mlezivamleziva  is an internship coordinator at the university of wisconsinmadison but hell leave in a few weeks to focus full time on converting the former home of northern plating a nickelplating company into a  square foot graintoglass distillery with a tasting room cocktail program and outdoor seating its less than a mile from old sugar distillery known for making honey liqueur brandy from wisconsin grapes and ouzo among other things at state line mleziva plans to start with a flagship gin a sageforward gin that is dry and really floral on the nosestate line hopes to purchase apples for an eau de vie apple brandy from door creek orchard near cottage grove and may work with briess malt  ingredients co in chilton to source grainthough whiskey takes years to age dont expect any white whiskey or flavored vodkas in the meantime    state line distillery is going into a  square foot building on madisons east side that used to be a nickel plating company  photo by john melziva we’ll be making our own neutral grain spirits in house so the base will be the same for the gin and vodka mleziva said and while hes producing those the whole time we’re going to be laying down whiskeyi spent time in scotland getting my degree so i’ve got a high affinity for wellmade whiskey and scotch in particular we’ll be putting down an americanstyle single malt aged in  gallon barrels were also doing rye whiskey and variations of rye in december the first news came out about state line distillery when the wisconsin state journal reported that it would cost  million and include a liter  gallon foottall kothe still from germanyeric welch and troy sedlak own the building shulfer architects are working with the construction company supreme structuresmleziva said he just finished paying on that kothe still which is set to arrive in april mark anunson formerly of few spirits in illinois is his business partner and production manager i’m always impressed with what few is putting out said mleziva mark specifically oversaw their whiskey program so we’ve got a lot of ideas kicking around on how to do a deep dive on our yeast selection and how that influences flavor profile  as well as barrel selection and maturation    john melziva is importing a still from germany for state line distillery its set to arrive in april  photo by john melziva mleziva grew up west of minneapolis and moved to madison after graduate school in  hed earned a bachelors degree in biology and a masters in education policy and he came to take a job as associate director of student activities at edgewood college he loved working with college students and still does they energize him he said but in  mleziva heard about a brewing and distilling program in scotland at heriotwatt university and he decided to take a chance it was one of those moments when you look in the mirror and say am i going to regret not doing this  years from now mleziva saidan enthusiastic homebrewer since his grandfather introduced him to it when he was about  mleziva figured hed focus on beer his affinity for distilling came as a surprise i fell in love with artistry that goes into whiskey specifically he said when you make a beer  theres a lot of thought given to grain selection yeast profile fermentation temperatures frontend things that make an amazing product  dont miss a thing get a cap times daily summary sent to your inbox sign up i understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement

engaging intellectual experience    buy now it will take a few years for state line distillery to start producing whiskey which takes time to age owner john melziva studied scotch distilling in scotland photo by michelle stocker mleziva also thought hed spend a few years in madison before going back to the minneapolis area then he met his wife deanna haase in madison the two got married in  and mleziva began to consider the possibilities for his own local distillery i started to fall in love with madison as a city as a place where there is a lot of energy around local business and artisan craft he said whether it’s food or beverage or just the general arts scene it resonated with mestate line will join a growing spirits scene here yahara bay distillery dane countys first since prohibition opened in  and expanded into a larger facility in fitchburg in october  old sugar is also on the east side elsewhere in dane county wollersheim winery makes brandy j henry makes bourbon and aeppeltreow winery  distillery produces an apple brandymleziva spent six months working as an assistant distiller at deaths door distillery in middleton deaths door makes several hundred thousand cases of spirits a year by contrast state line plans to make  cases in the first year and around  once the distillery is up and running there are several distilleries but we’re all doing different things focusing on the industry a little differently mleziva said we’re going to bring a different twist to what we’re doing by introducing clear spirits and focusing on trying to incorporate wisconsin botanicalsthere is no grand opening planned yet for state line but mleziva is looking forward to a welcome to the neighborhood event when everythings ready he hopes to have snacks like cheese and charcuterie things that go well with spirits as well as some small batch cordials to complement the primary spirits most important mleziva said is to grow authentically when i look at what defines success for state line i want to be fully integrated into the madison culture and beyond he said we’re purposely starting small i feel strongly about taking your time and growing our consumer
