antifúngicas actualesfuentes de datosse realizó una búsqueda en el banco de datos de medline para identificar artículos relevantes como repasos estudios recientes guías de tratamiento y datos de la compañía manufacturera merck  coseleción de estudiosse utilizo estudios in vitro y ensayos clínicos para resumir la eficacia clínica y la seguridad de caspofunginextracción de datosse repaso todos los estudios clínicos disponiblessíntesis de datosla incidencia de infecciones fungicidas está aumentando mientras que la población a riesgo también continua ampliándose el costo la resistencia y la morbilidad y mortalidad son factores claves que están asociados a esta enfermedad para poder tratar estos dilemas terapéuticos es necesario que se añada al escenario de agentes antifúngales caspofungin es el primer miembro de una clase de agentes antifúngicos llamados equinocandinas que fue aprobado para uso clínico caspofungin está clasificado como un fármaco inhibidor de la síntesis de glucano y representa una clase de agentes con un mecanismo de acción nueva a diferencia a los agentes actualmente disponibles polienos pirimidinas azoles que ejercen sus efectos en la pared celular del hongo los equinocandinas son los primeros agentes que inhiben la síntesis de la pared celular del hongo caspofungin tiene actividad contra aspergillus y cándida incluyendo especies que no son albicans datos de los ensayos clinicos demuestran que caspofungin es efectivo en pacientes con aspergilosis invasora así como candidiasis esofágica la fda ha aprobado su uso límite a la aspergilosis invasiva en pacientes que no responden o no toleran terapias antifúngicas tradicionales actualesconclusionescaspofungin tiene actividad contra especies de aspergillus así como una variedad de especies de cándida los datos clínicos apoyan su utilidad en el tratamiento contra la aspergilosis invasora y en infecciones selectas de cándida parece que el rol terapéutico de caspofungin pueda expandir cuando resultados de estudios clínicos adicionales estén disponiblesobjectifdécrire brièvement lépidémiologie des infections fongiques revoir les agents actuellement disponibles pour leur traitement et faire une revue des données disponibles sur la caspofongine cancidas concernant la pharmacologie du médicament la pharmacocinétique la posologie recommandée linnocuité et lefficacité ainsi que son rôle dans le traitement des infections fongiques invasives par comparaison à la thérapie antifongique actuellerevue de littératureune recherche informatisée dans la banque de données medline a été faite afin didentifier les articles pertinents incluant les articles de revue les études les plus récentes les lignes directrices de traitement et des données fournies par le fabricant mercksélection des étudesles études in vitro et les études cliniques ont été retenues pour évaluer lefficacité clinique et linnocuité de la caspofonginesélection de linformationtoutes les études cliniques disponibles ont été analyséesrésumélincidence des infections fongiques augmente parallèlement à lexpansion de la population à risque les coûts la résistance la morbidité et la mortalité liés à ces infections sont des aspects cruciaux à analyser des armes nouvelles pour lutter contre ces infections sont nécessaires pour contrôler ce défi thérapeutique la caspofongine est le premier agent dune nouvelle classe dantifongiques les échinocandines à avoir été approuvé pour une utilisation clinique la caspofongine est un inhibiteur de la synthèse des glucanes et représente une classe dagents possédant un nouveau mécanisme daction contrairement aux agents actuellement disponibles polyènes pyrimidines azoles qui exercent leur action sur la membrane cellulaire du champignon les échinocandines sont les premiers agents qui inhibent la synthèse de la βd glucane un composant de la paroi cellulaire des champignons la caspofongine est active contre les espèces daspergillus et de candida incluant les espèces non albicans les données issues des études cliniques montrent que la caspofongine est efficace lors daspergillose invasive aussi bien que lors dœsophagite à candida lindication approuvée par la fda se limite à laspergillose réfractaire à la thérapie conventionnelle ou lors dintoléranceconclusionsla caspofongine possède une activité contre les espèces daspergillus et contre une variété despèces de candida les données cliniques supportent son utilité dans le traitement de laspergillose invasive et dans certaines infections à candida dès que les données seront disponibles il est à prévoir que le rôle de cet agent dans la thérapie antifongique sera plus grandreferencessectionchoosetop of pageabstractepidemiologycurrently available agentchemistrymechanism of
