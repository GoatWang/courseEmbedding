  mina sooch president and ceo gemphire therapeutics inc by tom henderson email print newsmakers health care mina sooch photo by lon horwedel it was a rollercoaster year for mina sooch the president and ceo of gemphire therapeutics a small pharmaceutical startup in livonia it was a rollercoaster year for mina sooch the president and ceo of gemphire therapeutics a small pharmaceutical startup in livonia she had planned on an initial public offering of  million for gemphire early in the year but a cooling market nationally for pharma ipos pushed the timing back to june and the target amount down to  million in june world markets were roiled by the unexpected vote by those in the united kingdom to leave the european union and her ipo was pushed back to august and the amount downsized again to  million also in june sooch was named by crains as one of the  most influential women in michigan finally on aug  gemphire which had licensed a cardiovascular drug called gemcabene from pfizer inc had its offering and began trading on the nasdaq global market under the symbol gemp immediately sooch began proceeding on two human trials on different potential patient populations for gemcabene and laying the groundwork to enroll patients for a third trial all of which are expected to start reporting results in  favorable results — the three will enroll a total of about  patients in medical centers around the country — could lead to a secondary public offering or to a sale to a larger pharmaceutical company sooch said the ipo raised enough money to fund all three trials and get gemphire through the first half of  it was a year of highs but also one of uncertainty for quite some time i learned patience sooch said it was very rewarding to go public and execute on our plan the rest of the year to hire a team and get our trials up and running were exactly where we want to be as a company we got advice from our bankers that we should consider waiting for january  to go public but we wanted to launch three trials and we couldnt do that until we went public she said sooch put her money where her mouth was regarding the ipo to show her faith in gemcabene and that new trials would reflect the successes of earlier trials sooch and her cofounder and chief science officer charlie bisgaier each invested more than  in the ipo thats a meaningful number and it showcased our belief in gemcabene she said sooch was also a crains newsmaker of the year in  a year that established her as a superstar on the local biotech front in january that year she raised  million in venture capital for what had been a struggling pharmaceutical company that she joined in  as president and ceo plymouth townshipbased pronai therapeutics inc then that april she raised an additional

orleans in december  on how its lead product improved the conditions of patients with nonhodgkin lymphoma whose cancer had been resistant to other treatmentsin september  sooch left pronai which was setting the stage for an ipo of  million in  it was time for the company to bring in a ceo who had experience leading public companies and time for her to move on to another startup in gemphire
