that are the bedrock of our investment philosophy valuation matters dearly academic studies show that securities purchased at a discount provide enhanced return possibilities to investors we are business owners on behalf of our clients we believe portfolio turnover is the enemy of investors because of frictional costs and the likelihood it makes them regularly exit what could have been the investor’s best performing securities we seek out highquality businesses it is our belief that longduration investment success in common stocks is far more likely to come from businesses that have succeeded in the past our investment philosophy plays out in our firm’s eight investment criteria eight investment criteria our portfolio managers evaluate and purchase stocks based on the following eight investment criteria   required over the entire holding period   meets an economic need   strong competitive advantage wide moats or barriers to entry long history of profitability and strong operating metrics  generates high levels of free cash flow   available at a low price in relation to intrinsic value   favored but not required   managements history of shareholder friendliness  strong balance sheet  strong insider ownership preferably with recent purchases   every company we own must satisfy the required criteria for companies that do not also meet the favored criteria we believe these shortterm conditions will be ultimately corrected or overwhelmed by the required criteria     sell criteria  companies are sold if they deviate significantly from these criteria or if their stock price becomes unreasonable due to dramatic price appreciation in relation to underlying fundamentals when a security falls  from our purchase price or relative to a peer group the
