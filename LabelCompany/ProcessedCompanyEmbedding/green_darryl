furniturewhen the space you have isn’t quite enough it’s important to find furniture that has more than one purpose adding doubleduty pieces is a great way to conserve room and save money especially with a large or growing family instead of buying a traditional sofa invest in a sofa bed or daybed for overnight guests find an ottoman with hidden storage that can act as extra seating as well as stash extra blankets and throws finally benches with room for wicker baskets and bins help with organization and seating tootake advantage of your entire family room layoutthe center of a living room is often filled with sofas armchairs area rugs and coffee tables so use the room’s corners to create individual nooks in one corner place a chaise lounge side table and table lamp for the readers in the family in another corner place a small computer table and laptop for gaming and homework and for the adults use one corner to house a bar cart stocked with all the essentialsgo big with builtinsas one of the most frequently used rooms in the house living rooms often collect an abundance of books electronics and knickknacks avoid turning it into a glorified storage unit by splurging on builtins although they might be pricey builtin cabinets shelves and entertainment centers provide plenty of storage and give the impression of an organized puttogether room even if that’s not the case builtins also save space so you won’t have to worry about finding room for a bookshelf sideboard or media consoleoffer plenty of alternative seatingwhen you have a large group over during holidays or special events it’s key to have enough seating for everyone for a spaceefficient option use small ottomans poufs and cubes or even floor cushions and pillows when the crowd is extra large store benches along the perimeter of the room so they’re easy to grab and move during a party and ensure you have a basic sofa or two and armchairs for even more seating store folding chairs in a nearby closet or take chairs from the dining roombring in decorative accessoriesthere’s no need to skimp on the accessories even when space is limited small things such as colorful throw pillows soft throws shiny candleholders and trendy trays can pack a very large punch and can help your space feel like home picture frames and wall art are great ways to personalize a room and area rugs and curtains can add

accent chair will work for meconsider the room’s current design scheme as well as your personal preferences when making this decision do you want something that can double as a focal point if so find something with exposed wood and less padding or a piece upholstered in a unique materials such as a vibrant velvet do you want to sink into your new seat with a glass of wine at the end of a long day if relaxation is your main goal you’ll want a design where comfort is key — think thick cushions wide armrests or even a giant papasan chair consider the following types of chairs for your homearmchairs just like the name says these feature two arms and are synonymous with comfy living room chairs they come in many styles but the most common are the soft and inviting oversized chairs that sport substantial armrests these are perfect for curling up in and can be super conducive to getting lost in a good book smaller models like barrel or club chairs can be a great way to incorporate that same cozy feeling in a slightly more formal wayarmless chairs no arms required for these guys if you’ve got a tighter space but still want to add a functional accent piece a parsons side or slipper chair should fit the bill you can find them upholstered or not and while they are generally simple designs more intricate styles are available wingback chairs the high sides and back of a wing chair were originally intended to protect the sitter from drafts or help trap in heat from a fireplace which explains why it’s often pictured near one now its bold design serves as more of a statement and less of a functional element its close relative the balloon chair features a similar highback design with a partially enclosed halfdome shape that would protect its occupant just the sameegg chairs the modern futuristic look of this iconic style created by arne jacobsen in  is sure to be a showstopper it’s been said the design of the egg chair was inspired by the popular womb chair both styles feature womblike shapes and round modern curves its cousin the swan chair is a smaller less encompassing version but will bring an equally modern and fun look to any roomhow big should my accent chair bethis depends on where you plan to put it determining the size is all about understanding scale — if it’s going in a spacious living room a larger armchair will work but if it’s going into a tight guest bedroom or a corner consider one of smaller stature such as a slipper chair or a corner chair in addition keep in mind the other furnishings in the room so that the size of your new piece works with them not against themwhat upholstery material should i considerin many cases upholstered chairs tend to be accent pieces so it may be fun to use a patterned fabric or bold color to make a statement cotton and polyester designs usually come in the widest variety of colors and patterns but might not be the winners if you’re looking for fabrics that are easy to clean if your style is more easygoing and classic consider leather or microfiber both are fairly easy to clean and will withstand wearandtear over time always take your climate into account as well when choosing an upholstered chair — for example leather chairs may not be the best choice for hot sticky climatesshould i pair my living room chair with an ottomanottomans and footstools are great for kicking back and relaxing and work well if your armchair falls in line with a more casual lounging style think along the lines of a leather chair and ottoman tucked in the corner by a cozy fireplace if it’s too formal a footrest may seem out of place you’ll always need to consider space will there still be sufficient room for pathways and access to the chair itself if so your next step will be to make sure to get the height and width right to maximize comfort both pieces should be of similar width with the footstool being as high as or slightly lower than the seat height ideally you should try to coordinate the pieces by matching color material or patternunited statesunited statesunited kingdomaustraliadeutschlandfranceроссияitaliaespañadanmarksverigeirelandsingaporenew

learn morewhat kind of accent chairs do i needthere are many different styles so finding the right one to fit in the right spot can be a daunting task before shopping for new seating get a feel for what youre looking for are you trying to round out your living room set comfort is key so look for an wingback chaise lounge or recliner want to fill that empty corner in your dining room and also have additional dining room seating on hand opt for a more casual side or accent chair looking for really relax in your bedroom or nursery gliders and rockers will put you to sleep in no time once you figure out its function its easy to narrow down your optionswhat style chairs work for my spaceas you pick out the pattern color and material start by understanding what you like and what will blend in or stand out in your current decor a tufted or wingback club chair gives off an elegant sophisticated vibe while an piece with nailhead details or chevron pattern is more contemporary bring a pop of color to your space with a bright or multicolored option or add some muchneeded pattern in an allwhite room you can also add style by experimenting with material leather and wood are classic options while an upholstered or plastic piece can veer more modern depending on the other finishes when it comes to material you want to think about both practicality and design after all wood and plastic are more durable when little kids or pets are involved since theyre easy to wipe up and hard to ruinhow do i determine whether a recliner or chair is ergonomically correctmost often this applies to office chairs where people spend hours sitting however any piece that you spend time in should be ergonomically appropriate to start test out all options you’re considering for purchase — your body will innately know whether it’s right for you or not if it feels good check out the back support particularly for kitchen or dining room options that are generally more upright the lower portion should provide support while being slightly curved to follow the contour of your spine as for the seat it should feel comfortable when you first sit down and stay that way for several hours there should be at least an inch of space between your body and the sides of the furniture to allow for some movement if you’re looking for an option with arms make sure their height is proportionate to your body if they’re too high you’ll have trouble relaxing your shoulders while your arms are resting embed photo open photo in new window pagetype pagebrowseproductproducttopic topicproductprice
