better than small sizing up small caps by rhonda brammer barron’s – august   when after two decades at dl babson where he had managed the highly regarded microcap enterprise fund peter schliemann in  decided to strike out on his own he obviously needed a name for his fledgling firm finally after no little mulling he came up with — are you ready — rutabaga capital management that’s right — as in the humble yellowrooted vegetable eaten by people and livestock alike sometimes called a swedish or russian turnip “well it’s catchier than schliemann  associates” quips the 6yearold money manager schliemann whose enterprise fund was ranked no  by lipper in the microcap category for the year stretch just before he left says he got the idea for the name from a woman at morningstar who had described his investment strategy at babson as “unearthing rutabagas” all along schliemann has shown an affinity for unloved largely unfollowed companies typically in rather runofthemill businesses and not infrequently going through a rough patch “if you asked  analysts what they look for in an investment” he observes “at least eight of them will say a company with good profit margins well we look for just the opposite” a big believer in the regression to the mean schliemann searches out small companies whose margins have temporarily deteriorated for reasons he thinks he has a handle on and while he wants to see a catalyst for improvement he’s willing to wait two or three years for the full turnaround he prefers companies with a dominant niche and a good balance sheet — though he will buy leveraged outfits if they have ample cash flow to service and pay down debt schliemann runs  million for institutions — 6 million in microcaps companies with market caps of less than  million and the balance in smallcaps with market caps of less than  billion and while the smallcap portfolio has handily outperformed the russell  — up an annualized  since june  versus  for the russell — it’s the microcap fund that has truly sparkled since september  it’s up  annually compared with  for the russell so far this year through july  schliemann’s microcap picks have gained a sizzling  but don’t think for moment schliemann is a wild and crazy guy because of his value bent the beta of his funds — one measure of volatility — is roughly half that of the overall market with the microcap portfolio being even less volatile than his smallcap holdings continue reading includes sketches of three microcaps rutabaga capital management holdings as of 3  thoughts on “rutabaga capital
