starace and by the cfo alberto de paoli we will of course have the usual qa session at the end which will be open to those who are connected both on the call and on the web before we start let me also remind you that the media listen to both the presentation and the qa session thank you again and now let me hand over to francesco starace francesco starace good morning ladies and gentlemen let me start with reminding everyone that we recorded the period of a very resilient performance of ebitda thanks to the strong recovery in latin america the ongoing positive results in the retail business in italy a very resilient operation in iberia and a very good performance in renewables as a second point interim results confirm that latin america and renewables are our main areas of industrial growth on top of this in latin america i also remind you that we have bocamina  a megawatt coal plant up and running since july  and we are working to finalize the hydro project in el quimbo in colombia it’s a megawatt plant which will be completed during the second part of this year since june  we are filling up the reservoir of el quimbo which is now at  completion so the lake is there in the renewable business we have already addressed over  of the growth providing high visibility on future additions for  beside the  megawatts that have entered into operation during the first half we expect to add approximately  megawatts during the third quarter fully in latin america and in wind over  megawatts during the fourth quarter in latin america on july  the chilean authority svs has answered to enersis clarifying certain legal points and corporate governance suggestions related to the reorganization plan on july  the board of directors of enersis endesa chile and chilectra have outlined in more details the reorganization of the corporate structure the transaction proposed not only complies with the svs requirements but also accelerates the process by reducing the time between the necessary spinoffs and mergers minimizing possible uncertainties fourth on efficiencies we have succeeded to fully offset with savings the impact from additional capacity for growth and inflation keeping our operating costs opex broadly flat in nominal terms this group reorganization implemented last year is leading towards a higher focus on cash flow generation we have seen in this period clear signs of improvement in the free cash flow from operations which has allowed us to approach the net debt target of year end despite material negative impact of the foreign exchange eurodollar foreign exchange now let’s look at the operational highlights we are now on the following slide slide number  total installed capacity declined to  megawatts this follows the closure of more than  megawatts at least  of them being in italy the plants that we are taking off the grid mainly in italy where we have already closed more than  of the total  megawatt closure program this is a program that we have announced at the beginning of this year we registered an increase in the net production mainly in iberia and in the renewable business as a consequence the group load factor further increased to  in the first half of  from comparing with a  which was the first half of  in the distribution business total electricity distributed increased by  with significant increases in all geographies except for italy we have added in this period  end users in latin america we expect to reach – this number to reach about  million figure at the end of this year and we have added around  digital meters in spain and brazil in the retail business we added about  free power customers in europe mainly in italy now let’s move to the firsthalf group financial figures so we move to slide number  in the second quarter of the year we recorded positive and very strong results our first half  ebitda rose  mainly thanks to the strong recovery in iberia latin america and a continuing good performance of our renewable business that offset the expected worsening performance in the italian generation and network businesses the group net income rose by  to € billion group net debt increased about € billion and this is almost fully due to the negative exchange rate eurodollar which accounts to about € billion we would like now to update you on the delivery on the strategic plan announced in march this year so we turn to page number  we have defined the strategic pillars three things the first is operational efficiency operational efficiency will fuel additional development innovation and new business ideas the second is industrial growth a technology focused and geographically diversified growth much more granular and flexible in its modulation over the years third is portfolio management with a minimum asset rotation that would inject a healthy tension in the way our units operate and also to adapt to synergy evolutions the following slides show you the achievements of the period first of all on efficiency program we have succeeded to offset the additional costs that would come from additional capacity so growth and inflation and alberto will explain you this later on industrial growth we have secured the  ebitda growth already  of our target of growth ebitda for  is also already secured thanks to a bulk of total assets in execution of about € billion worth of investment which is about  of the total growth capex plan as for active portfolio management on the disposal side we have received two final binding offers for slovenske elektrarne negotiations are ongoing we expect to finalize the transaction agreement by year end as far as latin america restructuring is concerned the board of directors of chilean companies have agreed by unanimity of its members that the execution of any possible organization in the company operations should be executed in a way that would separate activities in chile from all other activities outside of chile at the level of enersis group by means of a corporate transaction that i will explain you in detail later on alberto will focus on the efficiency later now let’s start to look at the industrial growth the key figures on the slide that you see on page number  summarize the infrastructures that we have added in the period we are progressing in all the business drivers which underpin our strategic plan they are first of all renewable capacity addition we almost doubled total assets under construction from about  megawatts which were under construction at this stage last year to about  gigawatts today number of customers in latin america increased by about  in these six months  digital meters have been installed in the period in spain and brazil increased the number of free power and gas customers in italy mainly of about  and on conventional generation we as i said connected and started up bocamina  which is a megawatt coal plant in chile this is working now since july  and quimbo the hydro project that we had in construction in colombia for  megawatt hydro will come online the second part of the year moreover we have revised in detail the project pipeline in conventional generation now we have a new and refocused pipeline of mediumsized projects covered by potential ppas with a shorter time to ebitda cutting this from more than four years to three years we have held  screening committees in the first half of  we have abandoned  megawatts worth of potential projects we have added  megawatts of different projects mostly in latin america and this is a big change in the pipeline nature and content and we will make further assessment in the second half of  let us now dive more in detail in the following charts that get to explain these things a little bit more in depth we are progressing on industrial growth in line with the announced following criteria that are basically no merchant exposure for future projects higher flexibility in optionality and shorter time to ebitda so with the exception of conventional generation projects that are ongoing el quimbo in particular all other projects have time to ebitda lower than two years capex related to projects completed in execution is about € billion this would mean that we have covered about  of our growth capex plan which was if you remember € billion in the five years and that gives us a lot of visibility on our growth going forward € billion of growth capex have already been accrued in the first half of  this is for your record about a  increase year on year they include € billion of assets in operation so they became already producing plants which refer to the projects already completed in the first half  that i have described in slide number  total projects completed in execution consist of the following like i said € million in operations mentioned above € billion of assets in execution corresponding to € billion of investment in renewable and conventional generation which will give us additional  gigawatts  of which have commercial operation dates by year end  € billion of those € billion are related to distribution growth projects related to quality improvements smart meters reduction of network losses and connection to additional end users during the second half of  what does this mean in terms of returns on capital and growth ebitda we are quite well on track on the delivery of our investment plan in terms of growth ebitda we have achieved about  of our yearly target of about € million in line with our guidance given back in march that here we confirm what we have in operation so far and all the projects in execution that we have announced before will drive us to achieve the  target and address about  of the € billion target of growth ebitda by  i remind you that we have more than  megawatts including renewables in el quimbo under construction which have a cod date a commercial operation date of  we are well on track on value creation target returns calculated at commercial operation date on projects already entered in operation on first half  have about  basis point  basis point spread over project wacc projects under execution are above the minimum threshold of  basis points over projected wacc now let’s go the portfolio optimization part of the strategy we plan to recycle about € billion of capital which will be composed of about € billion of projects that are under execution that means transactions that are in this moment being completed this is about  completed the dilution in ebitda terms in our pl is so far not material as far as slovenske elektrarne is concerned let me give you a little bit of an update we have received two binding offers so far we have another bidder still working to submitting additional bid negotiations are ongoing we expect to finalize the transaction agreement by year end agreement framework is an equity sale in a twostage process first we will sell a minority stake by year end in a way that we will not have the sole control of the company any longer and we will therefore fully deconsolidate the assets from the balance sheet and the profit and loss statement second we will sell the remaining interest upon completion of construction of the two nuclear units which are currently at the final stages of construction and we will expect to become operational in – the first unit by end of  the second one at the beginning of  in the next stage we are going to select the preferred bidder we will then start the final negotiations with this party and we expect to reach the binding agreement by year end according to the framework that i have just described the binding offers that we have received are aligned with this process then the other additional € billion of assets that we have already identified in this cluster we have today under execution and therefore under transaction following disposals a portfolio of renewable assets in portugal including eneop this is our joint venture in portugal gas upstream operations hydro dolomiti energi our presence in france and our asset in belgium as far as the agp assets in portugal are concerned they include the eneop quota of the joint venture we have seen a strong interest for these assets we have more than  nonbinding offers binding offers are expected by the end of august on the right side we have no material cash out in the period so far let me now give you some update on how we are moving forward in latin america as far as the reorganization is concerned on july  chilean authority svs has responded to enersis clarifying certain legal points and corporate governance suggestions related to the reorganization plan in particular this response has indicated that the reorganization as it has been proposed and structured cannot be considered as a related party transaction the reorganization should be considered as a single transaction not as a sequence of two different transactions the extraordinary board of directors that we have just held on july  approved in unanimity that in case this transaction should be approved this will be done through a clear separation of chilean activities from the rest treating as a unique transaction and under a well defined calendar that i will now detail first step we will execute a spinoff of chilectra endesa chile and enersis in order to separate the chilean activities from those performed in other latin american countries and in a second step we will merge all the holding companies that are holding participations in countries outside of chile we will unlock value by increasing the visibility of separated businesses and geographies promoting a possible value relating in all group companies and we have seen this happening in the past so in the case of endesa for example we will create a streamlined corporate structure eliminating a holding discount valuation that is currently applied to enersis finally we will create differentiated equity stories allowing shareholders to have a higher flexibility in their investment the transaction that is under study seeks to accommodate all the requirements of the svs which have also suggested a few recommendations and it will also accelerate the process in order to reduce the time between the spinoffs and the mergers minimizing all the possible uncertainties for the entire completion let me focus your attention on a brief overview of the key figures of the enersis chile and enersis americas in the following chart so what would surface after this process is completed enersis chile would be a pure chilean integrated player it would be the leader both in generation and distribution in the country with an installed capacity of  megawatts more than  million end users in distribution it would have a management focused exclusively and responsible for this country in a customized investment plan with a strong pipeline of projects up to  megawatts furthermore given its high quality assets portfolio in generation in a stable chilean regulatory framework distribution it is expected to see enersis chile to have a stable and very visible cash flow profile different story in enersis americas and we call it enersis latin america it would be one of the largest utility players in latin america both in generation and distribution with an installed capacity of more than  megawatts and  million customers enersis americas will be the investment platform to undertake a relevant growth plan and capture the multiple investment opportunities that are emerging in the latin america region as far as its growth plan is concerned in the next month we will update our group strategic plan by including new capex plan for both region chile and latin america which currently amounts for € billion of which € billion are only for growth as far as the growth plan is concerned here the group will count with new projects surpassing  megawatts for the next years let me now explain a little bit in detail the timeline of this transaction execution is expected to last approximately nine months from the board of directors that will be held at the end of october  this will call for the first agms the calendar envisages two general meetings the first one will be in middecember to approve the spinoff providing also an indicative exchange ratio for the future merger and the second meeting will be the one expected in the second quarter of  that would then approve the merger of the three companies in abroad from chile the entire process is expected to be finalized in the third quarter of  to conclude this is a very exciting step for enel we finally have the potential to unlock significant value for our group in this very important part of the world which is latin america now let me hand over to alberto for some more detail on this good first half of  alberto alberto de paoli thank you good morning ladies and gentlemen before entering the financials i’ll give you some highlights on the market context in which we operate during first half  we have seen a power demand scenario which although generally worse than expected mainly in latam lead us to think that recession phase is close to the end more specifically in italy the economic outlook is improving this year for the first time since  the gdp is expected to increase and economic activity should strengthen next year where the gdp should climb by more than  the recovery in power demand in the country is still weak but the trend switched from negative to stable moreover as far as power prices are concerned we registered as of first half  an average spot price in the region of € megawatthour almost flat year on year but higher than our expectations for the full year equal to € we are also currently noticing increasing trend in the spot prices cal stands above € megawatthour again higher of our expectations finally due to the exceptional heat the average basic price in the month of july was higher than € megawatthour and some old thermal plants have been called by the system operator to cover the demand in spain electricity demand continues recording a positive trend mainly demand growth is driven not only by strong industrial activity but by the residential segment as well both the spanish government and the imf increased significantly its gdp growth estimates for  from  to  and from  to  respectively this first semester was also characterized by the normalization of the exceptional hydro contribution recorded during the first semester of  which has led to a  increase in the thermal gap as a result wholesale electricity prices stood at € megawatthour or  increase year on year while the balance  is at a level above € megawatthour higher than the current  forward curve electricity price in spain finally latam showed a robust growth in electricity demand indeed we recorded healthy  demand growth in the countries in which we operate together with prices almost flat in chile and with a level in the other countries lower than the last year due to better hydro conditions and lower commodities but above our expectation for  now let’s have a quick update on forward sales in italy we are about  hedged for  production  basis points more than the end of first quarter  at about € megawatthour higher than € as of the end of first quarter level of forward sales is almost in line with the previous year and as for  we have hedged at € megawatthour which is lower than our business plan assumptions but thanks to better hedging of the procurement contracts we have reached the same dark spreads versus our previous assumptions as for hedging strategy we have almost securitized most of our coal production while we are now starting to cover the hydro and ccgt portion as we see prices now in the market improving in spain we are fully hedged for  and above  for  at an average price of € megawatthour in  and € in  it is worth mentioning the strong price signals set by balance  forward price for the rest of the year with a price level of € megawatthour higher than the current  forward curve we have reached a level of  the full coverage is usually finalized in the second half and now we are starting to hedge at higher prices in latam finally we have reached the optimal hedging level for both  and  at increasing prices mainly in chile and in brazil now let’s look at the operational highlights so the total installed capacity as francesco said declined by more than  gigawatt or about  due to the following  gigawatt closures mainly in italy where we have already closed more than  of our  gigawatt program as far as hydro generation capacity is concerned the decline of about  gigawatt is due to the deconsolidation of se hydropower for roughly  megawatts following the asset sale and the deconsolidation of some hydro assets in slovakia following some pending legal disputes and we are mentioning the gabcikovo plant of around  megawatt notwithstanding the continuing decrease in installed capacity we registered a healthy recovery in the net production plus  mainly in iberia and in renewables in particular coal production rose by  ccgt by  mainly in italy and spain due to lower hydro electricity and higher thermal gas in the case of iberia renewables rose by  thanks to capacity additions despite weaker wind and hydro conditions in europe as a consequence the group load factor rose to  from  last year continuing group operational data as far as distributed electricity is concerned the growth is not only focused in latam but in all the geography areas but italy for example spain recorded a plus  yearonyear increase and romania rose by  in the last  months we added roughly  million end users mainly in latam now moving to first half group financial figures as already shown in the first slide of the presentation the reported group ebitda rose by circa  net of extraordinary items the ordinary ebitda remained broadly flat in more detail in the first half of  we recorded € million of extraordinary items due to € million for the capital gain on se hydropower sale and € million related to the accounting impact of the finalization of the sun acquisition while in  we recorded € million of extraordinary items related to € million on se hydropower and € million related to the sale of arctic russia now we’ll take a moment to update on the cash cost a new metric we have introduced in march as you can see in chart  cash cost increased by  in nominal terms on a likeforlike basis stripping out oneoff items they would increase by only  which corresponds to a plus  in maintenance capex and minus  in opex maintenance capex as i will explain later on increased by  as we have anticipated some planned maintenance activities in the first half to accelerate opex efficiency in the second half as far as opex is concerned on a likeforlike basis adjusted opex for oneoff items decreased by  the oneoff items effects includes perimeter delta provisions and capitalization adjustments we launched the new efficiency plan six months ago and specific action plans have been deployed and the implementation phase is ongoing we are expecting to fully achieve our target and the full potential of our plan within  to  months the opex reduction has been achieved thanks to external source as you can see from slide while personnel costs increase is mainly in latam the savings have been achieved in the major countries and especially in italy some  decrease in cost instead the costs are still increasing in latam almost entirely due to chilean effect and argentinean operations due to regulatory requirements specific managerial actions have been already identified and implemented and personnel cost savings will be achieved in a longer timeframe the already said  to  months on a likeforlike basis opex savings have been achieved in all the business areas as shown in this slide and this is slide page  and the efficiencies achieved are more than offset in the negative effects scenario mainly in latam and growth in renewables in real terms efficiencies have been higher than  in six months epi improved in all the business lines more specifically global generation is accelerating our plant closures in major countries in the first half  gigawatt have been commissioned several initiatives have also been launched to optimize maintenance costs and enhance procurement savings headcount has been reduced by  global distribution has achieved relevant cost savings in major countries where headcount has been reduced by  in renewables we are reducing the unitary cost per megawatt and we are also achieving savings in staff costs and incountry services as far as maintenance capex is concerned and we are now on page  we have registered this increase of about  mainly in latam as already stated the increase in maintenance capex is fully related to some planned maintenance activities in the first half that we brought forward in order to accelerate other efficiencies in the second half in light of the above we foresee  figures slightly decreasing versus last year and we are strongly confident to achieve at least our  target of € billion meaning € million less versus  in the first half figure are being affected – the  increase in conventional generation for about € million mainly due to indiscernible in argentina and the ramping of bocamina  and in distribution € million mainly in latam due to acceleration of some network programs now have a look at group ordinary ebitda starting from the business line and we are now on page  as you can see ebitda from global infrastructure and networks is roughly € billion and declined by € million versus last year or minus  but net of oneoff items that are equal to € million recorded in the first half  and plus € million recorded in first half  so net of these oneoff effects ebitda would increase  thanks to the new connections higher demand in latam and regulatory improvements in argentina and brazil ebitda in global generation and trading is € billion and it’s increased by  of € million also for global generation and trading net of oneoff items that are equal to minus € million in  related to regulatory revision of the iceland iberia and plus € million related to c swaps in first half  ebitda would have decreased  mainly due to lower hydro in most countries lower prices both in italy and slovakia and the worsening scenario in terms of effect on prices in russia partially compensated by higher prices and volumes in iberia renewables is equal to € million rose by € million mainly thanks to additional capacity in latam and north america and positive impact on favorable exchange rates the overall group retail business ebitda is equal to € billion a decrease by  versus last year mainly due to margins normalization in spain linked to the increase in power purchase cost which more than offset the significant increase in italy of about € million thanks to gross margin increase and flat costs year on year let’s now have a look at the group ordinary ebitda by region iberia is – on ebitda closed ebitda with € billion increased by € million mainly thanks to oneoff effects already mentioned stripping out this effect iberia would decrease of around  mainly due to normalization of hydro condition which more than offset positive contribution from higher volumes and prices latam ebitda is equal to € billion and shows the healthy increase of  mainly driven by the improvement in generation in chile and the already mentioned tariff increase in argentina this positive performance was partially offset by the expected decrease in italy the ebitda in italy is equal to € billion and has a reduction of  versus  this net of positive oneoff in  is in the range of  decrease this is the decrease following the decrease in generation for roughly € million due to lower prices in hydro this is partially compensated by the increase in retail and finally east europe the ebitda is € million it’s down  year on year and this is due to the reduction in prices in slovakia and russia with a significant negative fx effect mainly based on russia on the next slide we can look at our group net ordinary income result da remain broadly stable notwithstanding the increase in capex thanks to the reduction in italy and iberia following the impairment recorded in full year  in italy and also for the useful life extension of spanish nuclear gas plants our net financial charges amounted to € billion and has declined by more than  versus last year mainly due to change in other financial expenses so in more detail we recorded € billion of net financial charges on that and this is roughly  lower than last year and i will provide more details after and the positive contribution of € million for other financial expenses in  last year we had a negative impact of roughly € million and the main items of this are the negative oneoff in  for € million of which € million some rough adjustments in ampla in our distribution in brazil and then a positive oneoff for about € million argentina due to the cancellation of interest then some increase in capitalized interest for about € million and other expense income taxes in the period rose by € million due to an increase of around € million from higher earnings before taxes around € million of saving lower taxes in italy following the elimination of the robin hood tax and around € million of higher taxes in latam mainly due to tax reforms in chile and colombia as far as debt and financial expenses are concerned and now we are on page  our gross debt declined by € billion while net debt increased by € billion mostly due to the fx effect as you know this is a pure transaction effect required by ifrs rules and will not turn into cash since our debt is fully hedged through crosscurrency swap the reported level of gross debt recalculated across currency swap effects fixed in the contracts at the time of the future repayments would end up to a figure of close to € billion instead of € billion so € billion lower than the reported level the gross debt reduction net of tax effect is still roughly € billion equal to the reduction of cash following the repayment of roughly € billion of bonds of enel spa and nfp moreover we have a decline of financial receivables for about € billion cost of debt has decreased by circa  basis points to  net financial expenses on net debt decreased by  and this is thanks to the refinancing of bonds and credit lines negotiations and this is worth more about € million for less cost and on the other side an increase of financial expenses in latam in enel green power for a higher stock and cost of debt in this sense latam financing is one of the main areas of potential savings related to the corporate reorganizational line in addition to this we confirm our expectation for a rampup in the reduction of net financial expenses throughout the year thanks to the managerial actions already implemented and we do confirm that our interest expenses will decrease by about  at the end of the year then on the net free cash flow in the period we have generated more than € billion of ffo with a material improvement versus the last year say around plus  with a significant increase in ebitda conversion year on year ebitda conversion into ffo has increased in fact from about  of last year to circa  in the first half of  and this is thanks to the following lower noncash items in ebitda and lower use of funds stabilization of the working capital throughout this year as a result of the continuing effort in all the regions of the group and this is only partially offset by higher taxes and interest expenses paid for a similar amount of € million it’s worth mentioning that the net free cash flow generation has materially improved versus last year despite a higher level of both capex and dividend please consider that during the second half of the year we expect to have limited incremental dividend and increasing in growth capex taking also into consideration what i’ve previously said on ffo and net working capital by year end we expect to significantly improve net free cash flow after dividend and finally to the net debt overall net debt at the end of first half increased by more than € billion up to € billion net of assets held for sale related to slovenske elektrarne for comparison with the beginning of the year the net debt without considering the fx effect would have been € billion increased by about € billion versus december as we have paid around € billion of dividends and cashed in € million from disposals net of some minor acquisitions thank you for your attention let me now hand over to francesco for the closing remarks francesco starace thank you alberto we have provided you an update on the major strategic topic of our industrial plan in latin america reorganization we are progressing according to a welldefined and faster process that will unlock significant value for the group for slovenske elektrarne we are going to select a preferred bidder in the next days with them we will finalize negotiations and reach a binding agreement by year end as far as structural growth is concerned we have secured  growth ebitda and  of our target of growth ebitda for  thanks to a bulk of total assets in execution of about € billion which is about  of total growth capex plan efficiency plan is well on track and you will see full delivery on our guidance in the coming  to  months the group reorganization we have introduced last year is already showing signs of delivering improvements in cash flow as we have just heard from alberto we confirm our  targets and we continue to work hard on driving this positive trajectory for our company thank you for your attention and let’s now open to the qa session questionandanswer session operator operator instructions lawson steele from berenberg lawson steele first of all the restructuring of the latam business is clearly way overdue and makes an awful lot of sense from the point of having line of sight management at the very least but typically however many latam operations have been run efficiently at least when i used to cover them and especially when compared against peers so to what extent are you confident that reshaping the group will actually lead to cost savings and with the complexity in place today is it even possible to forecast what those cost savings might be with any sense of confidence and if so can you even know what time to expect any efficiency gains to materialize secondly could you update us on your current view on the outlook of italian generation prices and of course the gas price now that you’re seen that the asia and europe price spread has – gas price spread has virtually disappeared and with more gas lng supply from the likes of australia and usa do you think the italian gas price will fall further from the current levels thirdly could you take us through the principal moves behind the € billion increase in working capital and what expectations you now have for the full year for working capital please and then finally i see that retail sales initially were up  in first half and that the ebitda margin has climbed from  to  could you please give us some commentary there on how sustainable you see the margin increase and volume progression and when you see competition coming in to chomp away at that margin francesco starace i will answer the first two questions and the fourth and the third one will be handled by alberto on latam the restructuring there are basically you should say two levels of efficiency that we are targeting one is the operational efficiency level to be honest with you and you are right this has not to do so much with the restructuring of the corporate structure because this is handled and tackled by the group restructuring that we carried out already the global business lines are those that are driving this kind of efficiency and therefore that is already something that we have been addressing in the last  months six months starting from this year and it is unfolding nicely we don’t expect the corporate restructuring to affect it rather than maybe help it and speed it up a little bit i’m talking about how do we spread best practices across different countries i’m talking about how we maximize the use of spare parts across different countries i’m talking about how we improve the overall capex efficiency programs across different technologies so your observation is right they’re well run and they are run quite efficiently there is an increasing layer of efficiency that we will carry out spreading the best practice across the global position that we have in the world however there is a second degree of efficiency which comes from the corporate restructuring and that has to do with cash efficiency so what cash is trapped in the many companies and legal entities we own around this latin america continent what double taxations are we today exposed to when we look at the operations we have across the different countries and the fiscal regulatory frameworks that are different what kind of financial improvements we can have when we look at how we cross finance this operation that kind of efficiency has not yet kicked in it will kick in and it’s quite material just for your record only the fiscal double taxation impact is something in the range of  million to  million a year compared to the present situation and when compared to the simplified structure that i have explained to you and these kind of efficiencies the second kind of efficiency will only materialize after we have finished the restructuring of the corporate complex structure we have in latin america as far as further price erosion on gas in italy as a consequence of what is observed in spot markets around the world the recent increase in connectivity in let’s say gas markets thanks to the larger volumes of lng being traded around the world yes there is certainly if these trends stay for a longer time some kind of reverberation over the medium long term yes however gas prices in italy today are by and large dictated by pipe contracts and these pipe contracts in the hands of the bigger incumbent eni and in our case for what concerns ourselves do not really have a strong link to spot prices so over the medium long term if these low spot prices remain i would say yes you would try and see in europe and therefore also italy some kind of gas price erosion we don’t see it on the short to medium term today retail sale in italy going up in terms of volume and margins how much can that stand the test of additional competition obviously this cannot last forever we think however there are two separations here volume and that means the number of customers and underlying energy consumed by them they will keep growing because we will keep growing the customer base today we are targeting to get even that means to sell to customers end customers the energy we produce in enel green power and enel produzione and that leaves around  kilowatt hours of base to grow so we will keep that growing as far as margins are concerned they are largely the result of the decline in wholesale market prices that we have observed in the last three four years our sense is that these are more or less bottoming so you will not look at this derivative going forward all the years but the stickiness of customers and the very weak competition we have today in italy basically suggests that we will keep the volume growing without substantially eroding the margin and the churn rates that we enjoy today are relatively physiological in the industry so this is a relatively couple of years two three years going forward stable business with a good growth curve in terms of volume and a stable margin outlook i think there was a question on working capital alberto de paoli the capital numbers that you see in the chart we have absorbed € billion in the first half from net working capital last year we absorbed € billion so this is the improvement i was mentioning before if we see at the end of the year you can take that this absorbed € billion will be close to zero so you can add € billion of less generation in the second half from net working capital operator and now javier suarez from mediobanca please go ahead javier suarez three questions on my side too the first one is on the restructuring of the company in latin america as a follow up obviously this makes a lot of sense but after the restructuring you still will have four subsidiaries listed in latin america plus enel green power plus endesa plus the asset in brazil so what the company intends to do to reduce the holding discount as a followup what the company intends to do with endesa and there has been several press reports suggesting that the company may be considering or there has been the option to reduce the stake on endesa can you update us on that possibility and also do you think that the company and the current holding structure of enel green power is sustainable down the road or that could be considered too that is the first question and the second question is on the cost of debt there has been mentioning to the possible reduction in the cost of debt at the group but the company has reallocated capex into latin america and the cost of debt in latin america is higher than the cost of debt for european activities so in order to avoid a mismatch between cash flow generation and debt financing should we consider or see an increase in the cost of debt for the company rather than a decrease and the third question is on the forward selling for electricity there is backwardation on your forward selling and obviously there is a deviation versus the target that you presented in march so does the company feel the necessity to restate those targets on electricity prices for  and onward and what managerial effort the company can take to compensate that effect francesco starace so the first question is the mother of all questions you know actually i think let’s put it this way first of all let me be very clear i fully understand that there might be investors out there that see endesa as a fantastic opportunity for an acquisition and they see value in that i understand it and i fully appreciate that that said we are not in the process of selling endesa or portions of endesa anymore and we see indeed in endesa a lot of additional value creation that maybe is behind and beyond the pure financials so the fact that endesa is a very nice company producing a lot of cash with little debt there’s more than that in endesa at industrial level and there’s more than that in the iberian peninsula at the industrial level so we’re not going – you will not see corporate activity in endesa at all and the same on enel green power for different reasons i think the results that we published on enel green power yesterday show that growth curve of enel green power is strong and healthy it generates well good profits and it is an integral part of the growth story of enel we don’t see any need to change the setup we have today in these two companies because we have now to accomplished the major important step that is to fix the third company that we have today which is in a messy state enersis so you will see us focused on enersis for the next i would say six to nine months because that is really the very important story that we have to bring home is there a holding discount in enel as i said it will take about – in my opinion about  months for everyone to be looking at enel as a very efficient value creation machine using different companies around the world to accomplish these but spreading best practices and becoming a very integrated industrial player there’s a lot of that value creation around the world that is in our hands but not fully appreciated by the market because the market is looking at legal entities and listed companies so first we will carry out a demonstration in physical terms of what we are today saying and i think this first semester shows that we are in that direction and then i think the holding discount will slowly disappear on its own and if necessary then we will take some steps to finally address that last issue as long as the evolution of forward prices in energy in italy and spain i think i will let alberto now comment as far as that is concerned and also as far as the concern that moving capex into latin america intrinsically will grow our debt cost alberto de paoli so javier so i have two questions from you so one is on the cost of debt in latam and the second is on the price curve in italy first of all i would say that i said  of hedge in italy for  have been done at a level in which we have no impact on the margins we already have in the business plan for  because we hedged the margin and not only the price for selling we see now prices are rising so we think that we can look at what will happen in the next months in the market we are confident that we can cover our residual power generation at a level in which will not affect our margin for  but for sure we are now active because you know that we are going to present a new plan in november so we are active now in delivering a new efficiency plan to be in the safe zone and to have other fuel and other cost cutting to cover any gaps that might occur if our hedging strategy would be a little bit slower than our expectation when it comes on latam first of all take into account one important point that investments in latam are peaking in  so when you see the spike in debt and also in cost of debt it’s because in  we have a peak in investment if you look at our plan five years plan we presented in march you can easily see that latam is going to produce and to create a sum of € billion of ffo covering € billion of investment and € billion of dividend what we see is that latin america can easily invest € billion € billion leaving the level of debt at a stable level having said that we have not really initiated to simplify and also restructure our financial flow management in latin america because we are expecting that the simplification of the corporate structure will be done but we think that we have a lot of actions that can be implemented to lower the cost of debt so all in all i do think that the cost of debt that we have in the plan is okay and we think we have further room to decrease the debt the cost of debt in latin america operator now harry wyburd from merrill lynch hi harry please go ahead harry wyburd just one question from me please on free cash flow can i ask how much of the € billion group free cash flow for  to  which you’ve guided to in your march business plan is expected to come from italy i think in your march  plan you guided to € billion between  to  so i’m interested to know what the equivalent would be for  to  thanks alberto de paoli these numbers are the numbers that we have in our plan so from italy we can all in all say that if you ask me this to understand how much we can cover the dividends that we have to pay to final shareholders to enel shareholders you know that in our assumption we are going to pay € billion of dividend this € billion of dividend italy on a standalone basis generates roughly € billion of cash available for dividend distribution the rest will be paid by the dividends that the other subsidiaries will pay so all in all what we think that from italy and other dividends paid by other subsidiaries will stay in the range of € billion well above the € billion that we have to pay operator anna maria scaglia from alberto de paoli only to better simplify so if your question is on the € billion there is a different view so € billion of free cash flow italy is generating € billion the rest is generating out of italy when it comes to the dividend payments so the € billion italy is still generating € billion but the dividends from the other subsidiaries is generating the rest i think this clarifies operator anna maria scaglia from morgan stanley please go ahead anna maria scaglia the first question is regarding latam restructuring we’ve seen that one of the minority shareholder appealed against the svs decision i was wondering if you can update us in terms of the dialogue you have with the minorities and how confident you are of being able to implement this strategy and if these appeals can really have a negative impact on the process the second question is regarding your target for the year you confirmed the target in terms of ebitda and net income i was wondering if you have – following the performance in the first half if you have expectations that the mix might be materially different clearly in latam there is a lot of growth prospects for the second half if i look at your target so can you comment on that third question is regarding the distribution review in italy in particular i saw that in one of the proposals the government is – the regulator is proposing to revise the average life of the asset what’s your view there are you planning if this goes ahead to revise also your depreciation to offset this impact therefore net income should be minimal and last on the disposals i was looking at your slide and you have around € billion from slovenske and the hydro assets in italy which implies around € billion for slovenske is this also including the debt of slovenske going out from your asset and as well when you talk about this dual track does this involve selling a stake to the government of slovakia or are you planning to sell the whole stake to a new shareholder francesco starace let me just start from this last question then i will handle the question of latin america and the third question on distribution tariffs and alberto will handle the mix if the target – if the guidance can imply a different mix of results so on slovenske yes of course this includes the debt of slovenske and let me clarify this we have been in constant dialogue with the government which is the coshareholder of slovenske elektrarne the government of slovakia has appointed some advisors to help out in the process of deciding if and when and how much would they like to buy in the process that we are undergoing starting from now to say two years down the road when slovenske elektrarne will be finally – when mochovce  and  will be finally in operation we have explained to the government that we would be ready and willing to sell the stake they would like to buy concurrently with the first step sale to a third party in any time during the construction of mochovce  and  or at the end of the process so they basically have total freedom of flexibility to decide according to their internal schedule how much and when are they ready to buy so the flexibility is there and we are ready and willing to accommodate them on the first point that says indiscernible the svs decision okay only one appealed and that’s already quite a big change we know that they are not in agreement between themselves on the outlook for this transaction i think there are different negotiation tactics and styles the fragmentation on the front helps we think this is positive we think it is not something to be scared of we are not concerned that the svs will not confirm its judgment it’s very sound and very well thought off they deliberated a while before coming out with it so we don’t expect changes the dialogue with the sap is ongoing it’s actually moving very smoothly now that there is no third party correlated transaction nightmare front in front of us and so our approach has been very fair very open and the fact that we have now changed the approach to a onestep process ongoing which includes giving them the fair valuation of all the components of the transaction upfront so that they have a clear view of what the values are from the very beginning helps so we are positive on that and i think this story is unfolding much better than previously was thought of as far as distribution review the distribution tariff review is ongoing as you know the authority has issued an interesting paper we like it i would say in general and broad terms it’s a very creative and a very innovative way of going forward we like the fact that six years is the new timeframe it’s no more four we like the fact that there is an intrinsic premium for improvements in the performance of the grids with additional features being then digital or nondigital but in any case and we like the fact also that there is a second phase of the process that might imply a switch to totex we are not concerned by this we think it’s a constructive dialogue the one going on we think you the community of analysts have been also good at explaining to our authorities what is detrimental to the business and what helps so i encourage you to continue to do that and what more to say i think we will look at some very more material numbers coming out probably at the end of september before the third quarter is finished alberto de paoli i think i have to add three things one is now we are discussing with the regulator so we ran some sensitivities on this possibility to have a longer time for da and what we see is that we have no material impact on eps because we will have also lower da and at the end the overall impact is meaningful this is for the first on the target i think that we have to wait a little bit longer to understand how the second half will go today i said we have in the first half we had a certain amount of oneoff items so stripping out the oneoff items and looking at the second half in the line of the first half we can easily confirm our target not more than this and last on the slovakian disposals sure the overall level included the net debt when i say roughly € billion for the cluster it’s not mathematical so i think that we can having closed in a better way the two transactions we have closed we can also go up overall from the € billion operator and now enrico bartoli from mainfirst go ahead enrico bartoli a few questions from my side first of all going back to the italian electricity market actually the authority is proposing to change the structural tariff probably in order to force more consumption over the next few years so can you elaborate a bit on that if you see that this could provide some opportunities for you particularly in the retail business then i have a question related to your net debt guidance for the full year if i remember well it’s € billion just to understand if the positive evolution in working capital and movement of funds that we have seen in the first half was already included in this number and if it includes also the net debt of slovenske elektrarne or not then i have a question related to slide  actually the reconciliation of your net debt here includes minus € billion of contribution from iberia actually could you guide us understand what actually is the level of the net debt related to endesa that you consolidate in your net debt i guess this € billion doesn’t take into account the loan that you have with the spanish company francesco starace let me answer the first question and the second two and third will be answered by alberto yes the authority is going to probably restructure a little bit the electricity distribution tariff electricity tariff as you know the italian tariff is a little bit – implies an internal subsidy from a certain number of quite a few millions of customers that pay a little more visavis others but pay a little less than they should this comes from a distant past it has a little bit distorted the electricity patterns of consumption in the country we think it’s a good idea to fix it we think you’re right that this might unlock the value in cluster of customers that were so far relatively unattractive from a free market standpoint because they paid so little because they had this internal subsidy that they had basically an invulnerable position when approached by a free market operator so yes in principle we think it’s a good idea in principle we think it will unlock the market in terms of free market opportunities that it will happen overnight is another question because there are some kind of political resistances to that so you would be very cautious that wouldn’t be a revolution all of a sudden they will probably migrate customers more gradually than people think our view is yes it’s positive it’s going to take a while okay alberto alberto de paoli for our guidance at the end of this year on debt we already included this kind of benefit for the first half taking into account that we see – looking at  and  results of debt that we will suffer about € billion € billion of fx effect so net of this we have with the higher level of dividends and higher level of capex a sort of stability in our net debt net of fx effects and for your question on page  the figure is the figure of only the third party debt so it’s the size of the third party debt of the group and we have on top of this we have roughly € billion of intercompany loans among the enel group and endesa enrico bartoli sorry just to be clear in order to compare the net debt you have in your total figure with the € billion reported by endesa the two figures are the same or there is some difference there alberto de paoli the figures are the same but as i said we have – so all in all the figures are the same but endesa has the level that you see there that is the gross debt to third parties plus the intercompany debt so endesa is reporting the overall debt but you have to add the € billion in the intercompany debt so all in all its € billion operator now cosma panzacchi from bernstein cosma panzacchi i have a couple of questions regarding mostly the evolution of regulation so first of all if i look again all the production the regulatory production of the regulator recently on networks it seems that the regulator really highlights the need for material new investments in the grid for example in smart distribution system but at the same time it seems to me that the remuneration system and also the rollout of the new smart meters the new generation of smart meters is at this point a little bit cloudy in the framework that the regulator is designing what is your point of view on the current framework that the regulator is setting out for smart meters going forward do you still think that there will be an upside opportunity there going forward second again on networks speaking recently with trade unions if i’m not wrong mr starace has recently reconfirmed the willingness of enel to participate in the ultra broadband rollout plan of the italian government and has highlighted september as one of the key months for an update on this scheme however if i look at the indiscernible communication decree that never materialized and if i look at the stronger position of ti against the full deployment of a full ftth approach i wonder if you are still truly positive on the potential upside in this area if september is still a credible deadline and finally how your involvement could be compatible with not making ti’s network a fully stranded asset and the final question is on the outlook of power generation in italy again i think that you’ve been one of the strongest advocates in terms of a reform of the market abandoning a pure system marginal price in favor of more better longer term stability and if you want an overview of where the prices are going from this point of view i think enel green power has also tried to create some sort of agreement with enel italy recently trying to stabilize revenues going forward but with limited success so far so what do you think that still needs to happen before longterm ppas for example will be allowed and become prevalent in the market and specifically with regard to enel green power what are the hurdles for the conclusion of such an agreement francesco starace all right so i’ll start with smart meters let me give you some updates first of all the change on smart meters is not something that comes all of a sudden it’s a  years technical life expiration that is coming in  for the first meters that were installed in  so that is a known thing and it’s the process that’s been on for a while the issue is today rather shall we just replace the meters with existing ones or shall we replace the meters with new ones being a new design and this is obviously the second case is the case because digital devices that are  years old are replaced by devices that are much better and cheaper than them so it’s a nobrainer that a new meter is better than just the same meter again and that has been clarified today we are in the following steps the authority is getting through the nittygritty details of the features and functions additional capabilities of the new device just to give you an example these are devices that will enable for example prepayment from a remote or a local access and additionally it can be interrogated by the customer independently than the network and lots of stuff so these new devices are being i would say approved and vetted by the authorities this will take maybe another month then they will be finally rolled out in the investment process the tariff takes that into account that is an improvement of technology into the system according to the features that the authority will have authorized or approved and therefore it will be recognized as an additional revenue stream for us over and above the normal rab pure rab amortized replacement what we need to be careful with is that we don’t have stranded meters so basically the pace of replacement should mirror the pace of installment that took place  years ago okay now as far as ultrabroadband rollout plan what is going on again what we’re doing today is we have looking at around  smaller mediumsized cities in the various a b c d zones in which italy has been divided that will include the ultrabroadband connectivity attractiveness we’re doing that alone and with infratel and other players including tim to have a full knowledge and a complete understanding what the synergies are what are the cost reductions and what kind of improvements our participation to the process are bringing about we will finish this in september at that stage we will be free to define what is our involvement in this provided that we stick to what we have just said already that we repeat here a we are not going to become another telecom operator so we’re not going to provide content b we don’t want to be the owners of these cables they should be owned by the operators that manage the grid we will be the party responsible for laying them down and maintaining them for  years so there will be a stream of revenue related to that activity alone what the impact of that will be on the existing network of telecom it’s not up to me to say and let’s not get into that at all i don’t know enough about this matter to be able to comment now as far as power generation in italy what changes is likely they are the changes that will happen in europe and we see the new market design that has been leaked out of brussels by the commissioner canete and maros sefcovic going in the direction of longterm power purchase agreements being back into the game in europe and therefore they will come back in italy too it’s been going faster than we thought we knew this was coming and it’s now heavily moving forward of course everything is relative in european terms one can say it’s heavily moving forward but nothing is happening actually at the end of the day i think this is something that through  will finally start to see the light and that is basically the reason why we freeze any activity on that front that was going on you’re right we think it’s better to let the european dialogue get along well and therefore i think the power generation in italy will benefit from longterm pricing signals by and large there will be capacity payments in the meantime yes it will be material for most operators probably not operator manuel palomo from exane bnp paribas please go ahead manuel palomo to be honest most of my questions have been answered just wanted to get an update on your feeling about what the enel group could get as a benefit from a potential cfd with enel green power for enel green power in order to remove the risk to the italian power price then i would like to ask you about a couple of clarifications one is as regards to the € billion net debt target that you are giving for the year end i do not know whether you have already answered this but i did not get it clear are you including or excluding the debt associated to the assets held for sale that’s the numberone question and the second clarification is on hedging price in spain slide  you are mentioning € a megawatt hour while if i recall a couple of days ago in the investor presentation mr bogas was talking about above € i wonder what is the difference whether you are referring to different prices or if you could explain francesco starace on the egp issues which i discussed before first of all let me clarify this is not only an egp issue it’s in general merchant generation which includes also enel produzione it’s an overall transaction which does not only refer to enel green power but as i said we decided not to carry this on for the time being because we saw an acceleration on the european regulatory front that might be better wait so there’s no news there and the thing is just stalling and put back in the refrigerator waiting for an evolution at brussels level on that front i comment this is not only egp it’s all merchant generation by and large in italy there’s enel produzione and egp from our side but a lot of other players have the same issue we think maybe it was a good idea to start it maybe this was one of the reasons why in fact in brussels i told that see us moving this quickly we pushed them also but at this point we said let’s just not jump the gun and wait for what kind of regulatory framework changes they drive from there into our system alberto on the other questions alberto de paoli so the € billion guidance excludes the slovenske elektrarne debt and the second is the € of pepe bogas’ guidance so the reconciliation is we have € and this includes also ancillary services and capacity payments in the price and the two worth roughly € so you have a reconciliation of € towards € operator alberto gandolfi from ubs alberto gandolfi i have three the first one is just to go again around enel green power if i understood correctly chief executive starace just said that six to nine months the focus is latam nothing on the horizon on green power but my question would be when i look at the organization of enel you’re organized by country and then you have divisional heads so you have enel italy and then you may have the global head of distribution which also includes distribution in italy well enel green power appears to be the only business line which is not organized that way so my point is if the market continues to basically forget about value in any growth that’s in power how long will you be patient for and the second point is at the investor day you talked about maintaining the independent culture of green power that’s why you don’t want to blend it with conventional generation but my point is would you have to if you take it off the market you can just move the headquarters to another city and that green power forgive me here for suggesting that but wouldn’t that achieve also the change in culture that you’re seeking to preserve second question is about a little bit thinking about expanding your scope and i’m thinking about here a fine line between diversification and complexity do you see any effectively lacking pillars to your current portfolios so is there any economy that perhaps move in a less correlated way to italy spain or latam that you might be keen to gain exposure to being with € billion invested capital being with € billion invested capital but is it us regulated is it uk something in central europe it would be great if you could elaborate on that and lastly on generation italy on my calculation your ebitda is largely ancillary services because i could say that the ebitda made in coal and hydro is really enough to pay for your opex at the moment so i really welcome your closure plan but my question will be how far can you go over and above the plans you already announced and when closures will not only take down opex but will begin to have an impact on your assessment on spreads and on the supplydemand francesco starace enel green power well enel green power is not really that different when you look at the organization the way it is because it is basically a division – it is a global business line similar to for example grids today articulated in different countries and i know that comes from some kind of habit of industry that we like to look at this industry as a sum of geographies i think it’s roughly a big mistake which we keep doing the real structure of the industry is in a cluster of technologies so you have to look at green power and you have to look at global distribution the same way green power has an articulation in geographies that somehow overlaps with the one of for example grids and other traditional distribution and in other cases does not in the other cases it’s there too we have for example grids in romania and renewables in romania and this is the case in which they overlap so the country articulation is completely secondary in our view the business line driving forces will take over the corporate life of enel in the long term so there is no need to change this organization it’s just a question of working at it and building what is today still not at the same level green power started four years earlier global distribution and global generation started last year so you would see this coming in the next probably  months there is no need to articulate a different – and even then to put headquarters in a different place it doesn’t really add value itself it’s just another application maybe unless there is some fiscal benefit somehow but there is no plan on doing that at the moment in terms of lacking pillars i say they are lacking pillars in several geographies and again back to the same point well you look at that and you say there are different things in the world where we are not present we’re not in asia we’re now starting you will see us moving in asia in the next months not because we are tired of elsewhere but because we think we need to find as i said one or two new places going forward every day we don’t think we need to become the biggest player of indonesia tomorrow but we need to start moving and create opportunities worldwide as much as we can provided that we pay attention and we don’t make mistakes today i don’t see one part of the world where it is a disaster not to be we think we are moving quite well and it will take time maybe what you would have to look at is is there a technology or some kind of new business line that you are not fully focused upon yes and in that case i can say yes there is and unfortunately it’s a very elusive part of the business for most of the utilities nowadays and we’re focusing very much on this new frontiers of additional customer behavior and a lot of services that are allocated to that we don’t have an answer we don’t have a solution but we are working at that and i think you will look at our strategic plan articulation getting more in details in that sense as far as generation in italy what i can say is that we have sold the system that  megawatts of plants will not be started up again in the next future and we have already closed  of them and another  will be closed this coming month over and above that we don’t see much going on except continuously improving the environmental performance of coal and gas units that we want to keep on the only preservation policy that you can have in europe and in general in the oecd countries as far as the generation fleet is concerned is to make sure that you are always the best in class in terms of environmental impact that will put pressure on regulators that will put pressure on competitors that will preserve your position and that’s what we’re going to do alberto de paoli i only would add a comment on the msd on the indiscernible system only to clarify that more or less our – we have roughly € million on a yearly basis of margin from msd but you cannot compare this  million with ebitda of generation you have to compare it with the gross margin of generation and we have roughly say € billion of gross margin so the msd is an important part of our gross margin but it’s in the range of  of the gross margin so it’s not the entire margin of the generation operator javier garrido from jpmorgan javier garrido just two very quick questions i promise firstly on your crosscurrency swaps if i understand correctly that will give you € billion of extra ffo over and above your natural ebitda conversion can you tell us what’s the duration how much of those € billion are you expecting to get in the next full year to the end of the current strategic plan and the second question i don’t know if i understood correctly the second unit of mochovce is expected to be completed in the first half  is that correct francesco starace mochovce has two units and the time between the two is six months the last one yes first quarter  the first one which is mochovce  – sorry for this it’s mochovce  is the second – mochovce  is the second mochovce  is the first one is end of  and mochovce  first quarter of  this is the schedule today sorry end of  last quarter  yes alberto de paoli for the first question it’s not in this way so what we provided is that the question for us was what will be the cost of debt at the time of repayment so we say how we can strip out the accounting effects in asking us what will be the cash effect at the time of the payment looking at the crosscurrency swaps so today we have an accounting level of debt of € billion but at the repayment date this debt will be € billion because of the crosscurrency swap effect it’s not something that is today in our ffo assumptions it’s only to say this is a pure accounting effect because at the repayment date the effect in the cash out for the debt repayment will be € billion javier garrido sorry that is what i meant in the end you are going to put it this way i have € billion of extra cash flow or you are going to have € billion of lower cash outflow but in the end is a net € billion benefit versus what the accounting net debt shows so what i wanted to know is when that € billion call it saving on cash payments on interest will be seen because that will be a mismatch between your accounting interest cost and your cash interest cost alberto de paoli it’s not related to interest costs it is only related to the value of the repayment of the debt so in the interest costs you have – in the cash flow you have the hedge each time you pay interest this is only a valuation calculation of the value of the debt repayment not of the interest payment so it’s only a pure exercise to say this € billion that we have today the cash that we will need to repay the debt only the amount of debt the answer is no because at the time of repayment the cash that we will need to repay the debt will be less because of the effect of the crosscurrency swaps javier garrido so it’s a € billion benefit in principal payment not in interest payment but it’s a € billion difference alberto de paoli exactly operator antonella bianchessi from citi antonella bianchessi first of all are you confirming the € billion of capex on the full year the second question is if i look at – you’re saying that your business plan is on track and you confirm a € billion ebitda this year and next but if i look at this year ebitda there are something like € million of nonrecurring elements there is a regulatory review happening over the next year and also the currency in latin america are weakening so which is the asset that will support the growth and will allow you to maintain the same level of ebitda in  the third question is on supply margins they are up something like € million over the last three years do you think this is sustainable do you see any increase in competition the increasing churn rate or all these things so if you can comment on this level and finally on the cash flow if i just look at your debt level targets in the short term this year you are basically assuming that you will generate € billion € billion of cash flow before paying the dividend endesa is cash flow positive enersis is materially cash flow positive okay green power is negative but there is nothing left so can you elaborate on where the cash is going over and above the cash flow generated in italy so what’s happening in the holding system of the country that absorbs cash francesco starace antonella let me just go through this in order i will start with the issue on competition supply margins and volumes i guess you were referring to italy i imagine antonella bianchessi yes francesco starace i think i discussed this a little bit earlier but let me just go a little bit more in detail so the question is very good the competitive landscape in italy is very very flat who is our competitor on the retail market today in this country is it eni who is at this very moment deciding maybe to spin off this business itself is it edison who is not at all active on the market is it sorgenia who is reeling under the debt are there smaller players that might be active now and then the fact is eon is lost has left the country too the fact is for some time and i don’t think this can last forever for sure but for some time and i think this has been going to last more than two years there is no competition worth the name in this country on that front so that said is that meaning that our life is easy and that we can make a party of the days no we are the incumbent and the incumbent has some obligations in the market and i think we can say that we have behaved as an incumbent quite successfully in the past so we will keep growing the volume as i said because i think the number of customers the quality of customers and customer relationship has an intrinsic value over and above the margins that we sell energy every year we will increase the number of customers reaching a point a mix of customers that will have cumulative profile that will match our cumulative profile of production and no more no less than the volumes we target to produce there is of course an approximation there we will do that without destroying value because there is no real competitive environment at this moment worth the name there is some competition everyone is trying to cope but nothing more i think the real competition comes from the tariff subsidies that are today part of the debate in the tariff restructuring that we discussed before and we see a positive sign that this cross subsidy is now going to fade out as i said with due time so i think that addresses one of those four questions i think there was one on the cash flow i don’t know if you’re ready to do that or you want to go on the € billion yes the € billion capex full year yes we definitely confirm this is the capex that we plan to be spending at the end of the year we don’t see an issue of meeting this figure we will not exceed it we will not go short we will be there precisely probably at the end of the year as far as the cash flow is concerned maybe alberto you want to talk to it alberto de paoli so what we said in the business plan was that for the first year and so  we do confirm the € billion of investment and as you can easily understand it is a big push ahead and this is because we have to restart the growth and as said we now already gave the guidance that we will cover € million of ebitda growth in  and we have already achieved roughly  or € billion of ebitda growth in  so you can linearize the two dots and you can understand that one of the growths that we will really on to get the  result is already in the fact that we have already achieved a level of ebitda growth for  that stays in the middle of € million and € billion of the two years that we gave as a guidance so it’s the first point in which we rely on to get targets of  and we are confident on the other side that we can cover some gaps in scenarios and commodities with further efficiencies that we are putting in the company so we are also quite confident we can go ahead in our efficiency target in  so we think that the target will be achieved i don’t say easily achieved but with well management will be achieved also in  on the other side when it comes to cash flow and this is the point you know because we said that our active portfolio management of € billion will be matched in disposal and acquisitions but this match will be done not in the first years because in the first year we will have some support from disposal to keep the level of debt stable and then when the cash flow will improve we will do some acquisition because the focus is to support our € billion of growth not changing our debt figures except of fx effects that are not foreseeable clearly having said that from where the cash flow comes to support our effort as said and i come back to our plan so i think because i stick to the plan because i don’t see any material changes to the previous plan we presented we have in italy that it’s going to produce a free cash flow so cash flow after capex in the plan of roughly € billion in iberia there is roughly € billion and latin america there is roughly € billion these are the free cash flow available to cover the investments and available to pay dividend payments all in all in the plan is € billion € billion is for enel shareholders and € billion is for other shareholders our other minorities this is the plan antonella bianchessi yes but the math doesn’t add up because if italy does € billion latam does € billion and there are other € billion then this makes € billion and not € billion that is in your plan alberto de paoli then you have enel green power that will absorb antonella bianchessi but they just said it’s only € billion alberto de paoli so then you have this is – then you have the holding the staffs and everything antonella bianchessi exactly that’s what i wanted to understand alberto de paoli it’s exactly what we said in the business plan so the absorption the sum up is € billion and then you have enel green power the holding and other functions and you reach € billion italy has said in this case deducting the holding so we say € billion and the cost of the holding is roughly € billion so italy with holding is producing € billion in the period operator zach mecelis from covalis capital zach mecelis i’ll be very quick i just wanted to firm up or understand a bit more your statement regarding value creation in latin america specifically you mentioned that you have a capex plan already lined up but can you address specifically payout ratio target balance sheet the companies right now they are very under levered so i just wanted to see how you are thinking about the payout ratios the target debt to ebitda ratios and what instruments you would use to get there in terms of showing the value creation would it be buybacks special dividend and lastly i would like to clarify ownership target for enersis americas you’re now showing that you’re going to own more than  is there any restriction of you owning more than  as it was with current enersis and endesa chile structure so any clarification and more specifics would be appreciated francesco starace let me clarify this the ownership constraints that we have are related to chile and the laws that apply to the assets in chile they contaminate all our presence in latin america because they are altogether into enersis the moment that we isolate the chilean assets in chile with the chilean holdings these limitations will apply although will not change but they will apply to that company and they would not automatically expand to the other holding companies so there we would not have that limitation that caps us to  as we are in chile as far as value creation is concerned i think you referred to what kind of value can be unlocked when a package blended as enersis is then split into more targeted factors we have really – this is a study that we haven’t done in detail and i don’t think it makes any sense for us to give you estimations everyone can have his own view and the beauty of this is because the views differ these deals happen if we all had the same view then there would be no value creation whatsoever at this point so we think that there is obviously some value in separating intrinsically risk free areas with limited growth potential say chile with more risky areas with much more growth potential say for example brazil we think that but we’re not going to today put figures on the table we think the market will finally go out and decide the experience that we had for example with endesa was extremely positive and i think there is a potential similar story unfolding in latin america to that end but i cannot attach figures to that sorry zach mecelis so will there be a timeline when we’re going to have those figures because the reason endesa worked was a very clear communication strategy on dividend and that was that market was willing to pay for we have not heard anything yet on any specifics regarding the payout ratios dividends or target balance which would be nice to have to have the proper valuation francesco starace you have a point i think clearly the moment that we will incorporate this new legal entity as you know there will be at least listed at the top one they will do their own investor day their own investor equity story they will announce clear policies as far as investment growth and dividends are concerned and it would be today inappropriate that we do it in here without having this whole structure put in place and the boards take their own decision alberto de paoli yes i think indiscernible you can take page  because this is the indicative transaction timeline if you look at this we foresee a final board decision at the end of october and you know that by the end of november we are going to present a new plan so the agm will be called for december so in the time between october and december there will be indiscernible and communication to the market because shareholders have to vote in the agm on one side and the group has to present a new plan what i can say is for sure that we are working on two separate entities also in looking at a new business plan in doing this as different from the previous exercise we made for the entire latam because now we are focusing on specific strategies for the two companies and looking at the different perspective of cash generation and everything and also growth so for sure we will have this different proposition in the business plan and we think we will start to communicate and meeting with shareholders after the board of directors will approve in october this transaction operator alberto ponti from socgen alberto ponti hi all my questions have been answered thank you operator from rbc unverified analyst a couple questions the first one’s on net debt with actually two parts € billion target confirmed for the full year does that assume € billion proceeds in respect of the disposal plans that you have outlined and secondly in respect to debt back at the investor day you talked about an fx difference of € billion this morning you’ve talked about € billion so just wondered what is actually going better on the debt side of things to enable you to keep the yearend target the same and then secondly and just picking up again on latam and some of the numbers there what net income impact do you expect at the enel level of the moves that you are making to reorganize the latin american operations alberto de paoli i’ll take the three questions the second is yes so i hope because if the fx worsen we will suffer for an increase in fx impact so i think it’s something that is related to the market and now we have some assumptions for the year and then we will see what will happen in the second half for latam net impact on net income so we can say that we see and now we are expecting these new plans we can be more precise after having done new plans we know that we have some intrinsic value creation inside the transaction mainly on this side we see a significant value added in the overall fiscal build but with this complex nature the fiscal impact the fiscal structure is highly inefficient and moving on the net debt the end of the year we do expect that – really today we are looking at the value of the debt staying stick to a value that is around what we had in the first half just because we don’t know we had a lot of transactions that we don’t know if they would be closed end of the year beginning of next year so we see usual swing of say one two months so exactly we don’t know and the other side another say € million of value of transaction is already taken off because it’s the debt of slovenske that we don’t measure in the € billion so if i have to say today i have closed € million and i can say that if i sell the first tranche of slovenske i can say that already i included in the € billion another € billion of disposals so it’s all in all operator just one question from the web could you please give more details on the performance of the italian infrastructure and why ebitda decreased by almost  alberto de paoli so we have this answer is in the page – what i said in the page  we said that all in all at a global level we have a decrease of distribution but stripping out the oneoff items mainly in italy we would have an increase of  this is exactly what is for the italian distribution stripping out the oneoff effect of last year the distribution in italy is flat elisabetta ghezzi okay we have finished our presentation thank you very much for the attention and ir department will be available for your

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
