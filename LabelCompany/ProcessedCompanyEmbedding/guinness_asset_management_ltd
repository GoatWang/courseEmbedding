with it a degree of risk and investors should read the risk factors section in the prospectus before investing the value of the funds’ portfolios changes daily in accordance with the movement of underlying capital markets and the specific share price movements of the companies in whose shares each fund invests past performance is not a guide to future performance performance risks we identify the following performance risks in our funds market risk the value of investments and the income from them may go down as well as up and are not guaranteed an investor may not get back the amount originally invested the value of an investment can be affected by changes in general market conditions other political social and economic developments as well as specific matters relating to the companies in whose securities each fund invests currency risk changes in the rates of exchange may cause the value of investments to go up or down while the funds have share classes priced in various currencies the base currency of all the funds is us dollars and the fund valuations for all share classes are initially calculated each dealing day in us dollars nonus dollar share classes are then converted into their respective currencies from the us dollar valuation the funds invest internationally and hold all investments in local currency guinness asset management does not conduct any hedging of currency exposure on the funds’ capital value or income the funds aim to be fully invested most of the time but any cash balances are normally held in us dollars this means that the exposure of the funds to any one currency is mainly limited to the value of its holdings in stocks priced in that currency therefore as well as the impact of share price movements in the securities each fund holds the capital value of an investment in a fund will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the stocks’ local currency the fund’s base currency usd and the currency of the fund

the prospectus shareholders in guinness global equity income fund and guinness global money managers fund should note that all or part of the fees and expenses can be charged to the capital of the

examples in the guinness fund range include guinness alternative energy fund guinness global energy fund guinness global money managers fund geographic risk some funds invest only in stocks listed in or exposed to one single country or region these funds are very susceptible to the performance of that one country or region and can be volatile examples in the guinness fund range include guinness china  hong kong fund for more detail on the risks relating to specific products please refer to the relevant documentation for that product guinness eis service an enterprise investment scheme eis is a government initiative to encourage investment in smaller higherrisk companies by offering a range of tax reliefs to investors eisqualifying companies can be unlisted smaller companies companies whose shares are not quoted on any recognised stock exchange or companies listed on the alternative investment market aim the guinness eis service is a discretionary managed service investing in eis qualifying companies and managed by guinness asset management ltd the investment manager the service comprises a range of investment themes which can be accessed by investors via a sequence of dated “offerings” each offering has a finite subscription period with an opening and closing date for subscriptions to qualify for the full range of tax benefits of an eis investment investors should be prepared to hold their investment for a minimum of three years each offering has its own information memorandum detailing the terms and conditions specific risks and tax implications of investment the range of investment themes in the guinness eis service include aimlisted companies and sustainable energy companies an investment in the guinness eis service is subject to a number of risks both general and specific to each offering within the service before making any decision to invest prospective investors need to understand that investing in eisqualifying companies can be highly speculative and carries high risk the information memorandum for each offering contains details of the risks involved investors should consider carefully whether a subscription is suitable for them in the light of the information in the information memorandum and their personal circumstances before investing investors are strongly recommended to consult an authorised financial adviser we recommend you seek appropriate independent advice before investing past performance of the investment manager is no guarantee of future performance the value of an investment in any investee company may go down as well as up and investors may not get back the full amount invested the investment manager will rely on achieving an exit for the investments made in each offering in order to generate a capital gain for investors there is no guarantee that exits will be available at the prices anticipated by the investment manager general eis investment risks  concentration risk the investment manager may be unable to make sufficient investments in suitable investee companies if sufficient investments are not made the returns achieved by the service could be materially impacted the investment manager intends to invest across a portfolio of investee companies to diversify exposure to any one company however there is a risk that the investments are concentrated or there is a weighting towards one or more sectors in these circumstances returns to investors may be adversely affected by the underperformance of a particular company or sector  size and liquidity risk the guinness eis service invests in companies that are relatively small smaller investee companies can be vulnerable to government actions and changes in statute in particular there may be changes to the eis legislation which may affect investors’ tax positions investee companies may be reliant on the skills or knowledge of a small number of individuals and should a key individual leave performance may be adversely affected some companies’ shares in which the investment manager invests will be listed on aim other companies will be unlisted listed shares although some companies’ shares in which the guinness eis service can invest are listed on aim not all shares are readily realisable at all times investment in shares traded on aim involves a higher degree of risk and such shares may be less liquid than shares in companies which are listed on the main market of the london stock exchange the rules governing aim companies are less demanding than those of companies listed on the main market of the london stock exchange the market price of aimlisted shares may not necessarily reflect their underlying value the share price of aimlisted companies can be highly volatile and shareholdings can be illiquid the price at which aimlisted shares are quoted and the price at which such shares may realise will be influenced by a large number of factors some specific to the relevant investee company and its operations and others which may affect aimlisted companies generally such as legislative changes and general economic political regulatory or social conditions some aimlisted companies are majority owned by connected parties who may be in a position to exert influence on the relevant investee company and their interests may differ from other shareholders unlisted shares some offerings in the guinness eis service can invest in companies which are not expected to have a listing or quotation therefore there may not be a recognised or active market for the shares of investee companies and it may be difficult to sell or realise the investment or obtain reliable information about their value investors should not consider investing money in an offering which can hold shares in unlisted companies if their investment may be required during the life of the offering which is normally at least three years investors should not consider subscribing unless they can afford a total loss of their subscription minority holdings in unquoted investments may be difficult to protect and difficult to realise the timing of realisations of investments by the service cannot therefore be predicted  tax risks the tax reliefs referred to in the information memorandum for each offering in the guinness eis service are those currently applicable however investors should be aware that tax reliefs can change their applicability and value will depend upon the individual circumstances of a given investor and investors should seek their own independent professional advice on their particular tax situation and the application of such tax reliefs prior to making a subscription in the service it is the intention of the investment manager to invest in companies which qualify under the eis legislation but there is no guarantee that eis status can be maintained throughout the life of the investment both investee companies and investors need to comply with the requirements of the eis legislation in order to maintain eis income tax relief cgt free disposal and cgt deferral relief and noncompliance may result in the loss or partial clawback of eis income tax relief and cgt deferral relief and potential interest penalties subscription funds will not be returned in these instances investments will be exited as deemed appropriate by the investment manager shares in companies which qualify under the eis legislation will normally qualify for business property relief for inheritance tax purposes in order to secure this relief investors must retain their shareholding in an investee company for a minimum of two years the investment manager intends to invest in companies which qualify for eis relief cgt deferral relief and business property relief although there is a possibility that investments will not qualify for one or more of these to qualify for the full range of tax benefits of an eis investment it is the intention of the investment manager that investments in qualifying companies will be held for three years however the investment manager reserves the right to realise individual investments before three years if it believes it is in the best interests of investors specific eis risks additional risks and uncertainties apply to each offering in the service and the companies in which it invests these specific risks may have an adverse effect on the business of the investee companies investors should consider carefully whether a subscription to the service is suitable for them in the light of the information in the relevant information memorandum

fossil fuels will remain the predominant world energy source for decades to come however the era of easily accessible lowcost oil is overenergy company profitsrising demand and depletion of lowcost

prices are a significant driver of inflation which makes energy companies a useful longterm inflation hedge if we see dollar inflation of  over the next decade that’s just  per year it will be surprising if oil and gas prices do not rise by a comparable percentage white paper how to invest in energy request your copy energy investment case “more motor vehicles will be sold over the next  years than have been sold in the entire history of the automobile industry” surging demand for energy from developing countries the worlds population is growing at a rate of  per year and is projected by the un to rise by a further   billion people by  over  of this growth will come from developing countries the implications for energy consumption are profound more motor vehicles will be sold over the next  years than have been sold throughout the entire history of the automobile industry the surge of demand for electricity cars and consumer goods in emerging markets will have a significant impact on the worlds energy balance china’s demand for oil per capita has not yet reached that of the oecd in  there are  years of unrelenting oil demand growth to come as china’s vehicle fleet moves from  million now to  million by  with numerous other countries following behind the rise in global energy demand is projected to continue long into the future it is likely that the majority of this demand will be met by mainstream energy sources like oil natural gas and coal the world’s oil consumption currently stands at around  million barrels per day and continues to reach new highs each year even in the global recession of  demand for oil from emerging markets continued to grow we think that over the next  years global oil demand growth of  million barrels per day is highly plausible supply is struggling to keep pace high oil and natural gas prices between  and  incentivised energy companies to invest in new technologies resulting in strong natural gas and oil production from unconventional shale resources in north america this growth caused a change of production strategy from opec at the end of  and this has led to sharply lower oil prices as opec grows production and defends market share while north american production starts to slow we believe that opec is now producing near maximum capacity while nonopec production will decline in the future as a result of lower investment levels the industry still faces a big challenge in delivering reasonable oil supply growth at reasonable prices favourable environment for investing in energy the combination of growing demand and inadequate future supply signals that oil and other energy prices will move up over time this would create a very favourable environment for companies with energy resources and for their service providers and distributors the guinness global energy fund seeks to capitalise on this energy price environment we keep coming back to one key proposition easily extractable oil and gas assets remain scarce and it seems reasonable to believe that as they get scarcer they will trade at higher prices than we have yet seen we believe shareholders in energy companies that are part of that world

and are not guaranteed an investor may not get back the amount originally invested the value of an investment can be affected by changes in general market conditions other political social and economic developments as well as specific matters relating to the companies in whose securities each fund invests currency risk changes in the rates of exchange may cause the value of investments to

each dealing day in us dollars nonus dollar share classes are then converted into their respective currencies from the us dollar valuation the funds invest internationally and hold all investments in local currency guinness asset management does not conduct any hedging of currency exposure on the funds’ capital value or income the funds aim to be fully invested most of the time but any cash balances are normally held in us dollars this means that the exposure of the funds to any one currency is mainly limited to the value of its holdings in stocks priced in that currency therefore as

eisqualifying companies can be unlisted smaller companies companies whose shares are not quoted on any recognised stock exchange or companies listed on the alternative investment market aim the guinness eis service is a discretionary managed service investing in eis qualifying companies and managed by guinness asset management ltd the investment manager the service comprises a range of investment themes which can be accessed by investors via a sequence of dated “offerings” each offering has a finite subscription period with an opening and closing date for subscriptions to qualify for the full range of tax benefits of an eis investment investors should be prepared to hold their investment for a minimum of three years each offering has its own information memorandum detailing the terms and conditions specific risks and tax implications of investment the range of investment themes in the guinness eis service include aimlisted companies and sustainable energy companies an investment in the guinness eis service is subject to a number of risks both general and specific to each offering within the service before making any decision to invest prospective investors need to understand that investing in eisqualifying companies can be highly speculative and carries high risk the information memorandum for each offering contains details of the risks involved investors should consider carefully whether a subscription is suitable for them in the light of the information in the information memorandum and their personal circumstances before investing investors are strongly recommended to consult an authorised financial adviser we recommend you seek appropriate independent advice before investing past performance of the investment manager is no guarantee of future performance the value of an investment in any investee company may go down as well as up and investors may not get back the full amount invested the investment manager will rely on achieving an exit for the investments made in each offering in order to generate a capital gain for investors there is no guarantee that exits will be available at the prices anticipated by the investment manager general eis investment risks  concentration risk the investment manager may be unable to make sufficient investments in suitable investee companies if sufficient investments are not made the returns achieved by the service could be materially impacted the investment manager intends to invest across a portfolio of investee companies to diversify exposure to any one company however there is a risk that the investments are concentrated or there is a weighting towards one or more sectors in these circumstances returns to investors may be adversely affected by the underperformance of a particular company or sector  size and liquidity risk the guinness eis service invests in companies that are relatively small smaller investee companies can be vulnerable to government actions and changes in statute in particular there may be changes to the eis legislation which may affect investors’ tax positions investee companies may be reliant on the skills or knowledge of a small number of individuals and should a key individual leave performance may be adversely affected some companies’ shares in which the investment manager invests will be listed on aim other companies will be unlisted listed shares although some companies’ shares in which the guinness eis service can invest are listed on aim not all shares are readily realisable at all times investment in shares traded on aim involves a higher degree of risk and such shares may be less liquid than shares in companies which are listed on the main market of the london stock exchange the rules governing aim companies are less demanding than those of companies listed on the main market of the london stock exchange the market price of aimlisted shares may not necessarily reflect their underlying value the share price of aimlisted companies can be highly volatile and shareholdings can be illiquid the price at which aimlisted shares are quoted and the price at which such shares may realise will be influenced by a large number of factors some specific to the relevant investee company and its operations and others which may affect aimlisted companies generally such as legislative changes and general economic political regulatory or social conditions some aimlisted companies are majority owned by connected parties who may be in a position to exert influence on the relevant investee company and their interests may differ from other shareholders unlisted shares some offerings in the guinness eis service can invest in companies which are not expected to have a listing or quotation therefore there may not be a recognised or active market for the shares of investee companies and it may be difficult to sell or realise the investment or obtain reliable information about their value investors should not consider investing money in an offering which can hold shares in unlisted companies if their investment may be required during the life of the offering which is normally at least three years investors should not consider subscribing unless they can afford a total loss of their subscription minority holdings in unquoted investments may be difficult to protect and difficult to realise the timing of realisations of investments by the service cannot therefore be predicted  tax risks the tax reliefs referred to in the information memorandum for each offering in the guinness eis service are those currently applicable however investors should be aware that tax reliefs can change their applicability and value will depend upon the individual circumstances of a given investor and investors should seek their own independent professional advice on their particular tax situation and the application of such tax reliefs prior to making a subscription in the service it is the intention of the investment manager to invest in companies which qualify under the eis legislation but there is no guarantee that eis status can be maintained throughout the life of the investment both investee companies and investors need to comply with the requirements of the eis legislation in order to maintain eis income tax relief cgt free disposal and cgt deferral relief and noncompliance may result in the loss or partial clawback of eis income tax relief and cgt deferral relief and potential interest penalties subscription funds will not be returned in these instances investments will be exited as deemed appropriate by the investment manager shares in companies which qualify under the eis legislation will normally qualify for business property relief for inheritance tax purposes in order to secure this relief investors must retain their shareholding in an investee company for a minimum of two years the investment manager intends to invest in companies which qualify for eis relief cgt deferral relief and business property relief although there is a possibility that investments will not qualify for one or more of these to qualify for the full range of tax benefits of an eis investment it is the intention of the investment manager that investments in qualifying companies will be held for three years however the investment manager reserves the right to realise individual investments before three years if it believes it is in the best interests of investors specific eis risks additional risks and uncertainties apply to each offering in the service and the companies in which it invests these specific risks may have an adverse effect on the business of the investee companies investors should consider carefully whether a subscription to the service is suitable for

with global exposure to dividend paying companies the fund is managed for income and capital growth and invests in companies that are well placed to be able to pay a sustainable dividend into the future we focus on profitable companies that have generated persistently high return on capital over the last decade with these criteria as our starting point we identify many wellknown bluechip companies but we also find a broad spectrum of smaller companies that are outside of the traditional dividendpaying regions and sectors it is a rare achievement for a company to meet our investment criteria and we think it shows a mark of genuine quality we maintain a high conviction portfolio of around  equallyweighted stocks with low turnover and no benchmarkdriven constraints on sector and

construct the portfolio why invest in the guinness global equity income fund the fund is designed to provide investors with exposure to global equities through a high conviction low turnover portfolio of consistently profitable dividendpaying companies focus on consistent high return on capital consistent high return on capital is a good indication of a company’s ability to pay healthy dividends the fund invests in companies that are unusually consistent in generating returns on capital above their cost of capital growth and income our approach to dividend investing is to focus on companies that can sustainably grow their dividend into the future rather than simply looking for companies with a high dividend yield high conviction the fund typically invests in just  companies with each company having an equal weighting this provides a good balance between the benefits of diversification while also allowing each company to add meaningfully to performance we don’t have a long tail of small positions and by definition we can never just ‘hug’ the benchmark index fundamentally driven we focus on ‘bottomup’ stock selection rather than trying to make decisions based on an expected outlook for the world economy we like to invest in good companies that have in the short term fallen out of favour but that have previously shown an ability to weather most economic environments over time low turnover we prefer to invest over the long term we also recognise the increased costs of trading in and out of companies unnecessarily typically we will hold a company in the portfolio for between  and  years repeatable and independent ian mortimer and matthew page have managed the fund since launch they have developed an investment process that is clear robust transparent and scalable their approach filters out much of the noise and hype that surrounds companies to focus on the true signals that drive company valuations by performing their own company research and analysis using their own proprietary modelling systems the managers try to avoid some of the behavioural biases associated with being unduly influenced by market sentiment the case for a global equity income fund dividends make a gradual but potent contribution to longterm returns dividend growers have outperformed for  years efficient use of cash is paramount in creating a wellrun profitable company that will thrive management discipline is required to maintain dividend growth and can be a signal of a wellrun company using the example of the us stock market the evidence for this is clear in the returns of dividend paying and nondividend paying companies over the last forty years it is also informative to note that companies that cut their dividend were the worst performing group over this period –illustrating that not all dividendpaying companies are created equal power of compounding for investors reinvesting dividends delivers a significant proportion of your total return and in periods of low growth this can be even more striking the s and s for example were periods defined by some combination of sluggish economic growth rising inflation and high unemployment during these decades dividends accounted for over  of the total returns of the sp dividends can protect against inflation looking again at the us as an example dividends in the us stock market have grown at an average  per year since the s while inflation grew at  investing in dividendpaying companies can protect against inflation over long periods the income received in dividend payments has grown in line or at a higher rate than inflation global diversity the array of stocks around the world paying dividends has increased significantly in the last decade we can now invest in a basket of dividendpaying companies that gives you genuine global diversity and exposure to a healthy range of industries in your portfolio in contrast just six companies now account for over  of all dividend payments in the

and fixed income matthew graduated from new college university of oxford with a master’s degree in physics he is a cfa charterholder how do we run the fund “we don’t chase yield we want capital and dividend growth” although the fund is designed to invest in dividendpaying companies our starting point in selecting our investment universe is to identify companies with consistently high return on capital specifically we look at companies that have a return on capital of greater than  in each of the previous ten years our analysis shows that companies with persistently high return on capital are highly likely to continue to do so in the future – meaning they will continue to create shareholder value why  and why ten years  return on capital…  is well above the average real cost of capital of  this means companies who achieve this level are truly creating value for their shareholders …every year… consistency each year excludes highly cyclical companies or those with high but declining or volatile earnings …for ten years because business cycles tend to last less than ten years the companies in our investible universe have shown they can weather most economic environments “its a rare achievement for a company to meet our investment criteria and we think it shows a mark of genuine quality and this is where our portfolio starts – consistent high return on capital” on average only  of global listed companies achieve our threshold we then exclude those less than  billion in size or with a debt to equity ratio greater than  this gives us a pool of around  companies from which to build our portfolio what about yield companies that earn a consistent high return on capital often distribute a proportion of cash they create in the form of a dividend in the fund however we focus on those companies that can sustainably grow their dividend into the future from this pool we then select candidates for extended research on the basis of value and sentiment in depth proprietary modelling of a company’s cash flow capital budgeting and potential for dividend growth is combined with a subjective analysis of its business model to identify candidates for inclusion in the final portfolio by selecting companies from a broad range of industries countries and market capitalisation we aim to create a welldiversified portfolio which can provide a reasonable dividend yield and growing income stream at an attractive valuation relative to the broad market sell discipline it is often easier to find companies to buy that look cheap than it is to identify those companies you own which should be sold we consider sell discipline as important as selecting companies for purchase and continuously monitor the companies we hold in the fund the six core reasons we may sell a company are outlined below the company fails to continue to meet our return on capital criteria the valuation becomes too rich the balance sheet becomes stretched the dividend outlook or management policy to dividends changes unfavourably the original investment thesis no longer holds yield contribution to the portfolio is insufficient how do we construct the portfolio the guinness global equity income fund is a concentrated portfolio of around  equally weighted stocks this provides a number of useful attributes it reduces stockspecific risk as we will not be overweight in a small number of favourite companies we will not have a long tail of small holdings in the portfolio which can be a distraction and a potential drag on performance it instills a strong sell discipline as we must typically sell a position in order to make way for a new one and we must constantly assess the companies we own in the portfolio in comparison to the rest of the universe available to us we are truly index independent all companies held are weighted equally without regard to their weighting in the benchmark index leading the portfolio to have a high active weight fund global equity income fund

and are not guaranteed an investor may not get back the amount originally invested the value of an investment can be affected by changes in general market conditions other political social and economic developments as well as specific matters relating to the companies in whose securities each fund invests currency risk changes in the rates of exchange may cause the value of investments to go up or down while the funds have share classes priced in various currencies the base currency of all the funds is us dollars and the fund valuations for all share classes are initially calculated each dealing day in us dollars nonus dollar share classes are then converted into their respective currencies from the us dollar valuation the funds invest internationally and hold all investments in local currency guinness asset management does not conduct any hedging of currency exposure on the funds’ capital value or income the funds aim to be fully invested most of the time but any cash balances are normally held in us dollars this means that the exposure of the funds to any one currency is mainly limited to the value of its holdings in stocks priced in that currency therefore as well as the impact of share price movements in the securities each fund holds the capital value of an investment in a fund will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the stocks’ local

eisqualifying companies can be unlisted smaller companies companies whose shares are not quoted on any recognised stock exchange or companies listed on the alternative investment market aim the guinness eis service is a discretionary managed service investing in eis qualifying companies and managed by guinness asset management ltd the investment manager the service comprises a range of investment themes which can be accessed by investors via a sequence of dated “offerings” each offering has a finite subscription period with an opening and closing date for subscriptions to qualify for the full range of tax benefits of an eis investment investors should be prepared to hold their investment for a minimum of three years each offering has its own information memorandum detailing the terms and conditions specific risks and tax implications of investment the range of investment themes in the guinness eis service include aimlisted companies and sustainable energy companies an investment in the guinness eis service is subject to a number of risks both general and specific to each offering within the service before making any decision to invest prospective investors need to understand that investing in eisqualifying companies can be highly speculative and carries high risk the information memorandum for each offering contains details of the risks involved investors should consider carefully whether a subscription is suitable for them in the light of the information in the information memorandum and their personal circumstances before investing investors are strongly recommended to consult an authorised financial adviser we recommend you seek appropriate independent advice before investing past performance of the investment manager is no guarantee of future performance the value of an investment in any investee company may go down as well as up and investors may not get back the full amount invested the investment manager will rely on achieving an exit for the investments made in each offering in order to generate a capital gain for investors there is no guarantee that exits will be available at the prices anticipated by the investment manager general eis investment risks  concentration risk the investment manager may be unable to make sufficient investments in suitable investee companies if sufficient investments are not made the returns achieved by the service could be materially impacted the investment manager intends to invest across a portfolio of investee companies to diversify exposure to any one company however there is a risk that the investments are concentrated or there is a weighting towards one or more sectors in these circumstances returns to investors may be adversely affected by the underperformance of a particular company or sector  size and liquidity risk the guinness eis service invests in companies that are relatively small smaller investee companies can be vulnerable to government actions and changes in statute in particular there may be changes to the eis legislation which may affect investors’ tax positions investee companies may be reliant on the skills or knowledge of a small number of individuals and should a key individual leave performance may be adversely affected some companies’ shares in which the investment manager invests will be listed on aim other companies will be unlisted listed shares although some companies’ shares in which the guinness eis service can invest are listed on aim not all shares are readily realisable at all times investment in shares traded on aim involves a higher degree of risk and such shares may be less liquid than shares in companies which are listed on the main market of the london stock exchange the rules governing aim companies are less demanding than those of companies listed on the main market of the london stock exchange the market price of aimlisted shares may not necessarily reflect their underlying value the share price of aimlisted companies can be highly volatile and shareholdings can be illiquid the price at which aimlisted shares are quoted and the price at which such shares may realise will be influenced by a large number of factors some specific to the relevant investee company and its operations and others which may affect aimlisted companies generally such as legislative changes and general economic political regulatory or social conditions some aimlisted companies are majority owned by connected parties who may be in a position to exert influence on the relevant investee company and their interests may differ from other shareholders unlisted shares some offerings in the guinness eis service can invest in companies which are not expected to have a listing or quotation therefore there may not be a recognised or active market for the shares of investee companies and it may be difficult to sell or realise the investment or obtain reliable information about their value investors should not consider investing money in an offering which can hold shares in unlisted companies if their investment may be required during the life of the offering which is normally at least three years investors should not consider subscribing unless they can afford a total loss of their subscription minority holdings in unquoted investments may be difficult to protect and difficult to realise the timing of realisations of investments by the service cannot therefore be predicted  tax risks the tax reliefs referred to in the information memorandum for each offering in the guinness eis service are those currently applicable however investors should be aware that tax reliefs can change their applicability and value will depend upon the individual circumstances of a given investor and investors should seek their own independent professional advice on their particular tax situation and the application of such tax reliefs prior to making a subscription in the service it is the intention of the investment manager to invest in companies which qualify under the eis legislation but there is no guarantee that eis status can be maintained throughout the life of the investment both investee companies and investors need to comply with the requirements of the eis legislation in order to maintain eis income tax relief cgt free disposal and cgt deferral relief and noncompliance may result in the loss or partial clawback of eis income tax relief and cgt deferral relief and potential interest penalties subscription funds will not be returned in these instances investments will be exited as deemed appropriate by the investment manager shares in companies which qualify under the eis legislation will normally qualify for business property relief for inheritance tax purposes in order to secure this relief investors must retain their shareholding in an investee company for a minimum of two years the investment manager intends to invest in companies which qualify for eis relief cgt deferral relief and business property relief although there is a possibility that investments will not qualify for one or more of these to qualify for the full range of tax benefits of an eis investment it is the intention of the investment manager that investments in qualifying companies will be held for three years however the investment manager reserves the right to realise individual investments before three years if it believes it is in the best interests of investors specific eis risks additional risks and uncertainties apply to each offering in the service and the companies in which it invests these specific risks may have an adverse effect on the business of the investee companies investors should consider carefully whether a subscription to the service is suitable for

growth in the consumption of energyenergy supplydespite improvements in alternative energy supplies fossil fuels will remain the predominant world energy source for decades to come however the era of easily accessible lowcost oil is overenergy company profitsrising demand and depletion of lowcost energy supplies will push energy prices higher this will create a favourable environment for companies

hedge if we see dollar inflation of  over the next decade that’s just  per year it will be surprising if oil and gas prices do not rise by a comparable percentage white paper how to invest in energy request your copy energy investment case “more motor vehicles will be sold over the next  years than have been sold in the entire history of the automobile industry” surging demand for energy from developing countries the worlds population is growing at a rate of  per year and is projected by the un to rise by a further   billion people by  over  of this growth will come from developing countries the implications for energy consumption are profound more motor vehicles will be sold over the next  years than have been sold throughout the entire history of the automobile industry the surge of demand for electricity cars and consumer goods in emerging markets will have a significant impact on the worlds energy balance china’s demand for oil per capita has not yet reached that of the oecd in  there are  years of unrelenting oil demand growth to come as china’s vehicle fleet moves from  million now to  million by  with numerous other countries following behind the rise in global energy demand is projected to continue long into the future it is likely that the majority of this demand will be met by mainstream energy sources like oil natural gas and coal the world’s oil consumption currently stands at around  million barrels per day and continues to reach new highs each year even in the global recession of  demand for oil from emerging markets continued to grow we think that over the next  years global oil demand growth of  million barrels per day is highly plausible supply is struggling to keep pace high oil and natural gas prices between  and  incentivised energy companies to invest in new technologies resulting in strong natural gas and oil production from unconventional shale resources in north america this growth caused a change of production strategy from opec at the end of  and this has led to sharply lower oil prices as opec grows production and defends market share while north american production starts to slow we believe that opec is now producing near maximum capacity while nonopec production will decline in the future as a result of lower investment levels the industry still faces a big challenge in delivering reasonable oil supply growth at reasonable prices favourable environment for investing in energy the combination of growing demand and inadequate future supply signals that oil and other energy prices will move up over time this would create a very favourable environment for companies with energy resources and for their service providers and distributors the guinness global energy fund seeks to capitalise on this energy price environment we keep coming back to one key proposition easily extractable oil and gas assets remain scarce and it seems reasonable to believe that as they get scarcer they will trade at higher prices than we have yet seen we believe shareholders in energy companies that are part of that world will be duly rewarded fund managers tim guinness tim guinness is the founder and chief

value key energy equity subsectors integrateds exploration  production oil services canadian oil sands refiners emerging market energy coal producers nuclear topdown views rigorous independent analysis of the fundamental drivers of energy markets eg oil supply and demand opec behaviour natural gas supply and demand global lng market thermal and met coal markets this allows us to forecast

energy stocks each week to identify companies which look attractive on valuation return on investment earnings sentiment and price momentum other screens specific to certain subsectors are also employed to generate ideas stock due diligence stock ideas are taken from our screens and due diligence is performed to establish whether we have conviction to include the stock in our portfolio the due diligence centres around detailed financial modelling portfolio construction equallyweighted portfolio the portfolio comprises  equallyweighted positions most of the positions comprise a single stock but a few are split across more than one stock giving the portfolio  stocks in total our equallyweighted portfolio construction is designed create the best balance between maintaining fund concentration and managing stockspecific risk it also imposes a structural sell discipline an existing position must be sold to purchase a new holding sector weights the fund does not follow any benchmark in its subsector weights in particular there are no underweight restrictions the “supermajor” oil and gas sector weighting may be zero portfolio risk controls stock specific risk stock specific risk in the energy sector tends to be higher than the broader market by constructing the fund of  equallyweighted positions we avoid significant exposure to any one individual stock emerging

ended longonly equity funds investors should be willing and able to assume the risks of equity investing investment in the funds carries with it a degree of risk and investors should read the risk factors section in the prospectus before investing the value of the funds’ portfolios changes daily in accordance with the movement of underlying capital markets and the specific share price movements of the companies in whose shares each fund invests past performance is not a guide to future performance performance risks we identify the following performance risks in our funds market risk the value of investments and the income from them may go down as well as up and are not guaranteed an investor may not get back the amount originally invested the value of an investment can be affected by changes in general market conditions other political social and economic developments as well as specific matters relating to the companies in whose securities each fund invests currency risk changes in the rates of exchange may cause the value of investments to go up or down while the funds have share classes priced in various currencies the base currency of all the funds is us dollars and the fund valuations for all share classes are initially calculated each dealing day in us dollars nonus dollar share classes are then converted into their respective currencies from the us dollar valuation the funds invest internationally and hold all investments in local currency guinness asset management does not conduct any hedging of currency exposure on the funds’ capital value or income the funds aim to be fully invested most of the time but any cash balances are normally held in us dollars this means that the exposure of the funds to any one currency is mainly limited to the value of its holdings in stocks priced in that currency therefore as well as the impact of share price movements in the securities each fund holds the capital value of an investment in a fund will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the stocks’ local currency the fund’s base currency usd and the currency of the fund share class you own emerging market risk the risk inherent in a fund is higher when it is invested in markets which may be considered ’emerging’ these funds are only suitable for those investors who are prepared to accept the above average volatility inherent in emerging market investment there are other risks of investing in our funds such as credit and counterparty risks which are detailed in the prospectus shareholders in guinness global equity income fund and guinness global money managers fund should note that all or part of the fees and expenses can be charged to the capital of the funds charging fees and expenses to capital has the effect of lowering the capital value of your investment fund specific risks in addition some funds carry their own specific risks sector risk some funds invest only in companies involved in a single industry or a single sector of the market these funds are very susceptible to the performance of that one industry or sector and can be volatile examples in the guinness fund range include guinness alternative energy fund guinness global energy fund guinness global money managers fund geographic risk some funds invest only in stocks listed in or exposed to one single country or region these funds are very susceptible to the performance of that one country or region and can be volatile examples in the guinness fund range include guinness china  hong kong fund for more detail on the risks relating to specific products please refer to the relevant documentation for that product guinness eis service an enterprise investment scheme eis is a government initiative to encourage investment in smaller higherrisk companies by offering a range of tax reliefs to investors eisqualifying companies can be unlisted smaller companies companies whose shares are not quoted on any recognised stock exchange or companies listed on the alternative investment market aim the guinness eis service is a discretionary managed service investing in eis qualifying companies and managed by guinness asset management ltd the investment manager the service comprises a range of investment themes which can be accessed by investors via a sequence of dated “offerings” each offering has a finite subscription period with an opening and closing date for subscriptions to qualify for the full range of tax benefits of an eis investment investors should be prepared to hold their investment for a minimum of three years each offering has its own information memorandum detailing the terms and conditions specific risks and tax implications of investment the range of investment themes in the guinness eis service include aimlisted companies and sustainable energy companies an investment in the guinness eis service is subject to a number of risks both general and specific to each offering within the service before making any decision to invest prospective investors need to understand that investing in eisqualifying companies can be highly speculative and carries high risk the information memorandum for each offering contains details of the risks involved investors should consider carefully whether a subscription is suitable for them in the light of the information in the information memorandum and their personal circumstances before investing investors are strongly recommended to consult an authorised financial adviser we recommend you seek appropriate independent advice before investing past performance of the investment manager is no guarantee of future performance the value of an investment in any investee company may go down as well as up and investors may not get back the full amount invested the investment manager will rely on achieving an exit for the investments made in each offering in order to generate a capital gain for investors there is no guarantee that exits will be available at the prices anticipated by the investment manager general eis investment risks  concentration risk the investment manager may be unable to make sufficient investments in suitable investee companies if sufficient investments are not made the returns achieved by the service could be materially impacted the investment manager intends to invest across a portfolio of investee companies to diversify exposure to any one company however there is a risk that the investments are concentrated or there is a weighting towards one or more sectors in these circumstances returns to investors may be adversely affected by the underperformance of a particular company or sector  size and liquidity risk the guinness eis service invests in companies that are relatively small smaller investee companies can be vulnerable to government actions and changes in statute in particular there may be changes to the eis legislation which may affect investors’ tax positions investee companies may be reliant on the skills or knowledge of a small number of individuals and should a key individual leave performance may be adversely affected some companies’ shares in which the investment manager invests will be listed on aim other companies will be unlisted listed shares although some companies’ shares in which the guinness eis service can invest are listed on aim not all shares are readily realisable at all times investment in shares traded on aim involves a higher degree of risk and such shares may be less liquid than shares in companies which are listed on the main market of the london stock exchange the rules governing aim companies are less demanding than those of companies listed on the main market of the london stock exchange the market price of aimlisted shares may not necessarily reflect their underlying value the share price of aimlisted companies can be highly volatile and shareholdings can be illiquid the price at which aimlisted shares are quoted and the price at which such shares may realise will be influenced by a large number of factors some specific to the relevant investee company and its operations and others which may affect aimlisted companies generally such as legislative changes and general economic political regulatory or social conditions some aimlisted companies are majority owned by connected parties who may be in a position to exert influence on the relevant investee company and their interests may differ from other shareholders unlisted shares some offerings in the guinness eis service can invest in companies which are not expected to have a listing or quotation therefore there may not be a recognised or active market for the shares of investee companies and it may be difficult to sell or realise the investment or obtain reliable information about their value investors should not consider investing money in an offering which can hold shares in unlisted companies if their investment may be required during the life of the offering which is normally at least three years investors should not consider subscribing unless they can afford a total loss of their subscription minority holdings in unquoted investments may be difficult to protect and difficult to realise the timing of realisations of investments by the service cannot therefore be predicted  tax risks the tax reliefs referred to in the information memorandum for each offering in the guinness eis service are those currently applicable however investors should be aware that tax reliefs can change their applicability and value will depend upon the individual circumstances of a given investor and investors should seek their own independent professional advice on their particular tax situation and the application of such tax reliefs prior to making a subscription in the service it is the intention of the investment manager to invest in companies which qualify under the eis legislation but there is no guarantee that eis status can be maintained throughout the life of the investment both investee companies and investors need to comply with the requirements of the eis legislation in order to maintain eis income tax relief cgt free disposal and cgt deferral relief and noncompliance may result in the loss or partial clawback of eis income tax relief and cgt deferral relief and potential interest penalties subscription funds will not be returned in these instances investments will be exited as deemed appropriate by the investment manager shares in companies which qualify under the eis legislation will normally qualify for business property relief for inheritance tax purposes in order to secure this relief investors must retain their shareholding in an investee company for a minimum of two years the investment manager intends to invest in companies which qualify for eis relief cgt deferral relief and business property relief although there is a possibility that investments will not qualify for one or more of these to qualify for the full range of tax benefits of an eis investment it is the intention of the investment manager that investments in qualifying companies will be held for three years however the investment manager reserves the right to realise individual investments before three years if it believes it is in the best interests of investors specific eis risks additional risks and uncertainties apply to each offering in the service and the companies in which it invests these specific risks may have an adverse effect on the business of the investee companies investors should

funds carries with it a degree of risk and investors should read the risk factors section in the prospectus before investing the value of the funds’ portfolios changes daily in accordance with the movement of underlying capital markets and the specific share price movements of the companies in whose shares each fund invests past performance is not a guide to future performance performance risks we identify the following performance risks in our funds market risk the value of investments and the income from them may go down as well as up and are not guaranteed an investor may not get back the amount originally invested the value of an investment can be affected by changes in general market conditions other political social and economic developments as well as specific matters relating to the companies in whose securities each fund invests currency risk changes in the rates of exchange may cause the value of investments to go up or down while the funds have share classes priced in various currencies the base currency of all the funds is us dollars and the fund valuations for all share classes are initially calculated each dealing day in us dollars nonus dollar share classes are then converted into their respective currencies from the us dollar valuation the funds invest internationally and hold all investments in local currency guinness asset management does not conduct any hedging of currency exposure on the funds’ capital value or income the funds aim to be fully invested most of the time but any cash balances are normally held in us dollars this means that the exposure of the funds to any one currency is mainly limited to the value of its holdings in stocks priced in that currency therefore as well as the impact of share price movements in the securities each fund holds the capital value of an investment in a fund will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the stocks’ local currency the fund’s base currency usd and the currency of the fund share class you own emerging market risk the risk inherent in a fund is higher when it is invested in markets which may be considered ’emerging’ these funds are only suitable for those investors who are prepared to accept the above average volatility inherent in emerging market investment there are other risks of investing in our funds such as credit and counterparty risks which are detailed in the prospectus shareholders in guinness global equity income fund and guinness global money managers fund should note that all or part of the fees and expenses can be charged to the capital of the funds charging fees and expenses to capital has the effect of lowering the capital value of your investment fund specific risks in addition some funds carry their own specific risks sector risk some funds invest only in companies involved in a single industry or a single sector of the market these funds are very susceptible to the performance of that one industry or sector and can be volatile examples in the guinness fund range include guinness alternative energy fund guinness global energy fund guinness global money managers fund geographic risk some funds invest only in stocks listed in or exposed to one single country or region these funds are very susceptible to the performance of that one country or region and can be volatile examples in the guinness fund range include guinness china  hong kong fund for more detail on the risks relating to specific products please refer to the relevant documentation for that product guinness eis service an enterprise investment scheme eis is a government initiative to encourage investment in smaller higherrisk companies by offering a range of tax reliefs to investors eisqualifying companies can be unlisted smaller companies companies whose shares are not quoted on any recognised stock exchange or companies listed on the alternative investment market aim the guinness eis service is a discretionary managed service investing in eis qualifying companies and managed by guinness asset management ltd the investment manager the service comprises a range of investment themes which can be accessed by investors via a sequence of dated “offerings” each offering has a finite subscription period with an opening and closing date for subscriptions to qualify for the full range of tax benefits of an eis investment investors should be prepared to hold their investment for a minimum of three years each offering has its own information memorandum detailing the terms and conditions specific risks and tax implications of investment the range of investment themes in the guinness eis service include aimlisted companies and sustainable energy companies an investment in the guinness eis service is subject to a number of risks both general and specific to each offering within the service before making any decision to invest prospective investors need to understand that investing in eisqualifying companies can be highly speculative and carries high risk the information memorandum for each offering contains details of the risks involved investors should consider carefully whether a subscription is suitable for them in the light of the information in the information memorandum and their personal circumstances before investing investors are strongly recommended to consult an authorised financial adviser we recommend you seek appropriate independent advice before investing past performance of the investment manager is no guarantee of future performance the value of an investment in any investee company may go down as well as up and investors may not get back the full amount invested the investment manager will rely on achieving an exit for the investments made in each offering in order to generate a capital gain for investors there is no guarantee that exits will be available at the prices anticipated by the investment manager general eis investment risks  concentration risk the investment manager may be unable to make sufficient investments in suitable investee companies if sufficient investments are not made the returns achieved by the service could be materially impacted the investment manager intends to invest across a portfolio of investee companies to diversify exposure to any one company however there is a risk that the investments are concentrated or there is a weighting towards one or more sectors in these circumstances returns to investors may be adversely affected by the underperformance of a particular company or sector  size and liquidity risk the guinness eis service invests in companies that are relatively small smaller investee companies can be vulnerable to government actions and changes in statute in particular there may be changes to the eis legislation which may affect investors’ tax positions investee companies may be reliant on the skills or knowledge of a small number of individuals and should a key individual leave performance may be adversely affected some companies’ shares in which the investment manager invests will be listed on aim other companies will be unlisted listed shares although some companies’ shares in which the guinness eis service can invest are listed on aim not all shares are readily realisable at all times investment in shares traded on aim involves a higher degree of risk and such shares may be less liquid than shares in companies which are listed on the main market of the london stock exchange the rules governing aim companies are less demanding than those of companies listed on the main market of the london stock exchange the market price of aimlisted shares may not necessarily reflect their underlying value the share price of aimlisted companies can be highly volatile and shareholdings can be illiquid the price at which aimlisted shares are quoted and the price at which such shares may realise will be influenced by a large number of factors some specific to the relevant investee company and its operations and others which may affect aimlisted companies generally such as legislative changes and general economic political regulatory or social conditions some aimlisted companies are majority owned by connected parties who may be in a position to exert influence on the relevant investee company and their interests may differ from other shareholders unlisted shares some offerings in the guinness eis service can invest in companies which are not expected to have a listing or quotation therefore there may not be a recognised or active market for the shares of investee companies and it may be difficult to sell or realise the investment or obtain reliable information about their value investors should not consider investing money in an offering which can hold shares in unlisted companies if their investment may be required during the life of the offering which is normally at least three years investors should not consider subscribing unless they can afford a total loss of their subscription minority holdings in unquoted investments may be difficult to protect and difficult to realise the timing of realisations of investments by the service cannot therefore be predicted  tax risks the tax reliefs referred to in the information memorandum for each offering in the guinness eis service are those currently applicable however investors should be aware that tax reliefs can change their applicability and value will depend upon the individual circumstances of a given investor and investors should seek their own independent professional advice on their particular tax situation and the application of such tax reliefs prior to making a subscription in the service it is the intention of the investment manager to invest in companies which qualify under the eis legislation but there is no guarantee that eis status can be maintained throughout the life of the investment both investee companies and investors need to comply with the requirements of the eis legislation in order to maintain eis income tax relief cgt free disposal and cgt deferral relief and noncompliance may result in the loss or partial clawback of eis income tax relief and cgt deferral relief and potential interest penalties subscription funds will not be returned in these instances investments will be exited as deemed appropriate by the investment manager shares in companies which qualify under the eis legislation will normally qualify for business property relief for inheritance tax purposes in order to secure this relief investors must retain their shareholding in an investee company for a minimum of two years the investment manager intends to invest in companies which qualify for eis relief cgt deferral relief and business property relief although there is a possibility that investments will not qualify for one or more of these to qualify for the full range of tax benefits of an eis investment it is the intention of the investment manager that investments in qualifying companies will be held for three years however the investment manager reserves the right to realise individual investments before three years if it believes it is in the best interests of investors specific eis risks additional risks and uncertainties apply to each offering in the service and the companies in which it invests these specific risks may have an adverse effect on the business of the investee companies investors should consider carefully whether a subscription to the service is suitable for them in the light of the information in the relevant information memorandum

companies in the solar wind hydro geothermal biofuels biomass and energy efficiency sectors we believe that over the next twenty years the alternative energy sector will benefit from the combined effects of improved economics  renewable energy becoming competitive with power from fossil fuels valuation  alternative energy equities are undervalued due to poor energy sector sentiment whilst fundamentals of renewables remain strong due to low cost of installation longterm growth – corporate consumer and government interest due to economics underpins longterm prospects solutions  alternative energy offers solutions to climate change pollution and energy security the guinness alternative energy team has been managing alternative energy portfolios since  the fund is a longonly

portfolio construction  risk controls in brief why invest in alternative energy alternative energy is competitivea number of alternative energy technologies are now at a price point where they are already competitive with fossil fuel energy – and alternative energy technologies continue to become cheaper value opportunitymany stocks in the alternative energy sector are trading at a discount to broad market multiples the guinness alternative energy fund can select from a range of stocks with multiples of today’s assets earnings and revenues that do not reflect the high growth potential of these companies in addition companies in the alternative energy sector are often undervalued due to weak energy sector sentiment the correlation in performance with the conventional energy sector is not always warranted creating a value opportunity strong growth driverscompetitive economics of renewable energy corporate consumer and government interest due to favourable economics climate change pollution and energy securitylow current levels of alternative energy useagainst a backdrop of everlower prices renewable electricity the speed with which renewable energy can be built and increasing electricity demand from emerging economies the potential upswing in demand from very low historic levels is an exciting prospect for alternative energy companies and their investorsgovernment supportgovernments continue to support renewable energy in the form of subsidies net metering priority dispatch of their output and allowing renewable energy projects to compete in the same tenders as fossil fuel plants alternative energy investment case value opportunity – unwarranted correlation to fossil fuel pricesa number of alternative energy technologies are now at a price point where they are already competitive with fossil fuel energy – and alternative energy technologies continue to become cheaper alternative energy is competitivealternative energy technologies have reduced significantly in cost since  solar photovoltaic pv panels are now  cheaper than they were in  translating into a cheaper electricity source than coal in many parts of the world wind power has also decreased in cost though not as significantly as solar nevertheless wind is one of the cheapest forms of generating electricity and beat coal in tenders for power generation in chile and morocco in  and  respectively unlike conventional electricity sources solar pv plants can be built in months providing an easilybuilt increase in electricity generation alternative energy continues to decrease in cost although alternative energy technologies have already decreased in cost significantly the trend for solar and wind shows continued cost decreases even if at a slower pace from before storage technologies – specifically batteries – are now decreasing in cost on a similar path to that which solar pv panels achieved between  and  it is therefore likely that solar and wind power technologies combined with battery storage will become competitive in cost with fossil fuels and be able to provide power when the sun does not shine and the wind does not blow interest from corporations governments and consumers ensures longterm growth the price volatility in the conventional energy markets – specifically the gas and power markets – has driven many companies to hedge their electricity prices by either building renewable energy plants or signing longterm contracts to buy power from renewable energy plants for a fixed price governments continue to support renewable energy with increasing support coming from developing countries amid the decline in cost of wind and solar power energy security many countries have to import fossil fuels for their power generators leaving them at the mercy of international energy prices and exposed to counterparty risk particularly in developing countries with much of the world’s fossil fuel reserves lying outside of the oecd energy security remains a concern from a political perspective alternative energy is attractive as the power is then generally generated domestically and does not rely on imports alternative energy also reduces the exposure to fossil fuel commodity price risk that most countries face climate change the paris agreement at the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc conference of the parties in  confirmed that world leaders accept that reducing greenhouse gas emissions is necessary to avert disastrous global warming this acknowledgement indicates longerterm support for alternative energy sources pollution and health concerns the global population is becoming increasingly urban local air pollution has quickly become a serious issue fund manager edward guinness edward
