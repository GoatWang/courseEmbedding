contract manufacturer specializing in ongoing production programs describes the investments involved in winning this work article post 0 peter zelinski editorinchief modern machine shop wsi focuses its efforts on repeating part numbers a line developed for cylinder heads includes a parts washer seen here being loaded plus a custom test fixture and pressure tester the machining equipment is an aspect of the process that customers frequently take for granted wsi purchased this turnmill machine for oilfieldrelated parts such as the ones in the foreground producing this hydraulic fracturing part for the natural gas industry involves about  hours of machining on this taper hmc wsi’s benjamin rashleger points to a critical bore one of the features of this part that currently cannot be machined effectively by the company’s suppliers overseas previous next related topics largepart machining the nasdaq stock exchange is typically associated with the likes of apple and google but at least one company focused on manufacturing has been part of this exchange from the beginning wsi industries an employee contract manufacturer in monticello minnesota is one of only about  companies that have been continuously listed here since the start of the exchange in 9 this detail is somewhat fitting because wsi thrives by staking out territory where most other machining contractors don’t venture   the company pursues ongoing production programs involving large parts or large quantities to be sure many shops pursue these programs because the work offers obvious benefits unlike a prototype run or similar shortterm job the longrun program gives the shop a chance to refine a production process around the part and to recoup its investment in doing so but company president benjamin rashleger says the very reason wsi wins and retains such programs is found in that one word “investment” the cost and scale involved in meeting the demands of committed or even semicommitted programs constitute the principle challenges of this work   for example the traits that enable wsi to win ongoing jobs from major oems include extensive inhouse engineering support project management staffing the production capacity to quickly run parts as needed and the capital to both carry customer inventory and add new equipment in response to new demand all these elements add to overhead and the overall expense of that overhead requires wsi to keep courting and surpassing the expectations of companies that can provide highvalue orders mr rashleger freely admits that given this overhead cost wsi can’t economically compete for the nonrecurring work that comprises most contract manufacturing when an established customer sends wsi an order for a part number that won’t repeat the company often seeks the customer’s permission to outsource that job to save cost   during a recent walk around the company’s production floor mr rashleger detailed some of the realities of largeprogram production just one of those realities he says is that machining is taken for granted   beyond metalcutting wsi currently divides its work into three businesses one is highvolume machining of aluminum which mostly consists of parts related to lightvehicle engines in quantities of thousands of pieces per month the second business is repetitive batch work this consists of part numbers that keep coming back but are machined in quantities of perhaps only 0 per month the third business is the most recent addition and the fastest growing producing large parts mostly in steel for customers in the energy sector   repetitive batch work is the only area in which machining capability alone wins jobs this business is segregated into a section of the production floor that includes a wellorganized library of fixture tooling for the many recurring jobs this business runs smoothly and is largely self contained mr rashleger says but it accounts for only about  percent of total sales   to serve the other two businesses wsi typically has to go well beyond cutting metal because the customer is often more interested in the shop’s ability to validate the part or perform additional processing for example a line for aluminum cylinder heads includes a customengineered test fixture along with a parts washer and a pressure tester pointing to the horizontal machining center at the beginning of this line mr rashleger says “the customer doesn’t even ask about that machining is the part of the process that everyone assumes you can do”   committed resources work for an oilfieldrelated customer got wsi into turnmill machining for the first time in addition to purchasing new equipment the company dedicated two project managers and one engineer to this customer—all despite the fact that the work itself is not reliable   energy is “a hard business” mr rashleger explains one involving dramatic swings that can “shut the work off immediately” even so this new machine tool—an okuma turnmill with a turning diameter of 0 mm—was essential to run the customer’s parts efficiently wsi therefore bought the machine on just a handshake agreement with the customer in essence this agreement said that if wsi kept delivering the work as required the shop would keep getting the work so long as the customer has the work to give   wsi is trying to diversify within the energy sector pursuing work related not only to oil but also to natural gas another recent machine purchase is a taper milltronics hmc mr rashleger is the former president of milltronics that is large enough to accommodate massive steel manifold components used for hydraulic fracturing operations in natural gas extraction   personal contact one might think the choice of manufacturer for a large and costly production program would be based on a scrupulous analysis of cost and value it is says mr rashleger says but intangible factors figure in as well largescale production is actually an emotional buy—or at least as much of one as an industrial purchase can be   he says wsi “shows well” and this is an important asset the production floor is kept clean and organized with the equipment wellmaintained and if possible busy the manufacturing area itself is one of the company’s best resources for selling manufacturing   yet ultimately the staffing is the most important factor influencing the customer’s level of comfort program managers at wsi perform the vital role of giving each customer a personal advocate within the company for managing special needs by calling on the program manager’s help for example a customer can get a onepiece emergency order squeezed into machine schedules and sped through production with enough program managers to provide personal attention to customers wsi is staffed large enough to appear “small” when it comes to responding to special demands   the company recently performed a marketing survey eliciting feedback from customers one finding revealed the importance of a simple practice at wsi the habit of phoning customers every time there is a problem or delay with a job various customers expressed how valuable they thought this was the practice reassures customers that they don’t have to frequently check in because they know the company will communicate any concerns before it occurs to them to worry   capacity is a tough call mr rashleger says one of the hardest decisions he routinely faces is when to buy a machine tool having too much capacity obviously adds to the company’s burden when business is down yet having too little capacity is potentially even more expensive because it might prevent the shop from taking on new work with short notice—and just about all new work comes with short notice   “with one phone call our business can pick up dramatically” he says immediately after such a phone call comes in he often has to make several calls himself to find equipment required for the new job in fact when he gets even a hint that additional business might be coming he alerts machine tool dealers which sometimes keep machines waiting and earmarked for him the dealers are willing to do this because wsi routinely pays premiums for machine tools that are in stock and ready for immediate delivery   the ideal situation he says is always to have just one relatively large and capable machine tool open and waiting when this is the case—when all the machines in the shop are busy except this one—the shop can still take on new work immediately that is the shop can start using the machine it has available while mr rashleger sets about obtaining equipment that is bettersuited for the job   overseas is not far away even when the shop does everything right it still loses jobs for one part number the shop had achieved a defect rate of less than 0 pieces per million and an ontime delivery rate of more than  percent—two outstanding figures given the complexity of the product nevertheless a shift in relative currency prices sent the work overseas in some cases in fact customers have told wsi that it is their new policy to seek manufacturing in lowcost countries for certain parts in response to such developments wsi has formed its own relationships with lowcost country suppliers in which wsi still provides supplier management logistics and quality assurance because of these arrangements the company now has about  million of workinprocess inventory from overseas at any given time   for practically every part that wsi manages in this way not all of the machining goes overseas there are some operations the distant shops can’t do on the cylinder heads for example wsi machines the fineprecision features requiring control against the thermal expansion but the expertise gap is a moving target mr rashleger says the capabilities of overseas suppliers are steadily improving to stay ahead wsi has to keep moving as well—continually finding ways to meet tighter engineering demands and even more challenging customer requirements   related suppliers milltronics usa inc okuma america corporation related content machining center handles large components with 00 percent spindle uptime flexarm has expanded its
