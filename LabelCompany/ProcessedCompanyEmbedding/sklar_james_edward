and what it means the introduction to each book gives a concise but thorough treatment of its authorship date original setting and purpose following a structural analysis each commentary takes the book section by section drawing out its main themes and also comments on individual verses and problems of interpretation additional notes provide fuller discussion of particular difficulties in these new volumes the commentary on each section of the text is structured under three headings context comment and meaning the goal is to explain the true meaning of the bible and make its message plain in the logos edition these volumes are enhanced by amazing functionality important terms link to dictionaries encyclopedias and a wealth of other resources in your digital library perform powerful

sklar series tyndale commentaries publisher ivp academic publication date  pages  sample pages              levitical rules and regulations can at first appear irrelevant to contemporary christians—but they provide important old testament background for understanding large portions of the new testament leviticus describes a point in human history when god came and dwelt in the midst of the ancient israelites and taught them what their purpose in life really was jay sklar’s commentary makes clear what it is that the lord said to them and in so doing makes clear what he says to us today this new commentary fills the place of the previous one written by rk harrison and brings this sometimes difficult text even more keenly into focus for modern readers if you have always baulked at reading leviticus then get this book and use it as a guide it will be money and time wellspent —john de hoog vox reformata pastors seminarians and bible teachers will surely benefit from this volume and its readers will likely quote many of sklar’s modernday analogies —kazuyuki hayashi journal for the evangelical study of the old testament   jay sklar phd university of gloucestershire is professor of old testament and dean of faculty at covenant seminary st louis missouri deuteronomy author edward j woods series tyndale commentaries publisher ivp academic publication date  pages  sample pages              deuteronomy has been aptly described as a book “on the boundary” it addresses the possibilities of new life “beyond the jordan” as dependent upon israel’s keeping of the law and acknowledgment of yahweh’s supremacy moses leaves the people with his last will and testament that would ensure their success and wellbeing in the new land in this completely new volume on deuteronomy in the tyndale commentary series edward woods expounds upon the book’s breathtaking and allencompassing vision he shows how the israelites—from king to ordinary citizen—were exhorted to make its words the interpreter of their life’s story within the land edward j woods now retired was formerly senior lecturer in old testament at the melbourne school of theology victoria australia formerly the bible college of victoria where he still teaches part time he has also served as a moderator in old testament studies for the australian college of theology as a pastor in australia and

is the heart of the old testament the libretto of the most vibrant worship imaginable it informs our intellect stimulates our imagination arouses our emotions and stirs us to holy thoughts and actions it is also a pivotal witness to and anticipation of jesus christ tremper longman’s commentary interprets each psalm in its old testament setting summarizes its message and reflects on its significance from a new testament perspective noting any citation and also providing a christological reading this fresh commentary brings new perspectives from the two previous tyndale commentaries on the psalms by derek kidner this is a significant work of scholarship accessible to the general audience which provides both a compelling framework and an applicatory trajectory that is christfocused all of which will gratify the judicious reader —josh moody journal for the evangelical study of the old testament   longman’s contribution is a solid sober and uptodate revision of an influential commentary on the book of psalms in a series designed for pastors students and laypeople and will serve the readership well for the next generation —john c crutchfield journal of the evangelical theological society  no

song of songs author iain m duguid series tyndale commentaries publisher ivp academic publication date  pages 0 sample pages              this old testament book ‘the best of songs’ has fascinated and perplexed interpreters for centuries we hear the passionate melody of romantic love and are confronted by erotic imagery—but whose love is described is it a couple’s love for each other god’s love for his people or a poem that speaks to love in all its dimensions iain duguid’s commentary explains how the song is designed to show us an idealized picture of married love in the context of a fallen and broken world it also convicts us of how far short of this perfection we fall both as humans and as lovers and drives us repeatedly into the arms of our true heavenly husband jesus christ replacing g lloyd carr’s the song of solomon duguid’s commentary on the song of songs utilizes uptodate scholarship to paint a fresh picture of this provocative old testament text as one who found the original tyndale ot commentaries extremely helpful this reviewer can only express the desire that all volumes from the original series will be rewritten with the same clarity as the volume that has been reviewed here —ellis r brotzman journal of the evangelical theological society  no  throughout song of songs the reader is pushed to know meditate upon and apply biblical wisdom in regards to marriage duguid has written an excellent commentary that calls one to draw closer to god this work is a welcome addition for students seeking to get an introductory view of the song of songs and it will be an excellent addition to any pastor’s library —brian koning journal of biblical and theological studies vol  issue  iain m duguid phd university of cambridge is professor of old testament at grove city
