revenues of  as compared to  for three months ended march   an increase of  or  revenue from our funeral services segment increased by  or  from  in  to  in  the increase is principally due to the net

and capital resources operations   as of march   we had cash on hand of    operating activities  for the three months ended march   we used cash in operating activities of  as compared to  for the three months ended march   the decrease is principally due to changes in operating assets and liabilities   investing activities  for the three months ended march   we generated cash from investing activities of  as compared to cash used in investing activities of  for the three months ended march   the decrease is principally due to a decrease in cash advance for planned acquisitions and

had a negative working capital at march   and had net cash outflow for operating activities for the three months ended march   these factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern without realization of additional capital it would be unlikely for us to continue as a going concern   we plan to fund our operations from loans from our major shareholders and we may raise equity capital by offering shares of our common stock to investors as well as from our operations there is no obligation by the shareholders to provide such funding   although the company believes its revenues from operations will eliminate the need to raise additional funding to expand its business operations over the next  months there is no guarantee additional funding will not be required if financing is needed and we are not able to raise the capital necessary to fund our business expansion objectives we may have to delay the implementation of our business plan   we do not currently have any arrangements for financing obtaining additional funding will be subject to a number of factors including general market conditions investor acceptance of our business plan and initial results from our business operations these factors may impact the timing amount terms or conditions of additional financing available to us the most likely source of future funds available to us is through the sale of additional shares of common stock or advances from our major shareholders or directors and if we are able to obtain equity financing it will likely result in significant additional dilution to the interests of our current stockholders and may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your right as a stockholder the company may obtain financing by issuing debt which may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures or declaring dividends there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such additional financing is needed and if we cannot receive such financing we may be forced to suspend or cease operations            critical accounting policies   our financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap us gaap requires the use of estimates assumptions judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets liabilities revenues and expenses amounts reported these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies risk and financial condition we believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to gaap and are consistently and conservatively applied we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements   we believe the following is among the most critical accounting policies that impact our consolidated financial statements we suggest that our significant accounting policies as described in our financial statements in the summary of significant accounting policies be read in conjunction with this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period the company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to deferred income tax asset valuation allowances the company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual results experienced by the company may differ materially and adversely from the company’s estimates to the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results future results of operations will be affected   accounts receivable   accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes

amount collected by the company minus  of the contract price will be made when the termination is not made within  days from the contract initiation date full refund will be made when the termination

exists services were provided the fee for such services is fixed or determinable and collectability of the fee is reasonably assured insurance agency services are considered complete and revenue is recognized when an insurance policy becomes effective   income taxes   we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment   a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination with a tax examination being presumed to occur the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than  likely of being realized on examination for tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test no tax benefit is recorded   recent accounting pronouncements     in january  the financial
