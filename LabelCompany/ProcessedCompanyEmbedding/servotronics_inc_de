reliable industry statistics are available to enable the company to determine accurately its relative competitive position with respect to any of its products the company believes that it is a significant factor with respect to certain of its servocontrol components within its competitive market the company’s share of the overall cutlery market is not significant   the company has many different competitors with respect to servocontrol components because of the nature of that business and the fact that these products also face competition from other types of control components which

company’s  longterm incentive plan   item  selected financial data   the company is a smaller reporting company by rule b of the exchange act and is not required to provide the information required under this item   item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   business overview   the aviation and aerospace industries as well as markets for the company’s consumer products continually face evolving challenges on a global basis the operations of the company can be affected by the trends of the economy including interest rates income tax laws government regulation legislation and other factors in addition uncertainties in today’s global economy competition from expanding manufacturing capabilities and technical sophistication of lowcost developing countries and emerging markets currency policies in relation to the us dollar of some major foreign exporting countries the effect of terrorism difficulty in predicting defense and other government appropriations the vitality of the commercial aviation industry and its ability to purchase new aircraft the willingness and ability of the company’s customers to fund longterm purchase programs volatile market demand and the continued market acceptance of the company’s advanced technology and cutlery products make it difficult to predict the impact on future financial results   both the atg and cpg markets are sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and policies which may create volatility in operating results from period to period for example the airline industry is sensitive to fuel price increases and economic conditions these factors directly impact the demand for aircraft production as well as the amount of repair and overhaul required on inservice aircraft          government procurements are subject to congressional appropriations and priorities that may change from year to year such changes could result in but are not limited to the expansion andor contraction of government procurement requirements a reduction in funding the continuation or termination of existing programs the introduction of new programs requiring the funds that were originally directed to current programs a stretchout in government delivery requirements or such other us government determinations that could result in increases or reductions of government purchase orders for the atg andor the cpg products   the company’s suppliers are also subject to all the pressures and volatility being generated by the current global economic conditions any interruption of the company’s continuous flow of material and product parts that are required for the manufacture of the company’s products could adversely impact the company’s ability to meet the company’s customers’ delivery requirements consistent with the evolving requirements of the aerospace industry companies are increasingly being requested to operate under longterm agreements with their customers on the basis of fixed prices targeted year to year price reductions andor year to year price adjustments predicated on mutually agreed indices andor a combination of some or all of the above described pricing arrangements andor otherwise therefore productivity improvements and cost containment strategies are continuously sought within the company’s concept of continuous improvement the company’s products are labor intensive and as such productivity improvements are expected to have positive effects on the company’s operating results however increased costs for raw material purchased parts andor labor will have the reverse effect therefore there are strong incentives to continuously improve productivity and to containreduce costs   if any adverse economic events reduce the number of airliners andor aircraft being produced by the company’s relevant prime contractors the negative effects of that reduction will in turn flow down through the supply chain also certain major manufacturers have successfully imposed extended payment terms to their suppliers at times these extended payment terms are not available to the company when purchasing raw material such as aluminum magnetic material steel andor other product support items and services if the company’s customers delay their payments until after the extended due date or fail to pay it could adversely impact the company’s operating results   maximizing the company’s operations requires continued dedicated performances from the company’s key and other personnel in the company’s markets and business arenas there is substantial competition for the services of the highest performing individuals competitors customers and other companies who may have interest in the company’s most experienced and educatedhighly trained personnel ie managerial engineering and accountingadministrative are a continuing consequence of the company’s history of successful operational performance any unplanned replacement of such personnel may require the hiring of new personnel on an expedited basis provided they are available and may temporarily interrupt the company’s operations and efforts for continuous improvement   management discussion   during the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively of the company’s revenues were derived from contracts with agencies of the us government or their prime contractors and their subcontractors sales of products sold for government applications decreased approximately  and  from the prior year during  and  respectively due to decreased government shipments at the atg the company believes that government involvement in military operations overseas will continue to have an impact on the financial results in both the advanced technology and consumer products markets while the company is optimistic in relation to these potential opportunities it recognizes that sales to the government are affected by defense budgets the foreign policies of the us and other nations the level of military operations and other factors as such it is difficult to predict the impact on future financial results          the company’s commercial business is affected by such factors as uncertainties in today’s global economy global competition the vitality and ability of the commercial aviation industry to purchase new aircraft the effects and threats of terrorism market demand and acceptance both for the company’s products and its customers’ products which incorporate company made components   the atg engages its business development efforts in its primary markets and is broadening its activities to include new domestic and foreign markets that are consistent with its core competencies we believe our business remains particularly well positioned in the strong commercial aircraft market driven by the replacement of older aircraft with more fuel efficient alternatives and the increasing demand for air travel in emerging markets although the atg backlog continues to be strong actual scheduled shipments may be delayedchanged as a function of the company’s customers’ final delivery determinations based on changes in the global economy and other factors   the cpg continues to diversify its revenue streams with a broader government focus and new commercial channels including the addition of national retailers international accounts and a directtoconsumer business line in response to recent and ongoing reductions in military spending the cpg is also actively growing its custom manufacturing business to provide a wide range of metal and plastic fabrication services to a variety of consumer and industrial companies new product development is focused on the commercialization of products with applications that span government and civilian requirements to maximize demand or that open up new lines of business entirely   the atg and cpg continue to respond to us government procurement requests for quotes new product development activities are ongoing along with the acquisition and development of new product lines   see also note  business segments of the accompanying consolidated

certain expected operational efficiencies attributable to increased production volumes for inhouse and outsourced operations total employment levels grew from  employees at december   to  employees at

indemnitee is willing to continue in such positions with the indemnification and other rights provided hereby   in recent years litigation seeking to impose liability on directors and officers of publiclyheld corporations has become more frequent such litigation is extremely expensive to defend in many cases defense costs exceed the financial means of individual defendants further the possibility of liability for extremely large sums is a deterrent to persons accepting positions of responsibility with a public corporation   indemnitee is deeply concerned regarding this situation as well as the adequacy of the indemnification available under the corporation’s bylaws and the fact that directors and officers liability insurance even if obtainable has become much more limited in the scope of its protection and extremely expensive and can be cancelled at any time   now therefore to induce indemnitee to continue to serve the corporation and for other good and valuable consideration

shall be a defense to an action or proceeding under section c that indemnitee has not met the standards of conduct referred to herein which make it permissible hereunder for the corporation to indemnify indemnitee for the amount claimed but the burden     –  –       of proving such defense shall be on the corporation neither the failure of the corporation including the board independent

and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview the aviation and aerospace industries as well as markets for the companys consumer products continually face evolving challenges on a global basis the operations of the company can be affected by the trends of the economy including interest rates income tax laws government regulation legislation and other factors in addition uncertainties in todays global economy competition from expanding manufacturing capabilities and technical sophistication of lowcost developing countries and emerging markets currency policies in relation to the us dollar of some major foreign exporting countries the effect of terrorism difficulty in predicting defense and other government appropriations the vitality of the commercial aviation industry and its ability to purchase new aircraft the willingness and ability of the companys customers to fund longterm purchase programs volatile market demand and the continued market acceptance of the companys advanced technology and cutlery products make it difficult to predict the impact on future financial results both the atg and cpg markets are sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and policies which may create volatility in operating results from period to period for example the airline industry is sensitive to fuel price increases and economic conditions these factors directly impact the demand for aircraft production as well as the amount of repair and overhaul required on inservice aircraft    government procurements are subject to congressional appropriations and priorities that may change from year to year such changes could result in but are not limited to the expansion andor contraction of government procurement requirements a reduction in funding the continuation or termination of existing programs the introduction of new programs requiring the funds that were originally directed to current programs a stretchout in government delivery requirements or such other us government determinations that could result in increases or reductions of government purchase orders for the atg andor the cpg products the companys suppliers are also subject to all the pressures and volatility being generated by the current global economic conditions any interruption of the companys continuous flow of material and product parts that are required for the manufacture of the companys products could adversely impact the companys ability to meet the companys customers delivery requirements consistent with the evolving requirements of the aerospace industry companies are increasingly being requested to operate under longterm agreements with their customers on the basis of fixed prices targeted year to year price reductions andor year to year price adjustments predicated on mutually agreed indices andor a combination of some or all of the above described pricing arrangements andor otherwise therefore productivity improvements and cost containment strategies are continuously sought within the companys concept of continuous improvement the companys products are labor intensive and as such productivity improvements are expected to have positive effects on the companys operating results however increased costs for raw material purchased parts andor labor will have the reverse effect therefore there are strong incentives to continuously improve productivity and to containreduce costs if any adverse economic events reduce the number of airliners andor aircraft being produced by the companys relevant prime contractors the negative effects of that reduction will in turn flow down through the supply chain also certain major manufacturers have successfully imposed extended payment terms to their suppliers at times these extended payment terms are not available to the company when purchasing raw material such as aluminum magnetic material steel andor other product support items and services if the companys customers delay their payments until after the extended due date or fail to pay it could adversely impact the companys operating results maximizing the companys operations requires continued dedicated performances from the companys key and other personnel in the companys markets and business arenas there is substantial competition for the services of the highest performing individuals competitors customers and other companies who may have interest in the companys most experienced and educatedhighly trained personnel ie managerial engineering and accountingadministrative are a continuing consequence of the companys history of successful operational performance any unplanned replacement of such personnel may require the hiring of new personnel on an expedited basis provided they are available and may temporarily interrupt the companys operations and efforts for continuous improvement management discussion during the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively of the companys revenues were derived from contracts with agencies of the us government or their prime contractors and their subcontractors sales of products sold for government applications decreased approximately  and  from the prior year during  and  respectively due to decreased government shipments at the atg the company believes that government involvement in military operations overseas will continue to have an impact on the financial results in both the advanced technology and consumer products markets while the company is optimistic in relation to these potential opportunities it recognizes that sales to the government are affected by defense budgets the foreign policies of the us and other nations the level of military operations and other factors as such it is difficult to predict the impact on future financial results    the companys commercial business is affected by such factors as uncertainties in todays global economy global competition the vitality and ability of the commercial aviation industry to purchase new aircraft the effects and threats of terrorism market demand and acceptance both for the companys products and its customers products which incorporate company made components the atg engages its business development efforts in its primary markets and is broadening its activities to include new domestic and foreign markets that are consistent with its core competencies we believe our business remains particularly well positioned in the strong commercial aircraft market driven by the replacement of older aircraft with more fuel efficient alternatives and the increasing demand for air travel in emerging markets although the atg backlog continues to be strong actual scheduled shipments may be delayedchanged as a function of the companys customers final delivery determinations based on changes in the global economy and other factors the cpg continues to diversify its revenue streams with a broader government focus and new commercial channels including the addition of national retailers international accounts and a directtoconsumer business line in response to recent and ongoing reductions in military spending the cpg is also actively growing its custom manufacturing business to provide a wide range of metal and plastic fabrication services to a variety of consumer and industrial companies new product development is focused on the commercialization of products with applications that span government and civilian requirements to maximize demand or that open up new lines of business entirely the atg and cpg continue to respond to us government procurement requests for quotes new product development activities are ongoing along with the acquisition and development of new product lines see also note  business segments of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information concerning business segment operating results    results of
