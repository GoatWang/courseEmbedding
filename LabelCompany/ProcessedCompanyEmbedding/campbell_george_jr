in higher education today cooper union controversy and investigation by new york state attorney generaledit in the wake of the colleges recent financial difficulties that led to the school dismantling its  year mission of free tuition many faculty students and alumni questioned campbells actions and intentions as president according to john hechinger in  george campbell helped the school sidestep a crisis although by october   jamshed bharucha announced an insurmountable deficit that allegedly could not keep the institution sustainable without tuition in may  former board of trustees investment committee chair john michaelson admitted the school could have continued to use the endowment to cover deficits and would have survived until  when the higher payments from the chrysler lease start in an investigation of cooper unions finances released in a cross petition on september   new york state attorney general eric schneiderman found that president campbell misinformed the community as to the strength of cooper union’s finances when they had sufficient information to know the truth of the school’s increasingly dire condition additionally schneiderman found that campbell had an apparent conflict of interest in a  bonus that would to be awarded george campbell jr if construction of the new academic building at  cooper square was completed while he was president the investigation concluded that the schools financial difficulties in fact had happened under campbells presidency and planning the attorney general’s financial and operational investigation which began in august  and the results of which are being released today revealed that cooper union’s current financial problems are rooted in the failure of a  plan to finance the construction of a new academic building at  cooper square the plan involved the school taking out a  million mortgage loan on the land it owns beneath the chrysler building while simultaneously committing to a longterm renegotiation of its lease with the tenant that owns and operates the building personal lifeedit married since  to dr mary schmidt campbell president of spelman college and dean emerita of new york universitys tisch
