price if you have ever met dodge you know he has a certain attraction to strappy things when he gets bored i wasnt able to be home for a couple days to take them on their routine run so hes been

helpful cool    annrotan   would be  star but while i love the site and products they carry they should change advertising on their home page fast free  days shipping on orders over ” the shipping policy when opened on the help page then clarifies “most” people will get their orders in  days which is not the same thing i ordered a product that is going to take  days to be delivered apparently when i could have paid a little more and had my whole order here and guaranteed in  days on amazon prime i will definitely not be using chewy unless i know i have  week before i need a product unfortunately the products don’t have an approximate delivery time next to them even at checkout report is this review helpful cool    tiger   chewyscom my first experience with this company was not good they sent me an advertising mailer stating a  discount on my first order when i used the promo code it did not work and then when i called your customer service department they said my dog food brand was not eligible for the discount i dont see anywhere on this mailer that only select brands qualify and hence is kind of deceptive advertising in my opinionthey didnt offer any remedy and hence i will not use this company in the future as they cant even stand behind their ad to even a new customer report is this review helpful cool    lunanox   chewy is the best i dont what i did before i discovered chewy they have every product a pet owner could want top notch customer service great prices and orders are shipped at lightning speed chewys is the only place i go for all of my pets needs  report is this review helpful cool    ialreadyexistl   im a thrilled new customer  on tuesday i called and spoke to sarah in chewys customer service dept i had trouble signing into my new acct so she very nicely helped me thru that process and then i placed the order for treats and a trial of the natural balance dog food i was so surprised to receive the order the very next day this was just my nd order there were some problems with the first order ie i ordered the wrong size pet cot and called to set up a return i was told to donate the first cot and they sent me a new larger one free of charge the new one had obviously been opened and then taped up  i had no problem with that but it turned out to be missing three legs i asked for three legs and was told they couldnt do that so they sent me a whole new unopened cot im amazed that they would be that generous when other companies would have charged for the return of the first item and then charged me for the shipping on the third one so the result is that i need to figure out a way to make  legs for the second cot  then be able to donate it to the open door animal sanctuary the no kill shelter where our two dogs were alumni weve only got our girl maggie now so one cot is all we need and then they shipped my second order overnite report is this review helpful cool    leahrenee   customer engagement experts i cannot say enough about the customer service experience i encountered today i was solely responsible for ordering the feline natural balance and not the canine the order arrived and i immediately pinged via chat within  minutes ed g resolved my issue no questions asked refunded my money and graciously suggested i donate the food to a charity or shelter as i couldnt ship back the food has been donated to cat matchers in dallas tx to a lovely woman that devotes time to help kittens and cats and chewycom has earned a customer for life thank you chewycom for realizing the value in customer engagement and experience  report is this review helpful cool    allyssacaron   awesome service chewy provides great prices and really awesome customer service report is this review helpful cool    sunnysharma   horrible customer service i ordered a  large dog crate from chewycom after a week of not getting it i started to wonder and did track my package on fed ex website it showed they had delivered it so i called fedex and told them that i did not receive my package they created a case and called me back stating they delivered it to wrong place they stated they would get their driver to pick it up and bring it to right address i tried to stay very calm as to i had my vacation planned for over a year and thought  weeks would be long enough to receive a package another  days went by and no call from fedex and no package i called them again and after on hold for over  minutes they said that there were too many labels on the package so they sent it back by now i was getting nervous i called chewycom and their customer service stated they would call me next morning and overnight the package after  hours i still did not receive a call i called back to chewycom and they said they see the package is being returned and they can ship it again at this point i was very peed off day before my vacation and they tell me they can ship it again and cant do over night so first person lied and second person tried to help but at this point i was at point of no return with incompetent of chewycom and fedex i had to cancel my vacation my suggestion is that even though they have a good customer review beware just like any other company they really dont give a crap its numbers game i am sure they figure long as they sell that is all that matters i would not be surprised if chewycom does not pay to have positive review written by rd party so negative reviews are towards the bottom will not buy from them again ever report is this review helpful cool    marciamanno   top notch  caring company at chewycom chewycom has the best customer service they helped me and kept in touch with me for when our senior shih tzu tbone needed a special renal diet they did an excellent job making sure i got the prescription and food in time and we started auto delivery delivery was free and fast and when our tbone took a turn for the worst and passed away they didnt hesitate to make the return quick and hasslefree but where they really went above and beyond was having sympathy flowers sent to me and my family how thoughtful and kind chewycom truly cares about their customers and their furry friends report is this review helpful cool    patkinsellaboy   not a happy customer if someone were to ask me about chewycom  weeks ago there would be nothing bad i could or would say because i was that happy but things have taken a turn from a  star rating to now a  star all because of the shipping fiasco i have experienced this last week the first order i received in  days the nd order was ordered last wednesday and today is tuesday almost a week and the dog food still hasnt arrived i called customer service the other day and they refunded me money so i could buy a small bag of food to hold me over until the large bag arrives thats great but the money is taking its sweet time getting to my bank so this is added stress to my already stressful situation i called chewycom customer service today and they said the reason its taking so long for me to receive my order was because i ordered late wednesday and because their orders were backed up from the week before my order was delayed to be sent out until the following monday and then tuesday was the fourth of july so now here we are almost a week later and i am still waitingthe bottom line for me is because their orders were backed up that caused a domino effect my order was delayed a week and that now effects my dogs who are waiting for their food by profession i am a organization development consultant and i see this all the time you have a bottleneck in the way youre processing your orders and as a result you will lose customers like myself if you dont go back to the beginning and see where the problem areas are a process map may help you or a visual diagram mapping your entire process from the beginning when the order is placed to the end when the order is shipped to see where you need to implement improvementschanges report is this review helpful cool    steven   very fast shipping chewycom has fast shipping i rescued a  year old shepherd mix about  pounds from the spca of ga and needed some toys and treats ect and it was at my door in  days that is way i have a new order on the way thanks report is this review helpful cool    elizabethknigh   knowledgable friendly easy i spoke with aaron sp because i needed to return some dog food and wow what top notch service thanks so much for the food suggestions and making the return pleasant and easy we will definitely use chewy when we get
