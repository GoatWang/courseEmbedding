acquire an additional  dispensaries over the next  months the four facilities that are in the process of being acquired are modelled after those in denver colorado the four dispensary locations are in the following cities  fajardo which is a hub for boating and fishing and a launching port for islands vieques culebra the us virgin islands and the british virgin islands  carolina which is tourist center near puerto ricos international airport and home of top luxury hotels and casinos  dorado which is deemed to be an affluent residential area in puerto rico and lastly  san juan the capital of puerto rico and among the largest cruise destination ports we anticipate that all four dispensaries will be operational by july   it is anticipated that costs associated with operating the dispensaries will be approximately  per dispensary  of which will be used to obtain the license to operate  for operating capital  to complete the facility and for stock inventory we also anticipate requiring approximately  for working capital over the next twelve months the company anticipates earning revenue by selling medical marijuana edibles pills creams patches and oral drops and paraphernalia such as vaporizes the average net profit for medical marijuana dispensaries is  in the us according to a study conducted by marijuana business daily and the media annual revenue is  we aim to undercut our competition by acquiring our goods at a lower than average cost which we anticipate will allow us to achieve  net margins  higher than the industry average the four dispensaries the dispensaries that we are in the process of purchasing are located in the following areas which were chosen based on their strategic location relevant to important factors such as population density disposable income and proximity to key commercial and district tourist destinations  carolina the municipality of carolina is home to luis munos marin airport puerto ricos main airport with a population density of  carolina is a center of manufacturing and commerce the township has one of the islands largest shopping areas plaza carolina carolina also has a high concentration of young professionals whom industry trends suggest is a growing user class of medical marijuana carolina is also strategically located between san juan and the east coast of the island the east coast is home to many of the islands most spectacular beaches and a heavy tourist area  fajardo fajardo is located in the northeast coast of the island it is known for its luxury hotels such as the waldorf astoria and the puerto del rey marina while its population is only  it is the watersports capital of the island as well as the primary access point to the keys of puerto rico and the british and us virgin islands and thus is a popular tourist spot and a favorite vacation and recreational area for puerto rican citizens  dorado dorado situated  miles west of san juan is a township located on the north shore of puerto rico and the wealthiest community on the island with a population of approximately  people the municipalitys demographic consists of upperincome and retired residents as well as upperincome tourists it is also the home to several resort hotels such as embassy suites sheraton and the reserve at ritz carlton  san juan the capital of puerto rico is the cultural and historic center of puerto rico with the islands largest population center of  well known for the port at old san juan and cruise ships that bring thousands of tourists daily to the island the hotels beaches and points of interest in the area attract millions of visitors each year our goal in san juan is to create a flagship store to capitalize on the tourism in this area and build a large local following of patients business model we plan to operate as a service business specializing in the sale of medical marijuana edibles and paraphernalia including oils lotions thc pills vaporizers rigs grinders tshirts hats logo items and bongs and pipes with vaporizer attachments through our strategically located dispensaries in puerto rico we intend to purchase our products from the largest and most sophisticated grower on the island who operates a stateofthe art facility and currently has over  strands available and is able to produce up to  pounds a week we anticipate procuring products at a  discount to current wholesale market prices we anticipate that based on such prices we will realize gross margins of approximately  we intend to sell and keep inventory of the top  selling brands which will be determined by sales velocity we intend to use a stateofart crm to track our customers their buying habits and monthly spend customer segments will be categorized by age occupation and medical condition in addition we will focus on providing the best and most friendly customer service and provide the highest quality brands and widest variety possible in order to attract repeat business we expect to realize although no assurance can be given approximately  net margins on edibles with  net margins on edibles and paraphernalia revenue streams we anticipate that revenues will be generated from the following medical cannabis up to  strains in each dispensary derivatives oils lotions edibles thc pills paraphernalia vaporizers grinders rigs bongs and pipes with vaporizer attachments clothing hats tshirts logos cost structure we intend to price our product at below market rates however we intend to market certain items as boutique items such as gourmet  marketing our marketing and sales strategy will be aimed at generating longterm repeat customers as well as attracting tourists who visit the island who wish to purchase medical marijuana in order to generate repeat customers we intend to provide the highest quality medical marijuana at the lowest possible cost to insure we build a loyal customer base further we intend to train all of our employees to provide excellent customer service at this time puerto rico only allows digital advertising for medical marijuana thus we intend to leverage the internet and social media platforms including instagram facebook twitter youtube google  linkedin the yellow pages online yelp and over  marijuana websites we have identified our marketing will focus on the wide variety of our cannabis products and their high quality and low cost point relative to our competition we also intend to utilize blogs microads testimonial interviews articles and deploy this media across all social media channels and websites accessed by our customer targets capital requirements and use of proceeds on may   we completed the offering in which we sold to shares of our common stock and warrants to selected accredited investors for total gross proceeds of  the proceeds of which will be used for opening and the operation of our four  dispensaries as noted above we anticipate that the costs associated with opening and operating the dispensaries will  for each dispensary as follows   representing costs associated with obtaining the business license   for working capital for the next  months   to complete the build out of each dispensary and   for equipment and starting inventory it is also anticipated that the remainder from the proceeds received from the offering will be used for general working capital competition we face significant competition in all aspects of our business specifically we face competition from a number of companies that operate dispensaries in the legal cannabis market within the united states and us territories while such competition exists within the industry as a whole there is limited competition in puerto rico currently there are seven dispensaries with approved licenses in puerto rico and one of the seven is currently closed for lack of proper permits there are  prequalified dispensary licenses but it is expected that only  of those prequalified dispensary licenses will meet all the government criteria and will have the necessary funding to operate we also anticipate additional competition from the unauthorized sale and purchase of cannabis through the black market in puerto rico which is estimated by the government at  million annually while we deem the black market to be a major competitor we believe although no assurance can be given that we can transition those consumers by offering a greater variety of product at competitive prices competitive strengths consumers generally choose their dispensary based on several factors including proximity to where they live and work price quality variety and the overall service experience we believe that our advantage stems from our relationships with our supplier our supplier who operates a stateofthe art facility has over  strands available and can produce up to  pounds a week our supplier the largest in puerto rico in total production capacity has agreed to sell products to us at reduced prices which we believe will allow us to achieve  gross margins all while maintaining a major price advantage over competitors we also believe we possess certain other competitive strengths and advantages in the industries in which we operate range of services we are able to leverage our breadth of services and resources to deliver comprehensive integrated solutions to companies in the cannabis industryfrom operational compliance and marketing consulting to products security and financing services strategic alliances we are dedicated to growing through strategic acquisitions partnerships and agreements that will enable us to enter and expand into new markets our strategy is to pursue alliances with potential targets that have the ability to generate positive cash flow effectively meet customer needs and supply desirable products services or technologies among other considerations we anticipate that strategic alliances will play a significant role as more states pass legislation permitting the cultivation and sale of hemp and cannabis regulatory compliance the state laws regulating the cannabis industry are changing at a rapid pace currently there are  us states the district of columbia and the territories of guam and puerto rico that have created a legislative body to manage the medical cannabis industry eight of those states also allow recreational use we plan to take such steps necessary to ensure that all aspects of our operations are in compliance with all laws policies guidance and regulations to which we are subject and providing an opportunity to our customers and allies to use our services in order to ensure that they too are in full compliance are both critical components of our business plan industry knowledge we continue to create share and leverage information and experiences with the purpose of creating awareness and identifying opportunities to increase shareholder value our management team has business expertise extensive knowledge of the cannabis industry and closely monitors changes in legislation we intend to work with partners who will enhance the breadth of our industry knowledge lending capabilities in february  the treasury department issued guidelines for financial institutions dealing with cannabisrelated businesses nevertheless many banks and traditional financial institutions refuse to provide financial services to cannabisrelated businesses we plan to provide finance and leasing solutions to market participants using the fincen guidelines as a primary guide for compliance with federal law the cannabis industrymarket opportunity the legal cannabis markets in the united states are expanding rapidly there are now twentyeight states and washington dc with medical cannabis programs and eight of these states alaska california colorado maine massachusetts nevada oregon and washington plus washington dc have also legalized cannabis for recreational use we believe the market will continue to rapidly expand as existing states broaden the definition of the approved uses for cannabis ie from medicinal to recreational use and additional states legalize cannabis for at least some other purposes despite the fact that the federal controlled substances act makes the use and possession of marijuana illegal on a national level recent guidance from the federal government suggests that it will continue to tolerate legalization at the state level especially when backed by strong and effective regulation we believe it is significant that in  the congressional spending bill specifically prevented the justice department from spending money to enforce the federal ban on growing or selling cannabis in states where cannabis has been approved the company believes that not since the repeal of prohibition in  has a consumer product business opportunity of this magnitude been created simply by changes in the law according to an ibisworld report the cannabis industry is expected to achieve rapid growth over the next five years we believe the industry will continue to benefit from increasingly favorable attitudes towards medical cannabisbased treatments and applications as acceptance and legitimacy of cannabis continues to grow our target markets are those where states or us territories have legalized the production and use of cannabis such as puerto rico and eventually colorado according to published reports colorados cannabis industry reported estimated wholesale and retail sales during calendar years  and  of  million and  million respectively most recently voters in california nevada maine and massachusetts approved ballot measures to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use bringing the total number of states with legalized recreational cannabis use to eight in addition to the district of columbia as of december    us states the district of columbia and the territories of guam and puerto rico have legalized the use of cannabis for medical use in some form including five states in  alone while it is difficult to estimate the amount of time it would take for a state to establish regulations relating to the sale of cannabis or for those businesses engaged in this activity to begin generating revenue from operations we anticipate but no assurance can be given that for new states legalizing the medical use of cannabis revenues will begin to be realized in  and  continued development of the regulated cannabis industry depends on continued legislative authorization at the state level progress while encouraging is not assured and any number of factors could slow or halt progress in the cannabis industry puerto rico a unique market opportunity puerto rico benefits from a large and growing tourism industry according to an article published by travel pulse in march  and by prt newswire dated december  puerto ricos tourism doubled from  million visitors in  to  million in  importantly patients who hold a license to buy medical marijuana in the  states where it is now legal may use their patient license to purchase marijuana at puerto ricos dispensaries the academic sciences of puerto rico aspr in collaboration with the cannabis doctors of puerto rico conducted a certification program for doctors to obtain the health department hd license and recommended medicinal cannabis to nearly  patients based on such and considering that puerto rico is an island with a population of  million there is a potential market of  patients or  of puerto ricos current population in addition there is a potentially very large market opportunity presented by the burgeoning tourist industry if only  of the tourist visiting puerto rico purchase medical marijuana that would add another  patients on an annual basis or an average of approximately  patients per month we believe our initial locations present significant revenue potential and growth opportunity we have strategically picked our initial locations based on the following factors population density disposable income and proximity to commercial and districts tourist destinations medical cannabis market the last five years have seen a dramatic shift in public opinion on medical marijuana which is reflected in the direction of individual states toward legalization a quinnipiac poll published by politico on june   showed  of registered voters in the united states favor the use of medically prescribed cannabis twentyeight states and washington dc have enacted medical cannabis laws and there are approximately  million registered patients within these states the five states with the largest known current medical marijuana patient populations are california colorado michigan oregon and washington cannabis is used for medicinal purposes and has proven to be an effective treatment for pain relief inflammation and a number of other medical disorders according to an ibisworld report new medical research and changing public opinion have boosted industry growth doctors may prescribe legalized medical cannabis in approved states where patients can receive a recommendation from a stateapproved licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions specified by the state medical cannabis is being used to treat severe or chronic pain inflammation nausea and vomiting neurologic symptoms including muscle spasticity glaucoma cancer multiple sclerosis posttraumatic stress disorder anorexia arthritis alzheimers crohns disease fibromyalgia add adhd tourettes syndrome spinal cord injury and numerous other conditions cannabis oil has also been proven effective in treating epileptic seizures in children recreational cannabis market eight states have legalized recreational cannabis alaska california colorado maine massachusetts nevada oregon washington plus washington dc in november  colorado voters legalized recreational marijuana use this historychanging legislation created a window of opportunity for the commercialization and state taxation of a plant group that has until recently been virtually untouchable and has set the wheels in motion for other states to follow in july of  washington state launched its recreational program while oregon and alaska and the district of columbia voted to introduce recreational programs commencing in  in november  california maine massachusetts and nevada all passed ballot initiatives for the legalization of recreational cannabis a gallup poll survey from october  showed that  of americans are in favor of legalizing cannabis government and industry regulation cannabis is currently a schedule i controlled substance under the csa and is therefore illegal under federal law even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized to state law its use possession or cultivation remains a violation of federal law a schedule i controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the united states a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse the us department of justice the doj defines schedule i controlled substances as the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence if the federal government decides to enforce the csa in colorado with respect to cannabis persons that are charged with distributing possessing with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines andor terms of imprisonment the maximum being life imprisonment and a  million fine notwithstanding the csa as of the date of this filing  us states the district of columbia and the us territories of guam and puerto rico allow their residents to use medical cannabis voters in the states of alaska california colorado maine massachusetts nevada oregon and washington have approved ballot measures to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use such state and territorial laws are in conflict with the federal csa which makes cannabis use and possession illegal at the federal level in light of such conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis the previous administration under president obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by statedesignated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis for example the prior doj deputy attorney general of the obama administration james m cole issued a memorandum the cole memo to all united states attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the csa the cole memo ultimately emphasizes the need for robust state regulation of marijuana the memorandum rests on its expectation that state and local governments that have enacted laws authorizing marijuanarelated conduct will implement strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems that will address the threat those state laws could pose to public safety public health and other law enforcement interests in addition the financial crimes enforcement network fincen provided guidelines the fincen guidelines on february   regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabisrelated businesses consistent with their bank secrecy act bsa obligations additional existing and pending legislation provides or seeks to provide protection to persons acting in violation of federal law but in compliance with state laws regarding cannabis the rohrabacherfarr amendment to the commerce justice science and related agencies appropriations bill which funds the doj prohibits the doj from using funds to prevent states with medical cannabis laws from implementing such laws the rohrabacherfarr amendment is effective through april   but as an amendment to an appropriations bill it must be renewed annually the compassionate access compassionate access research expansion and respect states act the carers act has been introduced in the us senate which proposes to reclassify cannabis under the csa to schedule ii thereby changing the plant from a federally criminalized substance to one that has recognized medical uses more recently the respect state marijuana laws act of  has been introduced in the us house of representatives which proposes to exclude persons who produce possess distribute dispense administer or deliver marijuana in compliance with state laws from the regulatory controls and administrative civil and criminal penalties of the csa however as of the date of this filing neither the carers act nor the respect state marijuana laws act of  has been enacted the rohrabacherfarr amendment has not yet been renewed beyond april   and the new administration under president trump has not yet indicated whether it will change the previously stated policy of lowpriority enforcement of federal laws related to cannabis set forth in the cole memo or the fincen guidelines the trump administration could change this policy and decide to strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis any such change in the federal governments enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us while we do not currently harvest distribute or sell cannabis we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement policies of the federal government however once we commence operations we could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities a violation of federal law absent any future changes in cannabisrelated policies under the trump administration we intend to remain within the guidelines outlined in the cole memo and the fincen guidelines where applicable however we cannot provide assurance that we are in full compliance with the cole memo the fincen guidelines or any applicable federal laws or regulations licensing and local regulations where applicable we will apply for state licenses that are necessary to conduct our business in compliance with local laws local laws at the city county and municipal levels add a layer of complexity to legalized cannabis despite a states adoption of legislation legalizing cannabis cities counties and municipalities within the state may have the ability to otherwise restrict cannabis activities including but not limited to cultivation retail or consumption zoning sets forth the approved use of land in any given city county or municipality zoning is set by local governments or local voter referendum and may otherwise be restricted by state laws for example under certain state laws a seller of liquor may not be allowed to operate within  feet of a school there may be similar restrictions imposed on cannabis operators which will restrict where cannabis operations may be located and the manner and size to which they can grow and operate zoning can be subject to change or withdrawal and properties can be rezoned the zoning of our properties will have a direct impact on our business operations regulatory environment the regulatory status of the cannabis industry is shifting rapidly at the state level with momentum toward a change at the federal level through pressure on the us congress and the white house current federal regulations classify cannabis as a schedule  substance defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse this drug classification also includes heroin lsd and ecstasy the legal cannabis industry has evolved considerably over the past  years we believe the industry has reached the tipping point for legalization through pressure from citizens groups in individual states for the legalization of medical andor recreational marijuana as reported by pew research center in april  nearly half  of americans say they have tried marijuana and  have tried it within the past year in a national poll in october  by third way a public policy think tank  of respondents favored allowing individuals to use marijuana for medical purposes if recommended by a doctor this trend is further illustrated in recent surveys of public opinion for marijuana legalization rapidly outpacing opposition a majority of americans now favor broad legalization of marijuana opinions have changed drastically since  when gallup first asked the question and found that just  favored legalizing marijuana use compared to  as of june   showed  millennials currently  have been in the forefront of this change  favor legalizing marijuana use by far the highest percentage of any age group but across all generations – except for the silent generation ages   support for legalization has risen sharply over the past decade third way also found that  of respondents favor congress passing a bill giving states that have legalized marijuana a safe haven from federal marijuana laws so long as they have a strong regulatory system and when given an option of state or federal control  favor states control in deciding whether to legalize marijuana public support has given rise to the passage of new marijuana laws and regulations in a number of states as well as multiple legal reforms on legislative dockets each states legal environment is unique making it critical for businesses to know and understand the regulatory landscape on a statebystate basis another regulatory variable adding to the complexity of the legal cannabis market are the local laws at the municipality and county levels even when a state enacts legislation legalizing cannabis each level of local government has the right to exercise restrictions on cannabis activities such as retail consumption transportation and cultivation zoning is an area of particular concern which is set forth at the local level this can restrict where businesses can be located and the manner and size in which they operate understanding individual states laws and local regulations requires business operators and investors to account for multiple levels of regulatory compliance such as how marijuana may be sourced processed distributed and to whom where and how it may be sold state legal status while new statelevel legalization efforts continue to expand the number of states involved in the cannabis industry only a handful of existing states have any meaningful fullscale operations for the cultivation and distribution of cannabis this presents a significant growth opportunity for investment over the next several years as the existing legalized states and new states markets come online medical cannabis legalization –  states have legalized medical marijuana plus washington dc and the us territories of guam and puerto rico recreational cannabis legalization –  states ak ca co me ma nv or wa plus washington dc have passed laws that allow for adult recreational use of marijuana federal legal status cannabis is still classified as an illegal substance in the us the drug enforcement agency dea and the food and drug administration fda currently classify cannabis as a schedule  drug under the controlled substances act the classification makes cannabis illegal under federal law to cultivate manufacture distribute or possess cannabis and has created a discrepancy between states rights and federal law this discrepancy has created a complicated environment for cannabis businesses in regards to restrictive banking regulations interstate trade irs tax code and federal bankruptcy laws especially for companies that directly touch the plant such as growers and distributors for example fincen provided guidance regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabisrelated businesses consistent with their bsa obligations while we believe we do not qualify as a financial institution in the united states we cannot be certain that we do not fall under the scope of the fincen guidelines we plan to use the fincen guidelines as may be amended as a basis for assessing our relationships with potential tenants clients and customers as such as we engage in financing activities we intend to adhere to the guidance of fincen in conducting and monitoring our financial transactions because this area of the law is uncertain but expected to evolve rapidly we believe that fincens guidelines will help us best operate in a prudent reasonable and acceptable manner there is no assurance however that our activities will not violate some aspect of the csa if we are found to violate the federal statute or any other in connection with our activities our company could face serious criminal and civil sanctions additionally because the possession or distribution of cannabis violates federal law banks that provide services may face the threat of prosecution or sanctions and thus we may have difficulty acquiring or maintaining bank accounts and insurance and our stockholders may find it difficult to deposit their stock with brokerage firms the banking issues created by the federal laws have required the cannabis industry to focus on viable alternatives and have created opportunities for new providers from finance companies to security and software firms the issue of interstate trade requires companies that grow or distribute cannabis to duplicate efforts within each state they wish to legally operate and has limited the development of national brands these laws do not directly affect companies operating in ancillary businesses in february  the white house and the department of the treasury gave a roadmap for conducting transactions with cannabis companies operating within state regulations the most sweeping federal reforms to date however have come from congress in the federal spending bill that passed both houses in june  and continued in june  congress voted to protect state medical marijuana and hemp laws from federal interference and cut the deas budget as an example of increased support for the removal of federal laws banning medical marijuana the medical marijuanaprotecting amendment passed the house  and became law last year and was accepted by a larger  majority this year with even more republican members support the senate also introduced the compassionate access research expansion and respect states carers act in march  cosponsored by senator rand paul rky and now by  total us senators which seeks to drastically reduce the federal governments ability to crack down on statelegal medical marijuana programs open the banking system reclassify cannabis schedule  drug rating and encourage more research through several major changes in federal law this legislation currently is waiting for the senate judiciary chair to grant the bill a hearing ancillary cannabisrelated businesses as more states enact cannabis legislation the demand for cannabisrelated products and services grows the rapid expansion of the cannabis market combined with more sophisticated management teams and business models entering the market has spurred the development of numerous cannabisrelated niche markets these ancillary markets that do not physically touch the plant include infrastructure and support for the cannabis industry in such areas as social media security consulting delivery systems financial services software hightech electronic hardware infused products extracts oils hemp production ancillary cultivation solutions and retail as mentioned the federal government still classifies cannabis as a schedule  substance which leaves many traditional businesses fearing reputational and legal risks of serving the cannabis industry

legislation we also operate in an evolving industry that may not develop as expected furthermore our operations continue to evolve under our business plan as we continually assess new strategic opportunities for our business within our industry assessing the future prospects of our business is challenging in light of both known and unknown risks and difficulties we may encounter growth prospects in our industry can be affected by a wide variety of factors including competition from other similar companies regulatory limitations on the products we can offer and markets we can serve other changes in the regulation of medical and recreational cannabis use changes in underlying consumer behavior our ability to access adequate financing on reasonable terms and our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our operations challenges with new products services and markets and fluctuations in the credit markets and demand for credit we may not be able to successfully address these factors which could negatively impact our growth harm our business and cause our operating results to be worse than expected we may need to secure additional financing while we have raised funds that we believe will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months we anticipate that we may require additional funds for our operations in the future if we are not successful in securing additional financing when needed we may be unable to execute our business strategy which could result in curtailment of our operations our ability to raise additional capital is uncertain and dependent on numerous factors beyond our control including but not limited to economic conditions and availability or lack of availability of credit we currently do not have any committed external source of funds if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms we may not be able to among other things continue to expand our development sales and marketing teams acquire complementary technologies products or businesses if determined to be appropriate expand our global operations hire train and retain employees and respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities thenexisting stockholders interests may be materially diluted and the terms of such securities could include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect their rights as common stockholders debt financing and preferred equity financing if available may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specified actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures or declaring dividends cannabis remains illegal under federal law and any change in the enforcement priorities of the federal government could render our current and planned future operations unprofitable or even prohibit such operations we operate in the cannabis industry which is dependent on state laws and regulations pertaining to such industry however under federal law cannabis remains illegal the united states federal government regulates drugs through the controlled substances act the csa which places controlled substances including cannabis on one of five schedules cannabis is currently classified as a schedule i controlled substance which is viewed as having a high potential for abuse and having no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the united states no prescriptions may be written for schedule i substances and such substances are subject to production quotas imposed by the united states drug enforcement administration the dea because of this doctors may not prescribe cannabis for medical use under federal law although they can recommend its use under the first amendment currently  us states the district of columbia and the us territories of guam and puerto rico allow the use of medical cannabis voters in the states of alaska california colorado maine massachusetts nevada oregon and washington have approved ballot measures to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use such state and territorial laws are in conflict with the federal csa which makes cannabis use and possession illegal at the federal level because cannabis is a schedule i controlled substance the development of a legal cannabis industry under the laws of these states is in conflict with the csa which makes cannabis use and possession illegal on a national level the united states supreme court has confirmed that the federal government has the right to regulate and criminalize cannabis including for medical purposes and that federal law criminalizing the use of cannabis preempts state laws that legalize its use in light of such conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis the previous administration under president obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by statedesignated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis for example the prior doj deputy attorney general of the obama administration james m cole issued a memorandum the cole memo to all united states attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the csa the cole memo ultimately emphasizes the need for robust state regulation of marijuana the memorandum rests on its expectation that state and local governments that have enacted laws authorizing marijuanarelated conduct will implement strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems that will address the threat those state laws could pose to public safety public health and other law enforcement interests in addition the financial crimes enforcement network fincen provided guidelines the fincen guidelines on february   regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabisrelated businesses consistent with their bank secrecy act bsa obligations in  the united states house of representatives passed an amendment the rohrabacherfarr amendment to the commerce justice science and related agencies appropriations bill which funds the united states department of justice the doj the rohrabacherfarr amendment prohibits the doj from using funds to prevent states with medical cannabis laws from implementing such laws in august  a th circuit federal appeals court ruled in united states v mcintosh that the rohrabacherfarr amendment bars the doj from spending funds on the prosecution of conduct that is allowed by state medical cannabis laws provided that such conduct is in strict compliance with applicable state law in march  bipartisan legislation titled the compassionate access research expansion and respect states act the carers act was introduced proposing to allow states to regulate the medical use of cannabis by changing applicable federal law including by reclassifying cannabis under the controlled substances act to a schedule ii controlled substance and thereby changing the plant from a federallycriminalized substance to one that has recognized medical uses more recently the respect state marijuana laws act of  has been introduced in the us house of representatives which proposes to exclude persons who produce possess distribute dispense administer or deliver marijuana in compliance with state laws from the regulatory controls and administrative civil and criminal penalties of the csa although these developments have been met with a certain amount of optimism in the cannabis industry neither the carers act nor the respect state marijuana laws act of  have yet been adopted in addition the rohrabacherfarr amendment being an amendment to an appropriations bill that must be renewed annually has not been renewed beyond april   furthermore the ruling in united states v mcintosh is only applicable in the th circuit which does not include colorado the state where we currently primarily operate the new administration under president trump has not yet indicated whether it will change the previously stated policy of lowpriority enforcement of federal laws related to cannabis set forth in the cole memo or fincen guidelines the trump administration could change this policy and decide to strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis any such change in the federal governments enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us while we do not currently harvest distribute or sell cannabis we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement policies of the federal government additionally as we are always assessing potential strategic acquisitions of new businesses we may in the future also pursue opportunities that include growing and distributing medical or recreational cannabis should we determine that such activities are in the best interest of the company and our stockholders any such pursuit would involve additional risks with respect to the regulation of cannabis any potential growth in the cannabis industry continues to be subject to new and changing state and local laws and regulations continued development of the cannabis industry is dependent upon continued legislative legalization of cannabis at the state level and a number of factors could slow or halt progress in this area even where there is public support for legislative action any delay or halt in the passing or implementation of legislation legalizing cannabis use or its sale and distribution or the recriminalization or restriction of cannabis at the state level could negatively impact our business additionally changes in applicable state and local laws or regulations could restrict the products and services we offer or impose additional compliance costs on us or our customers and tenants violations of applicable laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations we cannot predict the nature of any future laws regulations interpretations or applications and it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be materially adverse to our business the cannabis industry faces significant opposition and any negative trends will adversely affect our business operations we are substantially dependent on the continued market acceptance and the proliferation of consumers of medical and recreational cannabis we believe that with further legalization cannabis will become more accepted resulting in a growth in consumer demand however we cannot predict the future growth rate or future market potential and any negative outlook on the cannabis industry may adversely affect our business operations large wellfunded business sectors may have strong economic reasons to oppose the development of the cannabis industry for example medical cannabis may adversely impact the existing market for the current cannabis pill sold by mainstream pharmaceutical companies should cannabis displace other drugs or products the medical cannabis industry could face a material threat from the pharmaceutical industry which is wellfunded and possesses a strong and experienced lobby any inroads the pharmaceutical or any other potentially displaced industry or sector could make in halting or impeding the cannabis industry could have a detrimental impact on our business we operate in a highly competitive industry the markets for ancillary businesses in the medical marijuana and recreational marijuana industries are competitive and evolving there is no material aspect of our business that is protected by patents copyrights trademarks or trade names and we face strong competition from larger companies that may offer similar products and services to ours many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories significantly greater financial marketing and other resources and larger client bases than us and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against these or other competitors given the rapid changes affecting the global national and regional economies generally and the medical marijuana and recreational marijuana industries in particular we may not be able to create and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace our success will depend on our ability to keep pace with any changes in our markets particularly legal and regulatory changes our success will also depend on our ability to respond to among other things changes in the economy market conditions and competitive pressures any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we may be unable to obtain capital to fully execute our business plan our business plan involves the acquisition of an additional  dispensaries over the next  month we anticipate that we will need additional capital in the future to fully execute our business plan however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on agreeable terms if at all and any future sale of our equity securities will dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders and could be at prices substantially below the price of the shares of common stock sold in the past if we are unable to obtain the necessary capital we may need to delay the implementation of or curtail our business plan we face risks associated with strategic acquisitions as an important part of our business strategy we intend to acquire additional dispensaries these acquisitions involve a number of financial accounting managerial operational legal compliance and other risks and challenges including the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations the applicable restrictions on cannabis industry and its participants may limit the number of available suitable businesses and dispensaries that we can acquire any acquired dispensary could underperform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable we may incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions acquisitions could cause our results of operations to differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in any given period or over the long term and acquisitions could create demands on our management that we may be unable to effectively address or for which we may incur additional costs additionally following any business acquisition we could experience difficulty in integrating personnel operations financial and other systems and in retaining key employees and customers our future success depends on our ability to grow and expand our customer base and operational territory our success and the planned growth and expansion of our business depend on our products and services achieving greater and broader acceptance resulting in a larger customer base and on the expansion of our operations into new areas and markets however there can be no assurance that customers will purchase our products or that we will be able to continually expand our customer base additionally if we are unable to effectively market or expand our product offerings we will be unable to grow and expand our business or implement our business strategy operating in new markets may expose us to new operational regulatory or legal risks and subject us to increased compliance costs we may need to modify our existing business model and cost structure to comply with local regulatory or other requirements facilities we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected revenue and profit levels on a consistent basis may have higher construction occupancy or operating costs and may present different competitive conditions consumer preferences and spending patterns than we anticipate any of the above could materially impair our ability to increase sales and revenue conditions in the economy the markets we serve and the financial markets generally may adversely affect our business and results of operations our business is sensitive to general economic conditions slower economic growth volatility in the credit markets high levels of unemployment and other challenges that affect the economy adversely could affect us and our customers and suppliers if growth in the economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period if there is a significant deterioration in the economy or such markets or if improvements in the economy do not benefit the markets we serve our business and results of operations could be adversely affected we depend on our management certain key personnel and board of directors as well as our ability to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel our future success depends largely upon the experience skill and contacts of our officers and directors and the loss of the services of these officers or directors may have a material adverse effect upon our business additionally shortages in qualified personnel could also limit our ability to successfully implement our growth plan as we grow we will need to attract and retain highly skilled experts in the cannabis industry as well as managerial sales and marketing security and finance personnel there can be no assurance however that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel our reputation and ability to do business may be negatively impacted by the improper conduct by our business partners employees or agents we depend on third party suppliers to produce and timely deliver our inventory products purchased from our suppliers are resold to our customers these suppliers could fail to produce products to our specifications or quality standards and may not deliver units on a timely basis any changes in our suppliers to resolve production issues could disrupt our ability to fulfill orders any changes in our suppliers to resolve production issues could also disrupt our business due to delays in finding new suppliers furthermore we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protects us from acts committed by our employees agents or business partners in violation of us federal or state laws any improper acts or allegations could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees if we do not effectively manage changes in our business these changes could place a significant strain on our management and operations our ability to grow successfully requires that we have an effective planning and management process the expansion and growth of our business could place a significant strain on our management systems infrastructure and other resources to manage our growth successfully we must continue to improve and expand our systems and infrastructure in a timely and efficient manner our controls systems procedures and resources may not be adequate to support a changing and growing company if our management fails to respond effectively to changes and growth in our business including acquisitions this could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition results of operations and future prospects catastrophic events may disrupt our business our inventory dispensaries and overall operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fires floods power losses telecommunications failures cyberattacks terrorist attacks acts of war human errors breakins and similar events additionally we rely on our thirdparty suppliers for our inventory  in the event of a catastrophic event we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions reputational harm delays in our product development and lengthy interruptions in our services breaches of data security and loss of critical data all of which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results any new or changes made to laws regulations rules or other industry standards affecting our business may have an adverse impact on our financial results we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business within the cannabis industry many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business in the united states cannabis is currently classified as a schedule i controlled substance under the csa and is therefore illegal under federal law even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized to state laws its use possession or cultivation remains a violation of federal law a schedule i controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the united states a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse the us department of justice the doj defines schedule i controlled substances as the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence notwithstanding the csa as of the date of this filing  us states the district of columbia and the us territories of guam and puerto rico allow their residents to use medical cannabis voters in the states of alaska california colorado maine massachusetts nevada oregon and washington have approved ballot measures to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use such state and territorial laws are in conflict with the federal csa which makes cannabis use and possession illegal at the federal level such conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis has created a complicated environment for cannabis businesses in regards to restrictive banking regulations interstate trade irs tax code and federal bankruptcy laws especially for companies that directly touch the plant such as growers and distributors for example since the possession or distribution of cannabis violates federal law banks that provide services may face the threat of prosecution or sanctions as a result of being denied banking services or direct access to conventional loans many of the companies that grow or distribute cannabis directly are forced to transact business on a cashonly basis the banking issues created by the federal laws have required the cannabis industry to focus on viable alternatives and have created opportunities for new providers from finance companies to security and software firms the issue of interstate trade requires companies that grow or distribute cannabis to duplicate efforts within each state they wish to legally operate and has limited the development of national brands if we are unable to raise capital or conduct operations as a result of various laws and regulations we may be unable to finance our activities which would have an adverse impact on our operations and financial results our success will be dependent on our ability to attract and retain key personnel we believe our success depends on the continued service of our management personnel and upon our ability to attract and retain qualified employees independent contractors and consultants the competition for qualified personnel is intense and the loss of key personnel or the inability to hire such personnel when needed could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition laws and regulations affecting the cannabis industry are constantly changing and this may affect our consumer base in ways that we are unable to predict local state and federal medical cannabis laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations we cannot predict the nature of any future laws regulations interpretations or applications that may affect us nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures when and if promulgated could have on the vitality of the cannabis legalization movement or the unification or popularity of the community in favor of legalization the members of which community form our anticipated consumer base and underpin our business model risks related to our common stock there is not an active liquid trading market for the companys common stock the companys common stock is quoted on the otc pink market under the symbol cyva however there has been minimal reported trading to date in the companys common stock and we cannot give an assurance that an active trading market will develop as a result investors may find it difficult to dispose of or to obtain accurate quotations of the price of our securities this severely limits the liquidity of the common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock a limited market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of capital stock and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or assets by using common stock as consideration if an active market for the companys common stock develops there is a significant risk that the companys stock price may fluctuate dramatically in the future in response to any of the following factors some of which are beyond our control variations in our quarterly operating results announcements that our revenue or income are below analysts expectations general economic slowdowns sales of large blocks of the companys common stock and announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts acquisitions strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the securities and exchange commission which may make it more difficult for stockholders to sell our common stock the sec has adopted rule g which establishes the definition of a penny stock for the purposes relevant to us as any equity security that has a market price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions for any transaction involving a penny stock unless exempt the rules require that a broker or dealer approve a persons account for transactions in penny stocks and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased in order to approve a persons account for transactions in penny stocks the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks the broker or dealer must also deliver prior to any transaction in a penny stock a disclosure schedule prescribed by the sec relating to the penny stock market which in highlight form sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination and that the broker or dealer received a signed written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction generally brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the penny stock rules this may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of the companys common stock if and when such shares are eligible for sale and may cause a decline in the market value of its stock because we became a public by means of a reverse acquisition we may not be able to attract the attention of brokerage firms because we became public through a reverse acquisition securities analysts of brokerage firms may not provide coverage of us since there is little incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock no assurance can be given that brokerage firms will want to conduct any secondary offerings on behalf of the company in the future applicable regulatory requirements including those contained in and issued under the sarbanesoxley act of  may make it difficult for the company to retain or attract qualified officers and directors which could adversely affect the management of its business and its ability to obtain or retain listing of its common stock we may be unable to attract and retain those qualified officers directors and members of board committees required to provide for effective management because of the rules and regulations that govern publicly held companies including but not limited to certifications by principal executive officers the enactment of the sarbanesoxley act has resulted in the issuance of a series of related rules and regulations and the strengthening of existing rules and regulations by the sec as well as the adoption of new and more stringent rules by the stock exchanges the perceived increased personal risk associated with these changes may deter qualified individuals from accepting roles as directors and executive officers further some of these changes heighten the requirements for board or committee membership particularly with respect to an individuals independence from the corporation and level of experience in finance and accounting matters we may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications if we are unable to attract and retain qualified officers and directors the management of its business and its ability to obtain or retain listing of our shares of common stock on any stock exchange assuming we elect to seek and are successful in obtaining such listing could be adversely affected voting power of our shareholders is highly concentrated in one shareholder peach management llc currently beneficially owns  of our outstanding common stock as well as one thousand  shares of series a preferred stock which entitles it to  of the voting power in addition to the certificate of designation for of the series a preferred stock the company is prohibited from designating any other class or series of preferred stock without first obtaining prior approval from the holder of the series a preferred stock such concentrated control of the company may adversely affect the price of our common stock a shareholder that acquires common stock will not have an effective voice in the management of the company we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future we have paid no dividends on our common stock to date and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future while our future dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of the business we currently anticipate that we will retain any earnings to finance our future expansion and for the implementation of our business plan a lack of a dividend can further affect the market value of our stock and could significantly affect the value of any investment in our company our stockholders may experience significant dilution we have a significant number of warrants to purchase our common stock outstanding the exercise of which would be dilutive to stockholders in certain instances the exercise prices are subject to adjustment if we issue or sell shares of our common stock or equitybased instruments at a price per share less than the exercise price then in effect in such case both the issuance and the adjustment would be dilutive to stockholders we may from time to time finance our future operations or acquisitions through the issuance of equity securities which securities may also have rights and preferences senior to the rights and preferences of our common stock we may also grant options to purchase shares of our common stock to our directors employees and consultants the exercise of which would also result in dilution to our stockholders our articles of incorporation allow for our board to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by our stockholders which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock our board of directors has the authority to issue upon obtaining prior consent from the holder of series a preferred stock up to  shares of our preferred stock without further stockholder approval as a result our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares together with a premium prior to the redemption of our common stock in addition our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our common stock or that is convertible into our common stock which could decrease the relative voting power of our common stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders although we have no present intention to issue any additional shares of preferred stock or to create any additional series of preferred stock we may issue such shares in the future as an issuer of penny stock the protection provided by the federal securities laws relating to forward looking statements does not apply to us although federal securities laws provide a safe harbor for forwardlooking statements made

protection in the event of any legal action based upon a claim that the material provided by us contained a material misstatement of fact or was misleading in any material respect because of our
