business faces and how those risks may be monitored and mitigated and assess on an ongoing basis the firm has in place controls and procedures necessary to manage those risks  the firm considers the following as key risks to its business operational risk – this risk covers a range of exposures including security breaches risk of clerical errors a breach of the fund’s investment objectives and the loss of key personnel operational risks and how they can be mitigated are assessed as part of the internal capital adequacy assessment process ”icaap” business risk – this risk includes a fall in assets under management due to market movements or internal factors such as poor investment decisions and a loss of reputation resulting in a reduction in fee income earned by the firm and hindering its ability to finance its operations and reimburse its expenses business risks are assessed and mitigated as part of the icaap market risk  the risk is the exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations due to investment management and performance fees being denominated in currencies other than sterling the firm operates currency bank accounts permitting it to receivepay currency directly credit risk – this risk relates to the exposure to the funds for nonpayment of management and performance fees and counterparty exposure relating to the firm’s bank balances and any other debtors this is

capital to support current and future activities this process includes an assessment of the specific risks to the firm the internal controls in place to mitigate those risks and an assessment of whether additional capital mitigates those risks the firm also considers a wind down scenario to assess the capital required to cease regulated activities we have not identified credit risk exposure classes or the minimum capital requirements for market risk as we believe that they are immaterial concerning pillar  it is the firm’s experience that the fixed overhead requirement establishes its capital requirements and hence market and credit risks are considered not to be material furthermore the market and credit risks component excludes such risks related to the management of alternative investment funds our capital requirements are currently £ the higher of the minimum capital calculated in accordance with either ‘pillar ’ or ‘own funds’ which is well within the level of regulatory capital held we consider this amount to be sufficient regulatory capital to support the business and have not identified any areas that give rise to a requirement to hold additional riskbased capital
