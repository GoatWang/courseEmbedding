accession number 98989 full text its been nearly  years since i graduated from medical school young and enthusiastic about an industry in which some of the brightest intuitive and hardworking individuals made their careers i subsequently returned to business school with the hope of applying some business acumen to health care and with the vision to help lead a flourishing industrynow that i have worked in the health care delivery industry for many yearsviewing it through both a clinical and business lensi have been consistently surprised with a single notion the health care delivery industry does not function as a service industry at all in fact in many respects health care has not applied many principles that other industries service or otherwise have used to improve their performancetunnel vision on qualityhistorically health care organizations relied on traditions of quality performance as their primary differentiating strategy in the marketplace at large conferences comprised of physicians from numerous organizations when asked what differentiates their organization from others the routine response is our organization is of higher quality than all otherswhat the health care delivery industry has yet to see is that clinical quality alone is not a sufficient differentiator despite the fact that our society is changing to one of enhanced consumerism intolerance for poor service and impatience many organizations continue to fall back on quality as their distinguishing feature as a result of health cares historical lack of focus on the service elements of its operations health care delivery is in fact a service industry that doesnt act like one when you consider the impeccable service offered by the ritz carlton by southwest airlines or by premium restaurants here in massachusetts and elsewhere the immaturity of health care is readily apparent by the realtime experiences patients suffer every day waiting six hours to be seen in emergency rooms waiting nine months to schedule a physical with a primary care physician even though a patient may have barely utilized any services that year playing phone tag incessantly with the doctors office to try to get through to schedule an appointment or seek advice waiting in queue in waiting rooms then in exam rooms and then again in the lab or pharmacy requiring patients to take a whole day off from work just to spend  minutes with the doctor receiving test results weeks after they are complete or never at all being treated by health care staff as if you are one on a long list to be seen that day rather than recognized as a customer to be treated with utmost courtesy respect and admirationthe need for changewhen fallon clinic in worcester mass conducted market research and focus groups with health care consumers and asked patients what they wanted from their health care providers the respondents rarely mentioned qualityillustration omittedinstead nearly  percent of all focus group participants highlighted improved customer service as the key opportunity for improvement among most providers when specifically asked about omission of a focus on quality patients responded by saying doctors have gone to medical school that requires hard work and dedication we presume most doctors will offer high quality carethis is not an unexpected response when you consider that quality is also assumed in other service industries for example is a travelers concern about arriving safely at a destination the major factor in a choice between us airways southwest airlines or american airlinesit is clear from a service perspective that health care is in great need of transformation as physicians and leaders of the health care industry we have been remiss in supplementing excellence in clinical quality with what consumers want service quality to put it another way patients expect that doctors will care for them but they want doctors and their staff to care about themsome physician groups have recognized that service orientation is important to patients and is an essential element of success one notable example is the emergence of concierge practices groups that offer sameday access for appointments 4hour oncall coverage for emergencies inviting environments and house calls all for a supplemental fee to doctors for providing these services the creation of such practices implies that good service in health care must come at a price this is definitely not sobeyond the notion of service orientation health care must transform in other ways applying the business principles and techniques long proven and used by other nonhealth care companiesfor example many physicians do not use or plan to use modern technologies such as electronic medical records thats surprising when you consider the emrs improve efficiency communication and safety likewise many of the delays and service problems in health care can be addressed and fixed through sophisticated process redesign most other industries have done it why not health carefallon clinics transformationfallon clinic embarked on a path of transformation to right some of these service deficiencies namely to transition our practice into a gold standard of health care delivery although steeped in a rich quality tradition and nationally recognized for excellence in clinical quality our organization realized that a tunnel vision focus on quality is not sufficient to achieve the gold standardemployees at fallon clinic scrutinized every element of its operational procedure and contractual relationships and embarked on a strategic transformation some of the key elements includeaccepting multiple insurersfor  years fallon clinic was nearly exclusive with fallon community health plan fchp with the exceptions of some contracts with indemnity insurers preferred provider organization ppo networks and cigna healthcare fallon clinic and fchp are strong partners however this exclusivity limited patient satisfaction for both organizationsat the clinic this led to discontinuity of care where patients were forced to break physician relationships as a result of insurance changes through their employer given the patient and physician dissatisfaction associated with these broken relationships fallon entered the first phase of the groups strategic transformation by accepting multiple insurersfallon physicians now see patients with multiple forms of insurance including blue cross blue shield of massachusetts harvard pilgrim health care fchp cigna private health care systems and othersfallon clinic received strong feedback from patients that contracting with other insurers was long overdue over the course of a fourmonth period nearly 8 blue cross blue shield patients joined fallon clinic either as firsttime patients or as patients returning to their former physiciansfocus on servicewhat patients wanted most from their doctors was to be treated as a customer ie to be listened to respected and treated as they would be treated at good hotels or restaurants with an understanding that the patient comes first fallon began asking our patients what they want fallon revised its patient satisfaction survey process and is now sending out weekly surveys to its patients to understand where the organization can make improvements a customer advisory board was also formed comprised of health care consumers who will help direct the practice toward those areas in greatest need of change fallon clinic is in the process of implementing a training program that mirrors those conducted at disney and the ritz carlton fallon is recruiting highquality doctors and staff who are extremely service orientedprocess reengineeringthrough its focus groups fallon learned that correcting appointment delays and telephone delays ran a close second when patients were asked what they wanted from health care the common misperception among patients is that physician offices are unable to improve access to care because of inadequate staff or too many patientsalternatively i would propose that the primary reasons for inability to improve access are process inefficiencies a business leader could spend years reviewing thousands of cases of companies that improved throughput and access delays by reengineering processes even the leaders of the ritz carlton attest that process improvements are the key to their successfallon is working to reengineer several processes to reduce wait time answer phone calls quickly with hold times of less than  seconds and develop a simplified scheduling process that includes treating some basic illnesses at home many fallon clinic primary care physicians can now see patients for routine physicals within 4 days some even the same dayuse of modern technologygiven the use of technology in most other industries the overwhelming absence of such technologies in health care delivery is remarkable fallon clinic recognizes that the use of cuttingedge technology is critical to process improvement service enhancement and patient safetyover the next two years the organization will invest in the following technologies upgraded electronic medical records full scale telephone system and voicemail upgrades voice recognition transcription and switchboard services filmless digital radiology allowing instantaneous xray image transmission to distant sites web enhancement including web visits for patients who prefer to communicate with their mds over the internet instead of through personal visits or the telephonefallons goal is to be on the leading edge of both patient care and customer servicerelated articleimagine a world where you awake in the morning realize you want a physical exam log on
