chfs looking for diogenes biotech midcap research analyst dividend investingsummarythis is a company with a long history of burning through cash with no visible results being obtainedits initial medical product has been placed on hold for further development due to their cash positionthe company is currently operating with a new business model based on a purchased product they obtained for  millionthe stock price is not sustainable at the current levelinvestment thesis in  bill withers recorded his song aint no sunshine the song quickly reached platinum sales at the time withers was working for an aerospace company in southern california his day job was making toilet seats for  airplanes the following information is about a company that has been in operation for many years but as of late they have taken the company in a new direction the product they were working on all this time they havent been successful in getting approved by the fda based on my research and reviewing the history and background it is my opinion that current or potential investors should not consider it a viable company for any investment dollars if one opts for being a contrarian to my opinion you might be flushing your money down the complete apparatus withers was involved with in  my opinion has no negative consideration for the management of this company my opinion relates only to the product the company initially was developing when the company was created and now the recently acquired product where they want to redirect their business model the name of the company is sunshine heart inc ssh company background sunshine is based in the minneapolis suburb of eden prairie minnesota the company was formed to work on developing a medical device to treat moderate to severe heart failure conditions heart disease is the major cause of death in our country so new and innovative treatment options are needed the product that sunshine was developing is known as the cpulse assist system that works as a counterpulsation in the heart this simply means their system involved placing a cuff around the outside of the aorta where the assist system would inflate and deflate the cuff thus impacting the rhythm with the natural heartbeat it was sunshines management belief that by applying a secondary pulse this would increase the hearts function in a person suffering from a condition were optimal functioning of their heart was declining it was hoped that the cpulse would assist the hearts function in areas like oxygenated blood flowing to blood vessels and the heart muscle would be improved basically a diseased heart would not have to work as hard in the process of pumping blood through the body if this could be accomplished it was felt this would also impact heart symptoms like shortness of breath dizziness fluid retention and a patients ability to do normal daytoday activities the following two illustrations show how the cpulse system would look when implanted into a patients body note in both pictures how the cuff is placed around the bodys major artery the aorta then notice the second lead wire placed over the left ventricle the pumping chamber for the heart this was to allow the heart to beat and then the cuff would inflate creating a second pulse of blood flow illustrations shared by sunshine however the best laid plans dont always turn out to provide the desired results and when applied to the area of medical science and product development the preclinical work can face an extraordinary number of problems when you read about a clinical trial in a peer journal you need to pay close attention to the safety section discussion my belief is that you dont want to see the opening sentence stating in general the implant was safe having an implant placed on your main artery with another lead wire placed on your left ventricle and then having someone describe this as generally safe doesnt give me a particularly good feeling toward my willingness for having this procedure done my further reluctance was enhanced when i saw the clinic trial involving  patients being screened for study inclusion  were confirmed eligible and implanted and  were considered as screen failures then from the  actual trial patients i note that  patients died within  months of the implant even when one considers the fact that these patients were suffering this debilitating and deadly disease the nature and cause of death by one of these patients is very troubling in my opinion this patient developed a procedurerelated sternal wound infection with the presence of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureusmrsa the infection was not resolved after several months of treatment it was then discovered that a fistula was attached from the sternum to the device cuffed to the aorta the patient was taken into surgery however during the procedure the individual suffered atrial and aortic tears in further documentation the trial results reflected the composite device related adverse event rate through  months was  the major cause being exit site infection rates of  current strategic realignment of the company on august   sunshine announced they had acquired the aquadex product line from an indirect subsidiary of baxter international nysebax this product serves as a temporary ultrafiltration treatment for fluid buildup where normal diuretic therapy hadnt resolved the patients issue and hospitalization is required this need is usually associated with preopt and postopt procedures for heart failure events sunshine purchased this product by paying baxter  million in cash and  million shares of sunshine stock if anyone wants to know the exact amount of the valuation attached to this purchase they might note at the time of the deal sunshines stock was trading for less than  for simplicity lets say baxter got  million in cash and stock valued at  million for a total of  million being the valuation for the deal on september  th  sunshine announced a strategic realignment of the company where they would focus all the companys resources on the aquadex flexflow®system this decision is further clarified where they announced they were pausing clinical evaluations for the neuromodulation technology based on these actions they anticipated they could cut their cash burn from  million per month from the fourth quarter of  to a targeted cash burn rate of  per month in the recently closed fourth quarter  basically they are hoping to cut their cash burn rate by  on a monthly basis how has the market reacted to this redirection in the company the stock closed today january  th  at  up  or  the trading volume for this date shares so from the purchase date of the aquadex product on august  th  when the stock was trading for less than a dollar great news  the stock is up more than x not exactly on january   where the stock traded as low as  per share they announced a  reverse split the stock opened the next day at  and has traded as high as  in the interim the outstanding number of shares is now a rather minuscule  shares simply meaning that today the entire outstanding number of shares were traded reality status why would a companys stock jump  today especially when they are cutting their operating expense budget by  issuing secondary stock on a constant basis and this being based on a product that baxter international basically gave them considering the total valuation of the deal was a mere  million in the announcement of the purchase sunshine projected they would attain a fourth quarter  annualized runrate for the aquadex business of  million and a fourth quarter  annualized revenue runrate of  million this is what i would label as irrational exuberance when you consider that sunshine purchased the product on august   and in their q  sec filings they reported they generated aquadex revenue totaling  if one applied this revenue rate over the full  rd quarter this would have generated approximately  in gross revenue when applying this current capture rate to a full calendar year this would generate about  in gross revenue now consider their  cut in operating expenses to  a month this means they will have operating expenses totaling  that needs to be covered by gross revenues of less than  at the end of q  they reported cash on hand totaled  after the end of q  on october rd they announce a secondary offering that netted them  based on this they would have held a total of  in operating cash based on the proposed burn rate of  per month this would imply that at the end of january  their cash position would be   minus  leaving a net of  simply meaning they will deplete their cash by the end of february to  therefore one should expect another dilution soon it is simply my opinion the lofty  valuation is merely smoke and mirrors my investing opinion if my projections are close to being the reality for aquadex revenues reinventing this company after years and millions of dollars spent for a product they have placed on hold for future clinical trials i would not be a purchaser of their stock as for my normal caveat i personally dont invest any of my investment dollars in short positions whether by shorting the common stock or having put options with margin accounts needed for one to short a stock in my opinion this is a foolish endeavor for the investor that isnt aware of the ability for day traders controlling the direction of a stock on a daily basis todays example of the entire number of outstanding shares having been traded with an increase in share prices by nearly  merely verifies this issue so be cautious with any trades long or short one should do their own personal due diligence that incorporates the criteria you personally apply in making your investment decisions my comments are strictly my opinion based on my interpretation of available data my input should merely be used as a starting point for your review and decision but if i might paraphrase the first line of withers aint no sunshine  aint no sunshine when your money is gone good luck with your future investing decisions disclosure iwe have no positions

shortterm momentum stock alertsno spam no hidden fees unsubscribe anytime cannabis sunshine heart inc nasdaqssh looking forward is key by chris sandburg posted on january   share tweet share share email comments sunshine heart inc nasdaqssh is a tricky one the company just effected a reverse split a split that was pretty much unavoidable but which has caused a rift among shareholders nonetheless and this split has come against a backdrop of some pretty underhand transactions with an employee owned investment fund called sabby management llc things are pretty opaque from a capital structure perspective and as usual in this sort of situation sentiment is taking a hit on the back of this opacity on the other side of the coin however sunshine heart has what looks to be a very effective cardiovascular asset which targets an area of considerable unmet need and – if new management is to be believed – the company is currently in a pivotal phase the other side of which is consistently growing revenues here is our take by way of a bit of background prior to mid the company was focused on the development of a heart failure device called cpulse the device looked promising but in order to get it to commercialization in the us sunshine heart would require millions of dollars and a large amount of investor patience as it pushed the device through trials at the end of  the thenceo resigned and a guy called john erb took over as interim a few months later in march  his role was made permanent fast forward to august and the company announced it had acquired a heart failure device from baxter international inc nysebax by way of an acquisition of the latter’s aquadex product line it was a  million acquisition so not a bank breaker but sunshine heart’s pps failed to respond finally in its most recent conference call third quarter  management announced that it was to stop the development of cpulse reportedly temporarily but for how long we don’t know in order to focus on the commercialization of aquadex this inflicted a blow to the company’s market cap since then some clarity has hit press regarding the above mentioned sabby group acquiring the equivalent of  underlying equity in sunshine heart through two preferred stock offers in july and october  and the company – as already discussed – has undertaken a  reverse what this one comes down to now is whether shareholders have faith in management’s belief that the dropping of the development product in favor of the commercialization of the approved asset is the right move for us it probably is with so much uncertainty surrounding capital structure and liquidity if there is one thing that sunshine heart needs right now it is some degree of stability an uninterrupted focus on fleshing out top line is the only real way to bring this stability to the table and it seems that therein lies the justification for the decision additionally if the company was to continue its cpulse development efforts shareholders would have likely ended up getting diluted to an even higher degree than they currently are being on the back of the numerous capital raises that a clinical development program in this sort of target indication necessitates financials aren’t great right now and we are probably going to see some degree of dilution nearterm anyway cash in hand came in at just short of  at september  and this won’t be enough to carry the company through anywhere near fy  with that said sunshine heart was able to report revenues for the first time in over a year during the third quarter reported at  which should take the edge off cash burn going forward bottom line here is that there still remains a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the stock but the reverse split was unavoidable and it is now a case of investors regrouping around what is essentially a fresh entity and basing valuation on the mediumterm sales prospects of baxter’s unloaded aquadex line applying this logic we think
