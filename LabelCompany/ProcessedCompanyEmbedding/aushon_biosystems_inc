revolutionizes protein biomarker research — combining elisa’s sensitivity and reproducibility with all the advantages of multiplexing only cira™ delivers on the promise of multiplexing’s throughput and affordability without compromising the sensitivity and consistency of singleplex elisa the cira™ immunoassay platform consists of the following products and services ciraplex® ultra ultrasensitive assay kits will enable researchers and clinicians to measure analytes at previously undetectable levels without giving up the precision and ease of use of our cira™ platform with total assay time of under three hours and the ability to read an entire well plate in under five minutes these assays are suitable for use in iarge clinical studies in addition these assays have a quantitative range of up to  logs enabling researchers to simultaneously measure both the high and low regions of the range for a single analyte ciraplex® assays utilize up to  analytes per well printed in a patentpending circular pattern this revolutionary assay technology provides consistent incubation with low sample volume enabling exceptional reproducibility a large menu of validated analytes across  species cirascan™ immunoassay system combines astronomygrade optics with sophisticated cirasoft™ software to enhance signaltonoise ratios for dramatically improved sensitivity dynamic range and
