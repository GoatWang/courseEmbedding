eroc this post discusses why common unit holders of eagle rock energy partners lp nasdaqeroc should vote no to the most recently proposed recapitalization we have set up a website at wwwfaireroccom where we explain why we believe unit holders should vote no that website discusses eroc’s current recapitalization proposal while this post discusses eroc’s background business and the stock’s potential total return if ngl prices stay roughly constant a copy of this post can be found on our blog at kerrisdalecapcomblogphp eagle rock energy partners lp trades under the ticker eroc on nasdaq eroc is an oil and natural gas mlp we are holders of eroc common units on january   eroc issued a preliminary proxy regarding a recapitalization transaction with its sponsor natural gas partners “ngp” and the transaction will likely be voted on by public common holders at some point in the next  months we urge common unit holders to vote no to the ngp proposal unless it is substantially modified this post will explain why we think the current transaction is adverse to common unit holders’ interests as well as discuss an investment in eroc in general we have set up a website at wwwfaireroccom where we explain why common holders should vote no to the current transaction if you are an eroc unitholder please distribute the link to other public holders the site and analysis will be updated as revised proposals or other relevant facts emerge accounts managed by kerrisdale currently hold eroc and we may buy or sell shares at any time we will not disclose our sale if and when we sell and we will not necessarily disclose that we have changed our thesis if we discover something faulty with our analysis at a later date our excel model historical financials and various eroc analyses can be downloaded here recapitalization eroc owns various oil and natural gas assets of both the midstream and upstream varieties and it suspended its dividend in early  due to declining commodity prices and a potential debt covenant breach in  the proposed recapitalization aims to reduce leverage to avoid a covenant default on wwwfaireroccom we explain why we believe eroc unit holders should vote no to the current proposed recapitalization on that site we go through three scenarios  no recapitalization  currently proposed recapitalization  a fair and appropriate recapitalization the aptly named “fair and appropriate recapitalization” is our preferred course it is very similar to the currently proposed recapitalization but removes a mm fee to eroc’s sponsor if the currently proposed transaction is rejected by unit holders we believe that the board of directors will be compelled to adopt a transaction very similar to our suggested “fair and appropriate recapitalization” if they don’t we think they would be potentially breaching their fiduciary duty and be exposed to lawsuits we are not going to rehash in this post our discussion of the recapitalization scenarios that is currently on wwwfaireroccom instead we’ll discuss eroc’s business and potential stock valuation business overview eagle rock energy partners lp is a master limited partnership engaged in three businesses i gathering compressing treating processing and transporting natural gas fractionating and transporting natural gas liquids “ngls” and marketing natural gas condensate and ngls which we will call its “midstream business” ii acquiring developing and producing interests in oil and natural gas properties which we call its “upstream business” and iii acquiring and managing fee mineral overriding royalty and royalty interests either through direct ownership or through investment in other partnerships which we call its “minerals business” excluding hedges the midstream upstream and minerals businesses accounted for   and  of  ebitda respectively the midstream business owns assets in five natural gas producing regions i the texas panhandle ii east texaslouisiana iii south texas iv west texas and v the gulf of mexico these five regions are productive mature natural gas producing basins that have historically experienced significant drilling activity as of  eagle rock’s natural gas gathering systems within these regions represent approximately  miles of natural gas gathering pipelines with approximately  well connections  natural gas processing plants with approximately  mmcfd of plant processing capacity and  horsepower of compression the midstream business averaged  mmcfd of gathered volumes and  mmcfd of processed volumes during  the upstream business has longlived high working interest properties located in four natural gas producing regions i southern alabama ii east texas iii south texas and iv west texas as of  these working interest properties included  operated productive wells and  nonoperated wells with net production of approximately  boed and proved reserves of approximately  bcf of natural gas  mmbbls of crude oil and  mmbbls of natural gas liquids of which  are proved developed producing the minerals business is likely to be sold so we are not going to focus on it we will however say that it is a valuable asset comprised of a portfolio of royalty interests in various productive wells in  states the segment will generate mm to mm of ebitda in  and keep in mind that  suffered from what could very well be trough energy prices as well  figures don’t include any lease bonuses rentals or other onetime bonus payments whereas  benefited from mm of such “recurring nonrecurring” bonus payments the minerals business has minimal capex  working capital uses at x trough cash flow we think that black stone is getting an excellent deal and they’ve aggressively pursued this asset ever since eroc first indicated it might sell the minerals division in the originally proposed restructuring ngp had arranged to purchase this business for mm an extremely low price but black stone’s persistence and unsolicited proposal shortly after the initial recapitalization announcement prompted the board to recommend selling it to black stone eroc was essentially created in  when natural gas partners a bn energyfocused private equity firm formed the partnership as a monetization vehicle ngp and management own the publicly traded partnership’s general partner all subordinated units and about  of the common units the general partner is entitled to an increasing share of cash flow as specific dividend benchmarks are met and these are captured through what are called “incentive distribution rights” after going public in  eroc completed more than half a dozen acquisitions totaling over  million including multiple deals involving oil and natural gas production assets and fee mineral and royalty interests as a result eroc has become a hybrid mlp with midstream natural gas assets upstream oil  gas assets and fee minerals  royalty interests the margins generated under some of eroc’s gathering and processing contracts particularly its keepwhole and percentageofproceeds contracts fluctuate based on the price of natural gas and ngls and in some cases the relationship between the price of natural gas and ngls its upstream assets are directly levered to energy prices eroc attempts to hedge its commodity price exposure through the use of various financial instruments in the second half of  the rapid decline of commodity prices had adverse impacts that ultimately led to a rise in forecasted leverage and a cut in the company’s unit holder distribution cash was redirected towards reducing debt per its partnership agreement when eroc suspends its common distribution all quarterly distributions under  per share are accumulated as arrearages the company must repay these arrearages to common holders before subordinated holders get any distributions because the company suspended its distribution in early   of arrearages have accumulated through to september   unless commodity prices surge subordinated holders are unlikely to receive any distributions over the next several years which explains ngp’s eagerness to do a deal that replaces their subordinated units with newly issued common units financials we have attached our quarterly excel model of eroc here please note that this is our internal model at kerrisdale capital using publicly available information and our own internal assumptions most notably our projections do not match the company’s projections our ebitda comes out higher than the company’s base standalone model as can be seen by the following comparison the differences are due to numerous reasons we don’t have any reason to believe that our model is more accurate than the company’s and really we build models to better understand the business drivers of our portfolio companies and are fully aware that our assumptions and profit forecasts may be wrong we don’t have access to the same detailed information as the company does nor have we spent as much time analyzing eroc’s underlying trends as its cfo has at the end of the day our ebitda forecasts are not terribly different from the company’s in our valuation analyses below we use the company’s projections valuation mlps trade on dividend yields to a large degree based on the company’s projections eroc would have mm of distributable cash flow in  and mm in  in a standalone base case if the transaction is approved  and  dcf would be mm and mm the dramatic difference in  is due to higher interest costs in the standalone case following a q  covenant breach based on the company’s assumption that interest rates would rise bps the company’s new distribution policy will establish a conservative baseline distribution that will be expected to be lower as a percentage of total distributable cash flow than many other mlps the rationale for this is that eroc’s underlying assets are exposed to more commodity price risk than other mlps the company has projected a  –  annualized distribution if the current transaction is approved in our analysis we assume that distributions begin at  rising to  in q and rising to approximately  –  in q these amounts are less than  of distributable cash flow in each relevant period in q we assume a distribution equal to  of distributable cash flow these are fairly conservative payout ratios if the recapitalization transaction is rejected and no modified recapitalization occurs we estimate a  cumulative year gain by purchasing eroc at monday’s closing price of  if management decides to reinstate a regular distribution at the approximate x leverage that the company would have at the end of  if the current recapitalization transaction is approved we estimate a  year total return if the currently proposed recapitalization is rejected and management chooses to do a modified recapitalization where they sell the minerals business and do a rights offering but don’t pay the unwarranted mm fee to ngp we estimate an  year total return for common unit holders commodity price risk eroc is a commodity business both the upstream and midstream businesses have exposure to energy prices and specifically eroc is highly levered to natural gas liquids prices ngls refer to ethane propane iso butane normal butane ethane and pentane and the pricing of these products drive the company’s earnings arguing that eroc should generate attractive returns as long as ngl prices stay constant is a bit like arguing that eroc should generate attractive returns as long as the coin i flip lands on heads forecasting the direction of the ngl price deck is tough unlike other commodities natural gas and crude oil that have a somewhat transparent relationship between supply and demand at least when compared to ngls fundamentals for natural gas liquids are driven by a complicated interplay of a host of hardtopredict factors ngl supply demand and prices are driven by markets that function independently of ngl fundamentals on the supply side ngl supply is largely a function of the quality and level of natural gas production rather than being responsive to ngl demand this is because ngls must be extracted from natural gas in order to meet pipeline specifications in contrast domestic demand for ngls can fluctuate based on a number of drivers including the overall demand by petrochemical companies which is driven by economic activity ngl exports which are driven by ethylene production levels abroad and global demand for ethylene derivative products and the economics of using a light nglbased versus a heavy crude oil based feedstock in petrochemical steam crackers to produce ethylene and other products all of this said ngl prices have historically been driven by crude oil prices moreso than the overall supply  demand dynamics of the ngl market according to a wachovia report in april  “cracking the code on natural gas liquids” ngl prices exhibit a higher correlation to crude oil prices than to ngl supply and demand imbalances wachovia tracked benchmark ethane and wti prices since  and noticed a  correlation between the price of ethane and crude oil the reason is that lightfeed ngl components compete with crude oil feedstocks naphtha and gas oil in the petrochemical industry which is the primary end market for ngls if oil prices increase  other crude refinery byproducts like naphtha and gas oil will follow directionally and as those byproducts become more expensive relative to ngls ethylene producers will opt for a higher percentage of ngls in their feedstock mix and ngl prices will rise and vice versa eroc’s upstream business is also tilted towards oil vs natural gas with more than  of  upstream gross profit coming from oil and ngls on the natural gas side eroc’s natural gas short position is generally offset by its gross profit from the natural gas production in its upstream business so it’s really oil  ngl pricing that drives eroc’s earnings the question of whether crude trades at  vs  vs  a barrel in  will probably have a bigger impact on eroc’s stock performance than how investors vote on the current recapitalization in its crudest form pardon the pun an investment in eroc is just one of many ways to invest in oil conclusion common unit holders should vote no to the current recapitalization proposal outlined in the january   proxy legal this communication is for informational
