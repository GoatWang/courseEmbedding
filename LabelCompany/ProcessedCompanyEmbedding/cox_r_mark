more than  years between  and  the business gets its name from leroy roy m cox the founder roy cox started lm cox manufacturing co inc who later became cox hobbies inc and then cox products before being sold to estes industries when it became cox models on february   estes industries stopped producing cox engines and sold all of their remaining inventory ie mainly spare parts to several private buyers from canada and usa one of the new owners of the remaining cox engine and parts inventory has launched a website cox international with online store millions of engines were produced and they

of model engines were the brain child of entrepreneur leroy roy m cox cox manufacturing started out in leroys garage in  where he made wooden pop guns for kids and employed local housewives to assemble them metal was scarce due to the war which is why the toy guns were made of wood in  metal became readily available again and competitors quickly moved into the market making their metal pop guns cheaper so roy moved to something else making metal tether cars for kids in august  a fire in coxs garage forced him to move to newer and larger premises at  poinsettia ave santa ana california in  cox developed a racing car which used an engine manufactured by cameron brothers the cars sold for  and generated  in sales in their first year of production in  cox developed their own engine for their racing tether car which included some parts from mel andersons spitzy engine this engine was called the o forty five as it was  cubic inch displacement in  with sales of the car proving to be a success cox moved on to development of a model plane engine roy felt the need for dependable easytostart engines and spent the better part of the year  in research actually  months his three man engineering crew himself mark mier and bill fogler spent  days a week day and night to develop the ‘ space bug’ contest engine the end result was the space bug  contest engine coxs first model plane engine which was completed in october  in  first name change was made to lm cox manufacturing company inc the space bug engine sets the scene for all the cox engines that followed and it went into full production in  this engine was so popular that it caused problems for other model engine manufacturers in  cox produced their first ready to fly rtf airplane the td which was powered by the space bug engine in  leroy cox lm cox manufacturing is sued by jim walker american junior aircraft co for copyright infringement because cox was using walkers patented bellcrank system in the td and secondly because walker believed the cox skylon reel was a copy of his ureely control handle the court case lasted for  years in  cox wins the court case against jim walker walkers patent on the bellcrank control system is ruled void and invalid because it was determined that the system had been designed before walkers patent and by someone else  a man named oba stclair who was the first man to fly a control line airplane in the usa back in  and the design was published in  oba stclair had shown his design to jim walker who took it upon himself to patent the design the court also ruled that the cox reel was not a copyright infringement in  cox developed the babe bee  designed by william bill selzer which had an extruded aluminum crankcase not cast like the others this engine sold for just  and stamped the final nail in the coffin of many competitors whose engines were selling for substantially more the babe bee was a high quality high precision engine which started easily and was very reliable unlike some of the competition in  cox took over the flying circle at disneyland which was a major coup for the company the model planes were being flown each day in front of tens of thousands of people and they had a hobby shop right there full of cox rtf planes the cox flying circle  remained in operation until  when it was closed to make way for expansion of tomorrowland in  cox hired an engineer named bill atwood who had already build his own line of engines to develop a new  cubic inch engine atwood was also responsible for the tee dee and medallion line of engines these engines put cox on the map as a leading engine in the world for many years to come in  due to continuing growth the company moved to larger  square feet facilities which were three times larger than the old site shortly thereafter cox got into slot cars and focused attention on gearing up for this fad  cox international is established in hong kong to meet the demands of the slot car craze  the slot car fad ends leaving cox with excess stock that cannot be sold resulting in financial cash flow problems in  leroys wife myrtle died and leroy was having health problems of his own so he retired and sold the company to leisure dynamics inc leisure dynamics continued to expand the range of cox model aircraft as well as adding trains boats rockets kites and radio control boosting sales to  million dollars per year roy cox retired with the distinction of being the worlds most successful model engine manufacturer in  william h selzer was appointed as president of lm cox manufacturing inc a subsidiary of leisure dynamics in  leisure dynamics breaks the company in two and moves the model production to minnesota and leaves the engine production in santa ana california in  leisure dynamics changes the company name to cox hobbies inc in  leisure dynamics filed for bankruptcy taking cox hobbies inc with them in  leroy roy m cox died sept  age  in  former cox engineer and president bill selzer whom cox hired in  purchased the company out of bankruptcy all manufacturing was returned to santa ana the company once again flourished into the s with new products being added and another move to even bigger facilities in  cox hobbies moved to new facilities at corona california in  the company name changed again to cox products the pee wee babe bee and pt  trainer still in production in  cox celebrated  years and introduced some new engines and rtf models in  cox sold to estes industries  centuri corp and moved to penrose colorado things changed quite considerably from here on cox as the hobbyists of the world knew it had gone the high reputation cox engines had declined one by one each product item was withdrawn from sale as stock ran out engine parts from different engines were mixed and matched making hybrid engines that performed very poorly compared to the cox engines from previous years estes added new products to the cox line using the cox name however these were electric radio control models some of which were known to explode resulting in a massive product recall by the company in  an online company calling themselves cox hobby distributors owned by estes industries appeared selling rc and electric products and some of the classic engines and rtf models however as each item from the classic era sold out it wasnt replaced in feb  estes industries sold all of their remaining classic cox stock to several private buyers one of them being a small company from canada in june  they launched a website cox international to sell their remaining stock online and also via ebay in jan  estescox corporation purchased by hobbico based in champaign illinois in  cox international continue to revive the classic cox brand as well as introducing new engine versions spare parts and accessories the enginesedit cox  engine specifications all cox  engines bore  inches  mm stroke  inches  mm displacement  cubic inches  cc borestroke ratio  oversquare cox  engine specifications bore  inches  mm stroke  inches  mm displacement  cubic inches  cc borestroke ratio  oversquare the cox  engine is a stroke internal combustion glow plug engine these engines use a glow plug to heat the fuelair within the cylinder to start once running it is disconnected and operates in the same manner as a diesel engine the self ignition is due to the heat produced from the compression of the airfuel mix and the catalytic reaction of the platinum element in the glow plug and the methanol in the fuel and does not depend in any way upon the continued use of the battery fuel intake to the engine is controlled by a simple needle valve and venturi system fuelair mixture intake to the crankcase is controlled via a reed valve or rotary valve depending on the engine design in a reed valve engine the valve is drawn open by suction as the piston moves upward on the compression stroke as the piston moves down on the power stoke the pressure in the crankcase causes the reed valve to close the fuel air mixture in the crankcase is then forced past the piston via the transferbypass ports in the cylinder one characteristic of a reed valve is that the engine will run in either direction an advantage for a pusher model but a disadvantage if the engine is finger started as it may start in the wrong direction the cox engines employed a starting spring which kept fingers free of the propellor and generally ensured correct rotational direction on rotary valve engines the process is similar except instead of a reed a rotary valve is used incorporated in the crankshaft which opens and closes as the piston moves up and down the rotary valve is more efficient and adjustable at design time as there is a larger and clearer path to the crankcase than in the reed valve setup but such engines can run in only one direction pusher configurations require a special propeller sometimes difficult to find the fuel used to power the engine is called model engine fuel a mixture of methanol  castor oil  and nitromethane  the cox line of reed valve engines designed prior to  used a rear reed valve induction system in the late s they played around with rear rotary valve induction as used in the rr before moving forward with front rotary valve induction for their tee dee and medallion lines early enginesedit cox thimble drome space bug  o forty five power pak special racer car engine pp  manufactured  this engine was the first designed by cox but included some major parts ie piston and cylinder of the spitzy  engine designed by mel anderson it employed a twin reed valve which was later used for the space bug the engine was a major engineering achievement for its time by incorporating reduction gears fuel tank flywheel and muffler all into one power pak the air intake was via one of the axles  o sixty power pak special racer car engine   manufactured  when slightly more power was needed for the thimble drome special car to obtain more speed a slightly larger version of the  was ordered with a bigger bore making the displacement  cubic inches  space bug cat  manufactured  the space bug was the first engine built entirely by cox it was designed for control line flying use only and was marketed as a competition engine and sold for  back then there was no market for radio control and free flight hadnt been considered by cox at this time the piston and cylinder were made from mild steel bar stock and the crankcase and fuel tank were cast aluminum  thermal hopper cat  manufactured  the thermal hopper is basically a space bug without the fuel tank it has a needle valve and venturi mounted on an aluminum plate instead these were designed for free flight and could also be used for control line flying it allowed the user to put a fuel tank of their choosing on the engine output was recorded at  bhp   rpm with a torque of  ozin at  rpm cox thimble drome thermal hopper  space bug jnr cat  manufactured  the space bug junior is a space bug with a smaller plastic tank this cheaper version also only had one intake bypass port and sold for   strato bug cat  manufactured  basically the same engine as a space bug but included a two piece fuel tank which was cheaper to make than the original space bug tank the tank itself is turned aluminium while the tank back is red yellow or blue plastic from the space bug junior but is modified to include an aluminium pickup tube and a larger hole to expose the venturi that is integral to the aluminium tank the later babe bee tank was simply a further developed version of this tank this engine was only produced during  and sold as a mid range sport engine for  as such not many exist today which makes them very rare and collectible selling for over us in  and  in  beware of fakes some unscrupulous sellers have been selling fake strato bugs that have a cnc machined tank and a space bug junior backplate standard beesedit cox babe bee left golden bee right  babe bee  cat  manufactured nov jan  the classic babe bee was the first engine cox produced with an extruded machined anodized bar stock aluminum crankcase this crankcase was machine made and was much cheaper and faster to make than the cast aluminum crankcase of the earlier models this engine was also supplied in thousands of rtf ready to fly airplanes sold in department stores worldwide it has an integrated cc fuel tank max output power was recorded around  bhp  watts   rpm on  nitro  pee wee  cat  manufactured feb jan  buoyed with excitement of the babe bee  leroy wanted to make a half size version of the babe bee so he did and they called it a pee wee  just like a babe bee only half the size  golden bee cat  manufactured oct jan  custom built golden bee  the golden bee is a baby bee that has a larger cc stunt vented fuel tank and has been anodized gold the larger tank allowed the planes to fly longer while the stunt vents allowed the airplanes to fly inverted without fuel running out or the engine cutting out the first versions of the golden bee had a single bypass intake port but later versions had two bypass ports making them slightly more powerful  qz cat  manufactured  qz stands for quiet zone it is a babe bee with a muffler twin bypass port cylinder with no sub piston induction and a high compression  glow head an attempt to regain the power loss caused by the muffler very similar to the later qrc engine which reportedly worked better cox also sold the muffler cylinder and high comp glow head components of the qz as a muffler conversion kit cat for   qrc cat  manufactured  the qrc was a modified babe bee engine that had a muffler and larger cc fuel tank in the s noise became an issue and the cox engineers discovered that when adding a muffler the engine would lose significant power this problem was alleviated by installing a cylinder with no sub piston induction the engine was designed for power launching radio controlled gliders and had a red tank with a blue spinner  rc bee cat  manufactured  this engine was designed for small radio controlled model planes it has a plastic clunk tank and an unusual cast crankcase the leisure dynamics team thought that cast crankcases would be cheaper to produce however they discovered that there were many manufacturing defects and they were difficult to machine resulting in a high failure rate so they returned to the tried and proven machined aluminum bar stock crankcase  dragon fly cat  manufactured  this engine was designed for the radio controlled model planes it is basically a baby bee with a clunk tank and a muffler throttle  texaco cat  manufactured  the is engine was designed for a texaco rc duration competition the engine has an additional fin on the larger glow plug which dissipates heat better allowing the engine to swing a larger propeller ie  or  inches this engine has a red cc fuel tank and a black crankcase original  engines did not come out with  fin glow plug the  fin glow plug came later in the  catalog  texaco jnr cat  manufactured  the same engine as the texaco above except that it has a smaller cc fuel tank which is also red first appeared in  cox catalog highperformance beesedit  rr cat  manufactured  the rare cox rr the rr uses a rear rotary valve intake rather than a reed valve in an attempt to achieve more power the engine came after the babe bee and looks very similar with its anodized machined extruded aluminum crank case and fuel tank the power improvement was negligible so cox reverted to the cheaper easier to build babe bee the engine was made for quite a few years and sold for  a left and right hand rotary valve was made as were left hand x glass filled nylon props for the rr some versions have a blue tank others have a clear anodized tank there were two versions of the tank back as well to fit the corresponding tank it has become a collectors item due to its uniqueness and pretty colors and is worth around  in   space hopper cat  manufactured nov  the space hopper was coxs first attempt at a beam mount high performance reed valve engine plus the first steps towards their greatest engine the tee dee series the engine was basically like the thermal hopper was to a space bug that is a babe bee without a tank but a venturi and needle valve relying on an external fuel tank the engine looks similar to the sportsman engine with a machined aluminium crankcase and rear induction via a reed valve with the needle valve assembly and venturi similar in appearance to the later tee dee series this engine was short lived and made way for the tee dee in  due to their similarities to the tee dee that followed some of the parts crossed over from this engine to the tee dee they look very retro and due to their apparent rareness are worth around us in  cox black widow  black widow cat  manufactured may jan  during the s a couple of cox engineers were playing around with different coloured babe bee and golden bee parts and came up with an allblack engine with a red spinner they hopped it up a bit with a dual bypass cylinder from a super bee  a black golden bee tank and a slightly larger  venturi intake the black widow was born these engines were marketed as a high powered combat engine on later black widows the red rubber spinner was replaced by a red anodized aluminum tee dee style spinner in the late s some black widows were produced with the a dual bypass slit exhaust cylinder the slit exhaust was to prevent fires according to an aeromodeller engine test done in august  the black widow on  nitro output power was  bhp  watts at  rpm with a max torque of  ozin at  rpm  killer bee  cat  manufactured  the killer bee was an attempt at making a fast reed valve  engine from information that had been learned over the years of racing and competition it had a tapered cylinder with spi and lighter piston similar to the tee dee a stronger balanced crankshaft and a new reed valve shape they had a yellow plastic needle valve later in  estes produced a killer bee that had none of these features but looked like the original killer bee except for the needle valve beware of fakes some unscrupulous people are producing fakes and selling them check to make sure the engine is the real deal before purchasing  killer bee  cat  manufactured  the killer bee  existed so that modellers could fly the same plane in two competition classes ie a and a simply by changing the engine this engine has exactly the same performance as the  there is a legend that two thin lines or grooves in the piston skirt are for positive identification but this is incorrect the grooves were intentionally designed to bleed off just enough power so that the  increase in displacement does not necessitate trim changes to a free flight model when switching the model from an  to the  to fly in the higher a class the benefit of the grooves as a visual identifier was accidental  venom cat  manufactured  cox venom with galbreathnelson head the venom was coxs last attempt at making a really fast  mouse racing engine again taken from ideas learned from years of competition this engine put all those ideas into an off the shelf product it used the killer bee crank shaft loosely fitted into the crankcase and a cylinder with porting very similar tee dee cylinder and tapered like the tee dee and with a lightened piston like the tee dee the rest of it was like a black widow the problem was that the production engine was not the same as the prototype a mistake had been made in manufacturing and the piston was lightened too much this made the engine fast but the piston weak and they would blow the top off the piston after a few runs at high speed as such only  were made and they never bothered to make any more because of that and all the fakes they are not worth a lot of money  beware of fakes some unscrupulous people are producing fakes and selling them check to make sure the engine is the real deal before purchasing tee deesedit the famous cox tee dee  and   tee dee  cat  manufactured nov jan  the tee dee is coxs most famous engine this engine was dominant in competition for many years it was designed by bill atwood who had been hired by cox specifically to produce the tee dee line of competition engines the important features of the tee dee are as follows tapered cylinder and a lightened and tapered piston result tighter piston fit at tdc and less piston mass two deep bypass ports with two bypass booster grooves known as side flutes on each bypass port extending slightly above the main bypass groove result significantly better air fuel mixture induction true peripheral venturi result more efficient fuel intake fuel draw and induction precision balanced and milled crankshaft result better fuel intake better balanced engine the tee dee was tested by aeromodeller magazine in  and the output power was recorded to be  bhp  watts   rpm with a max torque of  ozin at  rpm on  nitro note the modern norvel ame  engine which has an aluminum piston running in a ceramic coated cylinder outputs  bhp  watts  rpm in  the bypass porting crank shaft timing and venturi were modified slightly and a mesh screen was added to the venturi to keep out dirt this resulted in a minor performance improvement over the earlier versions a hopped up cox tee dee   tee dee  cat  manufactured oct jan  the  was simply a class a version of the engine physically the same on the outside only the bore was different and the piston had a small groove in the skirt to bleed off just enough power to exactly equal an  so no trim changes would be required to free flight models citation required this groove also visually differentiates the  from the  but this was of secondary importance the  also had a red carb body  tee dee  rc cat  manufactured  this engine had a proper rc carby and a full sized standard muffler and was designed specifically for rc flying it had no sub piston induction only two production runs of  each were done so there are only  of these in existence making them the second rarest production engine next to the venom note although the box said tee dee  the engine is actually  a cox tee dee  rc an  rc version also exists cat   manufactured  also  tee dee      cox also built tee dees in  cat  cat  cat and  cat size all these engines were very successful the original tee dee  immediately became the engine to use in fai ff with vastly higher performance than the olympic which had supplanted the european diesels used at the time they proved fragile particularly the thinwall cylinder and ballandsocket connecting rod and were replaced by beefedup versions as noted below one of the things cox wanted atwood to do was make him a  engine cox had already tried to halve the size of the pee wee  but couldnt get it to run for some reason the suspicion surrounded a problem with the tiny reed valve atwood found that the front rotary valve worked well on the  size hence the  was born medallionsedit  medallion  cat  manufactured nov jan  cox medallion  also known as the poor mans tee dee these were similar to the tee dee in appearance but had cheaper parts on them making them cheaper to buy the cylinder was a non tapered twin bypass with no boost ports like the one used on the black widow the crank shaft was drilled out rather than milled like the tee dee and the carb body was a one piece unit with a conventional needle valve and spray bar these engines were marketed as a sport  stunt engine as they were much tamer and much less cantankerous than the tee dee these are a great reliable easy to use little engine even today they can be purchased for under us in  rc versions of this engine were also produced with exhaust throttle ie  cat and the  cat with mufflerthrottle  medallion    the medallion engine was also produced in cat and cat  cubic inch size there were also rc versions of these ie cat medallion  rc and cat medallion  rc  medallion  manufactured  cox medallion  this particular  came about when a special order for  medallions was placed on cox by the national free flight society in the usa it was a gentlemans agreement done on a handshake and it nearly didnt happen when cox was sold to estes but the determination of the nffs resulted in the deal happening however estescox only came through with  engines the nffs engraved each engine with a serial number and kept a record of who purchased each engine these are probably the rarest of all cox engines due to the small size of the production run these engines have a unique piston and cylinder setup that occurs on no other cox engine before or after the cylinder has a straight bore  inches slit exhaust no sub piston induction product enginesedit these are all variations of the baby bee with different backplates and other parts designed for different rtf aircraft cars and boats there were literally hundreds of different models with subtle differences listed below are just a few of the more common ones  super bee cat  babe bee with twin bypass cylinder to give more power for the p warhawk rtf model early version had p stamped on the cylinder it had a standard babe bee tank  silver bee cat  similar to the super bee but it had a larger cc nonvented fuel tank it did not have p stamped on the cylinder but it did have the twin bypass ports this engine came with the spitfire rtf airplane  series x product engine catx manufactured  to  babe bee type engine with postage stamp type delrin backplate and brass needle valve instead of the integral babe bee fuel tank various shapes were used depending on the model they were fitted to each time they made a modification for a new model that was built a new cat number was produced eg  some had dual bypass port cylinders while others had single it depended on the airplane eg jud stuka p bendix racer p mustang  miss america models  series x product engine catx manufactured  to  babe bee type engine with horseshoe type delrin backplate and brass needle valve the horseshoe backplate had additional mounting holes drilled in the plate allowed fitting to after market and kit aircraft various shapes and colours were produced depending on the model they were fitted to some had dual bypass port cylinders while others had single it depended on the airplane eg sopwith camel fokker dvii me super stunter pt trainer and others produced in the mid s  series x product engine catx manufactured  to  similar in appearance to the  series engine produced for the  wings series of air craft ie hustler mantis f eagle and f falcon air planes  series   spook product engine cat came on a blister pack as a two ninety replacement engine basically a replacement  engine an aluminium back plate was used for the spook flying wing combat model kit engine   surestart cat another variation of the modern babe bee these were pretty good because they have a choke tube attached to the grey plastic backplate the choke tube makes the engine even easier to start they were fitted to the very last rtfs eg pt and hyper viper before they went out of production original equipment manufacturer oem enginesedit over the years some cox model engines were sold to other companies for use in their products and sold under the other companies names examples of these companies were testor corporation sanwa  kyosho of japan johannes graupner of germany jerobee industries trading as jomac products lite machine corporation kenbrite corp australia and tissan haifa in israel of all of the above mentioned companies only tissan haifa assembled their own engines called the banana  all the rest used motor manufactured by cox themselves  cox banana  cat this engine looked like a standard product engine with plastic backplate it also had a spring starter red aluminium spinner and the fuel intake tube was extended below the plastic backplate cox also supplied a specially printed banana  box insert to fit their standard box other cox enginesedit cox conquest  free flightcontrol line engine other engines made by cox are  sportsman  cat  manufactured  rear reed valve

cat  manufactured  this engine took over from the tee dee  as the cox engine for fai racing combat and free flight for many more years until the russian aac engines came along this engine was patterned on the australian designed  taipan cc twin ball race engine by gordon burford the entire top end of the cox conquest and the taipan tbr are interchangeable the taipan tbr was based on the rossi mkii so the top end is also interchangeable with a rossi mkii also came in rc version cat  as a result of reorganisation within leisure dynamics who owned cox and kb at the time production of this engine was handed over to kb and it became known as the kb conquest after  production continued for a number of years when the engine was sold to mecoa owned by randy linsalato where it continued on as the rjl conquest for some time  cox conquest   prototyped only samples do exist and the conquest  was a grown up version of the conquest  however due to reorganisation with leisure dynamics who owned cox and kb at the time it was decided not to commence production as kb already had a  sized engine in the market  queen bee  rccat  manufactured  rear reed valve rc engine uses a standard glow plug power output is similar to tee dee  came out mid  and is listed in cox  catalog cylindersedit there was a wide range of cylinders produced with three different wall thicknesses most are interchangeable between all engine types which can create problems when buying a used engine all early cylinders had a thin wall which was later found to need improvement because they bent easily in a

early engines that were produced before  had a light alloy piston rod which is retained in its socket by a slotted steel retaining cup which in turn is held in place by a steel circlip located in a shallow groove in the interior piston wall this arrangement known as a threepiece piston was abandoned as of  in favour of a hardened steel rod which was swaged into a bearing cup formed integrally in the piston interior the advantage of this latter setup was that it simplified assembly and the bearing could be reset to take up play using a suitable reset tool to reswage the cup the engines that used the earlystyle threepiece piston are any engines produced prior to  ie space bug space bug jnr thermal hopper and strato bug since the space bug space bug jr and thermal hopper where produced up until  you will find versions of these early engines around with the laterstyle pistons and cylinders cox reset tool the post piston is coated with copper on the inside and top this was done to prevent the nitrile hardening process from hardening the ball socket joint area the outside wall of the piston was then finely machined and polished to produce a chromed appearance piston  conrod ball socket joint free playedit sometimes especially with engines that have had a lot of use the piston  conrod ball socket joint is very loose and will adversely affect performance a cox “reset” tool available for the    and the  series engines is used to tighten the ball joint back up again the correct free play is  to  inches the  engines use a wrist pin so a socket reset tool is not required for these crankshaftsedit babe bee left  killer bee right on the bee engines there were  types of crankshaft produced and theyre interchangeable all bees with the exception of the killer bee and venom had the same crankshaft that was only good for about  rpm before the conrod pin would break off the killer bees and venom had a heavy duty balanced and lightened crankshaft that improved performance and could withstand speeds in excess of  rpm a company named davis diesel development in the usa also make a similar crankshaft called a killer crank for their diesel conversions they found under the heavier torque loads caused by running diesel fuel that the pins would break also hence they produced their own killer crank the same killer cranks are now being produced again by cox international on the tee dees and medallions the cranks are also interchangeable but quite different the tee dee has a large square hole at the intake end of the crank whereas the medallion has a smaller round hole the timing is also different on the later td rc versions the crankshaft is lightened and strengthened similar to the killer bee crank ie ground away and hole in conrod pin glow headsedit cox glow

at high revs but to do this plenty of nitromethane is also required for example a  x  prop with  nitro texaco engines are designed to use bigger props eg x fueledit the highest performance is achieved with fuel of  or more nitro content at least  oil  castorsynthetic is recommended acceptable performance can be had without nitromethane although the engine will be very sensitive to needle adjustments making it more difficult to operate with high nitromethane nitro fuel it may be necessary to lower the compression by installing up to six or more additional head gaskets when using castor oil it is advisable to clean the engine cylinder wall with a scotchbrite pad to remove castor oil varnish buildup that will occur especially after lean running this buildup of varnish will cause the engine to run inconsistently to avoid this problem it is advised to use a synthetic oil or synthetic and castor oil blend synthetic oil contains detergents that will keep the cylinder wall clean however these small engines do rely on some castor oil buildup to maintain high compression at higher running temperatures using clean fuel and keeping everything clean and free from dust and dirt particles is also very important for consistent running in an engine of such small size as these cox fuel formula fuel name methanol nitromethane castor oil klotz oil glow power     flight power

at the time cox developed the first cox engines they were used in control line and free flight model planes as there was no market for throttled radio control engines back then radio control although first developed in the s it was not available for model airplanes until the s and did not become economically viable for small model planes until the mids and even then was for the modelers who could afford it it was certainly out of reach of the hands of most children from the mids cox produced throttle control devices for some of their engines however these were not as effective as throttles on other brand engines as the cox throttle worked by restricting exhaust flow exhaust throttles were produced for most bee and all medallion engines but not tee dee in  cox produced an engine with a true throttleable rc carburetor and that engine was the queen bee  in  cox produced the tee dee  and  both of which had a conventional rc carburetor with adjustable airbleed and a full muffler in  an after

when it became cox models on february   estes industries stopped producing cox engines and sold all of their remaining inventory ie mainly spare parts to several private buyers from canada and usa one of the new owners of the remaining cox engine and parts inventory has launched a website cox international with online store millions of engines were produced and they became the most common a class

child of entrepreneur leroy roy m cox cox manufacturing started out in leroys garage in  where he made wooden pop guns for kids and employed local housewives to assemble them metal was scarce due to the war which is why the toy guns were made of wood in  metal became readily available again and competitors quickly moved into the market making their metal pop guns cheaper so roy moved to something else making metal tether cars for kids in august  a fire in coxs garage forced him to move to newer and larger premises at  poinsettia ave santa ana california in  cox developed a racing car which used an engine manufactured by cameron brothers the cars sold for  and generated  in sales in their first year of production in  cox developed their own engine for their racing tether car which included some parts from mel andersons spitzy engine this engine was called the o forty five as it was  cubic inch displacement in  with sales of the car proving to be a success cox moved on to development of a model plane engine roy felt the need for dependable easytostart engines and spent the better part of the year  in research actually  months his three man engineering crew himself mark mier and bill fogler spent  days a week day and night to develop the ‘ space bug’ contest engine the end result was the space bug  contest engine coxs first model plane engine which was completed in october  in  first name change was made to lm cox manufacturing company inc the space bug engine sets the scene for all the cox engines that followed and it went into full production in  this engine was so popular that it caused problems for other model engine manufacturers in  cox produced their first ready to fly rtf airplane the td which was powered by the space bug engine in  leroy cox lm cox manufacturing is sued by jim walker american junior aircraft co for copyright infringement because cox was using walkers patented bellcrank system in the td and secondly because walker believed the cox skylon reel was a copy of his ureely control handle the court case lasted for  years in  cox wins the court case against jim walker walkers patent on the bellcrank control system is ruled void and invalid because it was determined that the system had been designed before walkers patent and by someone else  a man named oba stclair who was the first man to fly a control line airplane in the usa back in  and the design was published in  oba stclair had shown his design to jim walker who took it upon himself to patent the design the court also ruled that the cox reel was not a copyright infringement in  cox developed the babe bee  designed by william bill selzer which had an extruded aluminum crankcase not cast like the others this engine sold for just  and stamped the final nail in the coffin of many competitors whose engines were selling for substantially more the babe bee was a high quality high precision engine which started easily and was very reliable unlike some of the competition in  cox took over the flying circle at disneyland which was a major coup for the company the model planes were being flown each day in front of tens of thousands of people and they had a hobby shop right there full of cox rtf planes the cox flying circle  remained in operation until  when it was closed to make way for expansion of tomorrowland in  cox hired an engineer named bill atwood who had already build his own line of engines to develop a new  cubic inch engine atwood was also responsible for the tee dee and medallion line of engines these engines put cox on the map as a leading engine in the world for many years to come in  due to continuing growth the company moved to larger  square feet facilities which were three times larger than the old site shortly thereafter cox got into slot cars and focused attention on gearing up for this fad  cox international is established in hong kong to meet the demands of the slot car craze  the slot car fad ends leaving cox with excess stock that cannot be sold resulting in financial cash flow problems in  leroys wife myrtle died and leroy was having health problems of his own so he retired and sold the company to leisure dynamics inc leisure dynamics continued to expand the range of cox model aircraft as well as adding trains boats rockets kites and radio control boosting sales to  million dollars per year roy cox retired with the distinction of being the worlds most successful model engine manufacturer in  william h selzer was appointed as president of lm cox manufacturing inc a subsidiary of leisure dynamics in  leisure dynamics breaks the company in two and moves the model production to minnesota and leaves the engine production in santa ana california in  leisure dynamics changes the company name to cox hobbies inc in  leisure dynamics filed for bankruptcy taking cox hobbies inc with them in  leroy roy m cox died sept  age  in  former cox engineer and president bill selzer whom cox hired in  purchased the company out of bankruptcy all manufacturing was returned to santa ana the company once again flourished into the s with new products being added and another move to even bigger facilities in  cox hobbies moved to new facilities at corona california in  the company name changed again to cox products the pee wee babe bee and pt  trainer still in production in  cox celebrated  years and introduced some new engines and rtf models in  cox sold to estes industries  centuri corp and moved to penrose colorado things changed quite considerably from here on cox as the hobbyists of the world knew it had gone the high reputation cox engines had declined one by one each product item was withdrawn from sale as stock ran out engine parts from different engines were mixed and matched making hybrid engines that performed very poorly compared to the cox engines from previous years estes added new products to the cox line using the cox name however these were electric radio control models some of which were known to explode resulting in a massive product recall by the company in  an online company calling themselves cox hobby distributors owned by estes industries appeared selling rc and electric products and some of the classic engines and rtf models however as each item from the classic era sold out it wasnt replaced in feb  estes industries sold all of their remaining classic cox stock to several private buyers one of them being a small company from canada in june  they launched a website cox international to sell their remaining stock online and also via ebay in jan  estescox corporation purchased by hobbico based in champaign illinois in  cox international continue to revive the classic cox brand as well as introducing new engine versions spare parts

bore  inches  mm stroke  inches  mm displacement  cubic inches  cc borestroke ratio  oversquare the cox  engine is a stroke internal combustion glow plug engine these engines use a glow plug to heat the fuelair within the cylinder to start once running it is disconnected and operates in the same manner as a diesel engine the self ignition is due to the heat produced from the compression of the airfuel mix and the catalytic reaction of the platinum element in the glow plug and the methanol in the fuel and does not depend in any way upon the continued use of the battery fuel intake to the engine is controlled by a simple needle valve and venturi system fuelair mixture intake to the crankcase is controlled via a reed valve or rotary valve depending on the engine design in a reed valve engine the valve is drawn open by suction as the piston moves upward on the compression stroke as the piston moves down on the power stoke the pressure in the crankcase causes the reed valve to close the fuel air mixture in the crankcase is then forced past the piston via the transferbypass ports in the cylinder one characteristic of a reed valve is that the engine will run in either direction an advantage for a pusher model but a disadvantage if the engine is finger started as it may start in the wrong direction the cox engines employed a starting spring which kept fingers free of the propellor and generally ensured correct rotational direction on rotary valve engines the process is similar except instead of a reed a rotary valve is used incorporated in the crankshaft which opens and closes as the piston moves up and down the rotary valve is more efficient and adjustable at design time as there is a larger and clearer path to the crankcase than in the reed valve setup but such engines can run in only one direction pusher configurations require a special propeller sometimes difficult to find the fuel used to power the engine is called model engine fuel a mixture of methanol  castor oil  and nitromethane  the cox line of reed valve engines designed prior to  used a rear reed valve induction system in the late s they played around with rear rotary valve induction as used in the rr before moving forward with front rotary valve induction for their tee dee and medallion lines early enginesedit cox thimble drome space bug  o forty five power pak special racer car engine pp  manufactured  this engine was the first designed by cox but included some major parts ie piston and cylinder of the spitzy  engine designed by mel anderson it employed a twin reed valve which was later used for the space bug the engine was a major engineering achievement for its time by incorporating reduction gears fuel tank flywheel and muffler all into one power pak the air intake was via one of the axles  o sixty power pak special racer car engine   manufactured  when slightly more power was needed for the thimble drome special car to obtain more speed a slightly larger version of the

only and was marketed as a competition engine and sold for  back then there was no market for radio control and free flight hadnt been considered by cox at this time the piston and cylinder were made from mild steel bar stock and the crankcase and fuel tank were cast aluminum  thermal hopper cat  manufactured  the thermal hopper is basically a space bug without the fuel tank it has a needle valve and venturi mounted on an aluminum plate instead these were designed for free flight and could also be used for control line flying it allowed the user to put a fuel tank of their choosing on the engine output was recorded at  bhp   rpm with a torque of  ozin at  rpm cox thimble drome thermal hopper  space bug jnr cat  manufactured  the space bug junior is a space bug with a smaller plastic tank this cheaper version also only had one intake bypass port and sold for   strato bug cat  manufactured  basically the same engine as a space bug but included a two piece fuel tank which was cheaper to make than the original space bug tank the tank itself is turned aluminium while the tank back is red yellow or blue plastic from the space bug junior but is modified to include an aluminium pickup tube and a larger hole to expose the venturi that is integral to the aluminium tank the later babe bee tank was simply a further developed version of this tank this engine was only produced during  and sold as a mid range sport engine for  as such not many exist today which makes them very rare and collectible selling for over us in  and  in  beware of fakes some unscrupulous sellers have been selling fake strato bugs that have a cnc machined tank and a space bug junior backplate standard beesedit cox babe bee left golden bee right  babe bee  cat  manufactured nov jan  the classic babe bee was the first engine cox produced with an extruded machined anodized bar stock aluminum crankcase this crankcase was machine made and was much cheaper and faster to make than the cast aluminum crankcase of the earlier models this engine was also supplied in thousands of rtf ready to fly airplanes sold in department stores worldwide it has an integrated cc fuel tank max output power was recorded around  bhp  watts   rpm on  nitro  pee wee  cat  manufactured feb jan  buoyed with excitement of the babe bee  leroy wanted to make a half size version of the babe bee so he did and they called it a pee wee  just like a babe bee only half the size  golden bee cat  manufactured oct jan  custom built golden bee  the golden bee is a baby bee that has a larger cc stunt vented fuel tank and has been anodized gold the larger tank allowed the planes to fly longer while the stunt vents allowed the airplanes to fly inverted without fuel running out or the engine cutting out the first versions of the golden bee had a single bypass intake port but later versions had two bypass ports making them slightly more powerful  qz cat  manufactured  qz stands for quiet zone it is a babe bee with a muffler twin bypass port cylinder with no sub piston induction and a high compression  glow head an attempt to regain the power loss caused by the muffler very similar to the later qrc engine which reportedly worked better cox also sold the muffler cylinder and high comp glow head components of the qz as a muffler conversion kit cat for   qrc cat  manufactured  the qrc was a modified babe bee engine that had a muffler and larger cc fuel tank in the s noise became an issue and the cox engineers discovered that when adding a muffler the engine would lose significant power this problem was alleviated by installing a cylinder with no sub piston induction the engine was designed for power launching radio controlled gliders and had a red tank with a blue spinner  rc bee cat  manufactured  this engine was designed for small radio controlled model planes it has a plastic clunk tank and an unusual cast crankcase the leisure dynamics team thought that cast crankcases would be cheaper to produce however they discovered that there were many manufacturing defects and they were difficult to machine resulting in a high failure rate so they returned to the tried and proven machined aluminum bar stock crankcase  dragon fly cat  manufactured  this engine was designed for the radio controlled model planes it is basically a baby bee with a clunk tank and a muffler throttle  texaco cat  manufactured  the is engine was designed for a texaco rc duration competition the engine has an additional fin on the larger glow plug which dissipates heat better allowing the engine to swing a larger propeller ie  or  inches this engine has a red cc fuel tank and a black crankcase original  engines did not come out with  fin glow plug the  fin glow plug came later in the  catalog  texaco jnr cat  manufactured  the same engine as the texaco above except that it has a smaller cc fuel tank which is also red first appeared in  cox catalog highperformance beesedit  rr cat  manufactured  the rare cox rr the rr uses a rear rotary valve intake rather than a reed valve in an attempt to achieve more power the engine came after the babe bee and looks very similar with its anodized machined extruded aluminum crank case and fuel tank the power improvement was negligible so cox reverted to the cheaper easier to build babe bee the engine was made for quite a few years and sold for  a left and right hand rotary valve was made as were left hand x glass filled nylon props for the rr some versions have a blue tank others have a clear anodized tank there were two versions of the tank back as well to fit the corresponding tank it has become a collectors item due to its uniqueness and pretty colors and is worth around  in   space hopper cat  manufactured nov  the space hopper was coxs first attempt at a beam mount high performance reed valve engine plus the first steps towards their greatest engine the tee dee series the engine was basically like the thermal hopper was to a space bug that is a babe bee without a tank but a venturi and needle valve relying on an external fuel tank the engine looks similar to the sportsman engine with a machined aluminium crankcase and rear induction via a reed valve with the needle valve assembly and venturi similar in appearance to the later tee dee series this engine was short lived and made way for the tee dee in  due to their similarities to the tee dee that followed some of the parts crossed over from this engine to the tee dee they look very retro and due to their apparent rareness are worth around us in  cox black widow  black widow cat  manufactured may jan  during the s a couple of cox engineers were playing around with different coloured babe bee and golden bee parts and came up with an allblack engine with a red spinner they hopped it up a bit with a dual bypass cylinder from a super bee  a black golden bee tank and a slightly larger  venturi intake the black widow was born these engines were marketed as a high powered combat engine on later black widows the red rubber spinner was replaced by a red anodized aluminum tee dee style spinner in the late s some black widows were produced with the a dual bypass slit exhaust cylinder the slit exhaust was to prevent fires according to an aeromodeller engine test done in august  the black widow on  nitro output power was  bhp  watts at  rpm with a max torque of  ozin at  rpm  killer bee  cat  manufactured  the killer bee was an attempt at making a fast reed valve  engine from information that had been learned over the years of racing and competition it had a tapered cylinder with spi and lighter piston similar to the tee dee a stronger balanced crankshaft and a new reed valve shape they had a yellow plastic needle valve later in  estes produced a killer bee that had none of these features but looked like the original killer bee except for the needle valve beware of fakes some unscrupulous people are producing fakes and selling them check to make sure the engine is the real deal before purchasing  killer bee  cat  manufactured  the killer bee  existed so that modellers could fly the same plane in two competition classes ie a and a simply by changing the engine this engine has exactly the same performance as the  there is a legend that two thin lines or grooves in the piston skirt are for positive identification but this is incorrect the grooves were intentionally designed to bleed off just enough power so that the  increase in displacement does not necessitate trim changes to a free flight model when switching the model from an  to the  to fly in the higher a class the benefit of the grooves as a visual identifier was accidental  venom cat  manufactured  cox venom with galbreathnelson head the venom was coxs last attempt at making a really fast  mouse racing engine again taken from ideas learned from years of competition this engine put all those ideas into an off the shelf product it used the killer bee crank shaft loosely fitted into the crankcase and a cylinder with porting very similar tee dee cylinder and tapered like the tee dee and with a lightened piston like the tee dee the rest of it was like a black widow the problem was that the production engine was not the same as the prototype a mistake had been made in manufacturing and the piston was lightened too much this made the engine fast but the piston weak and they would blow the top off the piston after a few runs at high speed as such only  were made and they never bothered to make any more because of that and all the fakes they are not worth a lot of money  beware of fakes some unscrupulous people are producing fakes and selling them check to make sure the engine is the real deal before purchasing tee deesedit the famous cox tee dee  and   tee dee  cat  manufactured nov jan  the tee dee is coxs most famous engine this engine was dominant in competition for many years it was designed by bill atwood who had been hired by cox specifically to produce the tee dee line of competition engines the important features of the tee dee are as follows tapered cylinder and a lightened and tapered piston result tighter piston fit at tdc and less piston mass two deep bypass ports with two bypass booster grooves known as side flutes on each bypass port extending slightly above the main bypass groove result significantly better air fuel mixture induction true peripheral venturi result more efficient fuel intake fuel draw and induction precision balanced and milled crankshaft result better fuel intake better balanced engine the tee dee was tested by aeromodeller magazine in  and the output power was recorded to be  bhp  watts   rpm with a max torque of  ozin at  rpm on  nitro note the modern norvel ame  engine which has an aluminum piston running in a ceramic coated cylinder outputs  bhp  watts  rpm in  the bypass porting crank shaft timing and venturi were modified slightly and a mesh screen was added to the venturi to keep out dirt this resulted in a minor performance improvement over the earlier versions a hopped up cox tee dee   tee dee  cat  manufactured oct jan  the  was simply a class a version of the engine physically the same on the outside only the bore was different and the piston had a small groove in the skirt to bleed off just enough power to exactly equal an  so no trim changes would be required to free flight models citation required this groove also visually differentiates the  from the  but this was of secondary importance the  also had a red carb body  tee dee  rc cat  manufactured  this engine had a proper rc carby and a full sized standard muffler and was designed specifically for rc flying it had no sub piston induction only two production runs of  each were done so there are only  of these in existence making them the second rarest production engine next to the venom note although the box said tee dee  the engine is actually  a cox tee dee  rc an  rc version also exists cat   manufactured  also  tee dee      cox also built tee dees in  cat  cat  cat and  cat size all these engines were very successful the original tee dee  immediately became the engine to use in fai ff with vastly higher performance than the olympic which had supplanted the european diesels used at the time they proved fragile particularly the thinwall cylinder and ballandsocket connecting rod and were replaced by beefedup versions as noted below one of the things cox wanted atwood to do was make him a  engine cox had already tried to halve the size of the pee wee  but couldnt get it to run for some reason the suspicion surrounded a problem with the tiny reed valve atwood found that the front rotary valve worked well on the  size hence the  was born medallionsedit  medallion  cat  manufactured nov jan  cox medallion  also known as the poor mans tee dee these were similar to the tee dee in appearance but had cheaper parts on them making them cheaper to buy the cylinder was a non tapered twin bypass with no boost ports like the one used on the black widow the crank shaft was drilled out rather than milled like the tee dee and the carb body was a one piece unit with a conventional needle valve and spray bar these engines were marketed as a sport  stunt engine as they were much tamer and much less cantankerous than the tee dee these are a great reliable easy to use little engine even today they can be purchased for under us in  rc versions of this engine were also produced with exhaust throttle ie  cat and the  cat with mufflerthrottle  medallion    the medallion engine was also produced in cat and cat  cubic inch size there were also rc versions of these ie cat medallion  rc and cat medallion  rc  medallion  manufactured  cox medallion  this particular  came about when a special order for  medallions was placed on cox by the national free flight society in the usa it was a gentlemans agreement done on a handshake and it nearly didnt happen when cox was sold to estes but the determination of the nffs resulted in the deal happening however estescox only came through with  engines the nffs engraved each engine with a serial number and kept a record of who purchased each engine these are probably the rarest of all cox engines due to the small size of the production run these engines have a unique piston and cylinder setup that occurs on no other cox engine before or after the cylinder has a straight bore  inches slit exhaust no sub piston induction product enginesedit these are all variations of the baby bee with different backplates and other parts designed for different rtf aircraft cars and boats there were literally hundreds of different models with subtle differences listed below are just a few of the more common ones  super bee cat  babe bee with twin bypass cylinder to give more power for the p warhawk rtf model early version had p stamped on the cylinder it had a standard babe bee tank  silver bee cat  similar to the super bee but it had a larger cc nonvented fuel tank it did not have p stamped on the cylinder but it did have the twin bypass ports this engine came with the spitfire rtf airplane  series x product engine catx manufactured  to  babe bee type engine with postage stamp type delrin backplate and brass needle valve instead of the integral babe bee fuel tank various shapes were used

engine   surestart cat another variation of the modern babe bee these were pretty good because they have a choke tube attached to the grey plastic backplate the choke tube makes the engine even easier to start they were fitted to the very last rtfs eg pt and hyper viper before they went out of production original equipment manufacturer oem enginesedit over the years some cox model engines were sold to other companies for use in their products and sold under the other companies names examples of these companies were testor corporation sanwa  kyosho of japan johannes graupner of germany jerobee industries trading as jomac products lite machine corporation kenbrite corp australia and tissan haifa in israel of all of the above mentioned companies only tissan haifa assembled their own engines called the banana  all the rest used motor manufactured by cox themselves  cox banana  cat this engine looked like a standard product engine with plastic backplate it also had a spring starter red

cox engine for fai racing combat and free flight for many more years until the russian aac engines came along this engine was patterned on the australian designed  taipan cc twin ball race engine by gordon burford the entire top end of the cox conquest and the taipan tbr are interchangeable the taipan tbr was based on the rossi mkii so the top end is also interchangeable with a rossi mkii also came in rc version cat  as a result of reorganisation within leisure dynamics who owned cox and kb at the time production of this engine was handed over to kb and it became known as the kb conquest after  production continued for a number of years when the engine was sold to mecoa owned by randy linsalato where it continued on as the rjl conquest for some time  cox conquest   prototyped only samples do exist and the conquest  was a grown up version of the conquest  however due to reorganisation with leisure dynamics who owned cox and kb at the time it was decided not to commence production as kb already had a  sized engine in the market  queen bee  rccat  manufactured  rear reed valve rc engine uses a standard glow plug power output is similar to tee dee  came out mid  and is listed in cox  catalog cylindersedit there was a wide range of cylinders produced with three different wall thicknesses most are interchangeable between all engine types which can create problems when buying a used engine all early cylinders had a thin wall which was later found to need improvement because they bent easily in a crash or when trying to undo with a cox wrench some people refer to these as mk cylinders the next type was thickened at the exhaust ports and are also known by some people as mk the third type was thick wall the way down from the cooling fins to the bottom this one facilitated the exhaust throttle ring and some people refer to this as a mk although cox never referred to them like this note the chart does not differentiate between specific modifications and changes made over the years as the company changed hands cox  cylinder crosssections cox venom cylinder referring to the cylinder crosssections above depicts a thin wall tee dee  cylinder with dual booster ports on the bypass port is a late model thick wall cylinder with slit exhaust and a single bypass booster is a black widow  cylinder with no bypass booster with a stepped wall is a pre cylinder used on early space bug space bug jr thermal hopper and strato bug note how the thread diameter for the glow head is much smaller no engines produced after  used this cylinder the most powerful cylinder piston combination without a doubt is the number  tee dee  cylinder this cylinder has a tapered grind and tapered and lightened piston so the piston fit gets tighter as the piston reaches top dead center tdc the intake or bypass porting is  deep ports with  bypass booster ports on each bypass this setup causes a swirling of the intake fuel air mixture which promotes better

dee also had a tapered cylinder and the crank was stronger and ported different from the medallion crank pistonsedit cox pistons pre and post  the early engines that were produced before  had a light alloy piston rod which is retained in its socket by a slotted steel retaining cup which in turn is held in place by a steel circlip located in a shallow groove in the interior piston wall this arrangement known as a threepiece piston was abandoned as of  in favour of a hardened steel rod which was swaged into a bearing cup formed integrally in the piston interior the advantage of this latter setup was that it simplified assembly and the bearing could be reset to take up play using a suitable reset tool to reswage the cup the engines that used the earlystyle threepiece piston are any engines produced prior to  ie space bug space bug jnr thermal hopper and strato bug since the space bug space bug jr and thermal hopper where produced up until  you will find versions of these early engines around with the laterstyle pistons and cylinders cox reset tool the post piston is coated with copper on the inside and top this was done to prevent the nitrile hardening process from hardening the ball socket joint area the outside wall of the piston was then finely machined and polished to produce a chromed appearance piston  conrod ball socket joint free playedit sometimes especially with engines that have had a lot of use the piston  conrod ball socket joint is very loose and will adversely affect performance a cox “reset” tool available for the    and the  series engines is used to tighten the ball joint back up again the correct free play is  to  inches the  engines use a wrist pin so a socket reset tool is not required for these crankshaftsedit babe bee left  killer bee right on the bee engines there were  types of crankshaft produced and theyre interchangeable all bees with the exception of the killer bee and venom had the same crankshaft that was only good for about  rpm before the conrod pin would break off the killer bees and venom had a heavy duty balanced and lightened crankshaft that improved performance and could withstand speeds in excess of  rpm a company named davis diesel development in the usa also make a similar crankshaft called a killer crank for their diesel conversions they found under the heavier torque loads caused by running diesel fuel that the pins would break also hence they produced their own killer crank the same killer cranks are now being produced again by cox international on the tee dees and medallions the cranks are also interchangeable but quite different the tee dee has a large square hole at the intake end of the crank whereas the medallion has a smaller round hole the timing is also different on the later td rc versions the crankshaft is lightened and strengthened similar to the killer bee crank ie ground away and hole in conrod pin glow headsedit cox glow headsedit there were  main types of cox glow

steel reed which is held in place by a plastic reed retainer see image on right later variants of the star and oval reeds were made of mylar and teflon some say mylar is the best while others prefer the stainless steel and then others prefer the teflon claims are that mylar and teflon are lighter and make the engine easier to start and go faster but they do not last as long as the stainless ones propellersedit  engines run well on a x to x prop a x apc works well to get any suitable speed for mouse racing a  inch pitch prop is required at high revs but to do this plenty of nitromethane is also required for example a  x  prop with  nitro texaco engines are designed to use bigger props eg x fueledit the highest performance is achieved with fuel of  or more nitro content at least  oil  castorsynthetic is recommended acceptable performance can be had without nitromethane although the engine will be very sensitive to needle adjustments making it more difficult to operate with high nitromethane nitro fuel it may be necessary to lower the compression by installing up to six or more additional head gaskets when using castor oil it is advisable to clean the engine cylinder wall with a scotchbrite pad to remove castor oil varnish buildup that will occur especially after lean running this buildup of varnish will cause the engine to run inconsistently to avoid this problem it is advised to use a synthetic oil or synthetic and castor oil blend synthetic oil contains detergents that will keep the cylinder wall clean however these small engines do rely on some castor oil buildup to maintain high compression at higher running temperatures using clean fuel and keeping everything clean and free from dust and dirt particles is also very important for consistent running in

engines they were used in control line and free flight model planes as there was no market for throttled radio control engines back then radio control although first developed in the s it was not available for model airplanes until the s and did not become economically viable for small model planes until the mids and even then was for the modelers who could afford it it was certainly out of reach of the hands of most children from the mids cox produced throttle control devices for some of their engines however these were not as effective as throttles on other brand engines as the cox throttle worked by restricting exhaust flow exhaust throttles were produced for most bee and all medallion engines but not tee dee in  cox produced an engine with a true throttleable rc carburetor and that engine was the queen bee  in  cox produced the tee dee  and  both of which had a conventional rc carburetor with adjustable airbleed and a full muffler in  an after market rc throttlechoke has

entrepreneur leroy roy m cox cox manufacturing started out in leroys garage in  where he made wooden pop guns for kids and employed local housewives to assemble them metal was scarce due to the war which is why the toy guns were made of wood in  metal became readily available again and competitors quickly moved into the market making their metal pop guns cheaper so roy moved to something else making metal tether cars for kids in august  a fire in coxs garage forced him to move to newer and larger premises at  poinsettia ave santa ana california in  cox developed a racing car which used an engine manufactured by cameron brothers the cars sold for  and generated  in sales in their first year of production in  cox developed their own engine for their racing tether car which included some parts from mel andersons spitzy engine this engine was called the o forty five as it was  cubic inch displacement in  with sales of the car proving to be a success cox moved on to development of a model plane engine roy felt the need for dependable easytostart engines and spent the better part of the year  in research actually  months his three man engineering crew himself mark mier and bill fogler spent  days a week day and night to develop the ‘ space bug’ contest engine the end result was the space bug  contest engine coxs first model plane engine which was completed in october  in  first name change was made to lm cox manufacturing company inc the space bug engine sets the scene for all the cox engines that followed and it went into full production in  this engine was so popular that it caused problems for other model engine manufacturers in  cox produced their first ready to fly rtf airplane the td which was powered by the space bug engine in  leroy cox lm cox manufacturing is sued by jim walker american junior aircraft co for copyright infringement because cox was using walkers patented bellcrank system in the td and secondly because walker believed the cox skylon reel was a copy of his ureely control handle the court case lasted for  years in  cox wins the court case against jim walker walkers patent on the bellcrank control system is ruled void and invalid because it was determined that the system had been designed before walkers patent and by someone else  a man named oba stclair who was the first man to fly a control line airplane in the usa back in  and the design was published in  oba stclair had shown his design to jim walker who took it upon himself to patent the design the court also ruled that the cox reel was not a copyright infringement in  cox developed the babe bee  designed by william bill selzer which had an extruded aluminum crankcase not cast like the others this engine sold for just  and stamped the final nail in the coffin of many competitors whose engines were selling for substantially more the babe bee was a high quality high precision engine which started easily and was very reliable unlike some of the competition in  cox took over the flying circle at disneyland which was a major coup for the company the model planes were being flown each day in front of tens of thousands of people and they had a hobby shop right there full of cox rtf planes the cox flying circle  remained in operation until  when it was closed to make way for expansion of tomorrowland in  cox hired an engineer named bill atwood who had already build his own line of engines to develop a new  cubic inch engine atwood was also responsible for the tee dee and medallion line of engines these engines put cox on the map as a leading engine in the world for many years to come in  due to continuing growth the company moved to larger  square feet facilities which were three times larger than the old site shortly thereafter cox got into slot cars and focused attention on gearing up for this fad  cox international is established in hong kong to meet the demands of the slot car craze  the slot car fad ends leaving cox with excess stock that cannot be sold resulting in financial cash flow problems in  leroys wife myrtle died and leroy was having health problems of his own so he retired and sold the company to leisure dynamics inc leisure dynamics continued to expand the range of cox model aircraft as well as adding trains boats rockets kites and radio control boosting sales to  million dollars per year roy cox retired with the distinction of being the worlds most successful model engine manufacturer in  william h selzer was appointed as president of lm cox manufacturing inc a subsidiary of leisure dynamics in  leisure dynamics breaks the company in two and moves the model production to minnesota and leaves the engine production in santa ana california in  leisure dynamics changes the company name to cox hobbies inc in  leisure dynamics filed for bankruptcy taking cox hobbies inc with them in  leroy roy m cox died sept  age  in  former cox engineer and president bill selzer whom cox hired in  purchased the company out of bankruptcy all manufacturing was returned to santa ana the company once again flourished into the s with new products being added and another move to even bigger facilities in  cox hobbies moved to new facilities at corona california in  the company name changed again to cox products the pee wee babe bee and pt  trainer still in production in  cox celebrated  years and introduced some new engines and rtf models in  cox sold to estes industries  centuri corp and moved to penrose colorado things changed quite considerably from here on cox as the hobbyists of the world knew it had gone the high reputation cox engines had declined one by one each product item was withdrawn from sale as stock ran out engine parts from different engines were mixed and matched making hybrid engines that performed very poorly compared to the cox engines from previous years estes added new products to the cox line using the cox name however these were electric radio control models some of which were known to explode resulting in a massive product recall by the company in  an online company calling themselves cox hobby distributors owned by estes industries appeared selling rc and electric products and some of the classic engines and rtf models however as each item from the classic era sold out it wasnt replaced in feb  estes industries sold all of their remaining classic cox stock to several private buyers one of them being a small company from canada in june  they launched a website cox international to sell their remaining stock online and also via ebay in jan

inches  mm stroke  inches  mm displacement  cubic inches  cc borestroke ratio  oversquare the cox  engine is a stroke internal combustion glow plug engine these engines use a glow plug to heat the fuelair within the cylinder to start once running it is disconnected and operates in the same manner as a diesel engine the self ignition is due to the heat produced from the compression of the airfuel mix and the catalytic reaction of the platinum element in the glow plug and the methanol in the fuel and does not depend in any way upon the continued use of the battery fuel intake to the engine is controlled by a simple needle valve and venturi system fuelair mixture intake to the crankcase is controlled via a reed valve or rotary valve depending on the engine design in a reed valve engine the valve is drawn open by suction as the piston moves upward on the compression stroke as the piston moves down on the power stoke the pressure in the crankcase causes the reed valve to close the fuel air mixture in the crankcase is then forced past the piston via the transferbypass ports in the cylinder one characteristic of a reed valve is that the engine will run in either direction an advantage for a pusher model but a disadvantage if the engine is finger started as it may start in the wrong direction the cox engines employed a starting spring which kept fingers free of the propellor and generally ensured correct rotational direction on rotary valve engines the process is similar except instead of a reed a rotary valve is used incorporated in the crankshaft which opens and closes as the piston moves up and down the rotary valve is more efficient and adjustable at design time as there is a larger and clearer path to the crankcase than in the reed valve setup but such engines can run in only one direction pusher configurations require a special propeller sometimes difficult to find the fuel used to power the engine is called model engine fuel a mixture of methanol  castor oil  and nitromethane  the cox line of reed valve engines designed prior to  used a rear reed valve induction system in the late s they played around with rear rotary valve induction as used in the rr before moving forward with front rotary valve induction for their tee dee and medallion lines early enginesedit cox thimble drome space bug  o forty five power pak special racer car engine pp  manufactured  this engine was the first designed by cox but included some major parts ie piston and cylinder of the spitzy  engine designed by mel anderson it employed a twin reed valve which was

only and was marketed as a competition engine and sold for  back then there was no market for radio control and free flight hadnt been considered by cox at this time the piston and cylinder were made from mild steel bar stock and the crankcase and fuel tank were cast aluminum  thermal hopper cat  manufactured  the thermal hopper is basically a space bug without the fuel tank it has a needle valve and venturi mounted on an aluminum plate instead these were designed for free flight and could also be used for control line flying it allowed the user to put a fuel tank of their choosing on the engine output was recorded at  bhp   rpm with a torque of  ozin at  rpm cox thimble drome thermal hopper  space bug jnr cat  manufactured  the space bug junior is a space bug with a smaller plastic tank this cheaper version also only had one intake bypass port and sold for   strato bug cat  manufactured  basically the same engine as a space bug but included a two piece fuel tank which was cheaper to make than the original space bug tank the tank itself is turned aluminium while the tank back is red yellow or blue plastic from the space bug junior but is modified to include an aluminium pickup tube and a larger hole to expose the venturi that is integral to the aluminium tank the later babe bee tank was simply a further developed version of this tank this engine was only produced during  and sold as a mid range sport engine for  as such not many exist today which makes them very rare and collectible selling for over us in  and  in  beware of fakes some unscrupulous sellers

babe bee was the first engine cox produced with an extruded machined anodized bar stock aluminum crankcase this crankcase was machine made and was much cheaper and faster to make than the cast aluminum crankcase of the earlier models this engine was also supplied in thousands of rtf ready to fly airplanes sold in department stores worldwide it has an integrated cc fuel tank max output power was recorded around  bhp  watts   rpm on  nitro  pee wee  cat  manufactured feb jan  buoyed with excitement of the babe bee  leroy wanted to make a half size version of the babe bee so he did and they called it a pee wee  just like a babe bee only half the size  golden bee cat  manufactured oct jan  custom built golden bee  the golden bee is a baby bee that has a larger cc stunt vented fuel tank and has been anodized gold the larger tank allowed the planes to fly longer while the stunt vents allowed the airplanes to fly inverted without fuel running out or the engine cutting out the first versions of the golden bee had a single bypass intake port but later versions had two bypass ports making them slightly more powerful  qz cat  manufactured  qz stands for quiet zone it is a babe bee with a muffler twin bypass port cylinder with no sub piston induction and a high compression  glow head an attempt to regain the power loss caused by the muffler very similar to the later qrc engine which reportedly worked better cox also sold the muffler cylinder and high comp glow head components of the qz as a muffler conversion kit cat for   qrc cat  manufactured  the qrc was a modified babe bee engine that had a muffler and larger cc fuel tank in the s noise became an issue and the cox engineers discovered that when adding a muffler the engine would lose significant power this problem was alleviated by installing a cylinder with no sub piston induction the engine was designed for power launching radio controlled gliders and had a red tank with a blue spinner  rc bee cat  manufactured  this engine was designed for small radio controlled model planes it has a plastic clunk tank and an unusual cast crankcase the leisure dynamics team thought that cast crankcases would be cheaper to produce however they discovered that there were many manufacturing defects and they were difficult to machine resulting in a high failure rate so they returned to the tried and proven machined aluminum bar stock crankcase  dragon fly cat  manufactured  this engine was designed for the radio controlled model planes it is basically a baby bee with a clunk tank and a muffler throttle  texaco cat  manufactured  the is engine was designed for a texaco rc duration competition the engine has an additional fin on the larger glow plug which dissipates heat better allowing the engine to swing a larger propeller ie  or  inches this engine has a red cc fuel tank and a black crankcase original  engines did not come out with  fin glow plug the  fin glow plug came later in the  catalog  texaco jnr cat  manufactured  the same engine as the texaco above except that it has a smaller cc fuel tank which is also red first appeared in  cox catalog highperformance beesedit  rr cat  manufactured  the rare cox rr the rr uses a rear rotary valve intake rather than a reed valve in an attempt to achieve more power the engine came after the babe bee and looks very similar with its anodized machined extruded aluminum crank case and fuel tank the power improvement was negligible so cox reverted to the cheaper easier to build babe bee the engine was made for quite a few years and sold for  a left and right hand rotary valve was made as were left hand x glass filled nylon props for the rr some versions have a blue tank others have a clear anodized tank there were two versions of the tank back as well to fit the corresponding tank it has become a collectors item due to its uniqueness and pretty colors and is worth around  in   space hopper cat  manufactured nov  the space hopper was coxs first attempt at a beam mount high performance reed valve engine plus the first steps towards their greatest engine the tee dee series the engine was basically like the thermal hopper was to a space bug that is a babe bee without a tank but a venturi and needle valve relying on an external fuel tank the engine looks similar to the sportsman engine with a machined aluminium crankcase and rear induction via a reed valve with the needle valve assembly and venturi similar in appearance to the later tee dee series this engine was short lived and made way for the tee dee in  due to their similarities to the tee dee that followed some of the parts crossed over from this engine to the tee dee they look very retro and due to their apparent rareness are worth around us in  cox black widow  black widow cat  manufactured may jan  during the s a couple of cox engineers were playing around with different coloured babe bee and golden bee parts and came up with an allblack engine with a red spinner they hopped it up a bit with a dual bypass cylinder from a super bee  a black golden bee tank and a slightly larger  venturi intake the black widow was born these engines were marketed as a high powered combat engine on later black widows the red rubber spinner was replaced by a red anodized aluminum tee dee style spinner in the late s some black widows were produced with the a dual bypass slit exhaust cylinder the slit exhaust was to prevent fires according to an aeromodeller engine test done in august  the black widow on  nitro output power was  bhp  watts at  rpm with a max torque of  ozin at  rpm  killer bee  cat  manufactured  the killer bee was an attempt at making a fast reed valve  engine from information that had been learned over the years of racing and competition it had a tapered cylinder with spi and lighter piston similar to the tee dee a stronger balanced crankshaft and a new reed valve shape they had a yellow plastic needle valve later in  estes produced a killer bee that had none of these features but looked like the original killer bee except for the needle valve beware of fakes some unscrupulous people are producing fakes and selling them check to make sure the engine is the real deal before purchasing  killer bee  cat  manufactured  the killer bee  existed so that modellers could fly the same plane in two competition classes ie a and a simply by changing the engine this engine has exactly the same performance as the  there is a legend that two thin lines or grooves in the piston skirt are for positive identification but this is incorrect the grooves were intentionally designed to bleed off just enough power so that the  increase in displacement does not necessitate trim changes to a free flight model when switching the model from an  to the  to fly in the higher a class the benefit of the grooves as a visual identifier was accidental  venom cat  manufactured  cox venom with galbreathnelson head the venom was coxs last attempt at making a really fast  mouse racing engine again taken from ideas learned from years of competition this engine put all those ideas into an off the shelf product it used the killer bee crank shaft loosely fitted into the crankcase and a cylinder with porting very similar tee dee cylinder and tapered like the tee dee and with a lightened piston like the tee dee the rest of it was like a black widow the problem was that the production engine was not the same as the prototype a mistake had been made in manufacturing and the piston was lightened too much this made the engine fast but the piston weak and they would blow the top off the piston after a few runs at high speed as such only  were made and they never bothered to make any more because of that and all the fakes they are not worth a lot of money  beware of fakes some unscrupulous people are producing fakes and selling them check to make sure the engine is the real deal before purchasing tee deesedit the famous cox tee dee  and   tee dee  cat  manufactured nov jan  the tee dee is coxs most famous engine this engine was dominant in competition for many years it was designed by bill atwood who had been hired by cox specifically to produce the tee dee line of competition engines the important features of the tee dee are as follows tapered cylinder and a lightened and tapered piston result tighter piston fit at tdc and less piston mass two deep bypass ports with two bypass booster grooves known as side flutes on each bypass port extending slightly above the main bypass groove result significantly better air fuel mixture induction true peripheral venturi result more efficient fuel intake fuel draw and induction precision balanced and milled crankshaft result better fuel intake better balanced engine the tee dee was tested by aeromodeller magazine in  and the output power was recorded to be  bhp  watts   rpm with a max torque of  ozin at  rpm on  nitro note the modern norvel ame  engine which has an aluminum piston running in a ceramic coated cylinder outputs  bhp  watts  rpm in  the bypass porting crank shaft timing and venturi were modified slightly and a mesh screen was added to the venturi to keep out dirt this resulted in a minor performance improvement over the earlier versions a hopped up cox tee dee   tee dee  cat  manufactured oct jan  the  was simply a class a version of the engine physically the same on the outside only the bore was different and the piston had a small groove in the skirt to bleed off just enough power to exactly equal an  so no trim changes would be required to free flight models citation required this groove also visually differentiates the  from the  but this was of secondary importance the  also had a red carb body  tee dee  rc cat  manufactured  this engine had a proper rc carby and a full sized standard muffler and was designed specifically for rc flying it had no sub piston induction only two production runs of  each were done so there are only  of these in existence making them the second rarest production engine next to the venom note although the box said tee dee  the engine is actually  a cox tee dee  rc an  rc version also exists cat   manufactured  also  tee dee      cox also built tee dees in  cat  cat  cat and  cat size all these engines were very successful the original tee dee  immediately became the engine to use in fai ff with vastly higher performance than the olympic which had supplanted the european diesels used at the time they proved fragile particularly the thinwall cylinder and ballandsocket connecting rod and were replaced by beefedup versions as noted below one of the things cox wanted atwood to do was make him a  engine cox had already tried to halve the size of the pee wee  but couldnt get it to run for some reason the suspicion surrounded a problem with the tiny reed valve atwood found that the front rotary valve worked well on the  size hence the  was born medallionsedit  medallion  cat  manufactured nov jan  cox medallion  also known as the poor mans tee dee these were similar to the tee dee in appearance but had cheaper parts on them making them cheaper to buy the cylinder was a non tapered twin bypass with no boost ports like the one used on the black widow the crank shaft was drilled out rather than milled like the tee dee and the carb body was a one piece unit with a conventional needle valve and spray bar these engines were marketed as a sport  stunt engine as they were much tamer and much less cantankerous than the tee dee these are a great reliable easy to use little engine even today they can be purchased for under us in  rc versions of this engine were also produced with exhaust throttle ie  cat and the  cat with mufflerthrottle  medallion    the medallion engine was also produced in cat and cat  cubic inch size there were also rc versions of these ie cat medallion  rc and cat medallion  rc  medallion  manufactured  cox medallion  this particular  came about when a special order for  medallions was placed on cox by the national free flight society in the usa it was a gentlemans agreement done on a handshake and it nearly didnt happen when cox was sold to estes but the determination of the nffs resulted in the deal happening however estescox only came through with  engines the nffs engraved each engine with a serial number and kept a record of who purchased each engine these are probably the rarest of all cox engines due to the small size of the production run these engines have a unique piston and cylinder setup that occurs on no other cox engine before or after the cylinder has a straight bore  inches slit exhaust no sub piston induction product enginesedit these are all variations of the baby bee with different backplates and other parts designed for different rtf aircraft cars and boats there were literally hundreds of different models with subtle differences listed below are just a few of the more common

gordon burford the entire top end of the cox conquest and the taipan tbr are interchangeable the taipan tbr was based on the rossi mkii so the top end is also interchangeable with a rossi mkii also came in rc version cat  as a result of reorganisation within leisure dynamics who owned cox and kb at the time production of this engine was handed over to kb and it became known as the kb conquest

listed in cox  catalog cylindersedit there was a wide range of cylinders produced with three different wall thicknesses most are interchangeable between all engine types which can create problems when buying a used engine all early cylinders had a thin wall which was later found to need improvement because they bent easily in a crash or when trying to undo with a cox wrench some people refer to these as mk cylinders the next type was thickened at the exhaust ports and are also known by some people as mk the third type was thick wall the way down from the cooling fins to the bottom this one facilitated the exhaust throttle ring and some people refer to this as a mk although cox never referred to them like this note the chart does not differentiate between specific modifications and changes made over the years as the company changed hands cox  cylinder crosssections cox venom cylinder referring to the cylinder crosssections above depicts a thin wall tee dee  cylinder with dual

powerful cylinder piston combination without a doubt is the number  tee dee  cylinder this cylinder has a tapered grind and tapered and lightened piston so the piston fit gets tighter as the piston

dee also had a tapered cylinder and the crank was stronger and ported different from the medallion crank pistonsedit cox pistons pre and post  the early engines that were produced before  had a light alloy piston rod which is retained in its socket by a slotted steel retaining cup which in turn is held in place by a steel circlip located in a shallow groove in the interior piston wall this arrangement known as a threepiece piston was abandoned as of  in favour of a hardened steel rod which was swaged into a bearing cup formed integrally in the piston interior the advantage of this latter setup was that it simplified assembly and the bearing could be reset to take up play using a suitable reset tool to reswage the cup the engines that used the earlystyle threepiece piston are any engines produced prior to  ie space bug space bug jnr thermal hopper and strato bug since the space bug space bug jr and thermal hopper where produced up until  you will find versions of these early engines around with the laterstyle pistons and cylinders cox reset tool the post piston is coated with copper on the inside and top this was done to prevent the nitrile hardening process from hardening the ball socket joint area the outside wall of the piston was then finely machined and polished to produce a chromed appearance piston  conrod ball socket joint free playedit sometimes especially with engines that have had a lot of use the piston  conrod ball socket joint is very loose and will adversely affect performance a cox “reset” tool available for the    and the  series engines is used to tighten the ball joint back up again the correct free play is  to  inches the  engines use a wrist pin so a socket reset tool is not required for these crankshaftsedit babe bee left  killer bee right on the bee engines there were  types of crankshaft produced and theyre interchangeable all bees with the exception of the killer bee and venom had the same crankshaft that was only good for about  rpm before the conrod pin would break off the killer bees and venom had a heavy duty balanced and lightened crankshaft that improved performance and could withstand speeds in excess of  rpm a company named davis diesel development in the usa also make a similar crankshaft called a killer crank for their diesel conversions they found under the heavier torque loads caused by running diesel fuel that the pins would break also hence they produced their own killer crank the same killer cranks are now being produced again by cox international on the tee dees and medallions the cranks are also interchangeable but quite different the tee dee has a large square hole at the intake end of the crank whereas the medallion has a smaller round hole the timing is also different on the later td rc versions the crankshaft is lightened and strengthened similar to the killer bee crank ie ground away and hole in conrod pin glow headsedit cox glow headsedit there were  main types of cox glow

castorsynthetic is recommended acceptable performance can be had without nitromethane although the engine will be very sensitive to needle adjustments making it more difficult to operate with high nitromethane nitro fuel it may be necessary to lower the compression by installing up to six or more additional head gaskets when using castor oil it is advisable to clean the engine cylinder wall with a scotchbrite pad to remove castor oil varnish buildup that will occur especially after lean running this buildup of varnish will cause the engine to run inconsistently to avoid this problem it is advised to use a synthetic oil or synthetic and castor oil blend synthetic oil contains detergents that will keep the cylinder wall clean however these small engines do rely on some castor oil buildup to maintain high compression at higher running temperatures using clean fuel and keeping everything clean and free from dust and dirt particles is also very important for consistent running in

engines they were used in control line and free flight model planes as there was no market for throttled radio control engines back then radio control although first developed in the s it was not available for model airplanes until the s and did not become economically viable for small model planes until the mids and even then was for the modelers who could afford it it was certainly out of reach of the hands of most children from the mids cox produced throttle control devices for some of their engines however these were not as effective as throttles on other brand engines as the cox throttle worked by restricting exhaust flow exhaust throttles were produced for most bee and all medallion engines but not tee dee in  cox produced an engine with a true throttleable rc carburetor and that engine was the queen bee  in  cox produced the tee dee  and  both of which had a conventional rc carburetor with adjustable airbleed and a full muffler in  an after market rc throttlechoke has

became cox models on february   estes industries stopped producing cox engines and sold all of their remaining inventory ie mainly spare parts to several private buyers from canada and usa one of the new owners of the remaining cox engine and parts inventory has launched a website cox international with online store millions of engines were produced and they became the most common a class  cubic

entrepreneur leroy roy m cox cox manufacturing started out in leroys garage in  where he made wooden pop guns for kids and employed local housewives to assemble them metal was scarce due to the war which is why the toy guns were made of wood in  metal became readily available again and competitors quickly moved into the market making their metal pop guns cheaper so roy moved to something else making metal tether cars for kids in august  a fire in coxs garage forced him to move to newer and larger premises at  poinsettia ave santa ana california in  cox developed a racing car which used an engine manufactured by cameron brothers the cars sold for  and generated  in sales in their first year of production in  cox developed their own engine for their racing tether car which included some parts from mel andersons spitzy engine this engine was called the o forty five as it was  cubic inch displacement in  with sales of the car proving to be a success cox moved on to development of a model plane engine roy felt the need for dependable easytostart engines and spent the better part of the year  in research actually  months his three man engineering crew himself mark mier and bill fogler spent  days a week day and night to develop the ‘ space bug’ contest engine the end result was the space bug  contest engine coxs first model plane engine which was completed in october  in  first name change was made to lm cox manufacturing company inc the space bug engine sets the scene for all the cox engines that followed and it went into full production in  this engine was so popular that it caused problems for other model engine manufacturers in  cox produced their first ready to fly rtf airplane the td which was powered by the space bug engine in  leroy cox lm cox manufacturing is sued by jim walker american junior aircraft co for copyright infringement because cox was using walkers patented bellcrank system in the td and secondly because walker believed the cox skylon reel was a copy of his ureely control handle the court case lasted for  years in  cox wins the court case against jim walker walkers patent on the bellcrank control system is ruled void and invalid because it was determined that the system had been designed before walkers patent and by someone else  a man named oba stclair who was the first man to fly a control line airplane in the usa back in  and the design was published in  oba stclair had shown his design to jim walker who took it upon himself to patent the design the court also ruled that the cox reel was not a copyright infringement in  cox developed the babe bee  designed by william bill selzer which had an extruded aluminum crankcase not cast like the others this engine sold for just  and stamped the final nail in the coffin of many competitors whose engines were selling for substantially more the babe bee was a high quality high precision engine which started easily and was very reliable unlike some of the competition in  cox took over the flying circle at disneyland which was a major coup for the company the model planes were being flown each day in front of tens of thousands of people and they had a hobby shop right there full of cox rtf planes the cox flying circle  remained in operation until  when it was closed to make way for expansion of tomorrowland in  cox hired an engineer named bill atwood who had already build his own line of engines to develop a new  cubic inch engine atwood was also responsible for the tee dee and medallion line of engines these engines put cox on the map as a leading engine in the world for many years to come in  due to continuing growth the company moved to larger  square feet facilities which were three times larger than the old site shortly thereafter cox got into slot cars and focused attention on gearing up for this fad  cox international is established in hong kong to meet the demands of the slot car craze  the slot car fad ends leaving cox with excess stock that cannot be sold resulting in financial cash flow problems in  leroys wife myrtle died and leroy was having health problems of his own so he retired and sold the company to leisure dynamics inc leisure dynamics continued to expand the range of cox model aircraft as well as adding trains boats rockets kites and radio control boosting sales to  million dollars per year roy cox retired with the distinction of being the worlds most successful model engine manufacturer in  william h selzer was appointed as president of lm cox manufacturing inc a subsidiary of leisure dynamics in  leisure dynamics breaks the company in two and moves the model production to minnesota and leaves the engine production in santa ana california in  leisure dynamics changes the company name to cox hobbies inc in  leisure dynamics filed for bankruptcy taking cox hobbies inc with them in  leroy roy m cox died sept  age  in  former cox engineer and president bill selzer whom cox hired in  purchased the company out of bankruptcy all manufacturing was returned to santa ana the company once again flourished into the s with new products being added and another move to even bigger facilities in  cox hobbies moved to new facilities at corona california in  the company name changed again to cox products the pee wee babe bee and pt  trainer still in production in  cox celebrated  years and introduced some new engines and rtf models in  cox sold to estes industries  centuri corp and moved to penrose colorado things changed quite considerably from here on cox as the hobbyists of the world knew it had gone the high reputation cox engines had declined one by one each product item was withdrawn from sale as stock ran out engine parts from different engines were mixed and matched making hybrid engines that performed very poorly compared to the cox engines from previous years estes added new products to the cox line using the cox name however these were electric radio control models some of which were known to explode resulting in a massive product recall by the company in  an online company calling themselves cox hobby distributors owned by estes industries appeared selling rc and electric products and some of the classic engines and rtf models however as each item from the classic era sold out it wasnt replaced in feb  estes industries sold all of their remaining classic cox stock to several private buyers one of them being a small company from canada in june  they launched a website cox international to sell their remaining stock online and also via ebay in jan  estescox corporation purchased by hobbico based in champaign illinois in  cox international continue to revive the classic cox brand as well as introducing new engine versions spare parts and accessories the enginesedit cox  engine specifications all cox  engines bore  inches  mm stroke  inches  mm displacement  cubic inches  cc borestroke ratio  oversquare cox  engine specifications bore  inches  mm stroke  inches  mm displacement  cubic inches  cc borestroke ratio  oversquare the cox  engine is a stroke internal combustion glow plug engine these engines use a glow plug to heat the fuelair within the cylinder to start once running it is disconnected and operates in the same manner as a diesel engine the self ignition is due to the heat produced from the compression of the airfuel mix and the catalytic reaction of the platinum element in the glow plug and the methanol in the fuel and does not depend in any way upon the continued use of the battery fuel intake to the engine is controlled by a simple needle valve and venturi system fuelair mixture intake to the crankcase is controlled via a reed valve or rotary valve depending on the engine design in a reed valve engine the valve is drawn open by suction as the piston moves upward on the compression stroke as the piston moves down on the power stoke the pressure in the crankcase causes the reed valve to close the fuel air mixture in the crankcase is then forced past the piston via the transferbypass ports in the cylinder one characteristic of a reed valve is that the engine will run in either direction an advantage for a pusher model but a disadvantage if the engine is finger started as it may start in the wrong direction the cox engines employed a starting spring which kept fingers free of the propellor and generally ensured correct rotational direction on rotary valve engines the process is similar except instead of a reed a rotary valve is used incorporated in the crankshaft which opens and closes as the piston moves up and down the rotary valve is more efficient and adjustable at design time as there is a larger and clearer path to the crankcase than in the reed valve setup but such engines can run in only one direction pusher configurations require a special propeller sometimes difficult to find the fuel used to power the engine is called model engine fuel a mixture of methanol  castor oil  and nitromethane  the cox line of reed valve engines designed prior to  used a rear reed valve induction system in the late s they played around with rear rotary valve induction as used in the rr before moving forward with front rotary valve induction for their tee dee and medallion lines early enginesedit cox thimble drome space bug  o forty five power pak special racer car engine pp  manufactured  this engine was the first designed by cox but included some major parts ie piston and cylinder of the spitzy  engine designed by mel anderson it employed a twin reed valve which was later used for the space bug the engine was a major engineering achievement for its time by incorporating reduction gears fuel tank flywheel and muffler all into one power pak the air intake was via one of the axles  o sixty power pak special racer car engine   manufactured  when slightly more power was needed for the thimble drome special car to obtain more speed a slightly larger version of the  was ordered with a bigger bore making the displacement  cubic inches  space bug cat  manufactured  the space bug was the first engine built entirely by cox it was designed for control line flying use only and was marketed as a competition engine and sold for  back then there was no market for radio control and free flight hadnt been considered by cox at this time the piston and cylinder were made from mild steel bar stock and the crankcase and fuel tank were cast aluminum  thermal hopper cat  manufactured  the thermal hopper is basically a space bug without the fuel tank it has a needle valve and venturi mounted on an aluminum plate instead these were designed for free flight and could also be used for control line flying it allowed the user to put a fuel tank of their choosing on the engine output was recorded at  bhp   rpm with a torque of  ozin at  rpm cox thimble drome thermal hopper  space bug jnr cat  manufactured  the space bug junior is a space bug with a smaller plastic tank this cheaper version also only had one intake bypass port and sold for   strato bug cat  manufactured  basically the same engine as a space bug but included a two piece fuel tank which was cheaper to make than the original space bug tank the tank itself is turned aluminium while the tank back is red yellow or blue plastic from the space bug junior but is modified to include an aluminium pickup tube and a larger hole to expose the venturi that is integral to the aluminium tank the later babe bee tank was simply a further developed version of this tank this engine was only produced during  and sold as a mid range sport engine for  as such not many exist today which makes them very rare and collectible selling for over us in  and  in  beware of fakes some unscrupulous sellers have been selling fake strato bugs that have a cnc machined tank and a space bug junior backplate standard beesedit cox babe bee left golden bee right  babe bee  cat  manufactured nov jan  the classic babe bee was the first engine cox produced with an extruded machined anodized bar stock aluminum crankcase this crankcase was machine made and was much cheaper and faster to make than the cast aluminum crankcase of the earlier models this engine was also supplied in thousands of rtf ready to fly airplanes sold in department stores worldwide it has an integrated cc fuel tank max output power was recorded around  bhp  watts   rpm on  nitro  pee wee  cat  manufactured feb jan  buoyed with excitement of the babe bee  leroy wanted to make a half size version of the babe bee so he did and they called it a pee wee  just like a babe bee only half the size  golden bee cat  manufactured oct jan  custom built golden bee  the golden bee is a baby bee that has a larger cc stunt vented fuel tank and has been anodized gold the larger tank allowed the planes to fly longer while the stunt vents allowed the airplanes to fly inverted without fuel running out or the engine cutting out the first versions of the golden bee had a single bypass intake port but later versions had two bypass ports making them slightly more powerful  qz cat  manufactured  qz stands for quiet zone it is a babe bee with a muffler twin bypass port cylinder with no sub piston induction and a high compression  glow head an attempt to regain the power loss caused by the muffler very similar to the later qrc engine which reportedly worked better cox also sold the muffler cylinder and high comp glow head components of the qz as a muffler conversion kit cat for   qrc cat  manufactured  the qrc was a modified babe bee engine that had a muffler and larger cc fuel tank in the s noise became an issue and the cox engineers discovered that when adding a muffler the engine would lose significant power this problem was alleviated by installing a cylinder with no sub piston induction the engine was designed for power launching radio controlled gliders and had a red tank with a blue spinner  rc bee cat  manufactured  this engine was designed for small radio controlled model planes it has a plastic clunk tank and an unusual cast crankcase the leisure dynamics team thought that cast crankcases would be cheaper to produce however they discovered that there were many manufacturing defects and they were difficult to machine resulting in a high failure rate so they returned to the tried and proven machined aluminum bar stock crankcase  dragon fly cat  manufactured  this engine was designed for the radio controlled model planes it is basically a baby bee with a clunk tank and a muffler throttle  texaco cat  manufactured  the is engine was designed for a texaco rc duration competition the engine has an additional fin on the larger glow plug which dissipates heat better allowing the engine to swing a larger propeller ie  or  inches this engine has a red cc fuel tank and a black crankcase original  engines did not come out with  fin glow plug the  fin glow plug came later in the  catalog  texaco jnr cat  manufactured  the same engine as the texaco above except that it has a smaller cc fuel tank which is also red first appeared in  cox catalog highperformance beesedit  rr cat  manufactured  the rare cox rr the rr uses a rear rotary valve intake rather than a reed valve in an attempt to achieve more power the engine came after the babe bee and looks very similar with its anodized machined extruded aluminum crank case and fuel tank the power improvement was negligible so cox reverted to the cheaper easier to build babe bee the engine was made for quite a few years and sold for  a left and right hand rotary valve was made as were left hand x glass filled nylon props for the rr some versions have a blue tank others have a clear anodized tank there were two versions of the tank back as well to fit the corresponding tank it has become a collectors item due to its uniqueness and pretty colors and is worth around  in   space hopper cat  manufactured nov  the space hopper was coxs first attempt at a beam mount high performance reed valve engine plus the first steps towards their greatest engine the tee dee series the engine was basically like the thermal hopper was to a space bug that is a babe bee without a tank but a venturi and needle valve relying on an external fuel tank the engine looks similar to the sportsman engine with a machined aluminium crankcase and rear induction via a reed valve with the needle valve assembly and venturi similar in appearance to the later tee dee series this engine was short lived and made way for the tee dee in  due to their similarities to the tee dee that followed some of the parts crossed over from this engine to the tee dee they look very retro and due to their apparent rareness are worth around us in  cox black widow  black widow cat  manufactured may jan  during the s a couple of cox engineers were playing around with different coloured babe bee and golden bee parts and came up with an allblack engine with a red spinner they hopped it up a bit with a dual bypass cylinder from a super bee  a black golden bee tank and a slightly larger  venturi intake the black widow was born these engines were marketed as a high powered combat engine on later black widows the red rubber spinner was replaced by a red anodized aluminum tee dee style spinner in the late s some black widows were produced with the a dual bypass slit exhaust cylinder the slit exhaust was to prevent fires according to an aeromodeller engine test done in august  the black widow on  nitro output power was  bhp  watts at  rpm with a max torque of  ozin at  rpm  killer bee  cat  manufactured  the killer bee was an attempt at making a fast reed valve  engine from information that had been learned over the years of racing and competition it had a tapered cylinder with spi and lighter piston similar to the tee dee a stronger balanced crankshaft and a new reed valve shape they had a yellow plastic needle valve later in  estes produced a killer bee that had none of these features but looked like the original killer bee except for the needle valve beware of fakes some unscrupulous people are producing fakes and selling them check to make sure the engine is the real deal before purchasing  killer bee  cat  manufactured  the killer bee  existed so that modellers could fly the same plane in two competition classes ie a and a simply by changing the engine this engine has exactly the same performance as the  there is a legend that two thin lines or grooves in the piston skirt are for positive identification but this is incorrect the grooves were intentionally designed to bleed off just enough power so that the  increase in displacement does not necessitate trim changes to a free flight model when switching the model from an  to the  to fly in the higher a class the benefit of the grooves as a visual identifier was accidental  venom cat  manufactured  cox venom with galbreathnelson head the venom was coxs last attempt at making a really fast  mouse racing engine again taken from ideas learned from years of competition this engine put all those ideas into an off the shelf product it used the killer bee crank shaft loosely fitted into the crankcase and a cylinder with porting very similar tee dee cylinder and tapered like the tee dee and with a lightened piston like the tee dee the rest of it was like a black widow the problem was that the production engine was not the same as the prototype a mistake had been made in manufacturing and the piston was lightened too much this made the engine fast but the piston weak and they would blow the top off the piston after a few runs at high speed as such only  were made and they never bothered to make any more because of that and all the fakes they are not worth a lot of money  beware of fakes some unscrupulous people are producing fakes and selling them check to make sure the engine is the real deal before purchasing tee deesedit the famous cox tee dee  and   tee dee  cat  manufactured nov jan  the tee dee is coxs most famous engine this engine was dominant in competition for many years it was designed by bill atwood who had been hired by cox specifically to produce the tee dee line of competition engines the important features of the tee dee are as follows tapered cylinder and a lightened and tapered piston result tighter piston fit at tdc and less piston mass two deep bypass ports with two bypass booster grooves known as side flutes on each bypass port extending slightly above the main bypass groove result significantly better air fuel mixture induction true peripheral venturi result more efficient fuel intake fuel draw and induction precision balanced and milled crankshaft result better fuel intake better balanced engine the tee dee was tested by aeromodeller magazine in  and the output power was recorded to be  bhp  watts   rpm with a max torque of  ozin at  rpm on  nitro note the modern norvel ame  engine which has an aluminum piston running in a ceramic coated cylinder outputs  bhp  watts  rpm in  the bypass porting crank shaft timing and venturi were modified slightly and a mesh screen was added to the venturi to keep out dirt this resulted in a minor performance improvement over the earlier versions a hopped up cox tee dee   tee dee  cat  manufactured oct jan  the  was simply a class a version of the engine physically the same on the outside only the bore was different and the piston had a small groove in the skirt to bleed off just enough power to exactly equal an  so no trim changes would be required to free flight models citation required this groove also visually differentiates the  from the  but this was of secondary importance the  also had a red carb body  tee dee  rc cat  manufactured  this engine had a proper rc carby and a full sized standard muffler and was designed specifically for rc flying it had no sub piston induction only two production runs of  each were done so there are only  of these in existence making them the second rarest production engine next to the venom note although the box said tee dee  the engine is actually  a cox tee dee  rc an  rc version also exists cat   manufactured  also  tee dee      cox also built tee dees in  cat  cat  cat and  cat size all these engines were very successful the original tee dee  immediately became the engine to use in fai ff with vastly higher performance than the olympic which had supplanted the european diesels used at the time they proved fragile particularly the thinwall cylinder and ballandsocket connecting rod and were replaced by beefedup versions as noted below one of the things cox wanted atwood to do was make him a  engine cox had already tried to halve the size of the pee wee  but couldnt get it to run for some reason the suspicion surrounded a problem with the tiny reed valve atwood found that the front rotary valve worked well on the  size hence the  was born medallionsedit  medallion  cat  manufactured nov jan  cox medallion  also known as the poor mans tee dee these were similar to the tee dee in appearance but had cheaper parts on them making them cheaper to buy the cylinder was a non tapered twin bypass with no boost ports like the one used on the black widow the crank shaft was drilled out rather than milled like the tee dee and the carb body was a one piece unit with a conventional needle valve and spray bar these engines were marketed as a sport  stunt engine as they were much tamer and much less cantankerous than the tee dee these are a great reliable easy to use little engine even today they can be purchased for under us in  rc versions of this engine were also produced with exhaust throttle ie  cat and the  cat with mufflerthrottle  medallion    the medallion engine was also produced in cat and cat  cubic inch size there were also rc versions of these ie cat medallion  rc and cat medallion  rc  medallion  manufactured  cox medallion  this particular  came about when a special order for  medallions was placed on cox by the national free flight society in the usa it was a gentlemans agreement done on a handshake and it nearly didnt happen when cox was sold to estes but the determination of the nffs resulted in the deal happening however estescox only came through with  engines the nffs engraved each engine with a serial number and kept a record of who purchased each engine these are probably the rarest of all cox engines due to the small size of the production run these engines have a unique piston and cylinder setup that occurs on no other cox engine before or after the cylinder has a straight bore  inches slit exhaust no sub piston induction product enginesedit these are all variations of the baby bee with different backplates and other parts designed for different rtf aircraft cars and boats there were literally hundreds of different models with subtle differences listed below are just a few of the more common ones  super bee cat  babe bee with twin bypass cylinder to give more power for the p warhawk rtf model early version had p stamped on the cylinder it had a standard babe bee tank  silver bee cat

to other companies for use in their products and sold under the other companies names examples of these companies were testor corporation sanwa  kyosho of japan johannes graupner of germany jerobee industries trading as jomac products lite machine corporation kenbrite corp australia and tissan haifa in israel of all of the above mentioned companies only tissan haifa assembled their own engines called the banana  all the rest used motor manufactured by cox themselves  cox banana  cat this engine looked like a standard product engine with plastic backplate it also had a spring starter red

cox engine for fai racing combat and free flight for many more years until the russian aac engines came along this engine was patterned on the australian designed  taipan cc twin ball race engine by gordon burford the entire top end of the cox conquest and the taipan tbr are interchangeable the taipan tbr was based on the rossi mkii so the top end is also interchangeable with a rossi mkii also came in rc version cat  as a result of reorganisation within leisure dynamics who owned cox and kb at the time production of this engine was handed over to kb and it became known as the kb conquest after  production continued for a number of years when the engine was sold to mecoa owned by randy linsalato where it continued on as the rjl conquest for some time  cox conquest   prototyped only samples do exist and the conquest  was a grown up version of the conquest  however due to reorganisation with leisure dynamics who owned cox and kb at the time it was decided not to commence production as kb already had a  sized engine in the market  queen bee  rccat  manufactured  rear reed valve rc engine uses a standard glow plug power output is similar to tee dee  came out mid  and is listed in cox  catalog cylindersedit there was a wide range of cylinders produced with three different wall thicknesses most are interchangeable between all engine types which can create problems when buying a used engine all early cylinders had a thin wall which was later found to need improvement because they bent easily in a crash or when trying to undo with a cox wrench some people refer to these as mk cylinders the next type was thickened at the exhaust ports and are also known by some people as mk the third type was thick wall the way down from the cooling fins to the bottom this one facilitated the exhaust throttle ring and some people refer to this as a mk although cox never referred to them like this note the chart does not differentiate between specific modifications and changes made over the years as the company changed hands cox  cylinder crosssections cox venom cylinder referring to the cylinder crosssections above depicts a thin wall tee dee  cylinder with dual booster ports on the bypass port is a late model thick wall cylinder with slit exhaust and a single bypass booster is a black widow  cylinder with no bypass booster with a stepped wall is a pre cylinder used on early space bug space bug jr thermal hopper and strato bug note how the thread diameter for the glow head is much smaller no engines produced after  used this cylinder the most powerful cylinder piston combination without a doubt is the number  tee dee  cylinder this cylinder has a tapered grind and tapered and lightened piston so the piston fit gets tighter as the piston reaches top dead center tdc the intake or bypass porting is  deep ports with  bypass booster ports on each bypass this setup causes a swirling of the intake fuel air mixture which promotes better

dee also had a tapered cylinder and the crank was stronger and ported different from the medallion crank pistonsedit cox pistons pre and post  the early engines that were produced before  had a light alloy piston rod which is retained in its socket by a slotted steel retaining cup which in turn is held in place by a steel circlip located in a shallow groove in the interior piston wall this arrangement known as a threepiece piston was abandoned as of  in favour of a hardened steel rod which was swaged into a bearing cup formed integrally in the piston interior the advantage of this latter setup was that it simplified assembly and the bearing could be reset to take up play using a suitable reset tool to reswage the cup the engines that used the earlystyle threepiece piston are any engines produced prior to  ie space bug space bug jnr thermal hopper and strato bug since the space bug space bug jr and thermal hopper where produced up until  you will find versions of these early engines around with the laterstyle pistons and cylinders cox reset tool the post piston is coated with copper on the inside and top this was done to prevent the nitrile hardening process from hardening the ball socket joint area the outside wall of the piston was then finely machined and polished to produce a chromed appearance piston  conrod ball socket joint free playedit sometimes especially with engines that have had a lot of use the piston  conrod ball socket joint is very loose and will adversely affect performance a cox “reset” tool available for the    and the  series engines is used to tighten the ball joint back up again the correct free play is  to  inches the  engines use a wrist pin so a socket reset tool is not required for these crankshaftsedit babe bee left  killer bee right on the bee engines there were  types of crankshaft produced and theyre interchangeable all bees with the exception of the killer bee and venom had the same crankshaft that was only good for about  rpm before the conrod pin would break off the killer bees and venom had a heavy duty balanced and lightened crankshaft that improved performance and could withstand speeds in excess of  rpm a company named davis diesel development in the usa also make a similar crankshaft called a killer crank for their diesel conversions they found under the heavier torque loads caused by running diesel fuel that the pins would break also hence they produced their own killer crank the same killer cranks are now being produced again by cox international on the tee dees and medallions the cranks are also interchangeable but quite different the tee dee has a large square hole at the intake end of the crank whereas the medallion has a smaller round hole the timing is also different on the later td rc versions the crankshaft is lightened and strengthened similar to the killer bee crank ie ground away and hole in conrod pin glow headsedit cox glow headsedit there were  main types of cox glow

propellersedit  engines run well on a x to x prop a x apc works well to get any suitable speed for mouse racing a  inch pitch prop is required at high revs but to do this plenty of nitromethane is also required for example a  x  prop with  nitro texaco engines are designed to use bigger props eg x fueledit the highest performance is achieved with fuel of  or more nitro content at least  oil  castorsynthetic is recommended acceptable performance can be had without nitromethane although the engine will be very sensitive to needle adjustments making it more difficult to operate with high nitromethane nitro fuel it may be necessary to lower the compression by installing up to six or more additional head gaskets when using castor oil it is advisable to clean the engine cylinder wall with a scotchbrite pad to remove castor oil varnish buildup that will occur especially after lean running this buildup of varnish will cause the engine to run inconsistently to avoid this problem it is advised to use a synthetic oil or synthetic and castor oil blend synthetic oil contains detergents that will keep the cylinder wall clean however these small engines do rely on some castor oil buildup to maintain high compression at higher running temperatures using clean fuel and keeping everything clean and free from dust and dirt particles is also very important for consistent running in

engines they were used in control line and free flight model planes as there was no market for throttled radio control engines back then radio control although first developed in the s it was not available for model airplanes until the s and did not become economically viable for small model planes until the mids and even then was for the modelers who could afford it it was certainly out of reach of the hands of most children from the mids cox produced throttle control devices for some of their engines however these were not as effective as throttles on other brand engines as the cox throttle worked by restricting exhaust flow exhaust throttles were produced for most bee and all medallion engines but not tee dee in  cox produced an engine with a true throttleable rc carburetor and that engine was the queen bee  in  cox produced the tee dee  and  both of which had a conventional rc carburetor with adjustable airbleed and a full muffler in  an after market rc throttlechoke has

became cox models on february   estes industries stopped producing cox engines and sold all of their remaining inventory ie mainly spare parts to several private buyers from canada and usa one of the new owners of the remaining cox engine and parts inventory has launched a website cox international with online store millions of engines were produced and they became the most common a class  cubic

entrepreneur leroy roy m cox cox manufacturing started out in leroys garage in  where he made wooden pop guns for kids and employed local housewives to assemble them metal was scarce due to the war which is why the toy guns were made of wood in  metal became readily available again and competitors quickly moved into the market making their metal pop guns cheaper so roy moved to something else making metal tether cars for kids in august  a fire in coxs garage forced him to move to newer and larger premises at  poinsettia ave santa ana california in  cox developed a racing car which used an engine manufactured by cameron brothers the cars sold for  and generated  in sales in their first year of production in  cox developed their own engine for their racing tether car which included some parts from mel andersons spitzy engine this engine was called the o forty five as it was  cubic inch displacement in  with sales of the car proving to be a success cox moved on to development of a model plane engine roy felt the need for dependable easytostart engines and spent the better part of the year  in research actually  months his three man engineering crew himself mark mier and bill fogler spent  days a week day and night to develop the ‘ space bug’ contest engine the end result was the space bug  contest engine coxs first model plane engine which was completed in october  in  first name change was made to lm cox manufacturing company inc the space bug engine sets the scene for all the cox engines that followed and it went into full production in  this engine was so popular that it caused problems for other model engine manufacturers in  cox produced their first ready to fly rtf airplane the td which was powered by the space bug engine in  leroy cox lm cox manufacturing is sued by jim walker american junior aircraft co for copyright infringement because cox was using walkers patented bellcrank system in the td and secondly because walker believed the cox skylon reel was a copy of his ureely control handle the court case lasted for  years in  cox wins the court case against jim walker walkers patent on the bellcrank control system is ruled void and invalid because it was determined that the system had been designed before walkers patent and by someone else  a man named oba stclair who was the first man to fly a control line airplane in the usa back in  and the design was published in  oba stclair had shown his design to jim walker who took it upon himself to patent the design the court also ruled that the cox reel was not a copyright infringement in  cox developed the babe bee  designed by william bill selzer which had an extruded aluminum crankcase not cast like the others this engine sold for just  and stamped the final nail in the coffin of many competitors whose engines were selling for substantially more the babe bee was a high quality high precision engine which started easily and was very reliable unlike some of the competition in  cox took over the flying circle at disneyland which was a major coup for the company the model planes were being flown each day in front of tens of thousands of people and they had a hobby shop right there full of cox rtf planes the cox flying circle  remained in operation until  when it was closed to make way for expansion of tomorrowland in  cox hired an engineer named bill atwood who had already build his own line of engines to develop a new  cubic inch engine atwood was also responsible for the tee dee and medallion line of engines these engines put cox on the map as a leading engine in the world for many years to come in  due to continuing growth the company moved to larger  square feet facilities which were three times larger than the old site shortly thereafter cox got into slot cars and focused attention on gearing up for this fad  cox international is established in hong kong to meet the demands of the slot car craze  the slot car fad ends leaving cox with excess stock that cannot be sold resulting in financial cash flow problems in  leroys wife myrtle died and leroy was having health problems of his own so he retired and sold the company to leisure dynamics inc leisure dynamics continued to expand the range of cox model aircraft as well as adding trains boats rockets kites and radio control boosting sales to  million dollars per year roy cox retired with the distinction of being the worlds most successful model engine manufacturer in  william h selzer was appointed as president of lm cox manufacturing inc a subsidiary of leisure dynamics in  leisure dynamics breaks the company in two and moves the model production to minnesota and leaves the engine production in santa ana california in  leisure dynamics changes the company name to cox hobbies inc in  leisure dynamics filed for bankruptcy taking cox hobbies inc with them in  leroy roy m cox died sept  age  in  former cox engineer and president bill selzer whom cox hired in  purchased the company out of bankruptcy all manufacturing was returned to santa ana the company once again flourished into the s with new products being added and another move to even bigger facilities in  cox hobbies moved to new facilities at corona california in  the company name changed again to cox products the pee wee babe bee and pt  trainer still in production in  cox celebrated  years and introduced some new engines and rtf models in  cox sold to estes industries  centuri corp and moved to penrose colorado things changed quite considerably from here on cox as the hobbyists of the world knew it had gone the high reputation cox engines had declined one by one each product item was withdrawn from sale as stock ran out engine parts from different engines were mixed and matched making hybrid engines that performed very poorly compared to the cox engines from previous years estes added new products to the cox line using the cox name however these were electric radio control models some of which were known to explode resulting in a massive product recall by the company in  an online company calling themselves cox hobby distributors owned by estes industries appeared selling rc and electric products and some of the classic engines and rtf models however as each item from the classic era sold out it wasnt replaced in feb  estes industries sold all of their remaining classic cox stock to several private buyers one of them being a small company from canada in june  they launched a website cox international to sell their remaining stock online and also via ebay in jan  estescox corporation purchased by hobbico based in champaign illinois in  cox international continue to revive the classic cox brand as well as introducing new engine versions spare parts and

inches  mm stroke  inches  mm displacement  cubic inches  cc borestroke ratio  oversquare the cox  engine is a stroke internal combustion glow plug engine these engines use a glow plug to heat the fuelair within the cylinder to start once running it is disconnected and operates in the same manner as a diesel engine the self ignition is due to the heat produced from the compression of the airfuel mix and the catalytic reaction of the platinum element in the glow plug and the methanol in the fuel and does not depend in any way upon the continued use of the battery fuel intake to the engine is controlled by a simple needle valve and venturi system fuelair mixture intake to the crankcase is controlled via a reed valve or rotary valve depending on the engine design in a reed valve engine the valve is drawn open by suction as the piston moves upward on the compression stroke as the piston moves down on the power stoke the pressure in the crankcase causes the reed valve to close the fuel air mixture in the crankcase is then forced past the piston via the transferbypass ports in the cylinder one characteristic of a reed valve is that the engine will run in either direction an advantage for a pusher model but a disadvantage if the engine is finger started as it may start in the wrong direction the cox engines employed a starting spring which kept fingers free of the propellor and generally ensured correct rotational direction on rotary valve engines the process is similar except instead of a reed a rotary valve is used incorporated in the crankshaft which opens and closes as the piston moves up and down the rotary valve is more efficient and adjustable at design time as there is a larger and clearer path to the crankcase than in the reed valve setup but such engines can run in only one direction pusher configurations require a special propeller sometimes difficult to find the fuel used to power the engine is called model engine fuel a mixture of methanol  castor oil  and nitromethane  the cox line of reed valve engines designed prior to  used a rear reed valve induction system in the late s they played around with rear rotary valve induction as used in

cheaper to make than the original space bug tank the tank itself is turned aluminium while the tank back is red yellow or blue plastic from the space bug junior but is modified to include an aluminium pickup tube and a larger hole to expose the venturi that is integral to the aluminium tank the later babe bee tank was simply a further developed version of this tank this engine was only produced

babe bee was the first engine cox produced with an extruded machined anodized bar stock aluminum crankcase this crankcase was machine made and was much cheaper and faster to make than the cast aluminum crankcase of the earlier models this engine was also supplied in thousands of rtf ready to fly airplanes sold in department stores worldwide it has an integrated cc fuel tank max output power was recorded around  bhp  watts   rpm on  nitro  pee wee  cat  manufactured feb jan  buoyed with excitement of the babe bee  leroy wanted to make a half size version of the babe bee so he did and they called it a pee wee  just like a babe bee only half the size  golden bee cat  manufactured oct jan  custom built golden bee  the golden bee is a baby bee that has a larger cc stunt vented fuel tank and has been anodized gold the larger tank allowed the planes to fly longer while the stunt vents allowed the airplanes to fly inverted without fuel running out or the engine cutting out the first versions of the golden bee had a single bypass intake port but later versions had two bypass ports making them slightly more powerful  qz cat  manufactured  qz stands for quiet zone it is a babe bee with a muffler twin bypass port cylinder with no sub piston induction and a high compression  glow head an attempt to regain the power loss caused by the muffler very similar to the later qrc engine which reportedly worked better cox also sold the muffler cylinder and high comp glow head components of the qz as a muffler conversion kit cat for   qrc cat  manufactured  the qrc was a modified babe bee engine that had a muffler and larger cc fuel tank in the s noise became an issue and the cox engineers discovered that when adding a muffler the engine would lose significant power this problem was alleviated by installing a cylinder with no sub piston induction the engine was designed for power launching radio controlled gliders and had a red tank with a blue spinner  rc bee cat  manufactured  this engine was designed for small radio controlled model planes it has a plastic clunk tank and an unusual cast crankcase the leisure dynamics team thought that cast crankcases would be cheaper to produce however they discovered that there were many manufacturing defects and they were difficult to machine resulting in a high failure rate so they returned to the tried and proven machined aluminum bar stock crankcase  dragon fly cat  manufactured  this engine was designed for the radio controlled model planes it is basically a baby bee with a clunk tank and a muffler throttle  texaco cat  manufactured  the is engine was designed for a texaco rc duration competition the engine has an additional fin on the larger glow plug which dissipates heat better allowing the engine to swing a larger propeller ie  or  inches this engine has a red cc fuel tank and a black crankcase original  engines did not come out with  fin glow plug the  fin glow plug came later in the  catalog  texaco jnr cat  manufactured  the same engine as the texaco above except that it has a smaller cc fuel tank which is also red first appeared in  cox catalog highperformance beesedit  rr cat  manufactured  the rare cox rr the rr uses a rear rotary valve intake rather than a reed valve in an attempt to achieve more power the engine came after the babe bee and looks very similar with its anodized machined extruded aluminum crank case and fuel tank the power improvement was negligible so cox reverted to the cheaper easier to build babe bee the engine was made for quite a few years and sold for  a left and right hand rotary valve was made as were left hand x glass filled nylon props for the rr some versions have a blue tank others have a clear anodized tank there were two versions of the tank back as well to fit the corresponding tank it has become a collectors item due to its uniqueness and pretty colors and is worth around  in   space hopper cat  manufactured nov  the space hopper was coxs first attempt at a beam mount high performance reed valve engine plus the first steps towards their greatest engine the tee dee series the engine was basically like the thermal hopper was to a space bug that is a babe bee without a tank but a venturi and needle valve relying on an external fuel tank the engine looks similar to the sportsman engine with a machined aluminium crankcase and rear induction via a reed valve with the needle valve assembly and venturi similar in appearance to the later tee dee series this engine was short lived and made way for the tee dee in  due to their similarities to the tee dee that followed some of the parts crossed over from this engine to the tee dee they look very retro and due to their apparent rareness are worth around us in  cox black widow  black widow cat  manufactured may jan  during the s a couple of cox engineers were playing around with different coloured babe bee and golden bee parts and came up with an allblack engine with a red spinner they hopped it up a bit with a dual bypass cylinder from a super bee  a black golden bee tank and a slightly larger  venturi intake the black widow was born these engines were marketed as a high powered combat engine on later black widows the red rubber spinner was replaced by a red anodized aluminum tee dee style spinner in the late s some black widows were produced with the a dual bypass slit exhaust cylinder the slit exhaust was to prevent fires according to an aeromodeller engine test done in august  the black widow on  nitro output power was  bhp  watts at  rpm with a max torque of  ozin at  rpm  killer bee  cat  manufactured  the killer bee was an attempt at making a fast reed valve  engine from information that had been learned over the years of racing and competition it had a tapered cylinder with spi and lighter piston similar to the tee dee a stronger balanced crankshaft and a new reed valve shape they had a yellow plastic needle valve later in  estes produced a killer bee that had none of these features but looked like the original killer bee except for the needle valve beware of fakes some unscrupulous people are producing fakes and selling them check to make sure the engine is the real deal before purchasing  killer bee  cat  manufactured  the killer bee  existed so that modellers could fly the same plane in two competition classes ie a and a simply by changing the engine this engine has exactly the same performance as the  there is a legend that two thin lines or grooves in the piston skirt are for positive identification but this is incorrect the grooves were intentionally designed to bleed off just enough power so that the  increase in displacement does not necessitate trim changes to a free flight model when switching the model from an  to the  to fly in the higher a class the benefit of the grooves as a visual identifier was accidental  venom cat  manufactured  cox venom with galbreathnelson head the venom was coxs last attempt at making a really fast  mouse racing engine again taken from ideas learned from years of competition this engine put all those ideas into an off the shelf product it used the killer bee crank shaft loosely fitted into the crankcase and a cylinder with porting very similar tee dee cylinder and tapered like the tee dee and with a lightened piston like the tee dee the rest of it was like a black widow the problem was that the production engine was not the same as the prototype a mistake had been made in manufacturing and the piston was lightened too much this made the engine fast but the piston weak and they would blow the top off the piston after a few runs at high speed as such only  were made and they never bothered to make any more because of that and all the fakes they are not worth a lot of money  beware of fakes some unscrupulous people are producing fakes and selling them check to make sure the engine is the real deal before purchasing tee deesedit the famous cox tee dee  and   tee dee  cat  manufactured nov jan  the tee dee is coxs most famous engine this engine was dominant in competition for many years it was designed by bill atwood who had been hired by cox specifically to produce the tee dee line of competition engines the important features of the tee dee are as follows tapered cylinder and a lightened and tapered piston result tighter piston fit at tdc and less piston mass two deep bypass ports with two bypass booster grooves known as side flutes on each bypass port extending slightly above the main bypass groove result significantly better air fuel mixture induction true peripheral venturi result more efficient fuel intake fuel draw and induction precision balanced and milled crankshaft result better fuel intake better balanced engine the tee dee was tested by aeromodeller magazine in  and the output power was recorded to be  bhp  watts   rpm with a max torque of  ozin at  rpm on  nitro note the modern norvel ame  engine which has an aluminum piston running in a ceramic coated cylinder outputs  bhp  watts  rpm in  the bypass porting crank shaft timing and venturi were modified slightly and a mesh screen was added to the venturi to keep out dirt this resulted in a minor performance improvement over the earlier versions a hopped up cox tee dee   tee dee  cat  manufactured oct jan  the  was simply a class a version of the engine physically the same on the outside only the bore was different and the piston had a small groove in the skirt to bleed off just enough power to exactly equal an  so no trim changes would be required to free flight models citation required this groove also visually differentiates the  from the  but this was of secondary importance the  also had a red carb body  tee dee  rc cat  manufactured  this engine had a proper rc carby and a full sized standard muffler and was designed specifically for rc flying it had no sub piston induction only two production runs of  each were done so there are only  of these in existence making them the second rarest production engine next to the venom note although the box said tee dee  the engine is actually  a cox tee dee  rc an  rc version also exists cat   manufactured  also  tee dee      cox also built tee dees in  cat  cat  cat and  cat size all these engines were very successful the original tee dee  immediately became the engine to use in fai ff with vastly higher performance than the olympic which had supplanted the european diesels used at the time they proved fragile particularly the thinwall cylinder and ballandsocket connecting rod and were replaced by beefedup versions as noted below one of the things cox wanted atwood to do was make him a  engine cox had already tried to halve the size of the pee wee  but couldnt get it to run for some reason the suspicion surrounded a problem with the tiny reed valve atwood found that the front rotary valve worked well on the  size hence the  was born medallionsedit  medallion  cat  manufactured nov jan  cox medallion  also known as the poor mans tee dee these were similar to the tee dee in appearance but had cheaper parts on them making them cheaper to buy the cylinder was a non tapered twin bypass with no boost ports like the one used on the black widow the crank shaft was drilled out rather than milled like the tee dee and the carb body was a one piece unit with a conventional needle valve and spray bar these engines were marketed as a sport  stunt engine as they were much tamer and much less cantankerous than the tee dee these are a great reliable easy to use little engine even today they can be purchased for under us in  rc versions of this engine were also produced with exhaust throttle ie  cat and the  cat with mufflerthrottle  medallion    the medallion engine was also produced in cat and cat  cubic inch size there were also rc versions of these ie cat medallion  rc and cat medallion  rc  medallion  manufactured  cox medallion  this particular  came about when a special order for  medallions was placed on cox by the national free flight society in the usa it was a gentlemans agreement done on a handshake and it nearly didnt happen when cox was sold to estes but the determination of the nffs resulted in the deal happening however estescox only came through with  engines the nffs engraved each engine with a serial number and kept a record of who purchased each engine these are probably the rarest of all cox engines due to the small size of the production run these engines have a unique piston and cylinder setup that occurs on no other cox engine before or after the cylinder has a straight bore  inches slit exhaust no sub piston induction product enginesedit these are all variations of the baby bee with different

cox engine for fai racing combat and free flight for many more years until the russian aac engines came along this engine was patterned on the australian designed  taipan cc twin ball race engine by gordon burford the entire top end of the cox conquest and the taipan tbr are interchangeable the taipan tbr was based on the rossi mkii so the top end is also interchangeable with a rossi mkii also came in rc version cat  as a result of reorganisation within leisure dynamics who owned cox and kb at the time production of this engine was handed over to kb and it became known as the kb conquest after  production continued for a number of years when the engine was sold to mecoa owned by randy linsalato where it continued on as the rjl conquest for some time  cox conquest   prototyped only

listed in cox  catalog cylindersedit there was a wide range of cylinders produced with three different wall thicknesses most are interchangeable between all engine types which can create problems when buying a used engine all early cylinders had a thin wall which was later found to need improvement because they bent easily in a crash or when trying to undo with a cox wrench some people refer to these as mk cylinders the next type was thickened at the exhaust ports and are also known by some people as mk the third type was thick wall the way down from the cooling fins to the bottom this one facilitated the exhaust throttle ring and some people refer to this as a mk although cox never referred to them like this note the chart does not differentiate between specific modifications and changes made over the years as the company changed hands cox  cylinder crosssections cox venom cylinder referring to the cylinder crosssections above depicts a thin wall tee dee  cylinder with dual booster ports on the bypass port is a late model thick wall cylinder with slit exhaust and a single bypass booster is a black widow  cylinder with no bypass booster with a stepped wall is a pre cylinder used on early space bug space bug jr thermal hopper and strato bug note how the thread diameter for the glow head is much smaller no engines produced after  used this cylinder the most powerful cylinder piston combination without a doubt is the number  tee dee  cylinder this cylinder has a tapered grind and tapered and lightened piston so the piston fit gets tighter as the piston reaches top dead center tdc the intake or bypass porting is  deep ports with  bypass booster ports on each bypass this setup causes a swirling of the intake fuel air mixture which promotes better

dee also had a tapered cylinder and the crank was stronger and ported different from the medallion crank pistonsedit cox pistons pre and post  the early engines that were produced before  had a light alloy piston rod which is retained in its socket by a slotted steel retaining cup which in turn is held in place by a steel circlip located in a shallow groove in the interior piston wall this arrangement known as a threepiece piston was abandoned as of  in favour of a hardened steel rod which was swaged into a bearing cup formed integrally in the piston interior the advantage of this latter setup was that it simplified assembly and the bearing could be reset to take up play using a suitable reset tool to reswage the cup the engines that used the earlystyle threepiece piston are any engines produced prior to  ie space bug space bug jnr thermal hopper and strato bug since the space bug space bug jr and thermal hopper where produced up until  you will find versions of these early engines around with the laterstyle pistons and cylinders cox reset tool the post piston is coated with copper on the inside and top this was done to prevent the nitrile hardening process from hardening the ball socket joint area the outside wall of the piston was then finely machined and polished to produce a chromed appearance piston  conrod ball socket joint free playedit sometimes especially with engines that have had a lot of use the piston  conrod ball socket joint is very loose and will adversely affect performance a cox “reset” tool available for the    and the  series engines is used to tighten the ball joint back up again the correct free play is  to  inches the  engines use a wrist pin so a socket reset tool is not required for these crankshaftsedit babe bee left  killer bee right on the bee engines there were  types of crankshaft produced and theyre interchangeable all bees with the exception of the killer bee and venom had the same crankshaft that was only good for about  rpm before the conrod pin would break off the killer bees and venom had a heavy duty balanced and lightened crankshaft that improved performance and could withstand speeds in excess of  rpm a company named davis diesel development in the usa also make a similar crankshaft called a killer crank for their diesel conversions they found under the heavier torque loads caused by running diesel fuel that the pins would break also hence they produced their own killer crank the same killer cranks are now being produced again by cox international on the tee dees and medallions the cranks are also interchangeable but quite different the tee dee has a large square hole at the intake end of the crank whereas the medallion has a smaller round hole the timing is also different on the later td rc versions the crankshaft is lightened and strengthened similar to the killer bee crank ie ground away and hole in conrod pin glow headsedit cox glow headsedit there were  main types of cox glow

propellersedit  engines run well on a x to x prop a x apc works well to get any suitable speed for mouse racing a  inch pitch prop is required at high revs but to do this plenty of nitromethane is also required for example a  x  prop with  nitro texaco engines are designed to use bigger props eg x fueledit the highest performance is achieved with fuel of  or more nitro content at least  oil  castorsynthetic is recommended acceptable performance can be had without nitromethane although the engine will be very sensitive to needle adjustments making it more difficult to operate with high nitromethane nitro fuel it may be necessary to lower the compression by installing up to six or more additional head gaskets when using castor oil it is advisable to clean the engine cylinder wall with a scotchbrite pad to remove castor oil varnish buildup that will occur especially after lean running this buildup of varnish will cause the engine to run inconsistently to avoid this problem it is advised to use a synthetic oil or synthetic and castor oil blend synthetic oil contains detergents that will keep the cylinder wall clean however these small engines do rely on some castor oil buildup to maintain high compression at higher running temperatures using clean fuel and keeping everything clean and free from dust and dirt particles is also very important for consistent running in

available for model airplanes until the s and did not become economically viable for small model planes until the mids and even then was for the modelers who could afford it it was certainly out of reach of the hands of most children from the mids cox produced throttle control devices for some of their engines however these were not as effective as throttles on other brand engines as the cox throttle worked by restricting exhaust flow exhaust throttles were produced for most bee and all medallion engines but not tee dee in  cox produced an engine with a true throttleable rc carburetor and

became cox models on february   estes industries stopped producing cox engines and sold all of their remaining inventory ie mainly spare parts to several private buyers from canada and usa one of the new owners of the remaining cox engine and parts inventory has launched a website cox international with online store millions of engines were produced and they became the most common a class  cubic

entrepreneur leroy roy m cox cox manufacturing started out in leroys garage in  where he made wooden pop guns for kids and employed local housewives to assemble them metal was scarce due to the war which is why the toy guns were made of wood in  metal became readily available again and competitors quickly moved into the market making their metal pop guns cheaper so roy moved to something else making metal tether cars for kids in august  a fire in coxs garage forced him to move to newer and larger premises at  poinsettia ave santa ana california in  cox developed a racing car which used an engine manufactured by cameron brothers the cars sold for  and generated  in sales in their first year of production in  cox developed their own engine for their racing tether car which included some parts from mel andersons spitzy engine this engine was called the o forty five as it was  cubic inch displacement in  with sales of the car proving to be a success cox moved on to development of a model plane engine roy felt the need for dependable easytostart engines and spent the better part of the year  in research actually  months his three man engineering crew himself mark mier and bill fogler spent  days a week day and night to develop the ‘ space bug’ contest engine the end result was the space bug  contest engine coxs first model plane engine which was completed in october  in  first name change was made to lm cox manufacturing company inc the space bug engine sets the scene for all the cox engines that followed and it went into full production in  this engine was so popular that it caused problems for other model engine manufacturers in  cox produced their first ready to fly rtf airplane the td which was powered by the space bug engine in  leroy cox lm cox manufacturing is sued by jim walker american junior aircraft co for copyright infringement because cox was using walkers patented bellcrank system in the td and secondly because walker believed the cox skylon reel was a copy of his ureely control handle the court case lasted for  years in  cox wins the court case against jim walker walkers patent on the bellcrank control system is ruled void and invalid because it was determined that the system had been designed before walkers patent and by someone else  a man named oba stclair who was the first man to fly a control line airplane in the usa back in  and the design was published in  oba stclair had shown his design to jim walker who took it upon himself to patent the design the court also ruled that the cox reel was not a copyright infringement in  cox developed the babe bee  designed by william bill selzer which had an extruded aluminum crankcase not cast like the others this engine sold for just  and stamped the final nail in the coffin of many competitors whose engines were selling for substantially more the babe bee was a high quality high precision engine which started easily and was very reliable unlike some of the competition in  cox took over the flying circle at disneyland which was a major coup for the company the model planes were being flown each day in front of tens of thousands of people and they had a hobby shop right there full of cox rtf planes the cox flying circle  remained in operation until  when it was closed to make way for expansion of tomorrowland in  cox hired an engineer named bill atwood who had already build his own line of engines to develop a new  cubic inch engine atwood was also responsible for the tee dee and medallion line of engines these engines put cox on the map as a leading engine in the world for many years to come in  due to continuing growth the company moved to larger  square feet facilities which were three times larger than the old site shortly thereafter cox got into slot cars and focused attention on gearing up for this fad  cox international is established in hong kong to meet the demands of the slot car craze  the slot car fad ends leaving cox with excess stock that cannot be sold resulting in financial cash flow problems in  leroys wife myrtle died and leroy was having health problems of his own so he retired and sold the company to leisure dynamics inc leisure dynamics continued to expand the range of cox model aircraft as well as adding trains boats rockets kites and radio control boosting sales to  million dollars per year roy cox retired with the distinction of being the worlds most successful model engine manufacturer in  william h selzer was appointed as president of lm cox manufacturing inc a subsidiary of leisure dynamics in  leisure dynamics breaks the company in two and moves the model production to minnesota and leaves the engine production in santa ana california in  leisure dynamics changes the company name to cox hobbies inc in  leisure dynamics filed for bankruptcy taking cox hobbies inc with them in  leroy roy m cox died sept  age  in  former cox engineer and president bill selzer whom cox hired in  purchased the company out of bankruptcy all manufacturing was returned to santa ana the company once again flourished into the s with new products being added and another move to even bigger facilities in  cox hobbies moved to new facilities at corona california in  the company name changed again to cox products the pee wee babe bee and pt  trainer still in production in  cox celebrated  years and introduced some new engines and rtf models in  cox sold to estes industries  centuri corp and moved to penrose colorado things changed quite considerably from here on cox as the hobbyists of the world knew it had gone the high reputation cox engines had declined one by one each product item was withdrawn from sale as stock ran out engine parts from different engines were mixed and matched making hybrid engines that performed very poorly compared to the cox engines from previous years estes added new products to the cox line using the cox name however these were electric radio control models some of which were known to explode resulting in a massive product recall by the company in  an online company calling themselves cox hobby distributors owned by estes industries appeared selling rc and electric products and some of the classic engines and rtf models however as each item from the classic era sold out it wasnt replaced in feb  estes industries sold all of their remaining classic cox stock to several private buyers one of them being a small company from canada in june  they launched a website cox international to sell their remaining stock online and also via ebay in jan  estescox corporation purchased by hobbico based in champaign illinois in  cox international continue to revive the classic cox brand as well as introducing new engine versions spare parts and accessories the enginesedit cox  engine specifications all cox  engines bore  inches  mm stroke  inches  mm displacement  cubic inches  cc borestroke ratio  oversquare cox  engine specifications bore  inches  mm stroke  inches  mm displacement  cubic inches  cc borestroke ratio  oversquare the cox  engine is a stroke internal combustion glow plug engine these engines use a glow plug to heat the fuelair within the cylinder to start once running it is disconnected and operates in the same manner as a diesel engine the self ignition is due to the heat produced from the compression of the airfuel mix and the catalytic reaction of the platinum element in the glow plug and the methanol in the fuel and does not depend in any way upon the continued use of the battery fuel intake to the engine is controlled by a simple needle valve and venturi system fuelair mixture intake to the crankcase is controlled via a reed valve or rotary valve depending on the engine design in a reed valve engine the valve is drawn open by suction as the piston moves upward on the compression stroke as the piston moves down on the power stoke the pressure in the crankcase causes the reed valve to close the fuel air mixture in the crankcase is then forced past the piston via the transferbypass ports in the cylinder one characteristic of a reed valve is that the engine will run in either direction an advantage for a pusher model but a disadvantage if the engine is finger started as it may start in the wrong direction the cox engines employed a starting spring which kept fingers free of the propellor and generally ensured correct rotational direction on rotary valve engines the process is similar except instead of a reed a rotary valve is used incorporated in the crankshaft which opens and closes as the piston moves up and down the rotary valve is more efficient and adjustable at design time as there is a larger and clearer path to the crankcase than in the reed valve setup but such engines can run in only one direction pusher configurations require a special propeller sometimes difficult to find the fuel used to power the engine is called model engine fuel a mixture of methanol  castor oil  and nitromethane  the cox line of reed valve engines designed prior to  used a rear reed valve induction system in the late s they played around with rear rotary valve induction as used in the rr before moving forward with front rotary valve induction for their tee dee and medallion lines early enginesedit cox thimble drome space bug  o forty five power pak special racer car engine pp  manufactured  this engine was the first designed by cox but included some major parts ie piston and cylinder of the spitzy  engine designed by mel anderson it employed a twin reed valve which was later used for the space bug the engine was a major engineering achievement for its time by incorporating reduction gears fuel tank flywheel and muffler all into one power pak the air intake was via one of the axles  o sixty power pak special racer car engine   manufactured  when slightly more power was needed for the thimble drome special car to obtain more speed a slightly larger version of the  was ordered with a bigger bore making the displacement  cubic inches  space bug cat  manufactured  the space bug was the first engine built entirely by cox it was designed for control line flying use only and was marketed as a competition engine and sold for  back then there was no market for radio control and free flight hadnt been considered by cox at this time the piston and cylinder were made from mild steel bar stock and the crankcase and fuel tank were cast aluminum  thermal hopper cat  manufactured  the thermal hopper is basically a space bug without the fuel tank it has a needle valve and venturi mounted on an aluminum plate instead these were designed for free flight and could also be used for control line flying it allowed the user to put a fuel tank of their choosing on the engine output was recorded at  bhp   rpm with a torque of  ozin at  rpm cox thimble drome thermal hopper  space bug jnr cat  manufactured  the space bug junior is a space bug with a smaller plastic tank this cheaper version also only had one intake bypass port and sold for   strato bug cat  manufactured  basically the same engine as a space bug but included a two piece fuel tank which was cheaper to make than the original space bug tank the tank itself is turned aluminium while the tank back is red yellow or blue plastic from the space bug junior but is modified to include an aluminium pickup tube and a larger hole to expose the venturi that is integral to the aluminium tank the later babe bee tank was simply a further developed version of this tank this engine was only produced during  and sold as a mid range sport engine for  as such not many exist today which makes them very rare and collectible selling for over us in  and  in  beware of fakes some unscrupulous sellers have been selling fake strato bugs that have a cnc machined tank and a space bug junior backplate standard beesedit cox babe bee left golden bee right  babe bee  cat  manufactured nov jan  the classic babe bee was the first engine cox produced with an extruded machined anodized bar stock aluminum crankcase this crankcase was machine made and was much cheaper and faster to make than the cast aluminum crankcase of the earlier models this engine was also supplied in thousands of rtf ready to fly airplanes sold in department stores worldwide it has an integrated cc fuel tank max output power was recorded around  bhp  watts   rpm on  nitro  pee wee  cat  manufactured feb jan  buoyed with excitement of the babe bee  leroy wanted to make a half size version of the babe bee so he did and they called it a pee wee  just like a babe bee only half the size  golden bee cat  manufactured oct jan  custom built golden bee  the golden bee is a baby bee that has a larger cc stunt vented fuel tank and has been anodized gold the larger tank allowed the planes to fly longer while the stunt vents allowed the airplanes to fly inverted without fuel running out or the engine cutting out the first versions of the golden bee had a single bypass intake port but later versions had two bypass ports making them slightly more powerful  qz cat  manufactured  qz stands for quiet zone it is a babe bee with a muffler twin bypass port cylinder with no sub piston induction and a high compression  glow head an attempt to regain the power loss caused by the muffler very similar to the later qrc engine which reportedly worked better cox also sold the muffler cylinder and high comp glow head components of the qz as a muffler conversion kit cat for   qrc cat  manufactured  the qrc was a modified babe bee engine that had a muffler and larger cc fuel tank in the s noise became an issue and the cox engineers discovered that when adding a muffler the engine would lose significant power this problem was alleviated by installing a cylinder with no sub piston induction the engine was designed for power launching radio controlled gliders and had a red tank with a blue spinner  rc bee cat  manufactured  this engine was designed for small radio controlled model planes it has a plastic clunk tank and an unusual cast crankcase the leisure dynamics team thought that cast crankcases would be cheaper to produce however they discovered that there were many manufacturing defects and they were difficult to machine resulting in a high failure rate so they returned to the tried and proven machined aluminum bar stock crankcase  dragon fly cat  manufactured  this engine was designed for the radio controlled model planes it is basically a baby bee with a clunk tank and a muffler throttle  texaco cat  manufactured  the is engine was designed for a texaco rc duration competition the engine has an additional fin on the larger glow plug which dissipates heat better allowing the engine to swing a larger propeller ie  or  inches this engine has a red cc fuel tank and a black crankcase original  engines did not come out with  fin glow plug the  fin glow plug came later in the  catalog  texaco jnr cat  manufactured  the same engine as the texaco above except that it has a smaller cc fuel tank which is also red first appeared in  cox catalog highperformance beesedit  rr cat  manufactured  the rare cox rr the rr uses a rear rotary valve intake rather than a reed valve in an attempt to achieve more power the engine came after the babe bee and looks very similar with its anodized machined extruded aluminum crank case and fuel tank the power improvement was negligible so cox reverted to the cheaper easier to build babe bee the engine was made for quite a few years and sold for  a left and right hand rotary valve was made as were left hand x glass filled nylon props for the rr some versions have a blue tank others have a clear anodized tank there were two versions of the tank back as well to fit the corresponding tank it has become a collectors item due to its uniqueness and pretty colors and is worth around  in   space hopper cat  manufactured nov  the space hopper was coxs first attempt at a beam mount high performance reed valve engine plus the first steps towards their greatest engine the tee dee series the engine was basically like the thermal hopper was to a space bug that is a babe bee without a tank but a venturi and needle valve relying on an external fuel tank the engine looks similar to the sportsman engine with a machined aluminium crankcase and rear induction via a reed valve with the needle valve assembly and venturi similar in appearance to the later tee dee series this engine was short lived and made way for the tee dee in  due to their similarities to the tee dee that followed some of the parts crossed over from this engine to the tee dee they look very retro and due to their apparent rareness are worth around us in  cox black widow  black widow cat  manufactured may jan  during the s a couple of cox engineers were playing around with different coloured babe bee and golden bee parts and came up with an allblack engine with a red spinner they hopped it up a bit with a dual bypass cylinder from a super bee  a black golden bee tank and a slightly larger  venturi intake the black widow was born these engines were marketed as a high powered combat engine on later black widows the red rubber spinner was replaced by a red anodized aluminum tee dee style spinner in the late s some black widows were produced with the a dual bypass slit exhaust cylinder the slit exhaust was to prevent fires according to an aeromodeller engine test done in august  the black widow on  nitro output power was  bhp  watts at  rpm with a max torque of  ozin at  rpm  killer bee  cat  manufactured  the killer bee was an attempt at making a fast reed valve  engine from information that had been learned over the years of racing and competition it had a tapered cylinder with spi and lighter piston similar to the tee dee a stronger balanced crankshaft and a new reed valve shape they had a yellow plastic needle valve later in  estes produced a killer bee that had none of these features but looked like the original killer bee except for the needle valve beware of fakes some unscrupulous people are producing fakes and selling them check to make sure the engine is the real deal before purchasing  killer bee  cat  manufactured  the killer bee  existed so that modellers could fly the same plane in two competition classes ie a and a simply by changing the engine this engine has exactly the same performance as the  there is a legend that two thin lines or grooves in the piston skirt are for positive identification but this is incorrect the grooves were intentionally designed to bleed off just enough power so that the  increase in displacement does not necessitate trim changes to a free flight model when switching the model from an  to the  to fly in the higher a class the benefit of the grooves as a visual identifier was accidental  venom cat  manufactured  cox venom with galbreathnelson head the venom was coxs last attempt at making a really fast  mouse racing engine again taken from ideas learned from years of competition this engine put all those ideas into an off the shelf product it used the killer bee crank shaft loosely fitted into the crankcase and a cylinder with porting very similar tee dee cylinder and tapered like the tee dee and with a lightened piston like the tee dee the rest of it was like a black widow the problem was that the production engine was not the same as the prototype a mistake had been made in manufacturing and the piston was lightened too much this made the engine fast but the piston weak and they would blow the top off the piston after a few runs at high speed as such only  were made and they never bothered to make any more because of that and all the fakes they are not worth a lot of money  beware of fakes some unscrupulous people are producing fakes and selling them check to make sure the engine is the real deal before purchasing tee deesedit the famous cox tee dee  and   tee dee  cat  manufactured nov jan  the tee dee is coxs most famous engine this engine was dominant in competition for many years it was designed by bill atwood who had been hired by cox specifically to produce the tee dee line of competition engines the important features of the tee dee are as follows tapered cylinder and a lightened and tapered piston result tighter piston fit at tdc and less piston mass two deep bypass ports with two bypass booster grooves known as side flutes on each bypass port extending slightly above the main bypass groove result significantly better air fuel mixture induction true peripheral venturi result more efficient fuel intake fuel draw and induction precision balanced and milled crankshaft result better fuel intake better balanced engine the tee dee was tested by aeromodeller magazine in  and the output power was recorded to be  bhp  watts   rpm with a max torque of  ozin at  rpm on  nitro note the modern norvel ame  engine which has an aluminum piston running in a ceramic coated cylinder outputs  bhp  watts  rpm in  the bypass porting crank shaft timing and venturi were modified slightly and a mesh screen was added to the venturi to keep out dirt this resulted in a minor performance improvement over the earlier versions a hopped up cox tee dee   tee dee  cat  manufactured oct jan  the  was simply a class a version of the engine physically the same on the outside only the bore was different and the piston had a small groove in the skirt to bleed off just enough power to exactly equal an  so no trim changes would be required to free flight models citation required this groove also visually differentiates the  from the  but this was of secondary importance the  also had a red carb body  tee dee  rc cat  manufactured  this engine had a proper rc carby and a full sized standard muffler and was designed specifically for rc flying it had no sub piston induction only two production runs of  each were done so there are only  of these in existence making them the second rarest production engine next to the venom note although the box said tee dee  the engine is actually  a cox tee dee  rc an  rc version also exists cat   manufactured  also  tee dee      cox also built tee dees in  cat  cat  cat and  cat size all these engines were very successful the original tee dee  immediately became the engine to use in fai ff with vastly higher performance than the olympic which had supplanted the european diesels used at the time they proved fragile particularly the thinwall cylinder and ballandsocket connecting rod and were replaced by beefedup versions as noted below one of the things cox wanted atwood to do was make him a  engine cox had already tried to halve the size of the pee wee  but couldnt get it to run for some reason the suspicion surrounded a problem with the tiny reed valve atwood found that the front rotary valve worked well on the  size hence the  was born medallionsedit  medallion  cat  manufactured nov jan  cox medallion  also known as the poor mans tee dee these were similar to the tee dee in appearance but had cheaper parts on them making them cheaper to buy the cylinder was a non tapered twin bypass with no boost ports like the one used on the black widow the crank shaft was drilled out rather than milled like the tee dee and the carb body was a one piece unit with a conventional needle valve and spray bar these engines were marketed as a sport  stunt engine as they were much tamer and much less cantankerous than the tee dee these are a great reliable easy to use little engine even today they can be purchased for under us in  rc versions of this engine were also produced with exhaust throttle ie  cat and the  cat with mufflerthrottle  medallion    the medallion engine was also produced in cat and cat  cubic inch size there were also rc versions of these ie cat medallion  rc and cat medallion  rc  medallion  manufactured  cox medallion  this particular  came about when a special order for  medallions was placed on cox by the national free flight society in the usa it was a gentlemans agreement done on a handshake and it nearly didnt happen when cox was sold to estes but the determination of the nffs resulted in the deal happening however estescox only came through with  engines the nffs engraved each engine with a serial number and kept a record of who purchased each engine these are probably the rarest of all cox engines due to the small size of the production run these engines have a unique piston and cylinder setup that occurs on no other cox engine before or after the cylinder has a straight bore  inches slit exhaust no sub piston induction product enginesedit these are all variations of the baby bee with different backplates and other parts designed for different rtf aircraft cars and boats there were literally hundreds of different models with subtle differences listed below are just a few of the more common ones  super bee cat  babe bee with twin bypass cylinder to give more power for the p warhawk rtf model early version had p stamped on the cylinder it had a standard babe bee tank  silver bee cat  similar to the super bee but it had a larger cc nonvented fuel tank it did not have p stamped on the cylinder but it did have the twin bypass ports this engine came with the spitfire rtf airplane  series x product engine catx manufactured  to  babe bee type engine with postage stamp type delrin backplate and brass needle valve instead of the integral babe bee fuel tank various shapes were used depending on the model they were fitted to each time they made a modification for a new model that was built a new cat number was produced eg  some had dual bypass port cylinders while others had single it depended on the airplane eg jud stuka p bendix racer p mustang  miss america models  series x product engine catx manufactured  to  babe bee type engine with horseshoe type delrin backplate and brass needle valve the horseshoe backplate had additional mounting holes drilled in the plate allowed fitting to after market and kit aircraft various shapes and colours were produced depending on the model they were fitted to some had dual bypass port cylinders while others had single it depended on the airplane eg sopwith camel fokker dvii me super stunter pt trainer and others produced in

engine   surestart cat another variation of the modern babe bee these were pretty good because they have a choke tube attached to the grey plastic backplate the choke tube makes the engine even easier to start they were fitted to the very last rtfs eg pt and hyper viper before they went out of production original equipment manufacturer oem enginesedit over the years some cox model engines were sold to other companies for use in their products and sold under the other companies names examples of these companies were testor corporation sanwa  kyosho of japan johannes graupner of germany jerobee industries trading as jomac products lite machine corporation kenbrite corp australia and tissan haifa in israel of all of the above mentioned companies only tissan haifa assembled their own engines called the banana  all the rest used motor manufactured by cox themselves  cox banana  cat this engine looked like a standard product engine with plastic backplate it also had a spring starter red aluminium spinner and the fuel intake tube was extended below the plastic backplate cox also supplied a specially printed banana  box insert to fit their standard box other cox enginesedit cox

cox engine for fai racing combat and free flight for many more years until the russian aac engines came along this engine was patterned on the australian designed  taipan cc twin ball race engine by gordon burford the entire top end of the cox conquest and the taipan tbr are interchangeable the taipan tbr was based on the rossi mkii so the top end is also interchangeable with a rossi mkii also came in rc version cat  as a result of reorganisation within leisure dynamics who owned cox and kb at the time production of this engine was handed over to kb and it became known as the kb conquest after  production continued for a number of years when the engine was sold to mecoa owned by randy linsalato where it continued on as the rjl conquest for some time  cox conquest   prototyped only samples do exist and the conquest  was a grown up version of the conquest  however due to reorganisation with leisure dynamics who owned cox and kb at the time it was decided not to commence production as kb already had a  sized engine in the market  queen bee  rccat  manufactured  rear reed valve rc engine uses a standard glow plug power output is similar to tee dee  came out mid  and is listed in cox  catalog cylindersedit there was a wide range of cylinders produced with three different wall thicknesses most are interchangeable between all engine types which can create problems when buying a used engine all early cylinders had a thin wall which was later found to need improvement because they bent easily in a crash or when trying to undo with a cox wrench some people refer to these as mk cylinders the next type was thickened at the exhaust ports and are also known by some people as mk the third type was thick wall the way down from the cooling fins to the bottom this one facilitated the exhaust throttle ring and some people refer to this as a mk although cox never referred to them like this note the chart does not differentiate between specific modifications and changes made over the years as the company changed hands cox  cylinder crosssections cox venom cylinder referring to the cylinder crosssections above depicts a thin wall tee dee  cylinder with dual booster ports on the bypass port is a late model thick wall cylinder with slit exhaust and a single bypass booster is a black widow  cylinder with no bypass booster with a stepped wall is a pre cylinder used on early space bug space bug jr thermal hopper and strato bug note how the thread diameter for the glow head is much smaller no engines produced after  used this cylinder the most powerful cylinder piston combination without a doubt is the number  tee dee  cylinder this cylinder has a tapered grind and tapered and lightened piston so the piston fit gets tighter as the piston reaches top dead center tdc the intake or bypass porting is  deep ports with  bypass booster ports on each bypass this setup causes a swirling of the intake fuel air mixture which promotes better

alloy piston rod which is retained in its socket by a slotted steel retaining cup which in turn is held in place by a steel circlip located in a shallow groove in the interior piston wall this arrangement known as a threepiece piston was abandoned as of  in favour of a hardened steel rod which was swaged into a bearing cup formed integrally in the piston interior the advantage of this latter setup was that it simplified assembly and the bearing could be reset to take up play using a suitable reset tool to reswage the cup the engines that used the earlystyle threepiece piston are

 killer bee right on the bee engines there were  types of crankshaft produced and theyre interchangeable all bees with the exception of the killer bee and venom had the same crankshaft that was only good for about  rpm before the conrod pin would break off the killer bees and venom had a heavy duty balanced and lightened crankshaft that improved performance and could withstand speeds in excess of  rpm a company named davis diesel development in the usa also make a similar crankshaft called a killer crank for their diesel conversions they found under the heavier torque loads caused by running diesel fuel that the pins would break also hence they produced their own killer crank the same killer cranks are now being produced again by cox international on the tee dees and medallions the cranks are also interchangeable but quite different the tee dee has a large square hole at the intake end of the crank whereas the medallion has a smaller round hole the timing is also different on the later

propellersedit  engines run well on a x to x prop a x apc works well to get any suitable speed for mouse racing a  inch pitch prop is required at high revs but to do this plenty of nitromethane is also required for example a  x  prop with  nitro texaco engines are designed to use bigger props eg x fueledit the highest performance is achieved with fuel of  or more nitro content at least  oil  castorsynthetic is recommended acceptable performance can be had without nitromethane although the engine will be very sensitive to needle adjustments making it more difficult to operate with high nitromethane nitro fuel it may be necessary to lower the compression by installing up to six or more additional head gaskets when using castor oil it is advisable to clean the engine cylinder wall with a scotchbrite pad to remove castor oil varnish buildup that will occur especially after lean running this buildup of varnish will cause the engine to run inconsistently to avoid this problem it is advised to use a synthetic oil or synthetic and castor oil blend synthetic oil contains detergents that will keep the cylinder wall clean however these small engines do rely on some castor oil buildup to maintain high compression at higher running temperatures using clean fuel and keeping everything clean and free from dust and dirt particles is also very important for consistent running in

engines they were used in control line and free flight model planes as there was no market for throttled radio control engines back then radio control although first developed in the s it was not available for model airplanes until the s and did not become economically viable for small model planes until the mids and even then was for the modelers who could afford it it was certainly out of reach of the hands of most children from the mids cox produced throttle control devices for some of their engines however these were not as effective as throttles on other brand engines as the cox throttle worked by restricting exhaust flow exhaust throttles were produced for most bee and all medallion engines but not tee dee in  cox produced an engine with a true throttleable rc carburetor and that engine was the queen bee  in  cox produced the tee dee  and  both of which had a conventional rc carburetor with adjustable airbleed and a full muffler in  an after market rc throttlechoke has

models on february   estes industries stopped producing cox engines and sold all of their remaining inventory ie mainly spare parts to several private buyers from canada and usa one of the new owners of the remaining cox engine and parts inventory has launched a website cox international with online store millions of engines were produced and they became the most common a class  cubic inch engine

leroy roy m cox cox manufacturing started out in leroys garage in  where he made wooden pop guns for kids and employed local housewives to assemble them metal was scarce due to the war which is why the toy guns were made of wood in  metal became readily available again and competitors quickly moved into the market making their metal pop guns cheaper so roy moved to something else making metal tether cars for kids in august  a fire in coxs garage forced him to move to newer and larger premises at  poinsettia ave santa ana california in  cox developed a racing car which used an engine manufactured by cameron brothers the cars sold for  and generated  in sales in their first year of production in  cox developed their own engine for their racing tether car which included some parts from mel andersons spitzy engine this engine was called the o forty five as it was  cubic inch displacement in  with sales of the car proving to be a success cox moved on to development of a model plane engine roy felt the need for dependable easytostart engines and spent the better part of the year  in research actually  months his three man engineering crew himself mark mier and bill fogler spent  days a week day and night to develop the ‘ space bug’ contest engine the end result was the space bug  contest engine coxs first model plane engine which was completed in october  in  first name change was made to lm cox manufacturing company inc the space bug engine sets the scene for all the cox engines that followed and it went into full production in  this engine was so popular that it caused problems for other model engine manufacturers in  cox produced their first ready to fly rtf airplane the td which was powered by the space bug engine in  leroy cox lm cox manufacturing is sued by jim walker american junior aircraft co for copyright infringement because cox was using walkers patented bellcrank system in the td and secondly because walker believed the cox skylon reel was a copy of his ureely control handle the court case lasted for  years in  cox wins the court case against jim walker walkers patent on the bellcrank control system is ruled void and invalid because it was determined that the system had been designed before walkers patent and by someone else  a man named oba stclair who was the first man to fly a control line airplane in the usa back in  and the design was published in  oba stclair had shown his design to jim walker who took it upon himself to patent the design the court also ruled that the cox reel was not a copyright infringement in  cox developed the babe bee  designed by william bill selzer which had an extruded aluminum crankcase not cast like the others this engine sold for just  and stamped the final nail in the coffin of many competitors whose engines were selling for substantially more the babe bee was a high quality high precision engine which started easily and was very reliable unlike some of the competition in  cox took over the flying circle at disneyland which was a major coup for the company the model planes were being flown each day in front of tens of thousands of people and they had a hobby shop right there full of cox rtf planes the cox flying circle  remained in operation until  when it was closed to make way for expansion of tomorrowland in  cox hired an engineer named bill atwood who had already build his own line of engines to develop a new  cubic inch engine atwood was also responsible for the tee dee and medallion line of engines these engines put cox on the map as a leading engine in the world for many years to come in  due to continuing growth the company moved to larger  square feet facilities which were three times larger than the old site shortly thereafter cox got into slot cars and focused attention on gearing up for this fad  cox international is established in hong kong to meet the demands of the slot car craze  the slot car fad ends leaving cox with excess stock that cannot be sold resulting in financial cash flow problems in  leroys wife myrtle died and leroy was having health problems of his own so he retired and sold the company to leisure dynamics inc leisure dynamics continued to expand the range of cox model aircraft as well as adding trains boats rockets kites and radio control boosting sales to  million dollars per year roy cox retired with the distinction of being the worlds most successful model engine manufacturer in  william h selzer was appointed as president of lm cox manufacturing inc a subsidiary of leisure dynamics in  leisure dynamics breaks the company in two and moves the model production to minnesota and leaves the engine production in santa ana california in  leisure dynamics changes the company name to cox hobbies inc in  leisure dynamics filed for bankruptcy taking cox hobbies inc with them in  leroy roy m cox died sept  age  in  former cox engineer and president bill selzer whom cox hired in  purchased the company out of bankruptcy all manufacturing was returned to santa ana the company once again flourished into the s with new products being added and another move to even bigger facilities in  cox hobbies moved to new facilities at corona california in  the company name changed again to cox products the pee wee babe bee and pt  trainer still in production in  cox celebrated  years and introduced some new engines and rtf models in  cox sold to estes industries  centuri corp and moved to penrose colorado things changed quite considerably from here on cox as the hobbyists of the world knew it had gone the high reputation cox engines had declined one by one each product item was withdrawn from sale as stock ran out engine parts from different engines were mixed and matched making hybrid engines that performed very poorly compared to the cox engines from previous years estes added new products to the cox line using the cox name however these were electric radio control models some of which were known to explode resulting in a massive product recall by the company in  an online company calling themselves cox hobby distributors owned by estes industries appeared selling rc and electric products and some of the classic engines and rtf models however as each item from the classic era sold out it wasnt replaced in feb  estes industries sold all of their remaining classic cox stock to several private buyers one of them being a small company from canada in june  they launched a website cox international to sell their remaining stock online and also via ebay in jan  estescox corporation purchased by hobbico based in champaign illinois in  cox international continue to revive the classic cox brand as well as introducing new engine versions spare parts and

inches  mm stroke  inches  mm displacement  cubic inches  cc borestroke ratio  oversquare the cox  engine is a stroke internal combustion glow plug engine these engines use a glow plug to heat the fuelair within the cylinder to start once running it is disconnected and operates in the same manner as a diesel engine the self ignition is due to the heat produced from the compression of the airfuel mix and the catalytic reaction of the platinum element in the glow plug and the methanol in the fuel and does not depend in any way upon the continued use of the battery fuel intake to the engine is controlled by a simple needle valve and venturi system fuelair mixture intake to the crankcase is controlled via a reed valve or rotary valve depending on the engine design in a reed valve engine the valve is drawn open by suction as the piston moves upward on the compression stroke as the piston moves down on the power stoke the pressure in the crankcase causes the reed valve to close the fuel air mixture in the crankcase is then forced past the piston via the transferbypass ports in the cylinder one characteristic of a reed valve is that the engine will run in either direction an advantage for a pusher model but a disadvantage if the engine is finger started as it may start in the wrong direction the cox engines employed a starting spring which kept fingers free of the propellor and generally ensured correct rotational direction on rotary valve engines the process is similar except instead of a reed a rotary valve is used incorporated in the crankshaft which opens and closes as the piston moves up and down the rotary valve is more efficient and adjustable at design time as there is a larger and clearer path to the crankcase than in the reed valve setup but such engines can run in only one direction pusher configurations require a special propeller sometimes difficult to find the fuel used to power the engine is called model engine fuel a mixture of methanol  castor oil  and nitromethane  the cox line of reed valve engines designed prior to  used a rear reed valve induction system in the late s they played around with rear rotary valve induction as used in the rr before moving forward with front rotary valve induction for their tee dee and medallion lines early enginesedit cox thimble drome space bug  o forty five power pak special racer car engine pp  manufactured  this engine was the first designed by cox but included some major parts ie piston and cylinder of the spitzy  engine designed by mel anderson it employed a twin reed valve which was later used for the space bug the engine was a major engineering achievement for its time by incorporating reduction gears fuel tank flywheel and muffler all into one power pak the air intake was via one of the axles  o sixty power pak special racer car engine   manufactured  when slightly more power was needed for the thimble drome special car to obtain more speed a slightly larger version of the

only and was marketed as a competition engine and sold for  back then there was no market for radio control and free flight hadnt been considered by cox at this time the piston and cylinder were made from mild steel bar stock and the crankcase and fuel tank were cast aluminum  thermal hopper cat  manufactured  the thermal hopper is basically a space bug without the fuel tank it has a needle valve and venturi mounted on an aluminum plate instead these were designed for free flight and could also be used for control line flying it allowed the user to put a fuel tank of their choosing on the engine output was recorded at  bhp   rpm with a torque of  ozin at  rpm cox thimble drome thermal hopper  space bug jnr cat  manufactured  the space bug junior is a space bug with a smaller plastic tank this cheaper version also only had one intake bypass port and sold for   strato bug cat  manufactured  basically the same engine as a space bug but included a two piece fuel tank which was cheaper to make than the original space bug tank the tank itself is turned aluminium while the tank back is red yellow or blue plastic from the space bug junior but is modified to include an aluminium pickup tube and a larger hole to expose the venturi that is integral to the aluminium tank the later babe bee tank was simply a further developed version of this tank this engine was only produced during  and sold as a mid range sport engine for  as such not many exist today which makes them very rare and collectible selling for over us in  and  in  beware of fakes some unscrupulous sellers have been selling fake strato bugs that have a cnc machined tank and a space bug junior backplate standard beesedit cox babe bee left golden bee right  babe bee  cat  manufactured nov jan  the classic babe bee was the first engine cox produced with an extruded machined anodized bar stock aluminum crankcase this crankcase was machine made and was much cheaper and faster to make than the cast aluminum crankcase of the earlier models this engine was also supplied in thousands of rtf ready to fly airplanes sold in department stores worldwide it has an integrated cc fuel tank max output power was recorded around  bhp  watts   rpm on  nitro  pee wee  cat  manufactured feb jan  buoyed with excitement of the babe bee  leroy wanted to make a half size version of the babe bee so he did and they called it a pee wee  just like a babe bee only half the size  golden bee cat  manufactured oct jan  custom built golden bee  the golden bee is a baby bee that has a larger cc stunt vented fuel tank and has been anodized gold the larger tank allowed the planes to fly longer while the stunt vents allowed the airplanes to fly inverted without fuel running out or the engine cutting out the first versions of the golden bee had a single bypass intake port but later versions had two bypass ports making them slightly more powerful  qz cat  manufactured  qz stands for quiet zone it is a babe bee with a muffler twin bypass port cylinder with no sub piston induction and a high compression  glow head an attempt to regain the power loss caused by the muffler very similar to the later qrc engine which reportedly worked better cox also sold the muffler cylinder and high comp glow head components of the qz as a muffler conversion kit cat for   qrc cat  manufactured  the qrc was a modified babe bee engine that had a muffler and larger cc fuel tank in the s noise became an issue and the cox engineers discovered that when adding a muffler the engine would lose significant power this problem was alleviated by installing a cylinder with no sub piston induction the engine was designed for power launching radio controlled gliders and had a red tank with a blue spinner  rc bee cat  manufactured  this engine was designed for small radio controlled model planes it has a plastic clunk tank and an unusual cast crankcase the leisure dynamics team thought that cast crankcases would be cheaper to produce however they discovered that there were many manufacturing defects and they were difficult to machine resulting in a high failure rate so they returned to the tried and proven machined aluminum bar stock crankcase  dragon fly cat  manufactured  this engine was designed for the radio controlled model planes it is basically a baby bee with a clunk tank and a muffler throttle  texaco cat  manufactured  the is engine was designed for a texaco rc duration competition the engine has an additional fin on the larger glow plug which dissipates heat better allowing the engine to swing a larger propeller ie  or  inches this engine has a red cc fuel tank and a black crankcase original  engines did not come out with  fin glow plug the  fin glow plug came later in the  catalog  texaco jnr cat  manufactured  the same engine as the texaco above except that it has a smaller cc fuel tank which is also red first appeared in  cox catalog highperformance beesedit  rr cat  manufactured  the rare cox rr the rr uses a rear rotary valve intake rather than a reed valve in an attempt to achieve more power the engine came after the babe bee and looks very similar with its anodized machined extruded aluminum crank case and fuel tank the power improvement was negligible so cox reverted to the cheaper easier to build babe bee the engine was made for quite a few years and sold for  a left and right hand rotary valve was made as were left hand x glass filled nylon props for the rr some versions have a blue tank others have a clear anodized tank there were two versions of the tank back as well to fit the corresponding tank it has become a collectors item due to its uniqueness and pretty colors and is worth around  in   space hopper cat  manufactured nov  the space hopper was coxs first attempt at a beam mount high performance reed valve engine plus the first steps towards their greatest engine the tee dee series the engine was basically like the thermal hopper was to a space bug that is a babe bee without a tank but a venturi and needle valve relying on an external fuel tank the engine looks similar to the sportsman engine with a machined aluminium crankcase and rear induction via a reed valve with the needle valve assembly and venturi similar in appearance to the later tee dee series this engine was short lived and made way for the tee dee in  due to their similarities to the tee dee that followed some of the parts crossed over from this engine to the tee dee they look very retro and due to their apparent rareness are worth around us in  cox black widow  black widow cat  manufactured may jan  during the s a couple of cox engineers were playing around with different coloured babe bee and golden bee parts and came up with an allblack engine with a red spinner they hopped it up a bit with a dual bypass cylinder from a super bee  a black golden bee tank and a slightly larger  venturi intake the black widow was born these engines were marketed as a high powered combat engine on later black widows the red rubber spinner was replaced by a red anodized aluminum tee dee style spinner in the late s some black widows were produced with the a dual bypass slit exhaust cylinder the slit exhaust was to prevent fires according to an aeromodeller engine test done in august  the black widow on  nitro output power was  bhp  watts at  rpm with a max torque of  ozin at  rpm  killer bee  cat  manufactured  the killer bee was an attempt at making a fast reed valve  engine from information that had been learned over the years of racing and competition it had a tapered cylinder with spi and lighter piston similar to the tee dee a stronger balanced crankshaft and a new reed valve shape they had a yellow plastic needle valve later in  estes produced a killer bee that had none of these features but looked like the original killer bee except for the needle valve beware of fakes some unscrupulous people are producing fakes and selling them check to make sure the engine is the real deal before purchasing  killer bee  cat  manufactured  the killer bee  existed so that modellers could fly the same plane in two competition classes ie a and a simply by changing the engine this engine has exactly the same performance as the  there is a legend that two thin lines or grooves in the piston skirt are for positive identification but this is incorrect the grooves were intentionally designed to bleed off just enough power so that the  increase in displacement does not necessitate trim changes to a free flight model when switching the model from an  to the  to fly in the higher a class the benefit of the grooves as a visual identifier was accidental  venom cat  manufactured  cox venom with galbreathnelson head the venom was coxs last attempt at making a really fast  mouse racing engine again taken from ideas learned from years of competition this engine put all those ideas into an off the shelf product it used the killer bee crank shaft loosely fitted into the crankcase and a cylinder with porting very similar tee dee cylinder and tapered like the tee dee and with a lightened piston like the tee dee the rest of it was like a black widow the problem was that the production engine was not the same as the prototype a mistake had been made in manufacturing and the piston was lightened too much this made the engine fast but the piston weak and they would blow the top off the piston after a few runs at high speed as such only  were made and they never bothered to make any more because of that and all the fakes they are not worth a lot of money  beware of fakes some unscrupulous people are producing fakes and selling them check to make sure the engine is the real deal before purchasing tee deesedit the famous cox tee dee  and   tee dee  cat  manufactured nov jan  the tee dee is coxs most famous engine this engine was dominant in competition for many years it was designed by bill atwood who had been hired by cox specifically to produce the tee dee line of competition engines the important features of the tee dee are as follows tapered cylinder and a lightened and tapered piston result tighter piston fit at tdc and less piston mass two deep bypass ports with two bypass booster grooves known as side flutes on each bypass port extending slightly above the main bypass groove result significantly better air fuel mixture induction true peripheral venturi result more efficient fuel intake fuel draw and induction precision balanced and milled crankshaft result better fuel intake better balanced engine the tee dee was tested by aeromodeller magazine in  and the output power was recorded to be  bhp  watts   rpm with a max torque of  ozin at  rpm on  nitro note the modern norvel ame  engine which has an aluminum piston running in a ceramic coated cylinder outputs  bhp  watts  rpm in  the bypass porting crank shaft timing and venturi were modified slightly and a mesh screen was added to the venturi to keep out dirt this resulted in a minor performance improvement over the earlier versions a hopped up cox tee dee   tee dee  cat  manufactured oct jan  the  was simply a class a version of the engine physically the same on the outside only the bore was different and the piston had a small groove in the skirt to bleed off just enough power to exactly equal an  so no trim changes would be required to free flight models citation required this groove also visually differentiates the  from the  but this was of secondary importance the  also had a red carb body  tee dee  rc cat  manufactured  this engine had a proper rc carby and a full sized standard muffler and was designed specifically for rc flying it had no sub piston induction only two production runs of  each were done so there are only  of these in existence making them the second rarest production engine next to the venom note although the box said tee dee  the engine is actually  a cox tee dee  rc an  rc version also exists cat   manufactured  also  tee dee      cox also built tee dees in  cat  cat  cat and  cat size all these engines were very successful the original tee dee  immediately became the engine to use in fai ff with vastly higher performance than the olympic which had supplanted the european diesels used at the time they proved fragile particularly the thinwall cylinder and ballandsocket connecting rod and were replaced by beefedup versions as noted below one of the things cox wanted atwood to do was make him a  engine cox had already tried to halve the size of the pee wee  but couldnt get it to run for some reason the suspicion surrounded a problem with the tiny reed valve atwood found that the front rotary valve worked well on the  size hence the  was born medallionsedit  medallion  cat  manufactured nov jan  cox medallion  also known as the poor mans tee dee these were similar to the tee dee in appearance but had cheaper parts on them making them cheaper to buy the cylinder was a non tapered twin bypass with no boost ports like the one used on the black widow the crank shaft was drilled out rather than milled like the tee dee and the carb body was a one piece unit with a conventional needle valve and spray bar these engines were marketed as a sport  stunt engine as they were much tamer and much less cantankerous than the tee dee these are a great reliable easy to use little engine even today they can be purchased for under us in  rc versions of this engine were also produced with exhaust throttle ie  cat and the  cat with mufflerthrottle  medallion    the medallion engine was also produced in cat and cat  cubic inch size there were also rc versions of these ie cat medallion  rc and cat medallion  rc  medallion  manufactured  cox medallion  this particular  came about when a special order for  medallions was placed on cox by the national free flight society in the usa it was a gentlemans agreement done on a handshake and it nearly didnt happen when cox was sold to estes but the determination of the nffs resulted in the deal happening however estescox only came through with  engines the nffs engraved each engine with a serial number and kept a record of who purchased each engine these are probably the rarest of all cox engines due to the small size of the production run these engines have a unique piston and cylinder setup that occurs on no other cox engine before or after the cylinder has a straight bore  inches slit exhaust no sub piston induction product enginesedit these are all variations of the baby bee with different backplates and other parts designed for different rtf aircraft cars and boats there were literally hundreds of different models with subtle differences listed below are just a few of the more common ones  super bee cat  babe bee with twin bypass cylinder to give more power for the p warhawk rtf model early version had p stamped on the cylinder it had a standard babe bee tank  silver bee cat  similar to the super bee but it had a larger cc nonvented fuel tank it did not have p stamped on the cylinder but it did have the twin bypass ports this engine came with the spitfire rtf airplane  series x product engine catx manufactured  to  babe bee type engine with postage stamp type delrin backplate and brass needle valve instead of the integral babe bee fuel tank various shapes were used depending on the model they were fitted to each time they made a modification for a new model that was built a new cat number was produced eg  some had dual bypass port cylinders while others had single it depended on the airplane eg jud stuka p bendix racer p mustang  miss america models  series x product engine catx manufactured  to  babe bee type engine with horseshoe type delrin backplate

engine   surestart cat another variation of the modern babe bee these were pretty good because they have a choke tube attached to the grey plastic backplate the choke tube makes the engine even easier to start they were fitted to the very last rtfs eg pt and hyper viper before they went out of production original equipment manufacturer oem enginesedit over the years some cox model engines were sold to other companies for use in their products and sold under the other companies names examples of these companies were testor corporation sanwa  kyosho of japan johannes graupner of germany jerobee industries trading as jomac products lite machine corporation kenbrite corp australia and tissan haifa in israel of all of the above mentioned companies only tissan haifa assembled their own engines called the banana  all the rest used motor manufactured by cox themselves  cox banana  cat this engine looked like a standard product engine with plastic backplate it also had a spring starter red aluminium spinner and the fuel intake tube was extended below the plastic backplate cox also supplied a specially printed banana  box insert to fit their standard box other cox enginesedit cox

cox engine for fai racing combat and free flight for many more years until the russian aac engines came along this engine was patterned on the australian designed  taipan cc twin ball race engine by gordon burford the entire top end of the cox conquest and the taipan tbr are interchangeable the taipan tbr was based on the rossi mkii so the top end is also interchangeable with a rossi mkii also came in rc version cat  as a result of reorganisation within leisure dynamics who owned cox and kb at the time production of this engine was handed over to kb and it became known as the kb conquest after  production continued for a number of years when the engine was sold to mecoa owned by randy linsalato where it continued on as the rjl conquest for some time  cox conquest   prototyped only samples do exist and the conquest  was a grown up version of the conquest  however due to reorganisation with leisure dynamics who owned cox and kb at the time it was decided not to commence production as kb already had a  sized engine in the market  queen bee  rccat  manufactured  rear reed valve rc engine uses a standard glow plug power output is similar to tee dee  came out mid  and is listed in cox  catalog cylindersedit there was a wide range of cylinders produced with three different wall thicknesses most are interchangeable between all engine types which can create problems when buying a used engine all early cylinders had a thin wall which was later found to need improvement because they bent easily in a crash or when trying to undo with a cox wrench some people refer to these as mk cylinders the next type was thickened at the exhaust ports and are also known by some people as mk the third type was thick wall the way down from the cooling fins to the bottom this one facilitated the exhaust throttle ring and some people refer to this as a mk although cox never referred to them like this note the chart does not differentiate between specific modifications and changes made over the years as the company changed hands cox  cylinder crosssections cox venom cylinder referring to the cylinder crosssections above depicts a thin wall tee dee  cylinder with dual booster ports on the bypass port is a late model thick wall cylinder with slit exhaust and a single bypass booster is a black widow  cylinder with no bypass booster with a stepped wall is a pre cylinder used on early space bug space bug jr thermal hopper and strato bug note how the thread diameter for the glow head is much smaller no engines produced after  used this cylinder the most powerful cylinder piston combination without a doubt is the number  tee dee  cylinder this cylinder has a tapered grind and tapered and lightened piston so the piston fit gets tighter as the piston reaches top dead center tdc the intake or bypass porting is  deep ports with  bypass booster ports on each bypass this setup causes a swirling of the intake fuel air mixture which promotes better

dee also had a tapered cylinder and the crank was stronger and ported different from the medallion crank pistonsedit cox pistons pre and post  the early engines that were produced before  had a light alloy piston rod which is retained in its socket by a slotted steel retaining cup which in turn is held in place by a steel circlip located in a shallow groove in the interior piston wall this arrangement known as a threepiece piston was abandoned as of  in favour of a hardened steel rod which was swaged into a bearing cup formed integrally in the piston interior the advantage of this latter setup was that it simplified assembly and the bearing could be reset to take up play using a suitable reset tool to reswage the cup the engines that used the earlystyle threepiece piston are any engines produced prior to  ie space bug space bug jnr thermal hopper and strato bug since the space bug space bug jr and thermal hopper where produced up until  you will find versions of these early engines around with the laterstyle pistons and cylinders cox reset tool the post piston is coated with copper on the inside and top this was done to prevent the nitrile hardening process from hardening the ball socket joint area the outside wall of the piston was then finely machined and polished to produce a chromed appearance piston  conrod ball socket joint free playedit sometimes especially with engines that have had a lot of use the piston  conrod ball socket joint is very loose and will adversely affect performance a cox “reset” tool available for the    and the  series engines is used to tighten the ball joint back up again the correct free play is  to  inches the  engines use a wrist pin so a socket reset tool is not required for these crankshaftsedit babe bee left  killer bee right on the bee engines there were  types of crankshaft produced and theyre interchangeable all bees with the exception of the killer bee and venom had the same crankshaft that was only good for about  rpm before the conrod pin would break off the killer bees and venom had a heavy duty balanced and lightened crankshaft that improved performance and could withstand speeds in excess of  rpm a company named davis diesel development in the usa also make a similar crankshaft called a killer crank for their diesel conversions they found under the heavier torque loads caused by running diesel fuel that the pins would break also hence they produced their own killer crank the same killer cranks are now being produced again by cox international on the tee dees and medallions the cranks are also interchangeable but quite different the tee dee has a large square hole at the intake end of the crank whereas the medallion has a smaller round hole the timing is also different on the later td rc versions the crankshaft is lightened and strengthened similar to the killer bee crank ie ground away and hole in conrod pin glow headsedit cox glow headsedit there were  main types of cox glow

steel reed which is held in place by a plastic reed retainer see image on right later variants of the star and oval reeds were made of mylar and teflon some say mylar is the best while others prefer the stainless steel and then others prefer the teflon claims are that mylar and teflon are lighter and make the engine easier to start and go faster but they do not last as long as the stainless ones propellersedit  engines run well on a x to x prop a x apc works well to get any suitable speed for mouse racing a  inch pitch prop is required at high revs but to do this plenty of nitromethane is also required for example a  x  prop with  nitro texaco engines are designed to use bigger props eg x fueledit the highest performance is achieved with fuel of  or more nitro content at least  oil  castorsynthetic is recommended acceptable performance can be had without nitromethane although the engine will be very sensitive to needle adjustments making it more difficult to operate with high nitromethane nitro fuel it may be necessary to lower the compression by installing up to six or more additional head gaskets when using castor oil it is advisable to clean the engine cylinder wall with a scotchbrite pad to remove castor oil varnish buildup that will occur especially after lean running this buildup of varnish will cause the engine to run inconsistently to avoid this problem it is advised to use a synthetic oil or synthetic and castor oil blend synthetic oil contains detergents that will keep the cylinder wall clean however these small engines do rely on some castor oil buildup to maintain high compression at higher running temperatures using clean fuel and keeping everything clean and free from dust and dirt particles is also very important for consistent running in an engine of such small size as these cox fuel formula fuel name methanol nitromethane castor oil klotz oil glow power     flight power     race power     diesel conversionedit davis diesel

engines they were used in control line and free flight model planes as there was no market for throttled radio control engines back then radio control although first developed in the s it was not available for model airplanes until the s and did not become economically viable for small model planes until the mids and even then was for the modelers who could afford it it was certainly out of reach of the hands of most children from the mids cox produced throttle control devices for some of their engines however these were not as effective as throttles on other brand engines as the cox throttle worked by restricting exhaust flow exhaust throttles were produced for most bee and all medallion engines but not tee dee in  cox produced an engine with a true throttleable rc carburetor and that engine was the queen bee  in  cox produced the tee dee  and  both of which had a conventional rc carburetor with adjustable airbleed and a full muffler in  an after market rc throttlechoke has
