direct energy operations through a planned acquisition of exploration properties in peru our management and directors resigned during january  and an existing stockholder was appointed as the sole officer and director along with his affiliates that own common stock herein referred to as “interim management” during february  the planned acquisition of the peruvian exploration properties was terminated because of the failure to complete the terms of the acquisition immediately following this termination aepp had limited or no operating activities no tangible assets and no intellectual property but had significant liabilities   during february  in order to prepare the company for the development or adoption of a new plan of operations aepp adopted a plan to exchange our common stock for our outstanding debt on march   interim management was issued  shares of common stock to pay acquire or reach agreement with aepp’s creditors to extinguish all of the existing indebtedness of aepp and eliminate any ongoing financial obligations including any fees for services rendered the face value of such liabilities extinguished totaled  excluding any compensation to interim management for services rendered     on march   interim management agreed to sell all of its common stock to oncolix after the completion of the plan to extinguish liabilities and after certain other conditions were met interim management reached agreement with its creditors for such extinguishment by march   as of such date aepp had no assets no operating activities and no liabilities and was dependent on interim management to fund its corporate activities   on april   interim management completed the sale  shares of common stock including the  shares previously owned and the  shares received to implement the debt extinguishment plan to oncolix interim management resigned all positions with the company and two officers of oncolix were appointed as the sole directors of aepp resulting in a change in control of aepp   as of this date oncolix has announced no specific plans regarding its ownership interest in aepp but oncolix is considering the possible acquisition by aepp of oncolix’s operations through a reverse merger transaction there can be no assurances that such a transaction will be proposed by oncolix or will be consummated nor of the terms of any such transaction oncolix has agreed to advance funds to aepp on a monthtomonth basis to continue aepp’s corporate activities there can be no assurances that such oncolix will continue such arrangement   liquidity and capital resources   the company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business the company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues to cover its operating cost and allow it to continue as a going concern as of april  the company has no cash no tangible assets and no intellectual property and is currently dependent on its majority stockholder oncolix to fund its corporate activities on a monthtomonth basis the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it develops or acquires an operating business and becomes profitable if the company is unable to obtain adequate capital it could be forced to cease operations        table of contents   in order to continue as a going concern the company currently is dependent on oncolix to advance funds for the company’s corporate activities however management cannot provide any assurance that oncolix will continue to fund such activities or that the company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans to acquire or develop operations the company sustained a loss for the three months ending march   and  of  and  respectively these costs were principally related to corporate activities including the extinguishment of liabilities the company has an accumulated loss of  as of march   because of the absence of significant operations or assets or positive cash flows therefrom the company will require additional funding to establish or acquire operations these factors raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty   net cash used in operating activities for the three months ending march   and  was  and  respectively   net cash used in investing activities for the three months ending march   and  was  and  respectively    we anticipate that our future liquidity requirements will arise from the need to establish or acquire operations the primary sources of funding for such requirements are expected to be the acquisition of operations through the issuance of debt or equity from private sources andor debt financing however we can provide no assurances that we will be able to establish operations or generate sufficient cash flow from operations andor obtain additional financing on terms satisfactory to us if at all to remain a going concern our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitability see plan of operation   we are not aware of any trends or known demands commitments events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in material increases or decreases in liquidity   capital resources   we had no material commitments for any

qualitative disclosures about market risk   we are a smaller reporting company as defined by rule b of the securities exchange act of  and are not required to provide the information under this item   item  controls and procedures    a management’s conclusions regarding effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures   the management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting the company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the company’s chief executive and chief financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles        table of contents   with respect to the period ending march   under the supervision and with the participation of our management we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de promulgated under the securities exchange act of    based upon our evaluation regarding the period ending march   the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officer has concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the company’s limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review material weaknesses noted are lack of an audit committee lack of a majority of outside directors on the board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures and management was dominated by one individual during the threemonth period ended march   and now is dominated by two individuals who are employees of oncolix without adequate compensating controls through the use of external consultants and the review process management believes that the financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct   the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives however the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected    b changes in internal controls   there have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the period ended march   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal controls over financial reporting subsequent to march   oncolix acquired a majority interest in the company and two oncolix employees were elected as the sole directors and officers the new management has been responsible for this quarterly report   for a full discussion of controls and procedures refer to item a

period ending march   the company engaged in the sale of its unregistered securities as described below the shares of our common stock were issued pursuant to an exemption from registration in section a of the securities act of  these shares of our common stock qualified for exemption under section a of the securities act of  since the issuance of shares by us did not involve a public offering the offering was not a “public offering” as defined in section a due to the insubstantial number of persons involved in the deal size of the offering manner of the offering and number of shares offered we did not undertake an offering in which we sold a high number of shares to a high number of investors in addition these shareholders had necessary investment intent as required by section a since they agreed to receive shares certificates bearing a legend stating that such shares are restricted pursuant to rule  of the  act this restriction ensures that these shares would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a “public offering” all shareholders are “sophisticated investors” and are family members friends or business acquaintances of our officers and directors based on an analysis of the above factors we believe we have met the requirements to qualify for exemption under section a of the securities act of  for this transaction   on march   the company issued  shares of common stock to new opportunity business solutions inc a wholly owned affiliate of brian kistler the sole officer and director of the company in exchange for the agreement to

productionradically simplifying technologies better align oil recovery with nature introducing advanced environmental petroleum producers inc otcqb aepp  a petroleum developer with new technologies and an exciting vision to slash the financial cost – and the environmental consequences – of very substantial petroleum production includes extraordinary earnings and gains potential for shareholders aepp’s licensed technologies from pointsource processing inc revolutionize oil recovery from shale bypulverizing oilrich rock against itself using highspeed air flowsusing a onestep liquid catalyst to recover the oil from the resultant sized rockreinstating the cleaned rock back where it originated – eliminating all tailings and tailings pond costssoon using proprietary lowtemperature cracking to break down complex lowgrade oil molecules into very highvalue highdemand highmargin jetfuelgrade and above hydrocarbons aepp is a petroleum exploration and development company which controls the technical evaluation agreement tea from perupetro sa peru’s controlling state agency to evaluate and potentially develop and produce oil  gas from block  in southern peru block  consists of a  square kilometers oil and gas lease holding minimally  square kilometers of onsurface shale oil based on d seismic geophysical surveys performed by leading peruvian petroleum engineers we have identified phase  with  square kilometers to the east these very large accessible resources are now being further evaluated and defined into qualified reserves by respected chapman petroleum engineering of calgary concurrently aepp has entered into an exclusive technology contract with pointsource processing inc psp of victoria bc for the extraction and upgrading of shale oil psp has completed  years of testing of the onsurface shale formations and is providing three phases of radically new recovery technologies with exceptional promise for lowcost environmentally sound procedures for exploitation of the oilrich shale’s technology phases   and  aepp is building a mobile processing plant specifically engineered for the oil shale of block  which will demonstrate the application of phases  and  technologies for the recovery of oil from shale phase phase s technology is known as air fractionation here the shale is pulverized against itself into pebblesize particles for the extraction of the petroleumthe process involves feeding the shale rock into a highspeed  mph airflow the large shalefilled container causing the shale pieces to pulverize against each other at a combined speed of mphthis process replaces the current capitalintensive step crushing and milling process known to tar sands producers and most mining operations the technology uses a single very lowenergy output with operating expenses that are onetenth that of conventional processes and capital expenditures that are a tiny fraction of the mass crushing cone crushing and milling known throughout the industry air fractionation is already being applied today in several industries for several costsaving and environmentsaving objectives what is new is that aepp’s mobile plant is anticipated to be the first demonstration of the process for petroleum recovery phase  the pebblesized pieces from phase  are loaded into a rotating drum and sprayed with a proprietary liquid catalyst which draws essentially all hydrocarbons from the shale pebbles effectively separating oil from shale the oilcatalyst liquid is drawn off and the catalyst after light heating to separate the catalyst from the hydrocarbons is recycled and used again in a closed loop cycle the cleaned pebbles are separated for reinstatement in the ground there are no tailings no tailings pond no poisons and no tailings spills or possible tailings liability – an additional large savings at this point the hydrocarbons are bitumen with some light volatiles api’s ranging from api to approx api with very low sulfur approximately  and ready for sale to market at prices in the range of usbarrel with the simplified oil recovery having cost in the range of approximately us  bbl a substantial gross profit margin approximately two tons of shale from block  is known to generate on average  barrel of bitumen ‘api’ refers to the grade and cost of any hydrocarbon as measured by the american petroleum institute west texas sweet crude oil the most quoted grade of oil is api phase  the third technology a proprietary low temperature cracking breaks down the complex bitumen molecules produced from phase  into lighter forms of hydrocarbons changing them into gaseous acetylene ethylene and molecular hydrogen dissolved in pentane api  hexane api  and octane api  this onestep process converts lowgrade oil into highgrade oils along the lines of jet fuel and lighter these gases dissolve in the liquids changing the specific gravity into a highly valuable hydrocarbon mix marketable in the range of approx bbl at an allin cost in the range of approximately bbl the low temperaturecracking module has no moving part and is designed to operate  for approx  years before replacement procedurally the phase  and  pilot plant can be constructed for approx us million the initial levels of defining reserves at block  are targeted to cost us million the company is targeting initial production of lowgrade bitumen from the phase  and  mobile plant in the range of    monthsphase technology application is twoplus years from readiness at a cost of approx us million profits from the sale of bitumen are anticipated to cover the majority of the capital expenditure for phase  production management directors loong yip juy vincent president mr loong age  was born in guangzhou china and is a resident of peru he is a graduate of the
