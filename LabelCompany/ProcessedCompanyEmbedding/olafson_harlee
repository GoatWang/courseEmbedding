share order reprints save article print email facebook linkedin twitter save article more email facebook linkedin order reprints twitter save article sarah sturmon dale contributing writer theres a popular story that mankato was really supposed to be mahkato after the dakota indians name for the blue earth river while that may or may not be true no one these days would mistake mankato  or its sister city north mankato  for the sleepy agricultural town it once was today the communitys economy is driven by a number of factors manufacturing health care education and agriculture we have a very wellbalanced and diverse economy said jonathan zierdt president and ceo of greater mankato growth inc there is no one horse that drives this community with that diversity comes a number of players who have helped shape mankatos present and are helping to formulate its future these  movers and shakers are jonathan zierdt considers himself an orchestra conductor he doesnt play the instruments he doesnt compose but if he does his job right as president and ceo of greater mankato growth inc a recent business merger of the chamber of commerce and economic development corp he can make beautiful music our job is to connect the right players at the right time said the yearold southern minnesota native if we do it right the community remains vibrant and wellbalanced so far zierdt who took over his current position in  sees a community that is hitting on all cylinders mankatonorth mankato last year was identified as no  in the nation in the top micropolitans category for new and expanded corporate facilities by site selection magazine the community also has been named two years in a row as one of the  best communities for young people by americas promise alliance and has been singled out by the american association of retired persons as one of four communities to watch and by  mankatonorth mankato expects to be recognized as minnesotas next metropolitan statistical area by the us office of management and budget  a designation that zierdt believes will help attract talent it is kind of like having a tiger by the tail he said the future of this community is immense jerome crest admits that hes well experienced when it comes to getting things done in mankato crest a native of minnesota is chief administrative officer for immanuel st josephs  mayo health system in mankato and he has been since  i admit it im the old man the yearold said laughing under his tenure the health care system has grown evolving from a  millionayear business in the s to  million today it is mankatos secondlargest employer but crests community involvement doesnt stop at his doorstep he is chair of the mankato chamber of commerce and formerly led valley industrial development corp his involvement he said is part of his own beliefs and his organizations selfinterest as an organization we benefit if the community is prosperous we need to have a great community to attract people he said mankato crest said is blessed with many assets such as good schools available land and highereducation facilities we are all very bullish on what is happening in mankato and what can happen as we go forward he said mankatoborn and bred tim lidstrom grew up watching the earthmovers building highway  near his home along the river at  he filled sandbags during the  floods ive seen the growth of this community and it has changed considerably said lidstrom  owner of lidstrom commercial realtors of late much of that change has involved lidstrom he has helped to find homes for menards home depot and lowes and assisted in putting together the land parcel that got mankato the walmart distribution center scheduled for construction next year im really more of a facilitator than a mover and shaker he said but he is proud of his role in attracting the bigbox stores which are helping to make mankato a regional center lidstrom has been in real estate in the area since  and has owned lidstrom commercial realtors for eight years he also has great optimism about the future especially if area officials are able to persuade the legislature to back establishing a link between mankato and interstate w  a move he thinks will shape the future of mankato for jean taylor mankato is where she grew up mankato is a place that really moves itself forward but isnt out there trying the most radical thing said the yearold president and ceo of mankatos largest employer taylor corp cos which specializes in personalized communication products and services it is small enough for people to be connected but big enough to provide opportunities in fact opportunity is just what mankato offered her dad as a college student glen taylor started with carlson wedding services as a parttime employee by  he purchased the company and true to his entrepreneurial spirit began looking for ways to expand beyond its wedding focus today taylor corp includes plus subsidiaries in  states and eight countries employing more than  people but its base is still in mankato and employees for the firm serve on a variety of local boards the united way and the local colleges we take our position in mankato very very seriously jean taylor said for her part taylor serves as vice chair of the minnesota early learning foundation and is working on issues of earlychildhood development initiatives the result mankato is a place where people want to be taylor said mankato can be thankful that dennis miller didnt want to leave his minnesota roots miller  was on his way to becoming a bigwig with a chicagobased communications firm when he decided to stay near home so he took a job with a wisconsin telecommunications firm which eventually asked him to head an effort to help a group of independent telephone companies build a wireless network based in mankato he and his wife jackie moved to mankato in  and have never left raising their two children there and even though midwest wireless was sold to arkansasbased alltel in  and miller has retired miller said he has no intention of scaling back his commitment to mankato and the area the  mankato state university graduate serves on the southern minnesota leadership circle and the boards of immanuel st josephs and the minnesota state universitymankato foundation i see my role as a facilitator miller said we have all the elements we need to continue to grow we are a rural area that is acting as a regional center we have rush minute not rush hour and we have leadership denny dotson is president of dotson co inc mankatos oldest manufacturing firm a foundry in business since  after growing up in mankato and leaving to make it on his own dotson returned to the company and town in  after the death of his father in  he took over
