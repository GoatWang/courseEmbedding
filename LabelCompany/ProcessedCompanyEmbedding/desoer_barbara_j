mentors have helped advance her own career an edited transcript of this qa follows how have mentors helped you in your careera mentor of mine is tom clausen former ceo of bank of america and president of the world bank with whom i worked closely while at bank of america he was a critical advisor to me at several points in my career—asking me probing questions that enabled me to consider different perspectives that i might otherwise have been blind to he did not give me any answers —he helped guide and inform my thought process which was invaluable and allowed me to accelerate my development and growth who have been your greatest champions my greatest champion is liam mcgee while at bank of america together liam threw me into countless situations that proved to be some of the most challenging and valuable opportunities that i’ve experienced liam had the uncanny ability to be right there when i needed him most while also knowing when to give me rope to go at it alone it’s an approach i try to emulate with my team today both tom and liam have passed and i miss their guidance and friendship but their support and the lessons i learned from them resonate today and i am a better leader as a result some ceos have held town meetings with employees while others strive to have their management and board teams set the cultural tone is there any approach or method to create a culture of inclusion that you would suggest based on your considerable experience for me it’s spending time with members of the citi team in whatever venue i can i get energy from my teammates and it is an important feedback loop that can help to determine what is working and what needs to be rethought i recently returned from two full days of meetings in zurich with various team members listening to their concerns thoughts and ideas while reinforcing the strategic context for what they are doing even the best and brightest need support one should not underestimate the value of facetoface meetings and providing welltimed context and perspective to any given body of work or initiative since  nacd directorship magazine has served as the media partner for the aiming high awards

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
