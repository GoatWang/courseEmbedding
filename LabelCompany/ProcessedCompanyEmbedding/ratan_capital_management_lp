alpha september   by melina sanchez share tweet share  share hedge funds manager analysis manager monday ratan capital stan altshuller chief research officer this weeks manager monday looks into the public filings of the only femalerun tiger cub ratan capital learn how theyve outperformed exactly one year ago bloombergbusiness profiled a young hedge fund manager who seeded by julian robertson currently runs the new yorkbased ratan capital management the article claimed that while being a “brilliant stock picker” nehal chopra’s tough managerial style presented challenges with retaining talent while we are not going to opine on the softer issues of people management we can respectfully test the first assumption about her investment management acumen a recent study by kyria capital a firm that invests in womenrun hedge funds found some distinctions between male and female asset managers given she is the only female manager in our group of about  tiger cubs anne dias griffin who used to run robertsonbacked aragon returned money to clients in  we will also test how different or unique her portfolio is relative to her fellow male tiger cubs and seeds as usual for our manager mondays everything mentioned in this post is sourced exclusively from public data including the manager’s profile simulated performance and all other analysis and commentary the data used here omits the short side nonequity securities many nonus securities and all nonpublic information such as actual fund performance to simulate performance and determine portfolio attributes such as liquidity we combine public holdings data with market and pricing data and make simple assumptions since being seeded by roberston in  ratan’s assets have grown significantly especially in the last few years some of the growth was due to performance but that’s only part of the story her impressive track record has attracted new capital and robertson himself increased his allocation our data starts at her first filing with the sec – december of  there are aum thresholds managers must cross to make filing a requirement we use our standard “novus lens” to peek under the hood of this manager let’s dive in     ratan capital aum and concentration changes as mentioned ratan’s aum we use total reported assets as a proxy has grown considerably since their first filing and now hover around  billion in light of this increase in assets the manager cut position count effectively focusing her book on a smaller number of stocks and driving up her concentration she runs a more concentrated book than most other tiger seeds as her top ten securities represent close to  of the portfolio many smaller longshort equity and eventdriven managers prescribe to the philosophy of keeping their books very concentrated and their analyst teams small this way they gain an edge in the few names they are invested in through focused research of the businesses behind the securities instead of spreading their efforts over dozens of positions “deworsification” is real but with a book this concentrated position sizing becomes just as critical as stock picking if ratan’s largest positions perform worse than their smallest positions they are leaving a lot of money on the table novus clients test this with a metric called position sizing value add ratan capital position sizing it seems the decision to move to a more concentrated investment style has been paying off since the beginning of  the period of increased concentration her sizing decisions have added an impressive  percentage point over the equally weighted return orange line in chart below this implies that the changes the manager is making are substantial and are having a real positive impact on the bottom line it also implies that the manager is skilled at expressing conviction their largest sized positions outperform smaller sized positions the same concept can be seen in the winloss ratios by position size buckets as expected from the chart above ratan does well in their largest positions winloss ratio by position size bucket contribution by position size bucket ratan capital scalability and liquidity we have seen many managers move up the market capitalization spectrum after rapidly growing assets below is the average market capitalization of the stocks in ratan’s portfolio weighted by their positions in each name recently their portfolio has been shifting into mega caps and out of small this move has kept liquidity in check and the fund remains very liquid even at their present concentration levels there does not seem to be any short term issues with scaling the fund further while remaining liquid but in the future if growth persists they might need to think about increasing position count and as a result potentially growing the analyst team covering new securities especially if they want to venture out of the mega cap space ratan capital market capitalization the data implies that this move into larger cap names has been warranted in fact similar to many of their tiger cub peers their highest return and alpha contribution come from larger capitalization stocks annualized return by market cap security selection alpha by market cap ratan capital sectors from her days at balyasny chopra has been a generalist investor not focusing on any one or two sectors rather looking for a “corporate change” in her investments practicing an eventdriven style however as of most recent filings it is clear that she has been riding the healthcare boom currently investing  of the portfolio in the sector down from  in january of this year according to novus framework our attribution framework that breaks returns into four components most of the alpha return above the market and sector returns has been generated in the healthcare sector since the start of the analyzable period in addition some alpha has been generated in consumer discretionary and it while it was lost in staples currently  of the book again this is typical of hedge funds in general as staples is commonly a zero or a negative alpha sector the article we referenced earlier in the post refers to chopra as a brilliant stock picker this seems to only be true in the healthcare sector according to data let’s take a closer look at the actual names ratan capital overlap it is interesting to look at the names that ratan shares with their tiger cub peers our free interactive overlap matrix makes this a simple exercise below is a screen shot of the tool if you click on uniqueness the matrix will sort managers from the most unique to the least unique uniqueness is calculated within the context of this group of tiger cubs so in the case of ratan they fall in the middle of the pack at  uniqueness that’s the portion of their portfolio that is unique only to them and no other tiger cub owns those names in the table to the right of the matrix the unique names are bold you can quickly see that the two largest positions in their portfolio are very commonly held stocks valeant and allergan at  and  cubs respectively thus most of the stock picking alpha in healthcare was actually due to a few very popular tiger cub stocks here are their top contributors since  is ratan capital a leader or follower a team in our product group headed up by adam benenson is building a pioneering analysis to rank all managers based on their ability to be early and right on a stock or to “lead the pack” in conviction trades for instance it’s interesting that ratan has benefited from valeant but were they among the first in that name or simply caught on after others had invested analyzing this only within the context of the tiger cubs we can see that ratan was among the first investors in vrx the third to be exact behind hound and marble arch who were leaders you can see that of the managers that followed suit many had much lower position sizes lower conviction and thus did not benefit as much as the leaders   valeant vrx     tiger cub tenure quarters as of  latest position size hound partners llc   marble arch investments lp   ratan capital group llc   viking global investors lp   hoplite capital management llc   lone pine capital llc   maverick capital ltd   emerging sovereign group llc   steadfast financial llc   tiger eye partners lp     ratan capital’s investment in valeant price vs position size from the chart above we can see how ratan managed the position size of vrx and increased their bets and trimmed at just the right times ratan capital’s similarity to adi capital some investors expressed concern over the fact that chopra’s husband paritosh gupta also runs an event driven fund smaller than ratan called adi capital management a filing with the sec states that “mr gupta and his spouse do not discuss any information related to their funds’ current investments potential investments investment strategies or other confidential investmentrelated information” we ran a simple overlap analysis on the two funds and found two names in common stock ratan capital size adi capital size valeant pharmaceuticals intl  – allergan plc  – time warner cable inc  – charter communications inc   pinnacle foods inc  – coty inc   teva pharmaceuticals  – liberty global plc  – horizon pharma plc  – calpine corp  – fossil group inc put  – ssc technologies hldgs inc  – hilltop holdings inc  –   while the position count of the overlapping securities certainly is low  the portfolios overlap significantly in percent of market value this means that both managers have high conviction in the two names they share roughly  of ratan’s portfolio is owned by adi and  of adi’s is owned by ratan if you were to pull two hedge funds at random their average expected overlap to each other is  according to our latest industry overlap analysis conclusion no doubt ratan capital is a successful tiger seed with potential and is proving their worth with great numbers however it would be wise for investors to understand the source and uniqueness of the alpha in their returns while the stock picking is indeed excellent in healthcare in particular the stocks are by no means unique in the scope of their peers however data points to ratan being leaders in at least some of the popular names and their ability to properly size those names and monetize their conviction is surely responsible for a large chunk of their success   three managers three styles an analysis of three different hedge fund strategies and how they generate alpha what makes a successful hedge fund manager we believe that studying performance alone does not adequately answer the question by looking at thousands of active manager portfolios we peek under the hood of managers’ investment process and recognize patterns that lead managers to consistent outperformance these patterns can be viewed as investment skill or managers’ ability to generate alpha through certain repeatable methods in this article we use public ownership data and the novus alpha platform to evaluate three very distinct money managers the three case studies aim to identify the driver of these managers’ success investment skill what’s in the
