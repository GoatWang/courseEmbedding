to richard richard f pops  chairman  chief executive officer thats great thank you eva good morning everyone so since our release last month of the topline results of the first two forward efficacy studies for alks  for major depressive disorder weve talked to many of you in some cases multiple times but i still wanted to start todays call by acknowledging the significant decline in our stock price and in the biotech market in general and reaffirming the strength of our company the first is we built this company to last to be able to withstand and even thrive in tough market conditions and to endure setbacks in any of our development programs our business is comprised of a portfolio of differentiated commercial products novel product candidates in development and substantial and growing revenue streams we built this over many years and were continuously adapting it in order to create additional value in the current environment the resiliency of alkermes becomes apparent we have a robust and growing base business generating more than  million of manufacturing and royalty revenues from our partners jj astrazeneca biogen and acorda for patented medicines that will persist into the s on top of this base were launching aristada into a rapidly growing longacting atypical antipsychotic market bring distinctive features important to physicians nurses and patients at a time when the huge economic burden and human suffering associated with schizophrenia is becoming even more evident in our communities the most directly comparable product in terms of flexibility and dosing features invega sustenna is already a  billion drug in the us and growing rapidly vivitrol is beginning to hit its stride generating nearly  million of revenue last year and growing at a  rate providing a oneofakind treatment alternative for opioid dependence at a time when politicians at the federal and state level the media and healthcare and criminal justice systems around the country are mobilizing to address what has become a national crisis we have great expectations for this medicine and its gratifying to see the numbers beginning to bear this out so from a financial and strategic perspective we believe weve never been stronger we are in a phase of launching and growing products and growing revenues off of an alreadystrong foundation were diversified we have plenty of cash and were building capabilities for the future in very distinctive segments of huge therapeutic markets the second point is with respect to our development pipeline we have arguably one of the most diverse medically and economically important latestage cns pipelines in the industry were tackling serious chronic diseases with devastating consequences for patients and families and were making excellent progress three medicines are in pivotal study alks  for major depressive disorder alks  for schizophrenia and alks  for multiple sclerosis each of these is based on a foundation of scientific evidence that is substantial and growing this is true for  as youve heard me say over the last several weeks we believe that were dialing in on the dosing testing and analysis of  in the setting of treatmentresistant depression weve had time to analyze the data more completely and share it with experts who were more convinced than ever that we have unambiguous evidence of activity at the same time ive also told you that you should be skeptical as to whether forward will be successful as its clear that we have not eliminated a potential for high placebo response even with our advanced study designs but you should know that our scientists statisticians and clinicians are excited to keep going this is science were learning and adapting in a difficult indication where many if not most active drugs frequently fail to separate from placebo in clinical trials we would stop in a second if we thought this medicine did not have the chance to potentially help many many people suffering from a very serious condition but we believe that it does and we think its revealing itself through these experiments im going to turn the call over to jim now to provide the financial overview and guidance but i wanted to set the stage this morning with this perspective this is a very strong company and were in the process of building it into something special when jim is finished ill have some additional detail on the individual elements of the commercial and development portfolios ill give it to jim james m frates  senior vice president  chief financial officer thanks richard good morning everyone  was an important year for us we continued the evolution from a business built around partnered products to a proprietary model that would drive our own topline growth marked by the expanded use of vivitrol and our newest proprietary product aristada which received fda approval and was subsequently launched in october we also continue to invest in our future growth by advancing our latestage pipeline of cns medicines financially our results for the fourth quarter and year ended december  were in line with our expectations and were characterized by strong revenues from our base business of commercial products and focused investments both in our proprietary commercial portfolio and in our pipeline we believe our strong and growing commercial business together with our diversified cns pipeline will drive significant growth and profitability over the next few years lets start with our key financial highlights in  we generated total revenues of  million a  increase over last year when we exclude our divested gainesfield business and we recorded a  million nongaap net loss for the fourth quarter our total revenues were  million and we recorded a nongaap net loss of approximately  million let me now review some of the key drivers of our financial performance during the quarter starting with vivitrol our novel oncemonthly injectable product for the treatment of opioid and alcohol dependence in the fourth quarter vivitrol had net sales of  million compared to approximately  million for the same period last year demonstrating growth of  on a sequential quarter basis unit growth was  while net sales growth was  as a result of increased medicaid reserves in the fourth order as our government business accelerated this is a positive development showing our success in accessing this important public payer market which will be a key part of vivitrols longterm growth if we look at the net sales growth for vivitrol over the entire year the underlying trend is more apparent where vivitrol grew  yearoveryear turning to  we expect vivitrol net sales to range from  million to  million representing topend growth of nearly  and reflecting our belief that vivitrol is still early in its growth phase let me just elaborate a moment on the trends that we see behind the accelerating growth in vivitrol its being driven by two main factors the commercial business and the public sector first on the commercial side physicians and systems increased experience using our product is driving more adoption and weve seen a steady expansion of the depth and breadth of the key accounts using vivitrol our commercial business is growing at a steady rate of  across the country with certain states growing as much as  where key plans have improved access by changing prior authorizations and failfirst policies second were beginning to see our work in the public sector lead to increased treatment with vivitrol growth in statefunded and medicaid programs is accelerating as an example our medicaid business doubled this year and now makes up almost  of our total business this is encouraging for us because in large measure this is where the majority of patients are covered and we believe were still only in the early stages of tapping into this important market turning to aristada we see the longacting injectable or lai market in schizophrenia as another exciting opportunity where our medication can support patient care in a market that is currently plagued by poor outcomes we believe our launch is off to an excellent start our team of  territory business managers is targeting a welldefined group of physicians who have a history of prescribing lais for the treatment of schizophrenia and while prescriptions in these early weeks number in the hundreds we have distributed more than  samples nationwide to meet the request of healthcare providers treating patients in the outpatient setting and in our hospital inpatient trial program these programs will play an important role in raising awareness about the attributes of aristada and we believe they will help us achieve longterm success the key to this market is securing access to reimbursement and this happens gradually over the course of the calendar year because of the patchwork of medicare part d managed medicaid and medicaid feeforservice plans in all  states we expect to have more than  planned meetings in  with more than  happening in the first quarter alone with payer decisions to be made over the next few months were confident that our commercial team has indepth knowledge of the commercial dynamics here and a sophisticated strategy to address them to assure a successful launch as a result of this work were off to a solid start for aristada with  million of net sales which included wholesaler stocking we would also – excuse me we would expect q  sales to be lower sequentially over this past quarter due to inventory drawdown as well as a normal launch process of gaining formulary access looking more broadly at  for aristada well provide more specific net sales guidance during the year as we gain further experience with the launch we would note as a reference point that the most recent product launched in the lai class achieved us net sales of around  million for the second through fifth quarters of its launch and we believe the shape of its launch curve and early results are a reasonable benchmark for aristadas early launch phase moving on to our key partner products we saw overall revenues of  million in  an increase of  from last year revenues were driven by  million from our partnered longacting atypical franchise and  million from ampyra and fampyra in terms of expenses our total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of  were  million compared to approximately  million for the same period in the prior year this increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by the focused investment in clinical studies investment in the launch of aristada and investment in profitable growth of vivitrol for the full year we had rd expenses of approximately  million and sga expenses of approximately  million turning ahead to  we expect rd expenses to be in the range of  million to  million this expectation reflects investment in the recently initiated pivotal development programs for alks  and alks  while also continuing the ongoing forward efficacy study for alks  as well as the advancement of our earlierstage candidates alks  and rdb  into the clinic for sga we expect to be in the range of  million to  million this increase is primarily driven by the full year cost of the aristada field sales team turning to our balance sheet were in a strong position and ended the fourth quarter of  with close to  million in cash in total investments and approximately  million in debt so looking forward to  were wellpositioned to execute on our plans to drive the next stage of alkermes growth while maintaining our financial strength with that ill turn the call back over to richard richard f pops  chairman  chief executive officer thats excellent thank you jim let me wrap up quickly with a review of our business and some of our upcoming milestones and lets start with aristada as you heard jim say the nationwide launch is well underway and early returns are good physician feedback on the product has been encouraging and consistent with our expectations aristada embodies key attributes important to patients and healthcare providers efficacy flexibility with a range of doses and durations and a simple readytouse format we designed aristada to have features that address the realworld needs of patients and healthcare professionals that pursuit continues with the positive news on the potential twomonth dosing regimen of aristada that we announced this morning based on these results we plan to submit a supplemental nda in the second half of  for the  milligram dose which will expand the current offering to three dosing intervals four weeks six weeks and eight weeks this is an unprecedented range of options for treatment with aripiprazole the opportunity that aristada represents for us is clear its transformed our commercial presence and has established a new foundation for our growth its an important medicine wellpositioned to compete in a  billion us market that is growing rapidly and has the clear potential to become our most significant product yet moving now to vivitrol we are seeing a groundswell of enthusiasm and clearly expanding use of this medicine its growing because of its increasing use in a wide variety of settings as the us treatment system begins to change in response to the growing prescription opioid and heroin epidemic whats most exciting is how an expanding array of states counties and municipalities are beginning to integrate the use of vivitrol into their criminal justice and healthcare systems more than  programs are ongoing in  states many of which are just getting going these are the harbingers of the future and have the potential to dramatically change and expand the way addiction is addressed in our society vivitrol is a oneofakind product on patent until  whose value is coming into focus so in many ways we see this as just the beginning for vivitrol now on to alks  our oncedaily oral investigational medicine for patients with major depressive disorder and an inadequate response to standard therapies as i mentioned earlier we believe that we are dialing in on the dosing evaluation and analysis of  while we did not meet the prespecified primary endpoint for either forward or forward the two studies provided us with a wealth of new data from over  patients we have been analyzing results and feel quite confident that alks  administered as the  mg mg dose continues to show clear signs of efficacy we see forward as a supportive study and its comparison to forward is instructive were excited to share this data with you and the scientific community and weve submitted the results to the american society of clinical psychopharmacology meeting or ascp which will take place at the end of may this was just recently accepted for an oral presentation the path forward is as follows forward continues to enroll we have a significant increment of new data to inform our analysis plan we will increase the study size slightly and now plan to enroll approximately  patients and we should report topline data by year end  in the case of a clear positive outcome for forward we will proceed to meeting with fda we believe the evidence provided by a positive forward trial and a previously completed successful randomized placebocontrolled phase  study together with supportive evidence from forward collectively could provide substantial evidence of efficacy for  in the treatment of major depressive disorder developing new drugs for the treatment of refractory depression is difficult and its risky were clearly not immune to that but its also important we believe that were harnessing one of most compelling new mechanisms for treating this disease in the past  years millions of patients stand to benefit we think were going to figure this out we may not and if the data begins to suggest that were wrong well stop but i want you to know that were far from that today turning now to alks  our novel oral broadspectrum antipsychotic drug candidate for the treatment of schizophrenia both of the core studies in the phase  program are now underway the first is a fourweek study evaluating the antipsychotic properties of  in approximately  patients with schizophrenia the second study initiated two weeks ago is evaluating weight gain with alks  compared to olanzapine in approximately  patients with stable schizophrenia over six months these two core studies will enroll throughout  and like weve done with past clinical programs we will update you on our progress and our estimated completion window as we get further underway this is a very streamlined registration program for an exciting new medicine for schizophrenia one with the potential to bring the proven efficacy of olanzapine with a differentiated safety profile with favorable weight and metabolic properties beyond these two studies were further interested in elucidating the metabolic profile of alks  our preclinical work has demonstrated that  has favorable metabolic properties compared to olanzapine and were gaining an understanding of samidorphans role in mitigating olanzapines central and peripheral effects we plan to conduct a metabolic study of alks  in adult volunteers as part of the pivotal program later this year also enrolling in its pivotal program is alks  our monomethyl fumarate or mmf for the treatment of multiple sclerosis  is an oral molecule thats designed to rapidly and efficiently convert to mmf in the body and offer differentiated features as compared to the current marketed dimethyl fumarate tecfidera our registration pathway is based on a b strategy referencing tecfidera pharmacokinetic bridging studies as well as a twoyear safety study in approximately  patients with ms are underway in addition were very interested in determining the gastrointestinal tolerability of  compared to tecfidera so were choosing to conduct a randomized headtohead comparison in approximately  patients which we plan to initiate mid we expect to be able to submit the nda for alks  in  beyond the pivotal stage clinical programs we continue to develop compelling new medicines from our rd engine two earlierstage candidates are moving into man  this year alks  and rdb  for  our immunooncology candidate we will file the ind this quarter and plan to initiate clinical testing in the second quarter alks  our novel chemical entity for the treatment of alzheimers agitation and other psychiatric indications is now in the clinic we expect data from the study in the second half of this year so in conclusion the business is strong with a major product launch underway with aristada vivitrol continuing to grow a diversified and growing base business and three latestage development candidates in pivotal development were incredibly excited about the prospects for alkermes in  and beyond so ill finish there and turn it back over to eva for questions eva stroynowski  investor relations contact thanks richard well now take your questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session and from barclays we have jon eckard on the line please go ahead jonathan m eckard  barclays capital inc good morning thanks for taking the questions richard f pops  chairman  chief executive officer good morning jon jonathan m eckard  barclays capital inc real quick on vivitrol guidance for  based on the  medicaid mix that jim referenced what does the new guidance reflect with regards to unit growth versus dollar growth because of the change in the gross and net and i have a question on aristada after james m frates  senior vice president  chief financial officer yeah jon good morning its jim i wont go into specifics on the unit growth obviously because were giving a range but it actually contemplates continued rapid growth in the share of medicaid business that were getting so i think thats why youre seeing – we feel like vivitrol is doing very well its growth has accelerated from  into  in terms of units and we still see that unit growth accelerating at those rates going forward a little bit less growth maybe on net sales because again the medicaid proportion is still growing fast does that make sense jonathan m eckard  barclays capital inc it does thank you james m frates  senior vice president  chief financial officer yeah jonathan m eckard  barclays capital inc and then quickly to you again jim your comments about the abilify maintena quarters two through five being like a reasonable guide or proxy to – for an aristada launch james m frates  senior vice president  chief financial officer yeah jonathan m eckard  barclays capital inc im guessing that number for what youre saying for aristada would exclude the  samples that you referenced and based on your competitive intelligence whats the level of sampling that was done with abilify maintena so that we could do a more clear applestoapples comparison for the demand of the two products james m frates  senior vice president  chief financial officer yeah thats really an important point jon im glad you asked about it so there wasnt a sample program that our competitor launched with back in  and first let me take a further step back they launched in march if you remember we obviously launched in october as we are moving into our quarters two through five as you line up the launch curves it makes sense to look at their quarters two through five right thats trying to line up applestoapples the thing thats different is we have  samples in the field and they had zero so all their demand came through net sales which is obviously going to be part of that roughly  million for the first year and we havent yet seen our samples start to pull through so thats one of the things – its one of the reasons why we may be trailing now but its also one of the things that our market research showed us that was really really important is that people want to be able to use samples and before the reimbursement gets worked out they want to be able to use it in the right patients and their practice and thats where they can use samples so its not exactly applestoapples but again were early in the launch phase these are just guides and we think that the important point is that the full year of reimbursement cycle that we need to get through these government payers before people start to make conclusions about how big the longterm potential in this product is jonathan m eckard  barclays capital inc if i could squeeze in one quick i noticed that the scripts for aristada are mainly – are mostly driven towards a high dose is there anything to look into for – from that mix of the different doses that being used and that would be my end thank you very much richard f pops  chairman  chief executive officer hey jon its rich ill just take that one yeah its interesting to see that some of the first trials that were getting from physicians using aristada has been to take patients that have not been getting adequate clinical coverage from other medicines and trying them on a higher dose and early returns are theyre getting a good experience with that we think thats great i think at equilibrium we expect a more even distribution across the doses but i think the fact that were starting at  mg with so many first trials represents a need in the marketplace jonathan m eckard  barclays capital inc thank you very much richard f pops  chairman  chief executive officer thank you operator from leerink we have paul matteis on the line please go ahead paul a matteis  leerink partners llc great thanks very much can you hear me okay richard f pops  chairman  chief executive officer sure paul paul a matteis  leerink partners llc great thank you i have a few one is on  im wondering – so you talked about forward being supported at a study of the  mg mg dose to the degree that youre able could you expound upon the actual magnitude of drug placebo difference you saw in that study in light of other drugs like seroquel and abilify that saw two point to three point differences on the  between them and placebo richard f pops  chairman  chief executive officer i wont other than to say we think its a very healthy response and youll see the data when we present the data at ascp and so why dont we talk about it as you see it because what i really want people to understand is that these analyses of forward are only really relevant in the context of a submission that would come with a positive forward or a subsequent study so in that setting i think that youll be able to take a look at the data and make your own conclusions but i think theres very little ambiguity from our perspective and our kol perspective the  mg mg dose is separating really nicely in forward paul a matteis  leerink partners llc okay thanks thats helpful and then you rich and im not sure if you specified this in your prepared remarks but for forward you talked about making a few changes one of them was increasing the end and another one was actually tweaking the stats plan so for increasing the end i know one concern was the potential for an associated increase in variability so maybe you could address that and secondarily with the stats change youve made can you just confirm that the new statistical analysis plan for this study would be something that you think the fda would okay and has approved other drugs in this area richard f pops  chairman  chief executive officer well i think its a fairly obvious statement that we wouldnt submit a stat plan if we didnt think the fda would approve them also in fact the final stat plan has not even been submitted for forward so its flexible up until the time that we underlined but what was the first part of the question i forgot that paul a matteis  leerink partners llc just the end and does that include  richard f pops  chairman  chief executive officer thats right yeah the decision we made to increase the end is really based on kind of looking the way the study is proceeding right now so we would not add new sites or new investigators in order to drive them so this is kind of a naturalistic logical landing place if we let the wellenrolling sites that are doing a good job continue on their enrollment path for a reasonable period of time so thats why id say its a gentle increase in the sample size the studies architecture is still its basic architecture and so i think that the primary change will come from this modest increase in sample size and a more refined statistical plan that incorporates the learnings from the additional  patients worth of data paul a matteis  leerink partners llc okay thanks for taking my question richard f pops  chairman  chief executive officer youre very welcome operator from jp morgan we have cory kasimov on line please go ahead cory w kasimov  jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning guys thanks for taking the questions i just – i guess rich want to first follow up on forward and just try to get a better sense of what ultimately drives the decision to modify the statistical plan and analysis for that study is it just the continued learnings that youre getting from  and  is it – are you waiting for feedback from kind of your consultants on that or its – because it sounds like this kind of has been ongoing – a decision hasnt been finalized yet im wondering kind of what the additional variables or inputs are that may make that decision for you richard f pops  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i think its not particularly esoteric its just the fact that when we first designed this statistical analysis for forward and  it was based on a patient randomized study in stage  – in phase  which was quite successful but thats a certainsized data set and we provide the way of modeling the two curves now with another  patients worth of data we just have a more nuanced way of looking at the analytical plan over that distribution so i think its really just a way you do the math and well continue to refine it statistically and figure out the best way to do it and what im also struck by is the fact within forward recall that we tested three – there were three treatment arms there was placebo there was the  mg mg dose as well as the  mg mg dose which was ineffective in that study so within the setting of a single study we can actually can see what an efficacious dose looks like at  mg mg and ineffective dose of  mg mg compared to placebo so were just getting a little bit able more resolution statistically in the best way to model this and to demonstrate the difference in a large study cory w kasimov  jpmorgan securities llc okay all right great and then quickly on aristada really just wondered if you could characterize the physician feedback your sales force has gotten on the product you guys have been very clear for some time on the marketing message that youd have and the differentiating features how has that been resonating with doctors and considering that youre going into – youre at least initially targeting prescribers of lais is there much education or do they kind of get it right away richard f pops  chairman  chief executive officer i think its really consistent with what we would have hoped for given the kind of explicit differences and attributes that aristada has versus the competition and the point i made about the  mg i think underscores – i think its probably the most interesting new learning since weve been in the real world of the marketplace which is how many physicians are interested in exploring that higher dose but the fact that we have this range of intervals the existence of the sixweek dosing interval is instructive because its not just the physicians say i can go ahead and dose it every six weeks it reflects the fact that theres a little bit more dosing forgiveness on the back end because the pk profile is different than other products so the fact that  mg can be dosed every six weeks just underscores the fact that weve got a different wave form of presentation in aristada so i think the flexibility of three doses and that being underscored by the range of intervals and then of course while not in the marketplace at all but i think todays data on the twomonth at a higher mass just underscores the fact that aristada is going to be a really really robust product family more analogous to what sustenna has brought to the market on the risperidone side and thats a  billion drug in the us and growing rapidly and i think that weve mimicked those features and that flexibility in the aristada side of – in the aripiprazole side of the market and thats why were so confident against the backdrop of a market thats growing so rapidly given the features that we have in the product that are kind of selfevident you dont really need to explain them at great length and to draw distinction between one dose and multiple doses and multiple durations i think were going to do just fine cory w kasimov  jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks for taking the questions richard f pops  chairman  chief executive officer youre welcome operator from jefferies we have biren amin please go ahead biren amin  jefferies llc yeah thanks guys for taking my question on the aristada twomonth data are you planning at all to – evaluating a switch study from maintena to this twomonth dosing schedule as a way of potentially transitioning and trying to convert patients away from maintena richard f pops  chairman  chief executive officer i think the switches from maintena will come naturally based on limitations that physicians are seeing with maintena to the extent those exist now i think that the twomonth is really as youve heard us say before biren you think about it this way if youre going to initiate a patient on a lai initiating one on one like aristada where if your patient is compliant and enjoying being on that medicine you can cut their number of injections in half each year thats really the offering rather than were going to try to shift the market toward twomonth in the same way that we see in invega sustennas threemonth we think the twomonth will do that for us as well so i guess the answer to your question which i didnt answer directly which is no i dont see immediately well leave it to the team i dont think immediately the need to run the study to switch people from maintena biren amin  jefferies llc thank you richard f pops  chairman  chief executive officer thank you eva stroynowski  investor relations contact operator it looks like we have time for one more question operator thank you from ubs we have marc goodman please go ahead ami fadia  ubs securities llc hi good morning this is ami fadia on behalf of marc couple of questions firstly on aristada in your guidance – well you didnt give specific guidance but as you thought about your  guidance how much more sampling are you anticipating in  and if you could just give us the amount of inventory stocking in the fourth quarter that would be helpful and then i have another one richard f pops  chairman  chief executive officer ami why cant you ask a question on behalf of ami no were not going to disclose our sampling plan thats competitive in  jim did you want to answer that james m frates  senior vice president  chief financial officer yeah well and i would say on inventory – again i mentioned i think there has been some stocking obviously thats being worked through we think the second quarter of launch this s first quarter will be down a little bit from last year but again we wont give specifics i think ims has started to track the data quite nicely and again these are very small numbers so through the year were quite comfortable we dont think there are high inventory levels right now ami fadia  ubs securities llc okay so now all the sort of prescriptions are being pulled through james m frates  senior vice president  chief financial officer yeah i think thats a fair statement and again in a normal base because its going to be growing much more than we believed than the  million in sales we saw last quarter ami fadia  ubs securities llc got it and then just another question on  have you had conversations with the fda around kind of some of the outcomes of the forward studies and how the fda might look at a positive forward study along with phase  would that be enough for them to really approve a drug richard f pops  chairman  chief executive officer yeah we will we havent yet one of the reasons we want to present at ascp is that the fda typically attends ascp its a fairly small community of folks that are involved in these studies around major depressive disorder but what we would do with a positive forward well we have a prenda meeting with fda and discuss the filing package but we – yes we do think it would be sufficient and based on historical precedent we think that theres a pathway absolutely for  and for successful registration based on that clinical trial program ami fadia  ubs securities llc got it and then just thirdly on vivitrol the drug has been continuing to grow nicely have you changed your thinking around the sales resources behind that product do you need to put in more or do you feel like its at a steadystate and you dont need to and you could probably repurpose some of them towards aristada or some other product richard f pops  chairman  chief executive officer well i think that theres a couple different alternatives in there one thing were not going to do is repurpose people whats happening with vivitrol vivitrol has an enormous amount of excitement within our commercial team and i think increasingly in the country and its still promoted in the us with a very small team of people in the field on the order of  people what weve been augmenting over the past couple years has not the field team as much as its been on the policy at the state and the federal level and thats going to continue i think theres no question that if vivitrol continues to grow at this rate we will expand the field base force as what happens typically is a territory will get particularly lively and well break a particular territory into two as opposed to opening new parts of the country that were not being covered so i think it will happen organically and all of thats embodied in the guidance that jim has given you eva stroynowski  investor relations contact all right thank you

call over to jim james m frates thanks sandy good morning everyone during the first quarter we continued to execute on our business strategy and our results reflect strong yearoveryear growth driven by our proprietary products we remain confident in our financial expectations for the year which we are reiterating today during q our sequential quarteroverquarter unique growth for vivitrol and aristada were somewhat mashed by our net sales results and ill explain that more in a moment let me start with an overview of our key financial highlights during the first quarter we generated total revenues of  million and recorded a  million nongaap net loss in the quarter vivitrol had net sales of  million compared to  million for the same period last year demonstrating growth of approximately  driven by underlying unit growth of  and robust expansion across the country typically first quarter net sales are impacted by deductable resets in commercial plans that happen at the beginning of the year and inventory build at our wholesalers during the preceding fourth quarter the inventory build of  million from the fourth quarter of  was largely worked down during the first quarter adjusting for these inventory fluctuations on a sequential basis vivitrol units grew approximately  with channel inventory at current levels and the commercial insurance plan deductible reset behind us we expected growth rates to accelerate throughout the year and we are reiterating our expectations for vivitrol net sales in the range of  to  million in  the underlying fundamentals of vivitrols growth and potential are strong since our year end results call in february weve seen a number of state expand from approximately  programs in  days to nearly  programs in  states the robust growth of these programs which range from public health initiatives to criminal justice programs in drug courts prisons and jails represents a leading indicator of the sustained growth of vivitrol further last year the comprehensive addiction recovery act and the st century cures act was signed into law and well begin to see the initial impact of these major pieces of legislation later this year as state access funding and implement new treatment programs to address the opioid epidemic turning to aristada the launch continues to gain traction in the growing long acting atypical market with  million of net sales during the first quarter as with vivitrol the underlying growth of aristada was somewhat obscured in our net sales results during the first quarter aristada prescriptions grew approximately  compared to the fourth quarter in march contracting for two major payer plans silverscript and wellcare took effect together these two plans open up a significant pool of patients representing  of the medicare part d market as these payer contracts took effect gross to net deductions increased during the quarter additionally inventory in the channel stayed flat from the end of  after sequentially increasing each quarter since launch looking ahead to the second quarter we expect the net sales will be in the range of  million to  million our q expectations reflect a lower average selling price as the contracting that took effect in march is in place for a full quarter and aristada sales volumes increased in these channels net sales should track prescription and unit growth more closely in the second half of the year as gross to net adjustments to the payer mix stabilize also in the second quarter we expect the approval for the  mg twomonth dose in june and are preparing for that launch shortly thereafter were making steady progress and were optimistic about aristada as our growth in new prescribers and the depth of prescriptions among our highest users continues to increase in march our market share for new prescriptions in the longacting aripiprazole market grew to approximately  compared to  in march of last year when healthcare providers use aristada they appreciate its unique attributes and we remain on track with our expectations for net sales to increase by at least  this year moving on to our key partner products we saw overall revenues of  million in the first quarter compared to  million in the first quarter of last year this included manufacturing and royalty revenues of  million related to risperdal consta invega sustenna and invega trinza compared to  million for the same period last year for ampyra and fampyra we recorded manufacturing and royalty revenues of  million during the first quarter compared to  million for the same period last year generic competition to ampyra is expected in july of  and at this time our total revenue guidance for  is not affected in terms of expenses our total operating expenses for the first quarter of  were  million compared to  million for the same period last year reflecting targeted investments in our latestage pipeline and in our commercial infrastructure to support the growth of our proprietary products as well as increased manufacturing activity turning to our balance sheet were in a strong position and entered the first quarter of  with approximately  million in cash and total investments the financial underpinnings of our business are solid we look forward to accelerating the growth of our proprietary products and executing on our development pipeline to deliver our important medicines to patients and with that ill turn the call over to richard richard f pops thank you jim good morning everyone our commercial portfolio and our latestage pipeline are in a state of rapid evolution vivitrol and aristada are growing and theyll continue to do so because they are important differentiated products addressing profound societal needs which are only becoming more prominent from an operational perspective the commercial and development teams are full throttle and excited to be fielding data and capabilities around medicines with incredible longterm potential in the fields we operate in serious mental illness and addiction things take time but you can see from our experience with vivitrol and in the longacting injectable antipsychotic market that good medicines priced fairly were built steadily over time as you heard in jims remarks the trends underlying vivitrols potential and growth are strong and supported by the activation of policymakers at the local state and federal levels just yesterday health and human services secretary tom price visited our wilmington ohio facility to learn more about vivitrol and alkermes commitment to the treatment of addiction the opioid epidemic is affecting every state and district across the country advancing treatment and prevention strategies have become national political health and criminal justice issues with bipartisan support vivitrol is in the central part of that discussion and it was inspiring for the whole company to hear the secretary recognize our dedication to this field and our growing impact on it turning to aristada our longacting injectable atypical antipsychotic for the treatment of schizophrenia like addiction approving the treatment of serious mental illness is a national priority and longacting injectable treatments are growing in importance for both medical and economic reasons we designed aristada for market leadership and we continue to build the aristada product family to provide more options and flexibility for patients physicians and payers this continues with the expected approval of the  mg twomonth dose in june which would add to our current offerings of once monthly and once every sixweek dosing options this will be the only twomonth antipsychotic on the market and our launch preparations are well underway now on to the latestage pipeline we have three latestage candidates approaching registration or completion of the pivotal programs this pipeline is moving quickly and we expect a number of important milestones in the next few months ill start with alks  were developing  as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of major depressive disorder in patients not achieving adequate clinical response to their firstline therapy its important to understand the clinical context these patients are several weeks or months into their major depressive episode and can experience debilitating and potentially fatal symptoms of their disease treatment options are limited and introduce new and significant risks alks  is doing different things for patients than other depression medications it is a wellestablished that the guidance ph opioid system is intimately involved in motivation social connection and resiliency and that its function is disregulated in the context of major depression and other psychiatric disorders  is specifically designed for therapeutic benefit via the endogenous opioid system while avoiding the risk of abuse dependence and addiction associated with opiate agonists we did this specifically and intentionally by including a prudent opioid antagonist component this is a fasttrack designated medicine with the pivotal program completed weve requested the prenda meeting and we expect it to occur in the late june or early july timeframe were preparing the new drug application and are on track to submit the nda later this year our belief in the safety and efficacy of  is based on data last year we presented data from forward and forward at ascp in may we will present the balance of the data from the forward pivotal program at the society of biological psychiatry medical meeting and will host a webcast conference call for analysts and investors these data will include forward the prespecified pooled analysis of forward and forward as well as a holistic overview of the consistent efficacy and safety profile of  demonstrated throughout the development program as we continue to build the evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of alks  and share it with key opinion leaders in the field we recognize that were just getting started reviewing the clinical importance of this new pharmacology the approval of  is an adjunctive agent in patients failing to get adequate clinical relief from firstline treatments as measured by madras should just be the beginning were going to continue to expand the data set supporting alks  to think its clinical profile through a new clinical trial this begins later this quarter as we initiate study  this study will continue our focus on patients suffering from treatment of refractory depression in addition to the madras this study will utilize scales and endpoints to assess additional domains such as social interaction anhedonia and resilience which are regulated by the opioid system and where alks  may have particular benefit so finishing up on  we will present the forward and the forward pooled data at sobp in may we have submitted our request for the prenda meeting and expect that to be scheduled soon we will start the next study by the end of the quarter and were on track with our preparations for submitting the nda by yearend turning to alks  were entering a data rich period as the pivotal program matures  is our novel oral antipsychotic designed to harness the efficacy of olanzapine with a more favorable weight and metabolic profile the first piece of new data comes from our recently completed exploratory phase  study in patients with schizophrenia and cooccurring alcohol use disorder despite representing more than a third of patients with schizophrenia these patients are generally excluded from clinical trials and represented undertreated and underserved patient population our study was designed to assess alks s efficacy safety and tolerability compared to olanzapine in this population and breaks new ground in testing antipsychotic medications in patients many physicians are unsure how to treat the hypothesis was that because  seems samidorphan it might have a greater effect on drinking behavior than olanzapine alone and thereby avoid some of the deleterious outcomes associated with alcohol use we prespecified the primary endpoints as a novel composite measure of disease exacerbation as measured by a series of potential events ranging from hospitalization to arrest the study did not show a difference on this endpoint as the alks  in olanzapine treatment groups performed similarly well the study did however provide a wealth of data supportive of the safety and real world efficacy of  compared to olanzapine in this complicated and underserved patient population perhaps the most striking finding was in terms of longterm antipsychotic efficacy while both groups experienced an improvement in panss scores which is the positive and negative syndrome scale subjects on alks  had greater longterm improvement this is remarkable as olanzapine is regarded as among the most effective of all the antipsychotic agents this underscores our fundamental positioning of alks  as a new antipsychotic agent as its favorable weight and metabolic profile is established through the development program the focus shift to its potential is to have a profound impact on the treatment of schizophrenia based on its efficacy this study provides additional support for that positioning we will complete the analysis of the study and look forward to presenting the data at a future medical meeting the next study to read out will be the pivotal phase  study of evaluating the antipsychotic efficacy of alks  compared to placebo and olanzapine in approximately  patients we have moved in the time lines for this study and now expect to complete enrollment in the next couple of weeks with topline data expected around midyear compared to our previous expectation at yearend the pivotal study of evaluating the effect of alks  on olanzapine associated weight gain will continue its enrollment throughout this year with data expected in mid  next is alks  for the treatment of multiple sclerosis which is also enrolling in this pivotal program  is a novel oral molecule formulated in an advanced controlled release dosage form that’s designed to compete against biogens tecfidera which represents a  billion class in the us in march there were a number of positive developments in the intellectual property around dimethyl fumarate which resulted in tecfidera patent protection being upheld through  while our branded fumarate market is positive for the longterm potential of alks  we expect the ip surrounding dimethyl fumarate will continue to be challenged to more completely elaborate the potential competitive advantages of alks  we are conducting an elective headtohead study of evaluating the gi tolerability of  compared to tecfidera this patient study began in march and will provide updates on expected timing of data as we get more experience with enrollment trends the pivotal program for  consists of two elements completed pharmacokinetic bridging studies enabling a b regulatory pathway referencing tecfidera and a twoyear open label safety study this study has enrolled now over  patients and the data continue to support a differentiated gi profile of  we expect to complete the safety exposure requirements for registration later this year and remain on track to submit the nda in  i will finish with alks  our novel immune therapy designed for selective activation of the il receptor in order to increase the number of tumor killing immune cells we have recently presented three posters at aacr showing some of the preclinical data which served the foundation of the program including data that demonstrated the selective expansion of cda tcell and natural killer cells with minimal expansion of the immunosuppressive regulatory tcells we are currently engaged in the dose escalation phase of our first clinical trial and we expect to see initial data later this year so i’ll finish there we have a lot of important milestones on the new horizon and we look forward to updating you over the course of the coming weeks and with that ill turn the call back to sandy for questions sandra coombs thanks richard brandon well now open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions from credit suisse we have vamil divan online please go ahead vamil divan hi great good morning thanks for taking my question so just two questions you mentioned on  the timeline that’s coming a little bit for the top line data there can you just explain what change was just enrollment came in faster than you thought or were there any other changes there that have taken place with the study and then the second one on vivitrol i appreciate the comments you made on the volume can you give a little more color just in terms of pricing as that has been the area of focus there in terms of the net price you are getting any changes or anything unusual on what happened this quarter thanks richard f pops okay vamil ill take the first one and let jim answer the second the  study is this efficacy study which is analogous of the study we ran for the approval of aristada all along in all of our psychiatric studies we say that we will trade time for quality or quality for time in this case we just had really excellent enrollment in the back half of the study which allowed us to hit our patient enrollment numbers sooner than we would have conservatively modeled other than that all systems are good james m frates yes and on vivitrol i think the change sequentially from quartertoquarter was really due to the seasonality that we have seen in the first quarter typically our pricing was very stable and our gross to net were  last quarter and  this quarter so pricing wasn’t an issue there really was just as those commercial plans reset and we head into the yearend you know we’ve seen that vivitrol fluctuations from quartertoquarter in the past so we are confident about where we are headed for the rest of the year vamil divan okay thanks so much james m frates you’re welcome operator from leerink we have paul matteis online please go ahead paul matteis great thanks so much a couple of questions on  and  first one on  was this study that you are initiating always planned or was it in reaction to any feedback from fda and do you have plans to initiate additional study in the future this year richard f pops good morning paul no this was not based on any feedback from fda this is based on our recognition that were just at the beginning of elaborating the clinical potential of this new pharmacology we had as you may know we had about a dozen or more of the top kols for depression at logan airport a few weeks ago and it was interesting because we reviewed all the data from the forward program and since there was a strong consensus the drug is doing as intended and will be approvable in that indication so the conversation then shifts to what do we do next because in a way we’ve developed  pursuant to the old rules up until this point testing it as adjunctive agent in patients with major depressive disorder failing to get adequate clinical relief using madras as the endpoint but it’s doing different things in patients brains and monoamine reuptake inhibitors particularly on these domains really the social resiliency anhedonia social connectivity and things like that so this next study will begin to explore that we also have some imaging ideas that we want to do just looking directly in the brain at different domains then of course other clinical indications other than adjunctive use in major depressive disorders so we will be in the clinic with the drug for the next decade paul matteis okay got it so we should potentially expect more studies in the future and then separately on… richard f pops absolutely paul matteis great thanks rich for clarifying that i appreciate it and then on  you conveyed that from the safety study you are continuing to see a differentiated indiscernible are you seeing lower rates of diarrhea and flushing how much of a window into the data do you have from your indiscernible richard f pops our team has lot of data and what i can tell you based on what i know i’ve been mostly looking at the major aes so saes and also gi discons ph and they are extremely low so the weakness of that observation is despite the large number of patients that we have now which is significant this is in trivial end now were over  patients but now we go headtohead it just underscores our interest and belief in the larger the brain headtohead study paul matteis okay thanks may be just one more on  if you don’t mind this study so is the timing as timing pulls into midyear do you think that this study is long enough and i guess you tweaked the run into i mean based on the design do you think that its realistic to see a benefit or differentiation on metabolic or so richard f pops you are breaking up a little bit paul but i think i understand the question i just want to make sure we are not confusing two different studies we’ve got the study that we’re going to have data on midyear now is part of the two study pivotal program as agreed with fda this is the formal definition description of efficacy with the primary compared to being placebo in acute schizophrenia it’s a four or five weeks study we also have olanzapine arm so we are not powered for indiscernible the primary statistical comparison is to placebo and of course that duration that’s how we ran the aristada phase  this is a standard efficacy study for antipsychotic agent separately were running a much more exploratory human metabolic study in volunteers thats an inpatient study for almost a month where were trying to see whether we can picture in the humans what we’re seeing in the rodents which is the peripheral metabolic effects of olanzapine and the corresponding effects when samidorphan in the form of  is also deployed so in the animals weve learnt a tremendous amount about why olanzapine is causing weight gain separate from our central hypothesis about the reward systems and if thats borne out in human we want to begin to explore that to underscore the pharmacology of  those data will also be available midyear but they are not part of the pivotal program paul matteis okay thanks rich i guess my question was on this study that’s going to read out in the year you see differentiation on weight gain really closer to are you anticipating that you may see differentiation from the olanzapine arm on metabolic side effects for  actually that was my question richard f pops i see im sorry i gave you a long answer to a question you didn’t ask but in a fourweek study we don’t expect to see major changes in a way plus all patients who are hospitalized are getting care it’s a different experiment paul matteis okay okay super helpful thanks very much richard f pops take care operator from jpmorgan we have cory kasimov please go ahead cory kasimov hey good morning guys thanks for taking the question actually two of them for you as well so i guess first when thinking about vivitrol traction over the course of the year how much insight do you guys typically have ahead of time as to when utilization of the product could or is kind of poised to pick up in certain states or systems and i have one follow up for jim james m frates yes cory that’s one of the things that makes it difficult to predict vivitrol because we are changing care and the use of a longacting relapse prevention medicine which is an antagonist so different the state programs are  when state programs start they can accelerate quite quickly the question is when exactly do they start right when are the systems in place when does the funding come through how quickly do physicians get up and running so i think the thing that makes us optimistic over time is that in all of our territories across the country as i tried to refer to in my remarks we are seeing that steady growth still occurring and we are also seeing many states accelerate that growth and our concentration in growth remains very high in those five key states still providing more than  of our sales so it is very difficult quartertoquarter to know exactly which state is going to pop next but given our market share and the movement we see across the country we are very confident that it will happen you know you add to that the additional funding that’s going to come in the second half of the year through st century cures and the cara legislation that was passed last year and what we are hearing on the ground from our sales team is we remain very optimistic about the growth cory kasimov okay great and then the follow up is it looks like there was a stepup in your cost of goods this quarter anything in at least as a percent of your total sales or anything in particular behind that is it more driven by the q commercial dynamics you discussed james m frates yes you know we do fluctuate from quartertoquarter on cost of goods and it has a lot of things to do with product mix and the amount of manufacturing that we are doing obviously we did more in the first quarter this year than we did last year and we also brought on some additional capacity too so that works through the system and volumes increase and we get more efficient on that we are very confident that cost of goods will get back into that kind of  range versus the  we saw this quarter so really just quartertoquarter fluctuation cory kasimov okay great thanks taking the questions james m frates you bet operator from cowen we have chris shibutani please go ahead chris shibutani yes thanks for taking the question on vivitrol can you comment a little bit about some of the trends youre seeing and underlying drivers such as the number of kind of the higher volume prescribers you did comment on the programs which are improving as new programs come on i know that they tend to be a little bit slower but a lot of the traction has historically seemed to come from the higher volume prescribers duration of use if you could comment there and then secondly this has been a drug that has kind of needed a constellation of events to come through payer backdrop recognition of demand et cetera i think weve discussed in the past sort of what are the pushes and pulls where are you able to push and invest i know that you tried to do so with that naltrexone kit do you speak to efforts that you feel you can proactively invest in and employ to somehow encourage growth in the market rather than sort of needing everything to move in sort of coincident fashion as it has but how can you sort of accelerate or push growth thank you richard f pops chris ill let i let jim answer some and then ill give you some color myself james m frates yes so i think its a good question chris and this again relates to the complexities of the vivitrol system we will point you back to analyst day with that the expansion of our provider network the policy overlay in a state and the access in reimbursement and when we get all three of those things working thats when we can drive and maybe add another sales person to the territory we can do some micro marketing that sort of more traditional marketing in a sense and so what were trying to do is continue to move those states up to highly developed states as weve talked about we dont do that count every quarter but we absolutely are moving in the right direction with states moving to highly developed states and it really is a coordinated effort between our reimbursement folks our sales folks and our policy folks in the states to move that along we are making progress i think the key thing that we look at is yearoveryear growth for vivitrol because again the first quarter with those commercial resets is very different from other quarters weve typically seen the highest growth rates in the second and third quarters and we have no we have little doubt that that will change as we go into the year some of the more specifics that you asked about in terms of the number of high prescribers our key accounts and maybe the depths of prescriptions and the duration we are seeing improvements the other thing is prescription fulfilment rates that sort of thing we are seeing improvements in those underlying trends those are slow percentage point percentage point a monthtomonth at a time and were definitely continuing to see that growth occurring in the background so as i say weve reiterated guidance for the year and hopefully well see and expect to see vivitrol accelerating through the course of the year richard f pops chris the only thing ill add to that is as we highlighted yesterday with secretary price is to the moment to cite the basic hydraulics in the market are that more vivitrol is going to be used thats why its a little bit sarcastic in a way and thats why weve used the  state programs compared to  even in february as a leading indicator its very difficult to predict any one of those  but again the aggregate theres just more and more people using more and more vivitrol and its got about  market share right now with a lot of states municipalities counties just beginning to get exposure to the product so its at the kind of highest level at the systematic level the basic instinct is due to  for more use of long acting antagonist medication you will see from us even in this quarter i got emails from a number of you all and you saw the buses in manhattan that had the vivitrol ad on them we’re beginning to expand these micro marketing approaches and i think youll be seeing more of vivitrol chris shibutani great and then just one quick additional seasonal question were heading into the cancer time of year  you see that when will see some color in terms of data or thinking about what youre going to do with that asset thank you richard f pops i dont think youll see anything at asco but i think for the fall that will be the timing where well be into those dosing cohorts where therapeutic concentrations we expect to start to seeing activity chris shibutani thank you richard f pops you‘re welcome operator from jefferies we have biren amin please go ahead biren amin yes hi guys thanks for taking my questions just on the new  study can you just share how many patients you plan to enroll in that trial and what the primary endpoint would be and i guess when should be expect data from this study and i guess the other question is will you be discussing the design of the trial with fda in your prenda meeting in second quarter thanks richard f pops good morning biren no we won’t talk about it with fda in the prenda meeting its not really part of the submission package and well probably give you more specific details when we do the webcast around the sobp presentation because were finishing off the details on that madras will continue to be one of the primary endpoints that were going to augment that with some new scales one of the tensions in running these depression studies is that you dont want to invoke a number of scale the more interventions with the patient tends to drive a higher placebo response so were being very very reductive and selective about trying to explore particular domains that we think map on to this endogenous opioid system pharmacology and those the team is settling on those and well tell you more about those as we get closer to launching it biren amin so rich maybe a follow up on the madras endpoint are you going to be evaluating an average across several weeks time such as what you did with  or  richard f pops yes we think thats the more precise and accurate determination of separation of these curves in these studies we know those are demonstrated there is just inherently weektoweek variability and you can win and you can lose simply based on variability so a more accurate approach is to capture more data in the analysis and we will probably employ an spcd or spcdlike study design as well with the first days to filter out high placebo responders biren amin and when do you hope to finish the trial like richard f pops well we have to start it first so it depends on the end so im not sure obviously it will be next year at a minimum but well give you more details as we finish designs biren amin great thank you richard f pops youre welcome operator from evercore isi we have umer raffat please go ahead unidentified analyst hi its dara ph standing in for umer i just had two questions so first on  in a scenario where  differentiates in phase iib versus taxotere ph do you intend on going it alone in this market or are you willing to partner richard f pops i think the answer is yes so the most important thing is to really understand the clinical and economic value of  relative to taxotere ph there are a number of people paying attention to this development program as you might imagine unlike  or  in our core psychiatry franchises where we know that we want to be launching those drugs ourselves and that would be a new foray for us we could do it ourselves its certainly tractable so we also could be collaborating around this as well unidentified analyst great and on aristada what was the gross to net in the first quarter and whats really changed from q and is this a trend is there any trends we should expect to continue richard f pops yes thank you yes the gross to net did increase from quartertoquarter so we were up about  points from  to  and our estimates for the full year is more in the mid s which is where you would see the other competitive products given they are very heavy medicare and medicaid thats  of the market here so thats one of the things i talked about in the dynamics were going to continue to see unit growth in the second quarter but as those medicare part d plans came on in march for the second quarter we expect gross to nets probably to move up into the mid to low s from the mid s where they were in the first quarter and stabilizing that mid  going forward for the foreseeable future unidentified analyst thats great and if and if i may just one quick question on the gi tolerability and of  again if that reads out in towards the end of the year is there any chance it would be included in the nda package at the fda richard f pops our expectations it would not be in the initial label based on the b  approach and also having run a single study with that said we would expect at launch to have that the data published and if the data are clear and compelling we could consider running a second study for potential label inclusion unidentified analyst thats great thank you very much richard f pops you’re welcome operator from citi we have liav abraham please go ahead liav abraham good morning thanks for taking the question a lot of mine have already been answered just a quick question on   and on your prenda meeting with fda thats scheduled for later in the quarter what feedback exactly do you plan on getting from fda in this meeting or is it purely to tick the box and will you be communicating anything to the investment community after this meeting and if so how and when and in what formats thank you richard f pops good morning liav the prenda meeting is a kind of statutory well known type b fda interaction all of our interactions with fda are meaningful and have an opportunity to teach and to learn this particular meeting is more typically focused on the structure of the nda itself the table of contents the various analyses the various figures tables and listings that well be providing the nda across the various elements the various modules in the nda itself typically minute meeting or working type meeting so we will absolutely give feedback coming out of it because that will give us more clarity on the timing of the submission and weve said year end and well tune that up as we come out of the meeting and any other things we learn we will share with you liav abraham great thank you sandra coombs okay brandon we have time for one more question sure from barclays we have david sell ph please go ahead unidentified analyst hi good morning thanks for taking the questions just in terms of cara and st century cures act and i think you referenced sort of some new money or state taxes and new money later in the year is it your expectation or do you have a sense or is it too early whether that money is going to go into existing programs or do you think it this will be a catalyst for new program formation and therefore sort of translation and then how should we think about that for potentially sort of helping that they call it option richard f pops this is rich i’ll answer that st century cures money really brings funding to the cara legislation that was passed in the summer as well so you can think about it as federal money that will be granted down to states largely for the initiation of new programs so weve been real strong advocates of this and the new programs come in two domains one is in the public health traditional substance abuse treatment also in the criminal justice side where the whole logic thats beginning to build the idea of lets not incarcerate patients with addiction lets start intervening in their treatment sooner prior to diverting them into the criminal justice system so i think you could see it in the form of new programs some of those programs relate directly to funding that could support purchasing vivitrol but actually more importantly it could put in the systems in the community to be able to treat patients with medications and to treatment generally often in states theres access to vivitrol through medicaid expansion and what is lacking has been the human infrastructure to deploy the use of monthly injectable treatments along with lack of social counselling and monitoring so that’s a long answer to a question but theres – its quite a complicated system unidentified analyst okay and then one more question if i might on aristada you referenced the two planned additions for march just curious in terms of aristada coverage right now how do you feel your positioned and especially relative to the competition and is there more work to be done or do you think that at this point its a level playing field and then just maybe some context around how you think the two month dose and how significant in terms of volume trends that might be richard f pops were effectively at parity now with the completion of those two big contracts in march where we want to be we could always improve but largely were at parity the twomonth is important for a couple of reasons not that it creates a step function in the sales in the quarter not far from it because i think the model ph use of longacting injectable will continue to be around that one month but its another reason for physicians to choose our product versus other competitive products because it opens the opportunity to produce a patients number of injections going six per year if theyre compliant and doing well on the medicines the second piece of it thats important over the long term that were quite energized about is the hospital start we expect labelling for the two months version to allow initiation on the twomonth dose this is different than invega trinza which requires stabilization on monthly sustain before initiating trinza the threemonth version if you could initiate a patient as they leave the hospital on a twomonth formulation that maps it really well into a public health system now that is looking to reduce the number of hospital readmits for the same diagnosis and gives patients a chance to stable therapeutic levels of the drug for a couple months coming out of their acute episode we think that from a personal and public health point of view that could be very powerful unidentified analyst and then richard i mean how many do you know how big the sort of hospital market or sort of initiating in the hospital market population is richard f pops we will follow up with you on this but my god im looking at jim it is about a third or about  start to come out of the hospital james m frates yes as you know the  unfortunately these patients cycled through a lot of times the average duration of therapy is very short four to six months and so when therapy changes they often sadly end up back in the hospital and so therefore there are real opportunity for new starts on early ph on unidentified analyst okay great thank you very much sandra coombs thank welcome richard f pops you’re welcome operator thank you we will now turn it back to sandy coombs for closing remarks sandra coombs thanks everyone for joining us on this busy
