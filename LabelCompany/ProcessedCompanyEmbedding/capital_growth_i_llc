in value of an asset or investment over time capital growth is measured on the basis of the current value of the asset or investment in relation to the amount originally invested in it capital growth is one of the most fundamental investment objectives for investors it generally connotes a higher appetite for risk as opposed to an income objective which may denote lower risk tolerance capital growth can also be classified into moderate growth and high growth in the equity realm the former would include blue chips while the latter would encompass speculative investments also known as capital appreciation breaking down capital growth in general the best prospects for capital growth are offered by assets where the investor has an ownership stake such as equities or real estate while both these asset classes have significant income components  equities through dividends and real estate through rental income  outsized returns on such investments accrue through the capital growth component a diversified portfolio would typically have investments with capital growth potential  like stocks and equity mutual funds or etfs  as well as assets that offer income such as bonds and real estate income trusts the asset allocation would be determined by various factors such as the investors objectives risk tolerance investment horizon etc the factors would also establish the equity allocation ie the relative amounts invested in blue chips and speculative stocks stocks that have the best capital growth prospects generally do not pay dividends since they may be able to generate better returns by reinvesting excess cash flow in their businesses as opposed to the returns available to an investor by investing dividend payouts while companies with substantial growth prospects can be found in any sector they tend to be clustered in highgrowth sectors like technology and biotechnology from a tax perspective capital growth is taxed differently from income in most jurisdictions the fact that tax on capital growth can be deferred until the asset or investment is sold while tax on income investments is due annually is a significant advantage for capital growth
