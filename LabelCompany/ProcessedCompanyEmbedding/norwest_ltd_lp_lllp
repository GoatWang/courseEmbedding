briefly sought to merge with sumitomo trust and banking one of the few stable japanese banks at the time but the latter discarded these plans after its investors reacted strongly to the proposal the keizo obuchi government which had helped to broker the talks between the banks then investigated the nationalization of ltcb which became effective by an act of the diet on october   prosecutors

of development in the united states in  when it established the sanwa bank of california •in  sanwa adopted a green cloverlike symbol as its logo and opened its first overseas office in san francisco in anticipation of the needs of japanese exporters sanwa redoubled its effort to expand in international banking and studying the bank of america as a model mapped out a strategy for growth in the retail sector it also moved its center of activity from osaka to the more dynamic tokyo of the three “osaka banks” the others being sumitomo and daiwa sanwa was most successful in exploiting the growth of the tokyo market the sanwa bank ltd is the world’s most profitable bank and second only to bank of tokyomitsubishi ltd in terms of total assets its surge to the top of the banking world during the mids has been based on the serious efforts it has made in japan to contain costs and expand its retail base expansion into north america in the s and an early entry into and continued growth of its operations in the nascent economies of asia the company’s longterm goal is to become the leading universal bank in the world the bank entered a new phase of development in the united states in  when it established the sanwa bank of california this subsidiary later acquired the charter bank and the golden state bank both in southern california and in  changed its name to golden state sanwa bank continuing its expansion in california–the world’s sixthlargest economy–the bank acquired the first city bank of rosemead in  sanwa’s s activities in the united states peaked in  with the acquisition of lloyds bank california for us million with the deal sanwa became the first japanese bank to acquire a major us bank sanwa meanwhile opened offices in new york chicago atlanta dallas boston los angeles toronto and vancouver as lending and other traditional banking operations became less profitable during the s sanwa moved even further into predominantly feebased nearbanking services notably leasing in  it acquired a leasing subsidiary from continental illinois bank for us million one of the largest japanese takeovers to that date within the first four years following the takeover the renamed sanwa business credit corporation–which was involved in vendor leasing and corporate commercial and direct finance–doubled its business volume to us billion also in  sanwa entered into a joint venture with germany’s dresdner bank and the bank of china to form china universal leasing co ltd which became the largest bankaffiliated leasing company in china additional leasing operations were subsequently established in jakarta bangkok singapore kuala lumpur and other asian cities the year  was also a key one for sanwa in terms of its overall management philosophy that year the bank shifted its primary emphasis from asset growth to increased profits in fact setting a goal of becoming the world’s most profitable bank in addition to tightening controls on costs through cuts in the work force and other strategies sanwa shifted its lending practices even more in the favor of small and mediumsized businesses generally considered less risky than large corporations by   percent of the bank’s loans went to smaller corporations in  sanwa’s president hiroshi watanabe initiated another major philosophical change when he scrapped what he considered the wishywashy aim of becoming known as “the people’s bank” of japan rather watanabe preferred a more concrete goal and settled on becoming “the global leader in universal banking” in sanwa’s initial efforts at reaching this lofty goal its most important actions occurred in japan and elsewhere in asia in its home market sanwa had a relatively weak standing in retail banking with for example only  branches and subbranches in tokyo in  compared with at least  each for its major rivals rather than acquiring smaller banks–as some of sanwa’s competitors did to their later regret after purchasing troubled banks–sanwa concentrated on setting up an extensive automated teller machine atm network which grew to number  by  at the same time that this filled the bank’s need for retail banking outlets it also meshed nicely with sanwa’s emphasis on profits since  atms could be set up for the same cost as just one branch and the employeeless atms were much cheaper to operate sanwa also pioneered in such profitsmart areas as electronic banking and although its desire to expand into financial services was frustrated by the slow pace of deregulation in japan sanwa established a securities operation there in  and a trust business in  perhaps even more important for sanwa in the long run was the bank’s aggressive moves into other asian markets during the late s and early s always the innovator sanwa established a branch in shenzhen in  becoming the first japanese commercial bank to enter china true to its roots sanwa’s overall strategy in china and elsewhere in asia was to focus on banking services for small and mediumsized companies which proved particularly successful in hong kong by  sanwa’s asian operations included  offices in china and hong kong  more elsewhere in asia the shanghai international finance company limited a joint venture in merchant banking and its various leasing operations sanwa’s aggressive international expansion had decreased its dependence on the domestic market to a level below that of any of its rivals in   percent of its revenues and  percent of its profits originated outside japan sanwa also weathered japan’s lending crisis and economic recession of the early s much better than other japanese banks and moved briefly to the top spot in worldwide banking in  in terms of assets the  merger of bank of tokyo and mitsubishi bank pushed sanwa down to number two more important to sanwa’s overall goal however the bank was also able to achieve the top spot in banking profitability in  posting pretax profits of us million heading into the end of the s sanwa was not yet the world leader in universal banking and observers noted weaknesses particularly in europe still with rapid growth projected throughout asia for the foreseeable future and sanwa far ahead of its rivals in these markets sanwa was wellpositioned to maintain a position near the top of world banking into the st century principal subsidiaries jcb co ltd sanwa
