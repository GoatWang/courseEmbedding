founded in  by gerard philips and his father frederik frederik a jewish banker based in zaltbommel financed the purchase and setup of a modest empty factory building in eindhoven where the company started the production of carbonfilament lamps and other electrotechnical products in  this first factory has been adapted and is used as a museum in  after a difficult first few years and near bankruptcy the philipses brought in anton gerards younger brother by sixteen years though he had earned a degree in engineering anton started work as a sales representative soon however he began to contribute many important business ideas with antons arrival the family business began to expand rapidly resulting in the founding of philips metaalgloeilampfabriek nv philips metal filament lamp factory ltd in eindhoven in  followed in  by the foundation of philips gloeilampenfabrieken nv philips lightbulb factories ltd after gerard and anton philips changed their family business by founding the philips corporation they laid the foundations for the later electronics multinational in the s the company started to manufacture other products such as vacuum tubes in  they introduced their electric razor the philishave marketed in the us using the norelco brand name the chapel is a radio with builtin loudspeaker which was designed during the early s philips radioedit philips chapel

dutch east indies now indonesia while pcjj broadcast in english spanish and german to the rest of the world the international program on sundays commenced in  with host eddie startz hosting the happy station show which became the worlds longestrunning shortwave program broadcasts from the netherlands were interrupted by the german invasion in may  the germans commandeered the transmitters in huizen to use for pronazi broadcasts some originating from germany others concerts from dutch broadcasters under german control philips radio was absorbed shortly after liberation when its two shortwave stations were nationalised in  and renamed radio netherlands worldwide the dutch international service some pcj programs such as happy station continued on the new station stirling engineedit philips was instrumental in the revival of the stirling engine when in the early s the management decided that offering a lowpower portable generator would assist in expanding sales of its radios into parts of the world where mains electricity was unavailable and the supply of batteries uncertain engineers at the companys research lab carried out a systematic comparison of various power sources and determined that the almost forgotten stirling engine would be most suitable citing its quiet operation both audibly and in terms of radio interference and ability to run on a variety of heat sources common lamp oil – cheap and available everywhere – was favored they were also aware that unlike steam and internal combustion engines virtually no serious development work had been carried out on the stirling engine for many years and asserted that modern materials and knowhow should enable great improvements encouraged by their first experimental engine which produced  w of shaft power from a bore and stroke of  mm ×  mm various development models were produced in a program which continued throughout world war ii by the late s the type  was ready to be handed over to philips subsidiary johan de witt in dordrecht to be produced and incorporated into a generator set as originally planned the result rated at  w electrical output from a bore and stroke of  mm ×  mm was designated mpca known as the bungalow set production of an initial batch of  began in  but it became clear that they could not be made at a competitive price besides with the advent of transistor radios with their much lower power requirements meant that the original rationale for the set was disappearing approximately  of these sets were eventually produced in parallel with the generator set philips developed experimental stirling engines for a wide variety of applications and continued to work in the field until the late s though the only commercial success was the reversed stirling engine cryocooler however they filed a large number of patents and amassed a wealth of information which they later licensed to other companies shaversedit the first philips shaver was introduced in the s and was simply called “the philishave” in the usa it was called the “norelco” which remains a part of their product line today world war iiedit on  may  the philips directors learned that the

eindhoven with few casualties among the dutch workers and civilians the philips works in eindhoven was bombed again by the raf on  march  frits philips the son of anton was the only philips family member to stay in the netherlands he saved the lives of  jews by convincing the nazis that they were indispensable for the production process at philips in  he was held at the internment camp for

cassette in  the company unveiled a special promotional film for this system in the uk featuring comedian denis norden the concept was quickly copied by the japanese makers whose tapes were significantly cheaper philips made one last attempt at a new standard for video recorders with the video  system with tapes that could be used on both sides and had  hours of total recording time as philips only sold its systems on the pal standard and in europe and the japanese makers sold globally the scale advantages of the japanese proved insurmountable and philips withdrew the v system and joined the vhs coalitioncitation needed philips had developed a laserdisc early on for selling movies but delayed its commercial launch for fear of cannibalizing its video recorder sales later philips

first few years and near bankruptcy the philipses brought in anton gerards younger brother by sixteen years though he had earned a degree in engineering anton started work as a sales representative

engineedit philips was instrumental in the revival of the stirling engine when in the early s the management decided that offering a lowpower portable generator would assist in expanding sales of its radios into parts of the world where mains electricity was unavailable and the supply of batteries uncertain engineers at the companys research lab carried out a systematic comparison of various power sources and determined that the almost forgotten stirling engine would be most suitable citing its quiet operation both audibly and in terms of radio interference and ability to run on a variety of heat sources common lamp oil – cheap and available everywhere – was favored they were also aware that unlike steam and internal combustion engines virtually no serious development work had been carried out on the stirling engine for many years and asserted that modern materials and knowhow should enable great improvements encouraged by their first experimental engine which produced  w of shaft power from a bore and stroke of  mm ×  mm various development models were produced in a program which continued throughout world war ii by the late s the type  was ready to be handed over to philips subsidiary johan de witt in dordrecht to be produced and incorporated into a generator set as originally planned the result rated at  w electrical output from a bore and stroke of  mm ×  mm was designated mpca known as the bungalow set production of an initial batch of  began in  but it became clear that they could not be made at a competitive price besides with the advent of transistor radios with their much lower power requirements meant that the original rationale for the set was disappearing approximately  of these sets were eventually produced in parallel with the generator set philips developed experimental stirling engines for a wide variety of applications and continued to work in the field until the late s though the only commercial success was the reversed stirling engine cryocooler however they filed a large number of patents and amassed a wealth of information which they later licensed to other companies shaversedit the first philips shaver was introduced in

member to stay in the netherlands he saved the lives of  jews by convincing the nazis that they were indispensable for the production process at philips in  he was held at the internment camp for

significantly cheaper philips made one last attempt at a new standard for video recorders with the video  system with tapes that could be used on both sides and had  hours of total recording time as

gerards younger brother by sixteen years though he had earned a degree in engineering anton started work as a sales representative soon however he began to contribute many important business ideas

the stirling engine when in the early s the management decided that offering a lowpower portable generator would assist in expanding sales of its radios into parts of the world where mains electricity was unavailable and the supply of batteries uncertain engineers at the companys research lab carried out a systematic comparison of various power sources and determined that the almost forgotten stirling engine would be most suitable citing its quiet operation both audibly and in terms of radio interference and ability to run on a variety of heat sources common lamp oil – cheap and available everywhere – was favored they were also aware that unlike steam and internal combustion engines virtually no serious development work had been carried out on the stirling engine for many years and asserted that modern materials and knowhow should enable great improvements encouraged by their first experimental engine which produced  w of shaft power from a bore and stroke of  mm ×  mm various development models were produced in a program which continued throughout world war ii by the late s the type  was ready to be handed over to philips subsidiary johan de witt in dordrecht to be produced and incorporated into a generator set as originally planned the result rated at  w electrical output from a bore and stroke of  mm ×  mm was designated mpca known as the bungalow set production of an initial batch of  began in  but it became clear that they could not be made at a competitive price besides with the advent of transistor radios with their much lower power requirements meant that the original rationale for the set was disappearing approximately  of these sets were eventually produced in parallel with the generator set philips developed experimental stirling engines for a wide variety of applications and continued to work in the field until the late s though the only commercial success was the reversed stirling engine cryocooler however they filed a large number of patents and amassed a wealth of information which they later licensed to other companies shaversedit the first philips shaver was introduced in the s and was simply called “the

philips the philips company was founded in  by gerard philips and his father frederik frederik a jewish banker based in zaltbommel financed the purchase and setup of a modest empty factory building in eindhoven where the company started the production of carbonfilament lamps and other electrotechnical products in  this first factory has been adapted and is used as a museum in  after a difficult first few years and near bankruptcy the philipses brought in anton gerards younger brother by sixteen years though he had earned a degree in engineering anton started work as a sales representative soon however he began to contribute many important business ideas with antons arrival the family business began to expand rapidly resulting in the founding of philips metaalgloeilampfabriek nv philips metal filament lamp factory ltd in eindhoven in  followed in  by the foundation of philips gloeilampenfabrieken nv philips lightbulb factories ltd after gerard and anton philips changed their family business by founding the philips corporation they laid the foundations for the later electronics multinational in the s the company started to manufacture other products such as vacuum tubes in  they introduced their electric razor the philishave marketed in the us using the norelco brand name the chapel is a radio with builtin loudspeaker which was designed during the early s philips radioedit philips chapel radio model a  on  march  philips went on the air with shortwave radio station pcjj later pcj which was joined in  by sister station phohi philips omroep hollandindië phohi broadcast in dutch to the dutch east indies now indonesia while pcjj broadcast in english spanish and german to the rest of the world the international program on sundays commenced in  with host eddie startz hosting the happy station show which became the worlds longestrunning shortwave program broadcasts from the netherlands were interrupted by the german invasion in may  the germans commandeered the transmitters in huizen to use for pronazi broadcasts some originating from germany others concerts from dutch broadcasters under german control philips radio was absorbed shortly after liberation when its two shortwave stations were nationalised in  and renamed radio netherlands worldwide the dutch international service some pcj programs such as happy station continued on the new station stirling engineedit philips was instrumental in the revival of the stirling engine when in the early s the management decided that offering a lowpower portable generator would assist in expanding sales of its radios into parts of the world where mains electricity was unavailable and the supply of batteries uncertain engineers at the companys research lab carried out a systematic comparison of various power sources and determined that the almost forgotten stirling engine would be most suitable citing its quiet operation both audibly and in terms of radio interference and ability to run on a variety of heat sources common lamp oil – cheap and available everywhere – was favored they were also aware that unlike steam and internal combustion engines virtually no serious development work had been carried out on the stirling engine for many years and asserted that modern materials and knowhow should enable great improvements encouraged by their first experimental engine which produced  w of shaft power from a bore and stroke of  mm ×  mm various development models were produced in a program which continued throughout world war ii by the late s the type  was ready to be handed over to philips subsidiary johan de witt in dordrecht to be produced and incorporated into a generator set as originally planned the result rated at  w electrical output from a bore and stroke of  mm ×  mm was designated mpca known as the bungalow set production of an initial batch of  began in  but it became clear that they could not be made at a competitive price besides with the advent of transistor radios with their much lower power requirements meant that the original rationale for the set was disappearing approximately  of these sets were eventually produced in parallel with the generator set philips developed experimental stirling engines for a wide variety of applications and continued to work in the field until the late s though the only commercial success was the reversed stirling engine cryocooler however they filed a large number of patents and amassed a wealth of information which they later licensed to other companies shaversedit the first philips shaver was introduced in the s and was simply called “the philishave” in the usa it was called the “norelco” which remains a part of their product line today world war iiedit on  may  the philips directors learned that the german invasion of the netherlands was to take place the following day having prepared for this anton philips and his son in law frans otten as well as other philips family members fled to the united

eindhoven with few casualties among the dutch workers and civilians the philips works in eindhoven was bombed again by the raf on  march  frits philips the son of anton was the only philips family member to stay in the netherlands he saved the lives of  jews by convincing the nazis that they were indispensable for the production process at philips in  he was held at the internment camp for political prisoners at vught for several months because a strike at his factory reduced production for his actions in saving the hundreds of jews he was recognized by yad vashem in  as a righteous

cassette in  the company unveiled a special promotional film for this system in the uk featuring comedian denis norden the concept was quickly copied by the japanese makers whose tapes were significantly cheaper philips made one last attempt at a new standard for video recorders with the video  system with tapes that could be used on both sides and had  hours of total recording time as philips only sold its systems on the pal standard and in europe and the japanese makers sold globally the scale advantages of the japanese proved insurmountable and philips withdrew the v system and joined the vhs coalitioncitation needed philips had developed a laserdisc early on for selling movies but delayed its commercial launch for fear of cannibalizing its video recorder sales later philips

zaltbommel financed the purchase and setup of a modest empty factory building in eindhoven where the company started the production of carbonfilament lamps and other electrotechnical products in  this first factory has been adapted and is used as a museum in  after a difficult first few years and near bankruptcy the philipses brought in anton gerards younger brother by sixteen years though he had earned a degree in engineering anton started work as a sales representative soon however he began to contribute many important business ideas with antons arrival the family business began to expand rapidly resulting in the founding of philips metaalgloeilampfabriek nv philips metal filament lamp factory ltd in eindhoven in  followed in  by the foundation of philips gloeilampenfabrieken nv philips lightbulb factories ltd after gerard and anton philips changed their family business by founding the philips corporation they laid the foundations for the later electronics multinational in the s the company started to manufacture other products such as vacuum tubes in  they introduced their electric razor the philishave marketed in the us using the norelco brand name the chapel is a radio with builtin loudspeaker which was designed during the early s philips radioedit philips chapel radio model a  on  march  philips went on the air with shortwave radio station pcjj later pcj which was joined in  by sister station phohi philips omroep hollandindië phohi broadcast in dutch to the dutch east indies now indonesia while pcjj broadcast in english spanish and german to the rest of the world the international program on sundays commenced in  with host eddie startz hosting the happy station show which became the worlds longestrunning shortwave program broadcasts from the netherlands were interrupted by the german invasion in may  the germans commandeered the transmitters in huizen to use for pronazi broadcasts some originating from germany others concerts from dutch broadcasters under german control philips radio was absorbed shortly after liberation when its two shortwave stations were nationalised in  and renamed radio netherlands worldwide the dutch international service some pcj programs such as happy station continued on the new station stirling engineedit philips was instrumental in the revival of the stirling engine when in the early s the management decided that offering a lowpower portable generator would assist in expanding sales of its radios into parts of the world where mains electricity was unavailable and the supply of batteries uncertain engineers at the companys research lab carried out a systematic comparison of various power sources and determined that the almost forgotten stirling engine would be most suitable citing its quiet operation both audibly and in terms of radio interference and ability to run on a variety of heat sources common lamp oil – cheap and available everywhere – was favored they were also aware that unlike steam and internal combustion engines virtually no serious development work had been carried out on the stirling engine for many years and asserted that modern materials and knowhow should enable great improvements encouraged by their first experimental engine which produced  w of shaft power from a bore and stroke of  mm ×  mm various development models were produced in a program which continued throughout world war ii by the late s the type  was ready to be handed over to philips subsidiary johan de witt in dordrecht to be produced and incorporated into a generator set as originally planned the result rated at  w electrical output from a bore and stroke of  mm ×  mm was designated mpca known as the bungalow set production of an initial batch of  began in  but it became clear that they could not be made at a competitive price besides with the advent of transistor radios with their much lower power requirements meant that the original rationale for the set was disappearing approximately  of these sets were eventually produced in parallel with the generator set philips developed experimental stirling engines for a wide variety of applications and continued to work in the field until the late s though the only commercial success was the reversed stirling engine cryocooler however they filed a large number of patents and amassed a wealth of information which they later licensed to other companies shaversedit the first philips shaver was introduced in the s and was simply called “the philishave” in the usa it was called the “norelco” which remains a part of their product line today world war iiedit on  may  the philips directors learned that the german invasion of the netherlands was to take place the following day having prepared for this anton philips and his son in law frans otten as well as other philips family members fled to the united states taking a large amount of the company capital with them operating from the us as the north american philips company they managed to run the company throughout the war at the same time the company was moved on paper to the netherlands antilles to keep it out of american hands on  december  the british no  group raf led an air raid which heavily damaged the philips radio factory in eindhoven with few casualties among the dutch workers and civilians the philips works in eindhoven was bombed again by the raf on  march  frits philips the son of anton was the only philips family member to stay in the netherlands he saved the lives of  jews by convincing the nazis that they were indispensable for the production process at philips in  he was held at the internment camp for political prisoners at vught for several months because a strike at his factory reduced production for his actions in saving the hundreds of jews he was recognized by yad vashem in  as a righteous among the nations  to edit after the war the company was moved back to the netherlands with their headquarters in eindhoven the philips light tower in eindhoven originally a light bulb factory and later the company headquarters in  the company began selling television sets in  it formed philips records which eventually formed part of polygram philips introduced the audio compact audio cassette tape in  and it was wildly successful compact cassettes were initially used for dictation machines for office typing stenographers and professional journalists as their sound quality improved cassettes would also be used to record sound and became the second mass media alongside vinyl records used to sell recorded music philips introduced the first combination portable radio and cassette recorder which was marketed as the radiorecorder and is now better known as the boom box later the cassette was used in telephone answering machines including a special form of cassette where the tape was wound on an endless loop the ccassette was used as the first mass storage device for early personal computers in the s and s philips reduced the cassette size for the professional needs with the minicassette although it would not be as successful as the olympus microcassette this became the predominant dictation medium up to the advent of fully digital dictation machinescitation needed in  philips launched the worlds first home video cassette recorder in the uk the n its relatively bulky video cassettes could record  minutes or  minutes later onehour tapes were also offered as competition came from sonys betamax and the vhs group of manufacturers philips introduced the n system which allowed doublelength recording for the first time a hour movie could fit onto one video cassette in  the company unveiled a special promotional film for this system in the uk featuring comedian denis norden the concept was quickly copied by the japanese makers whose tapes were significantly cheaper philips made one last attempt at a new standard for video recorders with the video  system with tapes that could be used on both sides and had  hours of total recording time as philips only sold its systems on the pal standard and in europe and the japanese makers sold globally the scale advantages of the japanese proved insurmountable and philips withdrew the v system and joined the vhs coalitioncitation needed philips had developed a laserdisc early on for selling movies but delayed its commercial launch for fear of cannibalizing its video recorder sales later philips joined with mca to launch the first commercial laserdisc standard and players in  philips teamed with sony to launch the compact disc this format evolved into the cdr cdrw dvd and later bluray which philips launched with sony in citation needed and  respectively in  philips split off its activities on the

radios into parts of the world where mains electricity was unavailable and the supply of batteries uncertain engineers at the companys research lab carried out a systematic comparison of various power sources and determined that the almost forgotten stirling engine would be most suitable citing its quiet operation both audibly and in terms of radio interference and ability to run on a variety of heat sources common lamp oil – cheap and available everywhere – was favored they were also aware that unlike steam and internal combustion engines virtually no serious development work had been carried out on the stirling engine for many years and asserted that modern materials and knowhow should enable great improvements encouraged by their first experimental engine which produced  w of shaft power from a bore and stroke of  mm ×  mm various development models were produced in a program which continued throughout world war ii by the late s the type  was ready to be handed over to

radios with their much lower power requirements meant that the original rationale for the set was disappearing approximately  of these sets were eventually produced in parallel with the generator set philips developed experimental stirling engines for a wide variety of applications and continued to work in the field until the late s though the only commercial success was the reversed stirling engine cryocooler however they filed a large number of patents and amassed a wealth of information which they later licensed to other companies shaversedit the first philips shaver was introduced in

philips the philips company was founded in  by gerard philips and his father frederik frederik a jewish banker based in zaltbommel financed the purchase and setup of a modest empty factory building in eindhoven where the company started the production of carbonfilament lamps and other electrotechnical products in  this first factory has been adapted and is used as a museum in  after a difficult first few years and near bankruptcy the philipses brought in anton gerards younger brother by sixteen years though he had earned a degree in engineering anton started work as a sales representative soon however he began to contribute many important business ideas with antons arrival the family business began to expand rapidly resulting in the founding of philips metaalgloeilampfabriek nv philips metal filament lamp factory ltd in eindhoven in  followed in  by the foundation of philips gloeilampenfabrieken nv philips lightbulb factories ltd after gerard and anton philips changed their family business by founding the philips corporation they laid the foundations for the later electronics multinational in the s the company started to manufacture other products such as vacuum tubes in  they introduced their electric razor the philishave marketed in the us using the norelco brand name the chapel is a radio with builtin loudspeaker which was designed during the early s philips radioedit philips chapel radio model a  on  march  philips went on the air with shortwave radio station pcjj later pcj which was joined in  by sister station phohi philips omroep hollandindië phohi broadcast in dutch to the dutch east indies now indonesia while pcjj broadcast in english spanish and german to the rest of the world the international program on sundays commenced in  with host eddie startz hosting the happy station show which became the worlds longestrunning shortwave program broadcasts from the netherlands were interrupted by the german invasion in may  the germans commandeered the transmitters in huizen to use for pronazi broadcasts some originating from germany others concerts from dutch broadcasters under german control philips radio was absorbed shortly after liberation when its two shortwave stations were nationalised in  and renamed radio netherlands worldwide the dutch international service some pcj programs such as happy station continued on the new station stirling engineedit philips was instrumental in the revival of the stirling engine when in the early s the management decided that offering a lowpower portable generator would assist in expanding sales of its radios into parts of the world where mains electricity was unavailable and the supply of batteries uncertain engineers at the companys research lab carried out a systematic comparison of various power sources and determined that the almost forgotten stirling engine would be most suitable citing its quiet operation both audibly and in terms of radio interference and ability to run on a variety of heat sources common lamp oil – cheap and available everywhere – was favored they were also aware that unlike steam and internal combustion engines virtually no serious development work had been carried out on the stirling engine for many years and asserted that modern materials and knowhow should enable great improvements encouraged by their first experimental engine which produced  w of shaft power from a bore and stroke of  mm ×  mm various development models were produced in a program which continued throughout world war ii by the late s the type  was ready to be handed over to philips subsidiary johan de witt in dordrecht to be produced and incorporated into a generator set as originally planned the result rated at  w electrical output from a bore and stroke of  mm ×  mm was designated mpca known as the bungalow set production of an initial batch of  began in  but it became clear that they could not be made at a competitive price besides with the advent of transistor radios with their much lower power requirements meant that the original rationale for the set was disappearing approximately  of these sets were eventually produced in parallel with the generator set philips developed experimental stirling engines for a wide variety of applications and continued to work in the field until the late s though the only commercial success was the reversed stirling engine cryocooler however they filed a large number of patents and amassed a wealth of information which they later licensed to other companies shaversedit the first philips shaver was introduced in the s and was simply called “the philishave” in the usa it was called the “norelco” which remains a part of their product line today world war iiedit on  may  the philips directors learned that the

eindhoven with few casualties among the dutch workers and civilians the philips works in eindhoven was bombed again by the raf on  march  frits philips the son of anton was the only philips family member to stay in the netherlands he saved the lives of  jews by convincing the nazis that they were indispensable for the production process at philips in  he was held at the internment camp for political prisoners at vught for several months because a strike at his factory reduced production for his actions in saving the hundreds of jews he was recognized by yad vashem in  as a righteous

cassette in  the company unveiled a special promotional film for this system in the uk featuring comedian denis norden the concept was quickly copied by the japanese makers whose tapes were significantly cheaper philips made one last attempt at a new standard for video recorders with the video  system with tapes that could be used on both sides and had  hours of total recording time as philips only sold its systems on the pal standard and in europe and the japanese makers sold globally the scale advantages of the japanese proved insurmountable and philips withdrew the v system and joined the vhs coalitioncitation needed philips had developed a laserdisc early on for selling movies but delayed its commercial launch for fear of cannibalizing its video recorder sales later philips

first few years and near bankruptcy the philipses brought in anton gerards younger brother by sixteen years though he had earned a degree in engineering anton started work as a sales representative

engineedit philips was instrumental in the revival of the stirling engine when in the early s the management decided that offering a lowpower portable generator would assist in expanding sales of its radios into parts of the world where mains electricity was unavailable and the supply of batteries uncertain engineers at the companys research lab carried out a systematic comparison of various power sources and determined that the almost forgotten stirling engine would be most suitable citing its quiet operation both audibly and in terms of radio interference and ability to run on a variety of heat sources common lamp oil – cheap and available everywhere – was favored they were also aware that unlike steam and internal combustion engines virtually no serious development work had been carried out on the stirling engine for many years and asserted that modern materials and knowhow should enable great improvements encouraged by their first experimental engine which produced  w of shaft power from a bore and stroke of  mm ×  mm various development models were produced in a program which continued throughout world war ii by the late s the type  was ready to be handed over to philips subsidiary johan de witt in dordrecht to be produced and incorporated into a generator set as originally planned the result rated at  w electrical output from a bore and stroke of  mm ×  mm was designated mpca known as the bungalow set production of an initial batch of  began in  but it became clear that they could not be made at a competitive price besides with the advent of transistor radios with their much lower power requirements meant that the original rationale for the set was disappearing approximately  of these sets were eventually produced in parallel with the generator set philips developed experimental stirling engines for a wide variety of applications and continued to work in the field until the late s though the only commercial success was the reversed stirling engine cryocooler however they filed a large number of patents and amassed a wealth of information which they later licensed to other companies shaversedit the first philips shaver was introduced in

member to stay in the netherlands he saved the lives of  jews by convincing the nazis that they were indispensable for the production process at philips in  he was held at the internment camp for

significantly cheaper philips made one last attempt at a new standard for video recorders with the video  system with tapes that could be used on both sides and had  hours of total recording time as

philips the philips company was founded in  by gerard philips and his father frederik frederik a jewish banker based in zaltbommel financed the purchase and setup of a modest empty factory building in eindhoven where the company started the production of carbonfilament lamps and other electrotechnical products in  this first factory has been adapted and is used as a museum in  after a difficult first few years and near bankruptcy the philipses brought in anton gerards younger brother by sixteen years though he had earned a degree in engineering anton started work as a sales representative soon however he began to contribute many important business ideas with antons arrival the family business began to expand rapidly resulting in the founding of philips metaalgloeilampfabriek nv philips metal filament lamp factory ltd in eindhoven in  followed in  by the foundation of philips gloeilampenfabrieken nv philips lightbulb factories ltd after gerard and anton philips changed their family business by founding the philips corporation they laid the foundations for the later electronics multinational in the s the company started to manufacture other products such as vacuum tubes in  they introduced their electric razor the philishave marketed in the us using the norelco brand name the chapel is a radio with builtin loudspeaker which was designed during the early s philips radioedit philips chapel radio model a  on  march  philips went on the air with shortwave radio station pcjj later pcj which was joined in  by sister station phohi philips omroep hollandindië phohi broadcast in dutch to the dutch east indies now indonesia while pcjj broadcast in english spanish and german to the rest of the world the international program on sundays commenced in  with host eddie startz hosting the happy station show which became the worlds longestrunning shortwave program broadcasts from the netherlands were interrupted by the german invasion in may  the germans commandeered the transmitters in huizen to use for pronazi broadcasts some originating from germany others concerts from dutch broadcasters under german control philips radio was absorbed shortly after liberation when its two shortwave stations were nationalised in  and renamed radio netherlands worldwide the dutch international service some pcj programs such as happy station continued on the new station stirling engineedit philips was instrumental in the revival of the stirling engine when in the early s the management decided that offering a lowpower portable generator would assist in expanding sales of its radios into parts of the world where mains electricity was unavailable and the supply of batteries uncertain engineers at the companys research lab carried out a systematic comparison of various power sources and determined that the almost forgotten stirling engine would be most suitable citing its quiet operation both audibly and in terms of radio interference and ability to run on a variety of heat sources common lamp oil – cheap and available everywhere – was favored they were also aware that unlike steam and internal combustion engines virtually no serious development work had been carried out on the stirling engine for many years and asserted that modern materials and knowhow should enable great improvements encouraged by their first experimental engine which produced  w of shaft power from a bore and stroke of  mm ×  mm various development models were produced in a program which continued throughout world war ii by the late s the type  was ready to be handed over to philips subsidiary johan de witt in dordrecht to be produced and incorporated into a generator set as originally planned the result rated at  w electrical output from a bore and stroke of  mm ×  mm was designated mpca known as the bungalow set production of an initial batch of  began in  but it became clear that they could not be made at a competitive price besides with the advent of transistor radios with their much lower power requirements meant that the original rationale for the set was disappearing approximately  of these sets were eventually produced in parallel with the generator set philips developed experimental stirling engines for a wide variety of applications and continued to work in the field until the late s though the only commercial success was the reversed stirling engine cryocooler however they filed a large number of patents and amassed a wealth of information which they later licensed to other companies shaversedit the first philips shaver was introduced in the s and was simply called “the philishave” in the usa it was called the “norelco” which remains a part of their product line today world war iiedit on  may  the philips directors learned that the german invasion of the netherlands was to take place the following day having prepared for this anton philips and his son in law frans otten as well as other philips family members fled to the united states taking a large amount of the company capital with them operating from the us as the north american philips company they managed to run the company throughout the war at the same time the company was moved on paper to the netherlands antilles to keep it out of american hands on  december  the british no  group raf led an air raid which heavily damaged the philips radio factory in eindhoven with few casualties among the dutch workers and civilians the philips works in eindhoven was bombed again by the raf on  march  frits philips the son of anton was the only philips family member to stay in the netherlands he saved the lives of  jews by convincing the nazis that they were indispensable for the production process at philips in  he was held at the internment camp for political prisoners at vught for several months because a strike at his factory reduced production for his actions in saving the hundreds of jews he was recognized by yad vashem in  as a righteous

minicassette although it would not be as successful as the olympus microcassette this became the predominant dictation medium up to the advent of fully digital dictation machinescitation needed in  philips launched the worlds first home video cassette recorder in the uk the n its relatively bulky video cassettes could record  minutes or  minutes later onehour tapes were also offered as competition came from sonys betamax and the vhs group of manufacturers philips introduced the n system which allowed doublelength recording for the first time a hour movie could fit onto one video cassette in  the company unveiled a special promotional film for this system in the uk featuring comedian denis norden the concept was quickly copied by the japanese makers whose tapes were significantly cheaper philips made one last attempt at a new standard for video recorders with the video  system with tapes that could be used on both sides and had  hours of total recording time as philips only sold its systems on the pal standard and in europe and the japanese makers sold globally the scale advantages of the japanese proved insurmountable and philips withdrew the v system and joined the vhs coalitioncitation needed philips had developed a laserdisc early on for selling movies but delayed its commercial launch for fear of cannibalizing its video recorder sales later philips

page three dimensional marks koninklijke philips v remington consumer products ltd intabylinevolkert teding van berkhout shield mark bv amsterdam netherlands verifier milca graverde looper amsterdams merkenbureau amsterdam netherlands case c on june   the european court of justice gave its decision on the interpretation of article  and  of eec directive no  to approximate the laws of the member states relating to trademarks the case was filed by the united kingdom court of appeal for a preliminary ruling in the proceedings pending before that court between koninklijke philips electronics nv and remington consumer products ltd the ecj held that only marks having a distinctive character by their nature or by the use made of them are capable of distinguishing their goods from the goods of other undertakings and thereby capable of registration in order to be capable of distinguishing an article for the purposes of article  of the directive the shape of the article in respect of which the sign is registered does not require any capricious addition such as an embellishment which has no functional purpose where a trader has been the only supplier of particular goods to the market extensive use of a sign that consists of the shape of those goods may be sufficient to give the sign a distinctive character for the purposes of article   of the directive in circumstances where as a result of that use a substantial proportion of the relevant class of persons associates that shape with that trader and no other undertaking or believes that goods of that shape come from that trader however the national court must verify the “circumstances” in which the requirement under art  is satisfied in this respect the national court must check whether the “circumstances” are based on specific and reliable data the presumed expectations of an average consumer of the category of goods or services in question who is reasonably wellinformed observant and circumspect are taken into account and the identification by the relevant class of persons of the product as originating from a given undertaking is as a result of the use of the mark as a trademark article e of the directive must be interpreted to mean that a sign consisting exclusively of the shape of a product is unregistrable by virtue thereof if it is established that the essential functional features of that shape are attributable only to the technical result moreover the ground for refusal or invalidity of registration imposed by that provision cannot be overcome by establishing that there are other shapes that allow the same technical result to be obtained     although every effort has been made to verify the accuracy of items carried in the inta bulletin readers are urged to check independently on

division referred for a preliminary ruling under article  ec seven questions concerning the interpretation of articles  and   and b of first council directive eec of  december  to approximate the laws of the member states relating to trade marks oj  l  p  hereinafter the directive      those questions have arisen in a dispute between koninklijke philips electronics nv philips and remington consumer products ltd remington concerning an action for infringement of a trade mark which philips had registered on the basis of use under the trade marks act  legal contextcommunity legislation     the purpose of the directive is as the first recital in its preamble states to approximate the laws of the member states on trade marks in order to remove existing disparities which may impede the free movement of goods and freedom to provide services and may distort competition within the common market      however according to the third recital in its preamble the directive is not intended to effect fullscale approximation of the laws of the member states relating to trade marks      article  of the directive provides under the heading signs of which a trade mark may consist a trade mark may consist of any sign capable of being represented graphically particularly words including personal names designs letters numerals the shape of goods or of their packaging provided that such signs are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings     article  of the directive which lists the grounds for refusal or invalidity of registration provides     the following shall not be registered or if registered shall be liable to be declared invalida    signs which cannot constitute a trade mark b    trade marks which are devoid of any distinctive character c    trade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which may serve in trade to designate the kind quality quantity intended purpose value geographical origin or the time of production of the goods or of rendering of the service or other characteristics of the goods or service d    trade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which have become customary in the current language or in the bona fide and established practices of the trade e    signs which consist exclusively of         the shape which results from the nature of the goods themselves or         the shape of goods which is necessary to obtain a technical result or         the shape which gives substantial value to the goods     a trade mark shall not be refused registration or be declared invalid in accordance with paragraph b c or d if before the date of application for registration and following the use which has been made of it it has acquired a distinctive character any member state may in addition provide that this provision shall also apply where the distinctive character was acquired after the date of application for registration or after the date of registration     article  which concerns the rights conferred by a trade mark provides the registered trade mark shall confer on the proprietor exclusive rights therein the proprietor shall be entitled to prevent all third parties not having his consent from using in the course of tradea    any sign which is identical with the trade mark in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which the trade mark is registered b    any sign where because of its identity with or similarity to the trade mark and the identity or similarity of the goods or services covered by the trade mark and the sign there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public which includes the likelihood of association between the sign and the trade mark      article  of the directive provides under the heading limitation of the effects of a trade mark     the trade mark shall not entitle the proprietor to prohibit a third party from using in the course of tradea    his own name or address b    indications concerning the kind quality quantity intended purpose value geographical origin the time of production of goods or of rendering of the service or other characteristics of goods or services c    the trade mark where it is necessary to indicate the intended purpose of a product or service in particular as accessories or spare parts provided he uses them in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial mattersnational legislation     trade mark registration in the united kingdom was formerly governed by the trade marks act  that act was repealed and replaced by the trade marks act  which implements the directive and contains the new law on registered trade marks      on the basis of schedule  of the trade marks act  trade marks registered under the trade marks act  may be considered to have the same effect as if they had been registered under the  act the main proceedings and the questions referred     in  philips developed a new type of threeheaded rotary electric shaver in  philips filed an application to register a trade mark consisting of a graphic representation of the shape and configuration of the head of such a shaver comprising three circular heads with rotating blades in the shape of an equilateral triangle that trade mark was registered on the basis of use under the trade marks act       in  remington a competing company began to manufacture and sell in the united kingdom the dt  which is a shaver with three rotating heads forming an equilateral triangle shaped similarly to that used by philips      philips accordingly sued remington for infringement of its trade mark remington counterclaimed for revocation of the trade mark registered by philips      the high court of justice of england and wales chancery division patents court united kingdom allowed the counterclaim and ordered revocation of the registration of the philips trade mark on the ground that the sign relied on by philips was incapable of distinguishing the goods concerned from those of other undertakings and was devoid of any distinctive character the high court also held that the trade mark consisted exclusively of a sign which served in trade to designate the intended purpose of the goods and of a shape which was necessary to obtain a technical result and which gave substantial value to the goods it went on to hold that even if the trade mark had been valid it would not have been infringed      philips appealed to the court of appeal against that decision of the high court      as the arguments of the parties raised questions relating to the interpretation of the directive the court of appeal england and wales civil division decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following questions to the court of justice for a preliminary ruling     is there a category of marks which is not excluded from registration by article b c and d and article  of council directive eec which is none the less excluded from registration by article a of the directive as being incapable of distinguishing the goods of the proprietor from those of other undertakings     is the shape or part of the shape of an article being the article in respect of which the sign is registered only capable of distinguishing for the purposes of article  if it contains some capricious addition being an embellishment which has no functional purpose to the shape of the article     where a trader has been the only supplier of particular goods to the market is extensive use of a sign which consists of the shape or part of the shape of those goods and which does not include any capricious addition sufficient to give the sign a distinctive character for the purposes of article  in circumstances where as a result of that use a substantial proportion of the relevant trade and public     a    associate the shape with that trader and no other undertaking     b    believe that goods of that shape come from that trader absent a statement to the contrary     a    can the restriction imposed by the words if it consists exclusively of the shape of goods which is necessary to achieve a technical result appearing in article eii be overcome by establishing that there are other shapes which can obtain the same technical result or     b    is the shape unregistrable by virtue thereof if it is shown that the essential features of the shape are attributable only to the technical result or     c    is some other and if so what test appropriate for determining whether the restriction applies     article c of the directive applies to trade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which may serve in trade to designate the kind quality quantity intended purpose  of the goods or service article b of the directive applies to the use by a third party of indications concerning the kind quality quantity intended purpose  of goods or services the word exclusively thus appears in article c and is omitted in article b of the directive on a proper interpretation of the directive does this omission mean that even if a mark consisting of the shape of goods is validly registered it is not infringed by virtue of article b in circumstances where     a    the use of the shape of goods complained of is and would be taken as an indication as to the kind of goods or the intended purpose thereof and     b    a substantial proportion of the relevant trade and public believe that goods of that shape come from the trade mark proprietor absent a statement to the contrary     does the exclusive right granted by article  extend to enable the proprietor to prevent third parties using identical or similar signs in circumstances where that use was not such as to indicate origin or is it limited so as to prevent only use which wholly or in part does indicate origin     is use of an allegedly infringing shape of goods which is and would be seen as an indication as to the kind of goods or the intended purpose thereof none the less such as to indicate origin if a substantial proportion of the relevant trade and public believe that goods of the shape complained of come from the trade mark proprietor absent a statement to the contrary      by application lodged at the court registry on  april  philips requested the reopening of the oral procedure which was closed on  january  following the delivery of the opinion of the advocate general andor the joinder of the present case with case c linde ag case c winward industries and case c rado in which requests for preliminary rulings referred by the bundesgerichtshof federal court of justice germany had been lodged with the court registry on  february       in support of its application philips submits that before replying to the referring court in the present case it would be sensible to take account of the views of the bundesgerichtshof in the cases mentioned in the previous paragraph which raise similar questions and thus to give the parties concerned an opportunity to submit their observations in that connection      by letters of  and  may  remington opposed the request for reopening andor joinder      the court may of its own motion on a proposal from the advocate general or at the request of the parties order that the oral procedure be reopened in accordance with article  of its rules of procedure if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or that the case must be dealt with on the basis of an argument which has not been debated between the parties see joined cases c and c deutsche post  ecr i paragraph       the court considers that it is not appropriate to join this case to those mentioned in paragraph  of this judgment and that it has all the information it needs to answer the questions raised in the main proceedings      the application made by philips must therefore be dismissed the first question     by its first question the referring court seeks to know whether there is a category of marks which is not excluded from registration by article b c and d and article  of the directive which is none the less excluded from registration by article a thereof on the ground that such marks are incapable of distinguishing the goods of the proprietor from those of other undertakings      according to philips by this question the national court seeks to know whether there is a special class of marks which even though distinctive in fact are none the less incapable of distinguishing as a matter of law philips submits that this cannot be the case in the light of the courts reasoning in its judgment in joined cases c and c windsurfing chiemsee  ecr i subject to the exception in article e of the directive if a shape has acquired a distinctive character in accordance with article  the grounds for refusal or invalidity listed in article a to d cannot apply and the shape cannot be considered devoid of distinctive character as a matter of law      remington contends that there is a significant difference between signs which do not fulfil the conditions laid down in article  of the directive in that they are not capable of distinguishing the products of one undertaking from those of another referred to in article a of that directive and marks which do not meet the criteria listed in article b c and d thereof whereas the former can never be registered evenon proof of extensive use the latter can be registered under article  on proof of a distinctive character arising from such use      the united kingdom government submits that if a sign which on its face is nondistinctive is nevertheless proved to have acquired a distinctive character that sign must in fact be capable of distinguishing the goods of one undertaking from those of others within the meaning of article  of the directive in its judgment in windsurfing chiemsee cited above the court made the point that the directive permits the registration of highly descriptive words which prima facie would not be capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings within the meaning of article  where those words have in fact acquired a distinctive character within the meaning of article  and accordingly a secondary meaning as a trade mark      the french government submits that the directive does not in itself exclude from registration a particular category of trade marks article  of the directive may lead on a casebycase basis to the exclusion of signs from trade mark protection but it must not be interpreted as excluding from such protection a category of signs per se      the commission contends that a mark which has acquired a distinctive character within the meaning of article  of the directive cannot be excluded from registration on the basis of article a thereof on the ground that it is incapable of distinguishing the goods of the trade mark proprietor from those of other undertakings findings of the court     in this connection it should be recalled to begin with that as stated in the tenth recital in the preamble to the directive the purpose of the protection afforded by a trade mark is inter alia to guarantee the trade mark as an indication of origin      moreover according to the caselaw of the court the essential function of a trade mark is to guarantee the identity of the origin of the marked product to the consumer or enduser by enabling him without any possibility of confusion to distinguish the product or service from others which have another origin and for the trade mark to be able to fulfil its essential role in the system of undistorted competition which the treaty seeks to establish it must offer a guarantee that all the goods or services bearing it have originated under the control of a single undertaking which is responsible for their quality see in particular case c loendersloot  ecr i paragraphs  and  and case c canon  ecr i paragraph       that essential function of the trade mark is also clear from the wording and the structure of the various provisions of the directive concerning the grounds for refusal of registration      first of all article  of the directive provides that all signs may constitute trade marks provided that they are capable both of being represented graphically and of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings      second under the rule laid down by article b c and d trade marks which are devoid of any distinctive character descriptive marks and marks which consist exclusively of indications which have become customary in the current language or in the bona fide and established practices of the trade are to be refused registration or declared invalid if registered windsurfing chiemsee cited above paragraph       finally article  of the directive adds a significant qualification to the rule laid down by article b c and d in that it provides that a sign may through use acquire a distinctive character which it initially lacked and thus be registered as a trade mark it is therefore through the use made of it that the sign acquires the distinctive character which is a prerequisite for its registration see windsurfing chiemsee paragraph       as the court observed at paragraph  of its judgment in windsurfing chiemsee just as distinctive character is one of the general conditions for registering a trade mark under article b distinctive character acquired through use means that the mark must serve to identify the product in respect of which registration is applied for as originating from a particular undertaking and thus to distinguish that product from goods of other undertakings      it is true that article a of the directive provides that signs which cannot constitute a trade mark are to be refused registration or if registered are liable to be declared invalid      however it is clear from the wording of article a and the structure of the directive that that provision is intended essentially to exclude from registration signs which are not generally capable of being a trade mark and thus cannot be represented graphically andor are not capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings      accordingly article a of the directive like the rule laid down by article b c and d precludes the registration of signs or indications which do not meet one of the two conditions imposed by article  of the directive that is to say the condition requiring such signs to be capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings      it follows that there is no class of marks having a distinctive character by their nature or by the use made of them which is not capable of distinguishing goods or services within the meaning of article  of the directive      in the light of those considerations the answer to the first question must be that there is no category of marks which is not excluded from registration by article b c and d and article  of the directive which is none the less excluded from registration by article a thereof on the ground that such marks are incapable of distinguishing the goods of the proprietor of the mark from those of other undertakings the second question     by its second question the national court seeks to know whether the shape of an article being the article in respect of which the sign is registered is capable of distinguishing for the purposes of article  of the directive only if it contains some capricious addition such as an embellishment which has no functional purpose      as to that philips submits that if contrary to its argument relating to the first question there is a category of marks which can be shown to have acquired a distinctive character but which are nevertheless incapable of distinguishing goods it is not appropriate to use the capricious addition test formulated by the referring court in order to ascertain which marks come within that category if it were necessary to create a special category of marks which are not capable of distinguishing those goods even though they have in fact a distinctive character philips suggests that an alternative test would be to ask whether the mark in question is the only practical way of describing the goods concerned      remington in contrast contends that if the shape of an article contains no capricious addition it will consist solely of a functional shape which will be incapable of distinguishing goods made to that shape from the same goods of another undertaking a capricious addition alone is capable of acting as an indication of origin in such cases moreover remington contends that the degree of descriptiveness is an important factor so that the more descriptive the sign the less distinctive it will be accordingly a wholly descriptive sign cannot be capable of distinguishing goods and the presence of a capricious addition is necessary to give a sign the ability to develop distinctive character      the united kingdom government submits in this regard that it is not helpful to consider whether a sign consisting of a shape contains some capricious addition or embellishment as a means of assessing whether it is capable of distinguishing for the purposes of article  of the directive      according to the french government there is nothing in the provisions of articles  and  of the directive to suggest that the shape of an article can be capable of distinguishing that article from those of other undertakings only if it contains some capricious addition consisting of an embellishment which has no functional purpose      in the light of its observations relating to the first question the commission proposes not to reply to the second question in any event it observes that articles  and a of the directive do not constitute a separate ground for refusing registration of a sign in connection with a lack of distinctiveness findings of the court     first it is clear from article  of the directive that a trade mark has distinctive character if it serves to distinguish according to their origin the goods or services in respect of which registration has been applied for it is sufficient as is clear from paragraph  of this judgment for the trade mark to enable the public concerned to distinguish the product or service from others which have another commercial origin and to conclude that all the goods or services bearing it have originated under the control of the proprietor of the trade mark to whom responsibility for their quality can be attributed      second article  of the directive makes no distinction between different categories of trade marks the criteria for assessing the distinctive character of threedimensional trade marks such as that at issue in the main proceedings are thus no different from those to be applied to other categories of trade mark      in particular the directive in no way requires that the shape of the article in respect of which the sign is registered must include some capricious addition under article  of the directive the shape in question must simply be capable of distinguishing the product of the proprietor of the trade mark from those of other undertakings and thus fulfil its essential purpose of guaranteeing the origin of the product      in the light of those considerations the answer to the second question must be that in order to be capable of distinguishing an article for the purposes of article  of the directive the shape of the article in respect of which the sign is registered does not require any capricious addition such as an embellishment which has no functional purpose the third question     by its third question the referring court essentially seeks to know whether where a trader has been the only supplier of particular goods to the market extensive use of a sign which consists of the shape of those goods is sufficient to give the sign a distinctive character for the purposes of article  of the directive in circumstances where as a result of that use a substantial proportion of the relevant class of persons associates the shape with that trader and no other undertaking or believes that goods of that shape come from that trader in the absence of a statement to the contrary      according to philips the criterion in article  of the directive is satisfied where because of extensive use of a particular shape the relevant trade and public believe that goods of that shape come from a particular undertaking moreover philips submits that a longstanding de facto monopoly on products with the relevant shape is important evidence which supports the acquisition of distinctiveness if a trader wishes to base an application for registration upon distinctiveness acquired through use a de facto monopoly is almost a prerequisite for such registration          remington submits that in the case of a shape which is made up of functional features only strong evidence is required that the shape itself has been used also as an indication of origin so as to confer on that shape a sufficient secondary meaning to justify registration where there has been a monopoly supplier of goods particular care needs to be taken to ensure that the factual analysis is focused on the relevant matters      the united kingdom government submits that any shape which is refused registration under article e of the directive cannot be protected by article  since the latter applies only to signs that would otherwise be declared invalid under article b c or d and not to those that fall within the scope of article e assuming however that the shape is not excluded from registration pursuant to the latter provision the united kingdom government submits that the requirements of article  are not satisfied where the publics recognition has come about not because of the trade mark but because of the monopoly on the supply of the goods      the french government submits that the third question should be answered in the affirmative the distinctive character required by article  of the directive may perfectly well be constituted by the fact that as a result of use a substantial proportion of the relevant trade and public associate the shape of the goods with a given trader and no other undertaking and believe that goods of that shape come from that trader      in the commissions view whether the distinctive character was acquired in a monopoly situation or in some other way the requirements of article  are satisfied as long as a substantial proportion of the relevant public believes that goods bearing the mark in question come from a particular undertaking findings of the court     in that regard it must first be observed that if a shape is refused registration pursuant to article e of the directive interpretation of which is the subject of the fourth question it can in no circumstances be registered by virtue of article       however article  of the directive provides that a mark which is refused registration under article b c or d may acquire following the use made of it a distinctive character which it did not have initially and can thus be registered asa trade mark it is thus through use that the mark acquires the distinctive character which is the precondition of registration      the distinctive character of a mark including that acquired by use must be assessed in relation to the goods or services in respect of which registration is applied for      as is clear from paragraph  of the judgment in windsurfing chiemsee in assessing the distinctive character of a mark in respect of which registration has been applied for the following may inter alia also be taken into account the market share held by the mark how intensive geographically widespread and longstanding use of the mark has been the amount invested by the undertaking in promoting the mark the proportion of the relevant class of persons who because of the mark identify goods as originating from a particular undertaking and statements from chambers of commerce and industry or other trade and professional associations      the court has also held that if on the basis of those factors the competent authority finds that the relevant class of persons or at least a significant proportion thereof identify goods as originating from a particular undertaking because of the trade mark it must in any event hold that the requirement for registering the mark laid down in article  of the directive is satisfied windsurfing chiemsee paragraph       however it must first be pointed out that the court has made clear that the circumstances in which the requirement under article  of the directive may be regarded as satisfied cannot be shown to exist solely by reference to general abstract data such as predetermined percentages windsurfing chiemsee paragraph       second the distinctive character of a sign consisting in the shape of a product even that acquired by the use made of it must be assessed in the light of the presumed expectations of an average consumer of the category of goods or services in question who is reasonably wellinformed and reasonably observant and circumspect see to that effect the judgment in case c gut springenheide and tusky  ecr i paragraph       finally the identification by the relevant class of persons of the product as originating from a given undertaking must be as a result of the use of the mark as a trade mark and thus as a result of the nature and effect of it which make it capable of distinguishing the product concerned from those of other undertakings      in the light of those considerations the answer to the third question must be that where a trader has been the only supplier of particular goods to the market extensive use of a sign which consists of the shape of those goods may be sufficient to give the sign a distinctive character for the purposes of article  of the directive in circumstances where as a result of that use a substantial proportion of the relevant class of persons associates that shape with that trader and no other undertaking or believes that goods of that shape come from that trader however it is for the national court to verify that the circumstances in which the requirement under thatprovision is satisfied are shown to exist on the basis of specific and reliable data that the presumed expectations of an average consumer of the category of goods or services in question who is reasonably wellinformed and reasonably observant and circumspect are taken into account and that the identification by the relevant class of persons of the product as originating from a given undertaking is as a result of the use of the mark as a trade mark the fourth question     by its fourth question the referring court is essentially asking whether article e second indent of the directive must be interpreted to mean that a sign consisting exclusively of the shape of a product is unregistrable by virtue of that provision if it is established that the essential functional features of the shape are attributable only to the technical result it also seeks to know whether the ground for refusal or invalidity of the registration imposed by that provision can be overcome by establishing that there are other shapes which can obtain the same technical result      in that regard philips submits that the purpose of that provision of the directive is to prevent the obtaining of a monopoly in a particular technical result by means of trade mark protection however the registration of a mark consisting of a shape which has a technical result imposes no unreasonable restraint on industry and innovation if that technical result can be obtained by other shapes which are readily available to competitors according to philips there are many alternatives to the shape constituting the trade mark at issue which would achieve the same technical result in shaving terms at an equivalent cost to that of its products      according to remington the clear meaning of article e of the directive is that a shape that is necessary to achieve a technical result in the sense that it performs a function in achieving that result but is not necessarily the only shape that can achieve that function must be excluded from registration the construction argued for by philips would render the exclusion so narrow as to be useless and would require a technical evaluation of alternative designs which would mean that the directive could not ensure protection of the public interest      the united kingdom government submits that registration must be refused if the essential features of the shape of which the sign consists are attributable only to the technical result      according to the french government the purpose of the exclusion provided for in article e second indent is to prevent the protection of technical creations which is limited in time from being circumvented by recourse to the rules on trade marks the effects of which are potentially longer lasting      both the french government and the united kingdom government take the view that the ground for refusal of registration under article e second indent of the directive cannot be overcome by establishing that there are other shapes capable of achieving the same technical result      given the legislative history of article e second indent and the need to construe exceptions narrowly the commission is of the view that the relevant criterion is the availability of alternative shapes to achieve the desired technical result findings of the court     it must first be observed in this regard that under article  of the directive a trade mark may as a rule consist of any sign capable both of being represented graphically and of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings      second it must also be borne in mind that the grounds for refusal to register signs consisting of the shape of a product are expressly listed in article e of the directive under that provision signs which consist exclusively of the shape which results from the nature of the goods themselves or the shape of the goods which is necessary to obtain a technical result or the shape which gives substantial value to the goods cannot be registered or if registered are liable to be declared invalid according to the seventh recital in the preamble to the directive those grounds for refusal have been listed in an exhaustive manner      finally the marks which may be refused registration on the grounds listed in article b c or d of the directive may under article  acquire a distinctive character through the use made of them however a sign which is refused registration under article e of the directive can never acquire a distinctive character for the purposes of article  by the use made of it      article e thus concerns certain signs which are not such as to constitute trade marks and is a preliminary obstacle liable to prevent a sign consisting exclusively of the shape of a product from being registrable if any one of the criteria listed in article e is satisfied a sign consisting exclusively of the shape of the product or of a graphic representation of that shape cannot be registered as a trade mark      the various grounds for refusal of registration listed in article  of the directive must be interpreted in the light of the public interest underlying each of them see to that effect windsurfing chiemsee paragraphs  to       the rationale of the grounds for refusal of registration laid down in article e of the directive is to prevent trade mark protection from granting its proprietor a monopoly on technical solutions or functional characteristics of a product which a user is likely to seek in the products of competitors article e is thus intended toprevent the protection conferred by the trade mark right from being extended beyond signs which serve to distinguish a product or service from those offered by competitors so as to form an obstacle preventing competitors from freely offering for sale products incorporating such technical solutions or functional characteristics in competition with the proprietor of the trade mark      as regards in particular signs consisting exclusively of the shape of the product necessary to obtain a technical result listed in article e second indent of the directive that provision is intended to preclude the registration of shapes whose essential characteristics perform a technical function with the result that the exclusivity inherent in the trade mark right would limit the possibility of competitors supplying a product incorporating such a function or at least limit their freedom of choice in regard to the technical solution they wish to adopt in order to incorporate such a function in their product      as article e of the directive pursues an aim which is in the public interest namely that a shape whose essential characteristics perform a technical function and were chosen to fulfil that function may be freely used by all that provision prevents such signs and indications from being reserved to one undertaking alone because they have been registered as trade marks see to that effect windsurfing chiemsee paragraph       as to the question whether the establishment that there are other shapes which could achieve the same technical result can overcome the ground for refusal or invalidity contained in article e second indent there is nothing in the wording of that provision to allow such a conclusion      in refusing registration of such signs article e second indent of the directive reflects the legitimate aim of not allowing individuals to use registration of a mark in order to acquire or perpetuate exclusive rights relating to technical solutions      where the essential functional characteristics of the shape of a product are attributable solely to the technical result article e second indent precludes registration of a sign consisting of that shape even if that technical result can be achieved by other shapes      in the light of those considerations the answer to the fourth question must be that article e second indent of the directive must be interpreted to mean that a sign consisting exclusively of the shape of a product is unregistrable by virtue thereof if it is established that the essential functional features of that shape are attributable only to the technical result moreover the ground for refusal or invalidity of registration imposed by that provision cannot be overcome by establishing that there are other shapes which allow the same technical result to be obtained      the referring court makes clear that consideration of the questions relating to the infringement would not be required if its interpretation of article  were to be upheld by the court of justice as the answer to the fourth question confirms that interpretation there is no need to reply to the fifth sixth and seventh questions costs     the costs incurred by the french and united kingdom governments and by the commission which have submitted observations to the court are not recoverable since these proceedings are for the parties to the main proceedings a step in the action pending before the national court the decision on costs is a matter for that court on those groundsthe courtin answer to the questions referred to it by the court of appeal england and wales civil division by order of  may  hereby rules     there is no category of marks which is not excluded from registration by article b c and d and article  of first council directive eec of  december  to approximate the laws of the member states relating to trade marks which is none the less excluded from registration by article a thereof on the ground that such marks are incapable of distinguishing the goods of the proprietor of the mark from those of other undertakings     in order to be capable of distinguishing an article for the purposes of article  of the directive the shape of the article in respect of which the sign is registered does not require any capricious addition such as an embellishment which has no functional purpose     where a trader has been the only supplier of particular goods to the
