characters  references  external links switzerlandedit origin of the nameedit road sign to hunzikon canton lucerne while several explanations exist for the origin of the surname hunziker the following appears to be that stated by most if not all swiss historians in the th and th centuries surnames often indicated a persons hometown hunzikers originated in the th century from a very small village called hunzingen today called hunzikon just east of geuensee canton lucerne in the th century the family was also found in large numbers in the wetzwil neighborhood of schlierbach canton lucerne and then spread throughout the suhrental suhre river valley in the th and th century swiss surnames were derived by appending the syllable –er this largely replaced the practice of using the von prefix view from small hamlet of hunzikon origination of hunzikers looking west across the suhre several hunzikers living in aargau have expressed a belief that the surname descends from the traditional occupation of dog breeder hundezüchter and have indicated that hunzikers have been involved with the development of several dog breeds this belief is supported in part by the rampant hound regularly found in hunziker coats of arms another possible origin raised by some genealogists is a reference to a valley in which a hun army camped a valley or part thereof might be referred to as a corner or ecke in german and hence the huns valley would be hunsecke however these explanations appear to be speculative early historyedit during the th and th centuries most hunzikers belonged to reformed protestant denominations and lived largely in and near unteraargau from  to  this part of aargau belonged to the old state of berne from  to  to the minicanton of aargau and in  was merged and made part of the modern canton aargau by the early th century records demonstrate that a master named hans hunziker lived in aarau his sons niklaus and hans became significantly involved with the urban upper class niklaus was a member of the court in  and city council in  his son was an aarau schultheiß and his brothers also held offices in the th century family members were influential schultheiß councilors and pastors in the th century hunzikers became heavily involved in the aargau textile industry about  johann jakob hunziker founded a textile firm in aarau the factory erected in  still stands johann jakobs grandson guido ulrich hunziker ran the firm until  before  persons with the surname hunziker lived primarily in canton aargau aarau bottenwil gontenschwil hendschiken kirchleerau leimbach moosleerau muhen oberkulm oftringen reitnau staffelbach unterbözberg and unterkulm canton berne schwarzhäusern wynau and canton basellandschaft arisdorf hunziker diasporaedit hunzikers in their traditional homeland of unteraargau were particularly impacted by civil strife natural disaster and cultural upheaval battles of the kappelerkriegs – the first war of villmergen in  and the toggenburg war or second war of villmergen in  collectively the villmergerkriegs occurred largely in and near modern aargau and reinforced significant religious conflicts in the region famine and plague were common during the th century also during this period argovite cottage industries cotton and silk weaving cigar production were devastated by industrialization in england and elsewhere as discussed below berne engaged in a ruthless repression of anabaptists during the th th and th centuries from  to  modern aargau was created from four distinct areas baden freie ämter fricktal and unteraargau different regions had been forcefully converted to protestantism or catholicism with even further reconversions while others were allowed religious freedom government in the different regions also differed significantly fricktal had been outside of swiss control altogether having been controlled by the habsburgs as a result the new union was not stable conflicts driven by ruralurban conflict resulted in the freiämtersturm revolt of  which was resolved in large part by aargau canton president johann georg hunziker a change from a  split of cantonal representation for reformed and catholic resulted in bloody conflict in  in  potato rot spread the  swiss civil war resulted in further argovite casualties these cultural and economic pressures drove many argovites including hunzikers from switzerland anabaptistsedit in the th century many hunzikers especially from the emmental became involved with pacifist anabaptist movements especially the swiss brethren the anabaptist movements typically propounded believers baptism voluntary church membership and other positions that contradicted those of the catholic church martin luther and ulrich zwingli anabaptists properties were confiscated berne in particular attempted to eradicate all anabaptists from the canton sentencing them to galley slavery flogging branding and expelling anabaptist ministers and in  established an anabaptist bureau specifically to persecute the anabaptists many anabaptists were imprisoned and tortured at trachselwald castle thun castle and other swiss sites anabaptists were held in cells known as deathboxes executions of swiss anabaptists were not uncommon during the th and th centuries in the late th through early th centuries many anabaptists were expelled from or otherwise left switzerland for the palatinate alsace moravia hesse france luxembourg lorraine bavaria galicia volhynia tyrol austria and the netherlands hunzikers in particular emigrated to the palatinate bavaria and alsace ongoing persecution in those locations led to further emigration to poland russia and the us william penn invited some to settle in pennsylvania and starting in  numerous anabaptist swiss settled in pennsylvania after continued persecution in the th century some swiss anabaptists joined the swiss state church in  anabaptists who remained in communion with those in the state church became known as mennonite and those who rejected communion with those in the state church were known as amish hunzikers were found in both camps one of the earliest hunzikers to reach the united states was valentine hunsicker – valentine was born in switzerland apparently in a reformed household moved to the palatine arrived in philadelphia in  and became a prominent us mennonite in the earlytomidth century a number of mennonite hunzikers were released from the dungeons only upon intercession from the netherlands and their promise to emigrate to the united states north americaedit american hunzikers have played a critical role in the us mennonite church the name is typically anglicized such as hunsaker huntzinger or unsicker some genealogists have speculated that

characters  references  external links switzerlandedit origin of the nameedit road sign to hunzikon canton lucerne while several explanations exist for the origin of the surname hunziker the following appears to be that stated by most if not all swiss historians in the th and th centuries surnames often indicated a persons hometown hunzikers originated in the th century from a very small village called hunzingen today called hunzikon just east of geuensee canton lucerne in the th century the family was also found in large numbers in the wetzwil neighborhood of schlierbach canton lucerne and then spread throughout the suhrental suhre river valley in the th and th century swiss surnames were derived by appending the syllable –er this largely replaced the practice of using the von prefix view from small hamlet of hunzikon origination of hunzikers looking west across the suhre several hunzikers living in aargau have expressed a belief that the surname descends from the traditional occupation of dog breeder hundezüchter and have indicated that hunzikers have been involved with the development of several dog breeds this belief is supported in part by the rampant hound regularly found in hunziker coats of arms another possible origin raised by some genealogists is a reference to a valley in which a hun army camped a valley or part thereof might be referred to as a corner or ecke in german and hence the huns valley would be hunsecke however these explanations appear to be speculative early historyedit during the th and th centuries most hunzikers belonged to reformed protestant denominations and lived largely in and near unteraargau from  to  this part of aargau belonged to the old state of berne from  to  to the minicanton of aargau and in  was merged and made part of the modern canton aargau by the early th century records demonstrate that a master named hans hunziker lived in aarau his sons niklaus and hans became significantly involved with the urban upper class niklaus was a member of the court in  and city council in  his son was an aarau schultheiß and his brothers also held offices in the th century family members were influential schultheiß councilors and pastors in the th century hunzikers became heavily involved in the aargau textile industry about  johann jakob hunziker founded a textile firm in aarau the factory erected in  still stands johann jakobs grandson guido ulrich hunziker ran the firm until  before  persons with the surname hunziker lived primarily in canton aargau aarau bottenwil gontenschwil hendschiken kirchleerau leimbach moosleerau muhen oberkulm oftringen reitnau staffelbach unterbözberg and unterkulm canton berne schwarzhäusern wynau and canton basellandschaft arisdorf hunziker diasporaedit hunzikers in their traditional homeland of unteraargau were particularly impacted by civil strife natural disaster and cultural upheaval battles of the kappelerkriegs – the first war of villmergen in  and the toggenburg war or second war of villmergen in  collectively the villmergerkriegs occurred largely in and near modern aargau and reinforced significant religious conflicts in the region famine and plague were common during the th century also during this period argovite cottage industries cotton and silk weaving cigar production were devastated by industrialization in england and elsewhere as discussed below berne engaged in a ruthless repression of anabaptists during the th th and th centuries from  to  modern aargau was created from four distinct areas baden freie ämter fricktal and unteraargau different regions had been forcefully converted to protestantism or catholicism with even further reconversions while others were allowed religious freedom government in the different regions also differed significantly fricktal had been outside of swiss control altogether having been controlled by the habsburgs as a result the new union was not stable conflicts driven by ruralurban conflict resulted in the freiämtersturm revolt of  which was resolved in large part by aargau canton president johann georg hunziker a change from a  split of cantonal representation for reformed and catholic resulted in bloody conflict in  in  potato rot spread the  swiss civil war resulted in further argovite casualties these cultural and economic pressures drove many argovites including hunzikers from switzerland anabaptistsedit in the th century many hunzikers especially from the emmental became involved with pacifist anabaptist movements especially the swiss brethren the anabaptist movements typically propounded believers baptism voluntary church membership and other positions that contradicted those of the catholic church martin luther and ulrich zwingli anabaptists properties were confiscated berne in particular attempted to eradicate all anabaptists from the canton sentencing them to galley slavery flogging branding and expelling anabaptist ministers and in  established an anabaptist bureau specifically to persecute the anabaptists many anabaptists were imprisoned and tortured at trachselwald castle thun castle and other swiss sites anabaptists were held in cells known as deathboxes executions of swiss anabaptists were not uncommon during the th and th centuries in the late th through early th centuries many anabaptists were expelled from or otherwise left switzerland for the palatinate alsace moravia hesse france luxembourg lorraine bavaria galicia volhynia tyrol austria and the netherlands hunzikers in particular emigrated to the palatinate bavaria and alsace ongoing persecution in those locations led to further emigration to poland russia and the us william penn invited some to settle in pennsylvania and starting in  numerous anabaptist swiss settled in pennsylvania after continued persecution in the th century some swiss anabaptists joined the swiss state church in  anabaptists who remained in communion with those in the state church became known as mennonite and those who rejected communion with those in the state church were known as amish hunzikers were found in both camps one of the earliest hunzikers to reach the united states was valentine hunsicker – valentine was born in switzerland apparently in a reformed household moved to the palatine arrived in philadelphia in  and became a prominent us mennonite in the earlytomidth century a number of mennonite hunzikers were released from the dungeons only upon intercession from the netherlands and their promise to emigrate to the united states north americaedit american hunzikers have played a critical role in the us mennonite church the name is typically anglicized such as hunsaker huntzinger or unsicker some genealogists have speculated that the surname honeysuckle found among cherokee and seminole tribe members may be a variant created by marriage of swiss immigrants with native americans and transformation of the surname to match an
