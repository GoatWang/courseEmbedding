company news blog recent images from the core labjuly  posted by trevor newton i was in calgary yesterday in the core lab meeting with some folks about stratas oil project the core lab is a big warehouse where thousands of meters of drillcore is stored from stratas wells and also many other alberta oil companies i thought you might like to see some pictures i took of the core many of you have seen images of our drillcore before but this time the pictures im showing you are specifically of our blueskygething core which is the sandsportion of our deposit which sits above the carbonates take a look at these beautiful samples these are images of strata oils drillcore from its blueskygething sands were in the process right now of determining whether any of the extraheavy oil in our sands can flow unassisted this is known as coldproduction of heavy oil and several other companies in the peace river region have had good success with it especially baytex energy our technical team is working on some recommendations and we should hear from them later this month the room where i was viewing the core absolutely reeked like bitumen if youve ever been around a pavingcrew when theyre spreading asphalt you know the smell i love it but thats probably because i know its worth money itll make you dizzy after awhile here are some pictures i took of the carbonateportion of the core here are more images of core from our debolt carbonates notice how the extraheavy oil is oozing from the pores in the rock when the drill crews were making their notes they remarked about the unusually high amount of oil coming out also notice how relatively fine the rock appears yet the permeability of our carbonate deposit is excellent the interconnectedness amongst the spaces within the rock itself is very high according to our technical experts which makes production recovery levels potentially much higher also of interest is the fact that this carbonate rock is actually very crumbly as you might expect sedimentary carbonate rock to be on another note the oil and gas journal just published an article which goes into some detail on albertas carbonatebitumen deposits the article is a bit technical but i thought you might like it more news later this month tweet     strata oil  gas inc all rights reserved   legal statement home about strata news projects investors contact   signup
