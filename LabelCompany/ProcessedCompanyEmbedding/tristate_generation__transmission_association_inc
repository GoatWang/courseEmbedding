by tristate to deliver to its  member cooperatives reached a significant milestone on oct  when cimarron solar facility’s first module of  megawatts officially began commercial operation  the megawatt photovoltaic facility is currently under construction in northeastern new mexico     the acre plant site which is located within the service territory of tristate member system springer electric cooperative is scheduled to be brought into commercial service in  megawatt blocks  right now we’re anticipating that the second  megawatts at cimarron will begin commercial operation by the end of october and the final block of  megawatts will go into service by midnovember said scott fernau tristate’s senior transmission project manager     the megawatt kit carson windpower project is also nearing its startup phase as tristate’s project field support telecommunications metering and scada personnel work through the final phases of equipment testing at the landsman creek substation which will serve this eastern colorado wind farm that is owned and operated by duke energy generation services   once the work is finalized next month at the substation we will be able to start back feeding power to the duke energy wind site so that their construction crews can complete their testing and commissioning of the project’s  turbines for a commercial startup by dec  said fernau   the kit carson windpower project is located on a  acre site approximately seven miles northwest of burlington colo  it is located within the service territory of tristate member kc electric association based

breakthroughs by investing in research and development aimed at tackling a number of important energy and environmental issues – and it has been recognized by the electric industry for its commitment to these initiatives   energy innovation isn’t just about finding new sources of power it’s about exploring new ways of producing and delivering it  tristate is using both products and services as well as technology to lessen emissions to meet growing demand with less environmental impact   combining new and traditional energy resources while exploring new methods of carbon capture and utilization to reduce greenhouse gas emissions results in cleaner production which equals cleaner air   tristate and other electric utilities look to research and development rd and advanced technology to help meet the challenges of providing reliable service while following increasingly complex and stringent regulatory guidelines and regulations  these ventures can be risky costly and time consuming so electric utilities often pool their resources to make the most of this vital aspect of the industry   tristate is involved with many rd projects on two levels core research and demonstration projects  core research is pooled by way of funding from members of a consortium and is of a general nature so it can benefit the majority  demonstration projects are of interest to only select utility members and the results usually study a specific issue for only a small number of funders   tristate and its member systems participate in several collaborative research groups       electric power research institute is a worldwide consortium of nearly  utilities whose collaborative science and technology portfolio spans every aspect of power generation delivery and enduse applications   cooperative research network provides electric cooperatives with the technical information and business tools that lead to the development of new products and services of particular value to the cooperative industry   power system engineering research center is a network of universities working with industry to find innovative solutions to challenges facing electric utilities and to educate the next generation of power industry engineers   utility variable generation integration group provides a forum for the critical analysis of wind technology for utility applications and to serve as a source of credible information on the status of wind technology and deployment   solar electric interest group provides a forum for participants to exchange information on all solar
