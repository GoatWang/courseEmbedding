team board of directors royalty products investors  media contact us these are our current clinical studies for more details on a particular product candidate click on its name pegsn ezn through the use of our pegylation technology we designed pegsn ezn a pegylated conjugate of sn to offer therapeutic advantages over unmodified sn and existing therapies the pegylated version allows parenteral delivery increased solubility higher exposure more profound deoxyribonucleic acid dna damage inhibition of angiogenesis and longer apparent halflife of sn see presentations and publications » hif alpha antagonist ezn hif alpha is overexpressed in many cancer types including common solid tumors it is a key regulator of numerous genes important in cancer biology and is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy drugs targeting hif alpha thus have the potential to target multiple cancer processes see presentations and publications » survivin antagonist ezn survivin plays a vital regulatory role in both apoptosis and cell division survivin is highly expressed in many cancers and in newly formed endothelial cells engaged in angiogenesis with little expression in normal adult tissues resistance of cancer cells to radiotherapy and cytotoxic drugs is strongly correlated with expression levels of survivin clinically survivin expression is associated with poor prognosis increased cancer recurrence and resistance to therapy  see presentations and publications » androgen receptor mrna antagonist ezn the ar is a validated target for the treatment of prostate cancer several approved androgenblocking or –binding agents have therapeutic benefit but prostate cancer typically develops resistance to these agents enzon’s lnabased ar mrna antagonist provides a novel and innovative strategy for the treatment of prostate cancer in preclinical studies enzon’s mrna antagonist downregulated the ar inhibited tumor growth when given alone and enhanced the antitumor activity of conventional agents that inhibit ar activity see presentations and publications » mrna antagonists enzon is developing additional lnabased mrna antagonists to other targets that drive tumor growth we have worldwide rights except for in europe to develop and commercialize the compounds lead molecules that target her and betacatenin have demonstrated antitumor activity in animal models of human cancer  enzon pharmaceuticals inc all rights reserved technology platforms — enzon   home about enzon overview executive team board of directors royalty products investors  media contact us enzon’s two versatile platform technologies are the basis of its four clinicalstage product candidates and multiple preclinical compounds enzon currently receives royalties on a number of marketed products based on its customized pegylation linker technology which is also employed by one other product candidate currently under latestage development for information about partnership opportunities please contact enzon’s business development team at partneringenzoncom customized linker technology our core expertise has been in engineering improved versions of injectable therapeutics through the chemical attachment of polyethylene glycol peg using our customized linker technology this pegylation technology employs proprietary chemical linkers designed to either release the native molecule at a controlled rate or provide permanent linkage that will maximize inherent activity of the native molecule in some cases pegylation can render a compound therapeutically effective whereas the unmodified form had only limited clinical utility a number of marketed biologic products utilize this novel pegylation platform to order peg reagents please contact nof corporation at ddsdrugcom and pegdrugcom locked nucleic acid lna it is now clear that many of the most important targets that drive tumor growth are currently unapproachable with antibodies because they are intracellular or very difficult to drug with small molecules enzon has licensed a number of messenger ribonucleic acid mrna antagonists based on locked nucleic acid lna technology to inhibit transcription factors or molecules that rely on proteinprotein interaction to drive tumor growth and are considered difficult to drug enzon’s lnabased oligonucleotides have demonstrated in preclinical models that such compounds can downregulate the target and inhibit tumor growth thereby supporting clinical studies we hold rights worldwide other than in europe to develop and commercialize these mrna antagonists which target hypoxiainducible factor alpha hif alpha survivin androgen receptor ar and additional targets in preclinical research  enzon pharmaceuticals inc all rights reserved enzon   home about
