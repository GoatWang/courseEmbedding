meeting with dr yeaton on  im a little nervous but hes close and sounds good by the comments posted met dr but he did not continue with consult as i had my  yr old with me i was very upset but it worked out that i could go the following week with my sister who had an appt  after meeting both dr anderson and yeaton we were on a high and thrilled we found someone so close to homethey are thorough and down to earth answered our questions and werent afraid to answer some of the hard pressed ones about the hospital or their experience we are delighted so farthere is a support group and follow up care they have referrals to the dietician and psych who does not take my insurance or my sisters  go figurei trust their skills and they are both very sweet6 postop  dr yeaton can be short and i was not pleased with his attitude when i came home and nearly passed out he was not helpful with my husband wondering what to do with me also dont expect him to give support afterwards go to the support group caroline or jamie are the co leaders and are very helpful have your aftercare support set up before hand also my followup appt was set for  days after surgery i took out my own stitches and am healing well saw dr anderson for my follow up as yeaton was out and the staff thought maybe i should be seen he was positive shook my hand and i liked him a whole lot better than yeaton scheduled my next followup with him too they have stopped surgeries for good after losing a couple of patients the hospital wont let them since january i guess im glad i had it done but i would pick someone with more experience if i did it again you should too july   robbien q dr yeaton was very friendly upon meeting him he was very matter of fact and honest with information re pre op post op aftercare and risks as well as benefits i liked him and i appreciated his honesty jan   tricia a dr yeatonwas very straight forward he has got a good well structured program and very strict about follow up being a nurse i know what i wanted from my md and also checked with peers around the captial district he has got an excellent reputation his office staff is friendly they did all the work on the preapproval my mother also had the surgery but when they went in found some unexpected surprises he handled it like a pro and my mother was a handful if you decide to go for the surgery i would recommend him he is very serious and will only take you if your are sure this is what you want this is a serious step and he is very strict nov   pam v my first impression was a bit abrupt he was talking to someone on the phone but when he came into the room that changed a great deal he made me feel very comfortable and that he cared he did not make feel rushed he told me every thing i had read and even answered question i had even before i asked them he did notice that i had my list and i had told him of my research he made me feel important to him his office staff were very pleasent and they take care of all the paper work and phone calls which was a reliefi cant say there was any thing i disliked about him or the staffhe went into great detail of the aftercare program and urged that i particpate in the support group he did address the risk of the surgery i would so far rate him a  i feel that surgical competence and beside manner are both important when you are putting your life into their hands if i feel the st bit uncomfortable with him i would not continue with the procedure and what made me feel better even was the fact that he does not allow some interns to come in do the work only himself and his associate will be doing it the was a good thingand to top it off he is a very handsome man july   tracey c dr yeaton was wonderful the girls at his office are great prior to my consult with him i called quite a few times and asked questions and they were always very friendly and willing to answer whatever they could my calls have been promptly returned and questions answered quickly and fully dr yeaton himself was great he was very clear and understanding i never felt uncomfortable or embarressed the office got me in very quickly and arranged for other tests to be done right away my overall impression was that dr yeaton and his staff are great i would recommend them to anyone may 6  cecilia c i met doctor yeaton on may   for my consultation he was
