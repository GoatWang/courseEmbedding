boston marketjune    by valerie killiferboston market has experienced its share of highs and lows over the past  years but with the june  announcement of f lane cardwell jrs appointment as ceo the chain could quickly get back on track as the leader in home meal replacement cardwell was serving on famous daves board of directors a position from which he has since resigned prior to taking the helm at boston marketbetween  and  he held positions at brinker international and sa restaurant corp and his roles with brinker included chief administrative officer and then ceo of eatzis market and bakery as bostons markets newest frontman cardwell said his top priority is not to get in the way he also plans to help reposition the company as the leader in the mealstogo category we recently had the opportunity to ask cardwell some questions about boston markets past present and future read on for more insights and information  having been a member of the brinker international system for nearly  years what lessons did you learn that can be applied to boston market overall my experience has shown me a lot about what works and what doesnt in home meal replacement as the evp of strategic development for brinker i learned a great deal about home meal repleacement a term boston market coined in  we took those learnings and developed eatzis where i served as the ceo that concept showed me that customers wanted hot food which they could eat right then but that they would also be interested in purchasing the same food chilled that they could take away and eat at a later time at corner bakery we evaluated and converted the service model from a cafeteria style of ordering to one where the customer orders at the counter finds a seat and has their food delivered to them boston market may be able to test new ways to approach our guests with chilled meals and to serve them differently  what do you see as some of boston markets biggest challenges and strengths in this economic environment consumers are reevaluating value in terms of portion size price quality convenience and service one of the biggest challenges will be addressing this new definition of price value everything is up for grabshowever this may also be one of our biggest strengths fast casual concepts are getting a lot of attention precisely for their combination of quality competitive pricing casual atmosphere and convenient service models boston market already works on many of those levels especially the quality of our food that is our major strength we dont have to fix the food we just need to do a better job of communicating why it is so good another challenge is rate of change implementing change across  restaurants is always a challenge  where do you see boston market positioned in the fast casual space its really hard to peg us down we are in the chicken category but we sell a lot of other proteins – turkey meat loaf brisket we are a restaurant but we are also home meal replacement with a signficant percentage of our sales in takeout we compete with restaurants but we also compete with grocery stores we need to refocus on our original reason for being boston market offers convenient affordable highquality meals that can be picked up and eaten at home we also need to communicate that we do chicken better than anyone  what are your first few priorities as boston markets ceo my first priority is not to get in the way we have a tremendous amount of longevity here at boston market and our team is doing many things right additionally my priority is to ask a lot of questions and be the voice of the customer ive been a fan of boston markets and have eaten there  times a month over the last  years in fact i eat out in restaurants about  times a year ive often wondered why certain things were done and others werent now i have a chance to dig in and understand the details of our positioning finally id like to communicate why our food is so good customers love our food but they dont really know why they love it we need to tell them why for example we need to communicate that our chickens are never more than two hours old in grocery stores they use a calendar to determine the freshness of their chicken at boston market we use a watch were always cooking our rotisserie chicken and you can taste the difference  how does the chains new  menu fit into its future brand positioning i mentioned earlier that customers are reassessing value well the  price point seems to be part of this new vernacular we introduced a menu of offerings at this price point last fall and we recently gave this menu a bigger presence in our stores the quality of the food on our  menu is a step above many other competitive offerings at this price point for example our chicken carver sandwich is literally carved to order from our allnatural rotisserie chicken that is never more than two hours old and then placed on an artisan roll we dont plan to walk away from this menu but we do plan to communicate our quality story we have  meals not just  deals  theres nothing really like boston market in the restaurant segment as a whole how do you see boston market competing with other fast casual chains for a portion of dinner dollars speaking specifically of dinner we have a real strength in this area family meals are our sweet spot and the economy is playing to our strengths for example you can feed a family of  very well for about  our typical family meal for four includes a one and a quarter rotisserie chickens four large sides and four cornbreads this is quality food at a price lower than many of our competitors during this day part this week we will also begin a family meal promotion where customers can add an additional whole rotisserie chicken to any family meal for only  its like getting another meal for two bucks  who do you see as its main competitors and what steps is the company taking to remarket itself and regain market share we look at everyone in fast casual as our competition but we see grocery as a big competitor as well back when i was with steak  ale we started watching the blurring of grocery and restaurants in fact a decade ago there were breakout sessions at grocery trade shows on how to boston marketize your grocery store now its our turn to take a page from grocerywhole foods for example has an entire display of chilled items that can be eaten immediately or taken to go to be eaten later we can perhaps offer customers different ways they can use boston market with more chilled items there is clearly a demand for restaurant quality meals to go and boston market was the originator of this idea during its hayday boston market was the most talked about restaurant chain among its customers and its competitors perhaps we can find new ways to reclaim thattopics operations management soupsaladsponsored linksrelated contentfranchise focus owner of  jimmy johns attributes success to empowering
