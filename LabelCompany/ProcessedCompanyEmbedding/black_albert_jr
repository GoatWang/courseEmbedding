albert cleage  pbs during the s many religious leaders led by malcolm x and the nation of islam sharply criticized the methods and advances claimed by the civil rights movement by far the most vocal christian minister advocating a more radical approach to obtaining civil rights was albert cleage jr albert cleage was born in indianapolis in  and grew up in detroit he received his ba from wayne state in  and his bachelor of divinity from oberlin graduate school of theology in  cleage was ordained in the congregational church in  after a briefand disappointingterm as pastor at an integrated church in san francisco cleage returned to detroit in  and served at st marks united presbyterian mission he soon clashed with white presbyterian leaders over issues of how he should lead his black congregation in  cleage and a group of followers left to form the central congregation church they were committed to ministering to the downtrodden and offered several programs for the communitys poor throughout the s cleage was active in issues of education and black political leadership by the late s his vision of christianity had radicalized alongside the disappointments of the civil rights movement and rise of black power he launched the black christian national movement in  which called for black churches to reinterpret jesus teachings to suit the social economic and political needs of black people that easter cleage unveiled an foot painting of a black madonna and renamed central congregational the shrine of the black madonna in  following a year of racial unrest in detroit cleage published the black messiah which detailed his vision of jesus as a black revolutionary leader in  he published his second book black christian nationalism and inaugurated the black christian nationalist movement as a separate denomination the name was later changed to the pan african orthodox christian church paocc and cleage changed his own name to jaramogi abebe agyeman meaning liberator holy man savior of the nation in swahili the paocc includes churches in atlanta ga and houston tx several cultural centers bookstores community service centers and a working farm jaramogi abebe agyeman died on february   the paocc continues his mission to uplift and liberate the pan african world community through the teachings of jesus the black messiah key moments of faith childhood influences cleages father was a pioneering black physician and their social class gave them access to detroits black aristocracy but even as a boy cleage was affected by detroits labor and civil rights struggles and gravitated toward issues of social justice an interracial fellowship failed cleage was ordained in the congregational church in  and became interim pastor at the newlyorganized integrated san francisco church for the fellowship of all peoples one of the founders of the fellowship church was black theologian howard thurman cleage was originally committed to interracial fellowship but when he saw the social inequality among the congregation especially the japaneseamerican members who had been forcibly removed from their homes and placed in interment camps he grew critical he called the church a contrived artificial affair that did not address racial inequalities of power and property an independent denomination in  cleage returned to detroit to serve at st marks united presbyterian mission whose founders included his father and uncle despite initially feeling at home at st marks cleage quickly came into conflict with the rigid presbyterian hierarchy he resented that white leaders in the suburbs could tell him how to run his black innercity congregation and in  he led a group of dissidents out of the church in this respect cleage was a decade ahead of black presbyterians and congregationalists who would later demand freedom to make changes to suit the needs of their congregations black arts conference stokely carmichael called for black power in the summer of  the same year cleage held the first annual black arts conference at central congregational the church cleage founded after leaving st marks the conference was his answer to the nation of islams call for blacks to find beauty in their own identity and culture the shrine of the black madonna on easter of  cleage unveiled an foot painting of a black madonna and renamed central congregational as the shrine of the black madonna at the same time he launched a black christian national movement which called for black churches to reinterpret jesus teachings believing that christianity previously had been used to keep black people down cleage challenged black churches to embrace jesus as a revolutionary black leader a zealot seeking to lead a black nation to freedom central to this belief was resurrecting the historical black messiah cleage wanted to dehonkify jesus for black christians the black messiah in  cleage published the black messiah which included several sermons and articles published in his weekly column message to the black nation in the michigan chronicle he also spread his views through participation in the interreligious foundation for community organization and the national black economic development conference the pan african orthodox christian churchin  cleage inaugurated the black christian nationalist movement as a separate denomination the name was later changed to the pan african orthodox christian church paocc in  a southern region of the paocc was established in atlanta ga followed by the southwest region in houston tx in  the paoccs mission which still continues after cleages death is to uplift empower and liberate the pan african world community and to bring the black church back to its historic rootsthe
