achieved fixedincome securities present issuer default risk  securities held by the fund may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the united states  market risk may affect a single issuer sector of the economy industry or the market as a whole an increase in interest rates may lower the value of the fixedincome securities held by the fund  declining interest rates may compel borrowers to prepay mortgages and debt obligations underlying the mortgagebacked securities owned by the fund the proceeds received by the fund from prepayments may be reinvested at interest rates lower than the original investment thus resulting in a reduction of income to the fund  rising interest rates could reduce prepayments and extend the life of securities with lower interest rates which may increase the sensitivity of the fund’s value to rising interest rates  there may be limited liquidity for certain fixedincome securities  the fund may hold securities for which prices from pricing

recommendations the bloomberg barclays intermediate government index is a subindex of the bloomberg barclays government bond index covering issues with remaining maturities of between three and five years  the bloomberg barclays government bond index is an index that measures the performance of all public us government obligations with remaining maturities of one year or more  the returns include the reinvestment of income and do not include any transaction costs management fees or other costs  it is not possible to invest directly in an index  duration is a measure of estimated price sensitivity relative to changes in interest rates  portfolios with longer durations are typically more sensitive to changes in interest rates  for example if interest rates rise by  the market value of a security with an effective duration of  years would decrease by  with all other factors being constant  the correlation between duration and price sensitivity is greater for securities rates investmentgrade than it is for securities rated below investmentgrade  duration estimates are based on assumptions by the adviser and are subject to a number of limitations  effective duration is calculated based on historical price changes of securities held by the fund and therefore is a more accurate estimate of price sensitivity provided interest rates remain within their historical range

the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high high this fund scored high because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category over a year period how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high average this funds expenses are rated as average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal

judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk
