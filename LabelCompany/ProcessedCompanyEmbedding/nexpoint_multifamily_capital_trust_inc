inc a new real estate investment trust its strategy is pursuing investments in class a and b multifamily properties with a valueadd component where they can invest capital to provide “lifestyle” amenities to “workforce” housing mhn chatted with matt mcgraner executive vice president and chief investment officer at nexpoint and managing director of real estate at highland capital management to learn the story of the growing company mhn how did the company get started mcgraner we got started in  as a reit underneath a closedend fund james dondero our president and founder was searching for yield uncorrelated to the public debt and equity markets and he was managing a fund called nexpoint credit strategies fund nhf and didn’t like anything he was seeing in the marketplace so he looked to real estate and really liked owning real estate directly but couldn’t do it in the closedend fund so to our knowledge we were the first people to ever come up with the idea of forming a private reit under the closedend fund we did that in early  we bought our first multifamily deal in october  and saw a lot of opportunity in the marketplace liked the story and the strategy of the middleincome workforce housing class b multifamily strategy we were growing that rapidly – we did about  transactions over the course of  and  it got to the point where it was becoming such a large part of the parent fund that we had to do something with it we looked for a number of ways to get value for the shareholders one of which was taking it public and listing the shares on the new york stock exchange that was the original route we chose to do to get value it was a fairly unique structure and it had never been done before mhn why did you choose to get involved with workforce housing specifically mcgraner we like it for a number of reasons – we like the class b workforce housing strategy because it’s recessionproof we really only need  in rent per unit to make a  percent yield in our markets which is really attractive you contrast that to a class a building in our market that earns  per unit to make a four percent yield particularly where the markets are today cap rates being at historic lows for multifamily we think when interest rates do rise cap rates will hurt the class a building more than they’ll hurt the class b building given that there’s such a delta between the  in rent we need to achieve our yields versus the nicer luxury properties andor singlefamily housing our typical tenant is renter by necessity and has been a renter all their life so what we try to do is buy assets at great spaces significant discount to replacement cost and go in and invest anywhere from  per unit to improve the living spaces for the middle income renters for example take a two to threestory garden apartment complex that hasn’t been touched in the last decade or two we’ll come in and add  amenities you might see at a luxury building and put them in place at a  construction building we’ll add resortstyle pools cabanas outdoor furniture an outdoor kitchen outdoor grills update the leasing centers from the tired old furniture and tile flooring to more of a starbucksstyle café and put a few apple computers in there and make it more of an interactive space on the interiors we’ll spend anywhere from  per unit removing carpet and installing hardwood floors removing old blinds and put in twoinch blinds put in california closets upgrading the appliance packages from a white to a black or stainless and removing vinyl countertops and installing granite once we’re done with the improvements we typically see a rental increase of  or  percent more so it’s a good business on the one hand we’re making great returns and on the other hand we’re providing an upgraded space for the tenants left office before right office after mhn since  what has been your biggest struggle mcgraner in early  it was trying to be competitive in the marketplace and buy assets that made sense for our underwriting the way we got around that was we started buying portfolios at wholesale discounts and we teamed up with our property manageroperating partner out of des moines iowa bh management services they’re one of the largest privately owned operators of gardenstyle multifamily middleincome apartments that we like to purchase and we are their largest client to date so they were a great asset in helping us overcome winning deals fast forward to today even though we’re a billion dollars in assets we’re still very small when it comes to publicly traded reit so we didn’t do a traditional style ipo where you had bankers lead in underwriting and have research coverage day one so we’re trying to overcome the fact that we’re small and no one really knows who we are that being said we’ve reached out to a number of investors and done hundreds of calls hundreds of meetings with investors and tried to tell a story everyone that listens to this story is interested we’re doing the same thing the larger private equity firms are doing in the private markets we’re just taking it to the public markets and we’re really the only pure play valueadd operator that’s traded in the public markets in the us so getting the story out has been hard to do without having an investment bank research analyst in our corner we are optimistic that we’ll get research coverage in the next month or two so that’ll help getting our name out there and making sure people know who we are has been the biggest challenge and the only thing we can do is continue executing on the strategy and driving performance and at some point hopefully people take notice mhn what’s in the pipeline for nexpoint mcgraner we’re excited to be fully public for a year and have a track record of four full consecutive quarters of earnings and leases that’ll be in march we’ll look forward to that at the same time we become shelf eligible which means we can have a registration statement that’s filed on the shelf with the sec so that we can raise capital in a pretty quick manner you have to be a year public to do that so that’s a big milestone it helps a company like ours grow we’ve looked at a few deals and we just purchased a couple in phoenix last week that we’re really excited about and that’s a new market for us we’re looking forward to seeing a full turn of the fruits of our labor and the cap x both in terms of across the portfolio the numbers and the results of having  upgraded deals with brand new leasing centers pools and turned units that’ll be cool once we get the full portfolio running and seeing how that fresh product out there is received by people of all ages especially the millennial age group left pool before right pool after mhn where do you see the future of workforce housing going based on your experience so far mcgraner i think the workforce class b strategy has become more in vogue we’re seeing a lot of new entrants into the market i’m still optimistic that there’s room to grow rents and provide these affordable spaces without pricing ourselves out of the market and having our tenants move on to something that might be a newer asset like  or  build that’ll always be on our minds and challenging but as long as fannie and freddie are in the market which we don’t see that gse disappearing anytime soon and as long as you can still buy apartments that have been wellmaintained and occupied for  plus years at decent yields at  to  percent yields i think it’s still going to be a very liquid highly transactional very exciting space to be you couple that with technology and the building products of today that are being implemented into these older properties you’re taking the obsolescence out of these deals and taking a product that’s pretty sleepy and we all think of as maybe our first apartment or something we might not otherwise want to live in and you’re walking into a unit of a  construction deal and having a very modern white cabinetry with brush nickel finishes stainless steel granite countertops and hardwood floors i think that as long as people continue to put money in the deals and upgrade the spaces you’re changing neighborhoods you’re pouring capital into pockets of cities that might otherwise not have seen it so it’s really changing and upgrading the face of the neighborhood too mhn what else should our readers know mcgraner we’re new but we’re not new to investing highland’s been around since  we’re a solid pedigree in investing especially in conjunction with our partner bh we have  billion assets across the firm so we have the capabilities to grow the company and perform we’re really the only workforce housing pure play multifamily reit in the space most other multifamily reits are focusing on the same thing – upgrading their portfolios buying newer deals buying lower yielding assets on the coastal markets – so we’ve always been contrarian in zigging while others are zagging if you want a percent yield and you want a class a luxury multifamily reit on the coast there’s  or  to choose from but if you want something different a little higher yield with a recessionproof strategy i think it’s important to take a look at our company we own  percent of the stock of the company and i know we’re small but i’m still not sure any other reit owns as much of their company as we do so it’s aligning ourselves with our shareholders it’s a big positive and we’re continuously supporting the stock and the story and we’ll continue to do so because we believe in it related posts on the market
