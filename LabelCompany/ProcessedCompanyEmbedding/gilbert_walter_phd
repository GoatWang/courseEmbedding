cambridge where he earned a phd in physics supervised by the nobel laureate abdus salam in  career and researchedit gilbert returned to harvard in  and was appointed assistant professor of physics in  gilberts wife celia had begun working for james watson and this led to gilbert becoming interested in problems in molecular biology watson and gilbert would run their laboratory jointly through most of the s until watson left for cold spring harbor laboratory in  he was promoted to associate professor of biophysics and promoted again in  to professor of biochemistry he is a cofounder of the biotech startup companies biogen and myriad genetics and was the first chairman on their respective boards of directors gilbert left his position at harvard to run biogen as ceo but was later asked to resign by the companys board of directors he is also a member of the board of scientific governors at the scripps research institute gilbert has served as the chairman of the harvard society of fellows in  gilbert cofounded paratek pharmaceuticals inc along with dr stuart b levy gilbert served as chairman until  gilbert was an early proponent of sequencing the human genome at a march  meeting in santa fe new mexico he proclaimed the total human sequence is the grail of human genetics in  he proposed starting a company called genome corporation to sequence the genome and sell access to the information in an opinion piece in nature in  he envisioned completion of the human genome sequence transforming biology into a field in which computer databases would be as essential as laboratory reagents gilbert returned to harvard in  gilbert was an outspoken critic of david baltimore in the handling of the scientific fraud accusations against thereza imanishikari gilbert also joined the early controversy over the cause of aids though he later stated he was satisfied with the evidence that disease is caused by hivcitation needed in  gilberts phd student in physics gerald guralnik extended gilberts work on massless particles guralniks work on is widely recognized as an important thread in the discovery of the higgs boson with his phd student benno müllerhill gilbert was the first to purify the lac repressor just beating out mark ptashne for purifying the first gene regulatory protein together with allan maxam gilbert developed a new dna sequencing method using chemical methods developed by andrei mirzabekov his approach to the first synthesis of insulin via recombinant dna lost out to genentechs approach which used genes built up from the nucleotides rather than from natural sources gilberts effort was hampered by a temporary moratorium on recombinant dna work in cambridge massachusetts forcing his group to move their work to an english biological weapons site gilbert first proposed the existence of introns and exons and explained the evolution of introns in a seminal  news and views paper published in nature in  gilbert proposed the rna world

walter gilbert was born in boston massachusetts on march st  to richard gilbert a harvard university economist and emma cohen a child psychologist in  his family moved to washington dc where he attended public schools and later the sidwell friends school gilbert developed an early interest in science he ground mirrors for his own telescope joined scientific clubs and in  was awarded a westinghouse science scholarship by the science clubs of america talent search in addition to his scientific pursuits gilbert wrote poetry prose and plays and would go on to study philosophy and chinese while an undergraduate in  he graduated from sidwell friends school and pursued his scientific interests at harvard university studying chemistry and physics he was awarded numerous scholarships was elected to the harvard chapter of the society of sigma xi and graduated with a degree in physics in  he then went on to attend cambridge university trinity college in england aided by a national science foundation fellowship at cambridge his thesis advisor was future nobel laureate abdus salam and in  he graduated with a phd in mathematics after graduation he returned to the united states and married celia stone a poet he met while attending sidwell friends school in  gilbert joined the faculty at harvard as a lecturer in physics and in  he was appointed assistant professor of physics in the early s he became interested in messenger rna and worked with james d watson on experiments to isolate the nucleic acid from this point on gilbert’s scientific career would be primarily focused on molecular biology his first paper on messenger rna appeared in nature in  while his last paper on physics would be published in  in  he was appointed associate professor of biophysics and in  he was promoted to professor of biophysics beginning in the mids he began investigating why different cells produce different proteins even though they have identical dna and with benno müllerhill he isolated the lac repressor gene in escherichia coli which prevented the production of certain enzymes except when lactose is present in the cell this confirmed an earlier theory proposed by jacques monod and françois jacob that repressor genes regulate the process of protein synthesis in the cell he then went on to develop a pioneering method for determining the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid frederick sanger independently developed the same method for this work he was awarded the  louisa gross horwitz prize from columbia university with sanger the  albert lasker basic medical research award with sanger and roger wolcott sperry and finally the  nobel prize in chemistry with sanger and paul berg in  he cofounded with other prominent biologists and businessmen biogen one of the earliest biotechnology companies he left harvard to run the company in  in  he resigned as chairman and ceo of biogen and returned to harvard to conduct research in  he was appointed carl m loeb university professor at the university in  he founded the biotechnology company myriad genetics and would go to serve on the advisory board of numerous other biotech firms he is married to celia stone and has two children scope and content the walter gilbert collection at cshl library and archives is composed of material accrued by gilbert as a student sidwell friends school harvard university
