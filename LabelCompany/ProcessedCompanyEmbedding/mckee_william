william mckee claims generic baldness drug turned her into a woman by hilary hanson   a year old former software engineer says that taking medication for baldness transformed him from a man into a woman mandi mckee formerly known as william mckee began taking a generic version of propecia finesteride in october  to combat malepattern baldness the new york post reports at that time mckee was a married man and was energetic focused sharp and athletic according to her blog mckee took the medication for nine months during which time she says she developed an array of side effects she says her mental alertness severely decreased and she lost work as a result even more alarming however were the physical changes on her website mckee writes that her rockhard chest softened and began to turn into breasts her shoulders were literally falling into a more feminine position and her hips were loosening and becoming wider as on a womans body whats more the pill barely did anything to treat mckees baldness according to the daily mail photos story continues below photos of mandi mckee photos of mandi mckee photos of mandi mckee  of  mandi mckee mandi mckee formerly known as william mckee says that taking a generic version of the baldness medication propecia brought about dramatic physical and mental changes prior to taking the drug mckee identified as a man but she is now living as a transgender woman share this slide facebook the combination of mckees brain fog and physical transformation led to severe depression mckee told the post it felt like the me that ive always known was not there anymore she said unable to concentrate on work mckee a tampa fla resident began losing clients and found herself propelled into debt though transgenderism is not related to sexual identity she also found herself becoming attracted to men instead of women she ultimately separated from her wife of  years in may  in december  mckee began seeing a counselor for transgender therapy and writes that she is now early on my path of transitioning to live fulltime as a woman mckee does not see her transformation as a choice however but as something forced upon her by the medication the old me was killed she writes by the drug company merck mckee is not alone in her experiences with the drug a study published earlier this month in the journal of sexual medicine found that some men taking propecia experience sexual side effects that can last years after the individual has stopped taking the drug men in  states have filed lawsuits against merck on the grounds that propecia affected their sexuality however the courts do not permit lawsuits from those who took the generic version and so mckee is unable to take legal action according to msn nonetheless mckee has stated that she is planning to sue merck for  billion hat tip farkcom suggest a correction hilary hanson editor the huffington post more william mc kee propecia propecia side effects baldness drug turns man
