exec now driving microsofts  billion ad budget new cmo will try to carry out one microsoft idea by seth fineberg tim peterson published on march   most popular microsofts newly appointed chief marketer is a familiar face for better or worse a month into his tenure microsoft ceo satya nadella has tapped chris capossela for a second spin as cmo a year microsoft veteran who spent a couple years as bill gates speech assistant mr capossela held the position from april  to july  now hes back however in an interview he said the title may be the same but the job is a lot different i was running what was known as a central marketing group which had functional services that could be used by the eight business groups we had but we didnt have specific product marketing teams now its all in one place mr capossela said of course the same could have been said the last time microsoft overhauled its marketing organization  eight months ago only this time mr capossela has control over budgets when mr nadellas predecessor steve ballmer reorganized the companys businesses and leadership last summer his aim was to coalesce a company known for its infighting into one microsoft interestingly that realignment shifted mr capossela out of the marketing department but rather than look outside the company for a bigname marketer to underscore the fresh start  say the wellrespected wendy clark of cocacola or beth comstock of ge  microsoft replaced mr capossela with an insider tami reller former cfo of an accounting software firm that microsoft acquired in  she had served as cfo and cmo of windows before being named executive vp of marketing last july now ms reller is out the door and mr nadella handed the reins back to mr capossela as a marketer were in so many businesses we often have to see ourselves as a leader and challenger described by an excolleague as a product person at heart mr caposselas most recent role in the consumer channels group was considered more in his wheelhouse than marketing was as corporate vp of microsofts consumer channels group mr capossela worked with retailers and telecom companies to juice sales of microsofts consumerfocused products like the xbox gaming console surface tablet and windows smartphones prior to that mr capossela had some success as a vp in the microsoft office division marketing office office  sharepoint exchange lync offerings and even oversaw the launch of office  and  while his consumermarketing background is thin that stint may prove useful as mr capossela looks to navigate microsofts productmarketing needs the fact is we are a clear market leader in some businesses and when you are you drive a campaign in a certain way but some ways were challengers as with search phone and in the tablet market said mr capossela as a marketer were in so many businesses we often have to see ourselves as a leader and challenger former microsoft marketing executives characterized mr caposselas marketing strategy as productdriven and label him an operations guy he is someone who makes sure the trains run on time but isnt interested in uprooting the tracks they said one former microsoft marketing executive said that mr capossela delegated everything and did not micromanage though he would ask to be kept apprised of progress mr caposselas relatively passive style contrasts with his predecessor mich mathews who stepped down as cmo in  over two decades at microsoft ms mathews burnished her reputation among employees as a singular marketing powerhouse she guided the brand through its antitrust investigation and was willing to go toetotoe with bill gates over perceptions of the company said former employees even after mr capossela took over microsoft marketers would call ms mathews on the sly for counsel said a former microsoft marketing employee wither scroogled then came mark penn mr ballmer hired hillary clintons political strategist in july  mr penn wasted little time before infusing fresh blood into microsofts messaging and drawing some from its rivals the mastermind behind microsofts googletakedown campaign scroogled his dcstyle mudslinging has met with mixed reviews among microsoft employees mr capossela is said to have disliked the direction mr penn took microsofts marketing but he declined to discuss the scroogled campaign in an interview with ad age but thats history coinciding with mr caposselas reappointment mr penn has been named chief strategy officer and has ceded control of microsofts  billion ad budget to mr capossela who now reports directly to mr nadella that appears to be a welcome change microsoft employees are said to view mr capossela as a great people manager good communicator and not derisive like mark penn according to an excolleague one former microsoft marketing executive said mr penns contract is set to expire in june which if true may have spurred the most recent shakeup mr capossela will have an early chance to brand microsofts marketing as his own in january microsoft began an extensive agency review in which mr penn was said to be a top decisionmaker will mr capossela like mr nadella commence his tenure with an incremental twist on his predecessors strategy or would he do something as radical as consolidate its agencies into a single dedicated shop for this new one microsoft in this article btobcmo

peterson published on march   most popular microsofts newly appointed chief marketer is a familiar face for better or worse a month into his tenure microsoft ceo satya nadella has tapped chris capossela for a second spin as cmo a year microsoft veteran who spent a couple years as bill gates speech assistant mr capossela held the position from april  to july  now hes back however in an interview he said the title may be the same but the job is a lot different i was running what was known as a central marketing group which had functional services that could be used by the eight business groups we had but we didnt have specific product marketing teams now its all in one place mr capossela said of course the same could have been said the last time microsoft overhauled its marketing organization  eight months ago only this time mr capossela has control over budgets when mr nadellas predecessor steve ballmer reorganized the companys businesses and leadership last summer his aim was to coalesce a company known for its infighting into one microsoft interestingly that realignment shifted mr capossela out of the marketing department but rather than look outside the company for a bigname marketer to underscore the fresh start  say the wellrespected wendy clark of cocacola or beth comstock of ge  microsoft replaced mr capossela with an insider tami reller former cfo of an accounting software firm that microsoft acquired in  she had served as cfo and cmo of windows before being named executive vp of marketing last july now ms reller is out the door and mr nadella handed the reins back to mr capossela as a marketer were in so many businesses we often have to see ourselves as a leader and challenger described by an excolleague as a product person at heart mr caposselas most recent role in the consumer channels group was considered more in his wheelhouse than marketing was as corporate vp of microsofts consumer channels group mr capossela worked with retailers and telecom companies to juice sales of microsofts consumerfocused products like the xbox gaming console surface tablet and windows smartphones prior to that mr capossela had some success as a vp in the microsoft office division marketing office office  sharepoint exchange lync offerings and even oversaw the launch of office  and  while his consumermarketing background is thin that stint may prove useful as mr capossela looks to navigate microsofts productmarketing needs the fact is we are a clear market leader in some businesses and when you are you drive a campaign in a certain way but some ways were challengers as with search phone and in the tablet market said mr capossela as a marketer were in so many businesses we often have to see ourselves as a leader and challenger former microsoft marketing executives characterized mr caposselas marketing strategy as productdriven and label him an operations guy he is someone who makes sure the trains run on time but isnt interested in uprooting the tracks they said one former microsoft marketing executive said that mr capossela delegated everything and did not micromanage though he would ask to be kept apprised of progress mr caposselas relatively passive style contrasts with his predecessor mich mathews who stepped down as cmo in  over two decades at microsoft ms mathews burnished her reputation among employees as a singular marketing powerhouse she guided the brand through its antitrust investigation and was willing to go toetotoe with bill gates over perceptions of the company said former employees even after mr capossela took over microsoft marketers would call ms mathews on the sly for counsel said a former microsoft marketing employee wither scroogled then came mark penn mr ballmer hired hillary clintons political strategist in july  mr penn wasted little time before infusing fresh blood into microsofts messaging and drawing some from its rivals the mastermind behind microsofts googletakedown campaign scroogled his dcstyle mudslinging has met with mixed reviews among microsoft employees mr capossela is said to have disliked the direction mr penn took microsofts marketing but he declined to discuss the scroogled campaign in an interview with ad age but thats history coinciding with mr caposselas reappointment mr penn has been named chief strategy officer and has ceded control of microsofts  billion ad budget to mr capossela who now reports directly to mr nadella that appears to be a welcome change microsoft employees are said to view mr capossela as a great people manager good communicator and not derisive like mark penn according to an excolleague one former microsoft marketing executive said mr penns contract is set to expire in june which if true may have spurred the most recent shakeup mr capossela will have an early chance to brand microsofts marketing as his own in january microsoft began an extensive agency review in which mr penn was said to be a top decisionmaker will mr capossela like mr nadella commence his tenure with an incremental twist on his predecessors strategy or would he do something as radical as consolidate its agencies into a single dedicated shop for this new one microsoft in this article btobcmo strategydigitaltechnology become a member register now renew membership benefits datacenter site by area  chris cerolli
