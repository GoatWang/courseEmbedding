cliffs natural resources inc homehomeaccueil    about us    commercial  products products customized to steelmakers specifications as a differentiated mining company cliffs is uniquely positioned to satisfy the requirements of our north american steelmaking customers our highgrade premium pellets are customized for and fed directly to our customers’ blast furnaces and are produced under perhaps the most stringent environmental regulatory framework in the world while other mining companies continue to suffer the consequences of an oversupplied seaborne iron ore market cliffs is focused on its core business in the united states thanks to our longterm partnerships with north american steelmakers we operate under stable contracts we serve growing endmarkets for steel such as automotive construction white goods and manufacturing iron ore pellets iron ore lump and fines drgrade pellets and hbi us iron ore operations blast furnace pellets we produce various grades of iron ore pellets including standard and fluxed for use in our customers’ blast furnaces as part of the steelmaking process the variation in grades results from the specific chemical and metallurgical properties of the ores at each mine and whether or not fluxstone is added in the process in many cases our iron ore pellets can be used interchangeably industry demand for the various grades of iron ore pellets depends on each customer’s preferences and changes from time to time in the event that a given mine is operating at full capacity the terms of most of our pellet supply agreements allow some flexibility in providing our customers iron ore pellets from different mines if feasible standard pellets require less processing are generally the least costly pellets to produce and are called “standard” because no ground fluxstone such as limestone or dolomite is added to the iron ore concentrate before turning the concentrate into pellets in the case of fluxed pellets fluxstone is added to the concentrate which produces pellets that can perform at higher productivity levels in the customer’s specific blast furnace and will minimize the amount of fluxstone the customer may be required to add to the blast furnace product quality while most iron ore producers mine market and sell a commoditized product that is effectively fungible across most blast furnaces our production of custommade pellets is the true differentiating factor when comparing cliffs to its peers in the iron ore space during the ’s cliffs pioneered a process that beneficiated the lowergrade ore into high quality custom made pellets since that time cliffs has remained on the cutting edge of this technology while iron ore pellets are made in other parts of the world it can be said that competitive pellet producers are still “catching up” to the improvements cliffs continues to make in its unrivaled product quality mainly our iron ore pellets perform superior to other products in the market due to the productivity it helps to drive in the customer’s blast furnace as cliffs pellets are homogenous in size they rank at the top versus other comparable pellets with regard to consistency in size this consistency allows air to flow through the furnace efficiently and thus drive the most optimal yield possible the other superior quality of the cliffs product is that it minimizes pollution in the steelmaking process compared to a fines or sinter product iron ore pellets have the advantageous homogenous qualities as well as much higher iron content as a result emissions from the blast furnaces are diminished we believe that as pollution becomes more of an issue in china more iron ore producers will continue to attempt to emulate the quality of cliffs pellets while the market begins to shift in that direction asia pacific iron ore operations cliffs’ koolyanobbing operations serve the asian iron ore markets with directshipped fines and lump ore the lump products are fed directly to blast furnaces while the fines products are used as sinter feed the variation in the two export product grades reflects the inherent chemical and physical characteristics of the ore bodies mined as well as the supply requirements of our customers banded iron formations host the mineralization which is predominately hematite and goethite each deposit is characterized with different chemical and physical attributes and in order to achieve customer product quality ore in varying quantities from each deposit must be blended together crushing and blending are undertaken at koolyanobbing where the crushing and screening plant is located once the blended ore has been crushed and screened into a direct lump and fines shipping product it is transported by rail approximately  miles south to the port of esperance via kalgoorlie for shipment to our customers in asia drgrade pellets direct reduced iron dri is a high quality metallic product  percent pure iron produced by the direct reduction of iron oxide at a temperature below the fusion point of iron it is primarily used is in electric arc furnaces eaf but can also be used by blast furnaces and other iron and steelmaking applications both iron oxide pellets and lump ores can be used in the production of dri dri is a valuable supplement to scrap in the eaf process helping dilute the impurities and residual metals that come along with the scrap charge using its technical expertise to increase product offerings cliffs developed a new product line drgrade pellets for feedstock in dri production we reached a significant milestone with very positive results from the successful operational trial of our drgrade pellets fullscale production testing has been successful with third parties consuming pellets we are wellpositioned to produce drgrade pellets that achieve dritargeted specifications and to feed our toledo hbi plant hotbriquetted iron hbi the hotbriquetted iron hbi that will be produced by cliffs from our plant in toledo ohio is a compacted form of dri designed for ease of shipping handling and feeding into an electric arc furnace hbi is transported and fed similarly to scrap and pig iron and does not require the same special handling as cold dri hbi can also be consumed into blast furnaces helping to boost their productivity investor inquiries paul finan   paulfinancliffsnrcom sales north american sales

new investment said the governor in a news releaselourenco goncalves chairman president and chief executive officer of cliffs natural resources inc with gov john r kasich clevelandbased cliffs is building a hot briquetted iron production plant in toledo this is great news for toledo and were pleased that cliffs chose ohio for their new investment said the governor in a news releasecliffs natural resources inc by olivera perkins the plain dealer operkinsplaindcom cleveland ohio  clevelandbased cliffs natural resources inc will build the midwests firstever plant producing hot briquetted iron which is used in steelmaking the company announced thursday the  million project which received  million in grants and other financial incentives is expected to break ground in early  on the ironville site in east toledo a former brownfield the plant is anticipated to begin production in mid the company said the project is scheduled to create  construction jobs and  permanent jobs hourly jobs at the plant will pay about  said lourenco goncalves chairman president and chief executive officer of the yearold mining and natural resources company the plant will be cliffs first facility in ohio he said toledo was uniquely situated for the project we got a site in the port of toledo that is extremely convenient he said it is close to the clients and has easy access logistically it is an extremely positive site for us receiving iron pellets from minnesota to produce the hbi or hot briquetted iron us rep marcy kaptur democrat of toledo expressed similar sentiments the confluence of a jobready site and toledos excellent distribution and transportation network helped to put the toledo port site over the top attracting major investment and the jobs that will come with it she said in a news release goncalves said a lot of the plants back office operations will be done in cleveland creating additional jobs we dont have a number to give you but that is a very fair conclusion that there will be more jobs in cleveland he said goncalves said the plant would meet a strong demand in the midwest and the great lakes region for hbi which is used in an electric arc furnace as part of the steelmaking process he said partly because hbi isnt produced in the region steelmakers primarily rely on scrap metal with some pig iron mixed in the pig iron comes from places such as russia and venezuela cliffs is relying on local production having an advantage in serving a customer base concentrated in ohio and neighboring states it will be the first hbi facility in the midwest and the first one in the great lakes goncalves said we think of this as a great market opportunity that has been present for a long long time and now we can do it because in order to produce hot briquetted iron you need two things iron ore which we have plenty of and affordable natural gas which is something relatively new in the midwest since the shale boom made natural gas affordable in the great lakes he said hbi allows for the production of a higher grade of steel scrap carries trace elements that are completely unacceptable for the highend applications goncalves said we will produce a customized product  not a one size fits all  for each one of our clients he said follow opinfo view comments cliffs natural resources inc  investors  financial information  financial highlights nyse
