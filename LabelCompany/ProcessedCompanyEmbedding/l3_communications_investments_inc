business description history background information on l communications holdings inc  rd avenue th floornew york new york usa company perspectives l communications goal is to be the leading mezzanine supplier to prime contractors the company will do so by investing in its core technologies and acquiring companies that enhance or complement its current technologies history of l communications holdings inc l communications holdings inc through its l communications corp subsidiary operates companies that produce secure communication systems training systems microwave components avionics and ocean systems telemetry instrumentation and space and wireless products its customers are mostly defense and intelligence agencies as well as aircraft manufacturers and defense contractors l also supplies the commercial telecommunications industry l maintained a  percent defense  percent commercial product mix like its predecessor loral corporation l communications has undergone phenomenal growth orchestrated by former loral executives frank lanza and robert lapenta origins loral corporation was an assemblage of defense units acquired from fairchild ford ibm unisys and others between the mids and mids by wall street investor bernard l schwartz in april  lockheed martin acquired most of these businesses for  billion two loral executives coo frank lanza and comptroller robert lapenta joined lockheed martin as executive vicepresident and vicepresident respectively lorals space businesses formed a separate firm loral space  communications ltd run by schwartz lockheed martin which had been formed in  by the merger of lockheed corp and martin marietta corp began to divest noncore units after the massive loral acquisition it sold its stake in the martin marietta construction materials business in  lanza described by the washington post as a taciturn new yorker admired for his creativity and engineering genius reportedly felt stifled by the bureaucratic corporate atmosphere at lockheed martin an electrical engineer by training lanza had joined loral in  and was named president and chief operating officer in  along the way he was instrumental in growing the company from modest origins to a  billion giant in  as he approached traditional retirement age lanza convinced his new employer lockheed chairman norman r augustine to spin off ten former loral companies to form l communications it took me less than half an hour to get a yes lanza later told business week lanza finally got a chance to be ceo and numbers whiz lapenta was named president and chief financial officer the ten businesses spun off had annual revenues of  million and  employees the largest of these were wideband systems in salt lake city and communications systems in camden new jersey also included were two northern california companies randtron and nardamicrowave which manufactured microwave antennas for military applications these two together had fewer than  employees lockheed martin received  million for selling  percent of its ownership in the ten companies after the sale a limited partnership led by lehman brothers owned half of l lockheed martin retained a  percent interest and a management group accounted for another  percent lockheed agreed to invest  million in l lehman invested  million and the management group provided  million another  million was financed with bank debt and highyield bonds the name of the new company came from lanza lapenta and either lockheed or lehman brothers according to varying reports in july  l found itself aggressively bidding against its partowner lockheed martin for control of a texas instruments chipmaking business that raytheon was being forced to unload as part of a justice department settlement the desired unit produced gallium arsenide highpower amplifier monolithic microwave integrated circuits or mmics a proprietary product l was eager to expand its microwave components business which accounted for a quarter of sales and also sought out joint ventures with swedens ericsson microwave systems ab and frances thomsoncsf to bring new technologies into the us military market l had a welldeveloped commercial business as well its advanced recorders plant in sarasota florida which made black boxes for aircraft landed a contract to supply american airlines with solidstate flight data recorders for both its existing fleet and planes on order with boeing the deal had a potential value of  million  ipo ls first year revenues were  million plans for a  million initial public offering ipo were announced in february  the ipo at  a share came on may  in the next six months the companys share price would rise to  a share helped by strong earnings lanzas acquisition strategy was to buy technology leaders either struggling independent companies or black sheep divisions of major defense contractors observed business week lanza focused on small to medium sized companies to avoid costly takeover battles with aerospace giants essco a leading producer of groundbased radomes protective shields for antennas and precision millimeter wave antenna systems acquired in september  was a representative purchase by november  l had already acquired seven companies including spd technologies which supplied power equipment to the us navy and storm control systems inc which made satellite control software the company spent heavily to  million a yearon rd to improve its existing products and to make them cheaper to produce in december  l agreed to acquire microdyne corp based in alexandria virginia for  million microdyne made radio receivers used in tracking satellites and aircraft l companies already made the data hardware that used these antennas l posted aftertax profits of  million on revenues of  billion in  an additional stock offering was announced in early  intending to raise  million to pay down debt and fund further acquisitions in december  l agreed to pay  million for two businesses honeywell international inc was required to sell after its merger with allied signal inc one of these produced gyroscopes controlled momentum devices and sensors for weapons systems and satellites the other made an inertial sensor product based on micromachined electromechanical systems mems technology used in advanced guidance systems l also bought honeywells trafficalert collision avoidance system tcas business for  million l incorporated the tcas unit into a joint venture with sextant a thomsoncsf affiliate tcas had recently been required on all european cargo aircraft and passenger planes with more than  seats another important acquisition in  was that of satellite transmission systems this brought l into a  million a year business of fixed wireless communications systems typically installed in developing countries that lacked traditional land lines meanwhile new federal aviation administration requirements were boosting ls cockpit voice recorder business in january  l agreed to buy raytheon companys flight simulation and training business for  million link simulation and training based in arlington virginia became ls largest division with  million a year in revenues link had pioneered the earliest mechanical flight simulators in the first decades of aviation but had languished in later years as it was shuffled among a succession of corporate foster parents lanza declared l was committed to help link thrive in the growing training market in march  however l sued raytheon to cancel its acquisition agreement alleging that raytheon failed to disclose liabilities in the business bigger game in the new millennium when institutional investor asked lanza ls next move in november  he quipped were gonna go buy lockheed ls impressive growth made this a less than outrageous prospect the companys share price reached  by the end of the year a new stock offering announced in april  was to raise  million in the spring of  lanza announced that he was changing his acquisition strategy to buy larger companies in a bid to become the home depot of the defense industry he aimed for l to have revenues of  or  billion within the next several yearsa stretch for what was then a  billion company but not a laughable one especially given lanzas reputation faster growth was deemed necessary to compete against honeywell international inc which was being acquired by the us general electric co reported the wall street journal at the  paris air show lanza told wwwaviationnow com that l was a catalog company it was more efficient he said to approach the handful of major aerospace companies with a vast array of products than to try to vie for their business as a small  million supplier l also boasted considerable
