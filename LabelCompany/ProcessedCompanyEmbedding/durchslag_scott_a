angies list the new leadfeed service gives service providers leads culled from the large number of nonmembers who visit the angie’s list website the initial rollout covers about  home improvement categories scott durchslag angie’s list president and ceo march   michael chmielecki keywords commercial market  flooring business news  flooring industry associations  flooring installation  flooring market trends  flooring retailer  qa features  residential market reprints no comments angie’s list recently launched leadfeed a new service aimed at converting visitors who do not have an account with the website into new leads for service providers we spoke with scott durchslag angie’s list president and ceo about the new offering first how did leadfeed come about durchslag leadfeed came into being when i first came to angie’s list and looked at our analytics information each year we have more than  million unique visitors but  percent of them are not members so they were coming to the site then leaving and we weren’t doing anything with them the thought behind leadfeed was a very simple one why not ask these nonmembers what it is they were looking for and how urgently they needed it by answering those questions they become a new source of leads for our service providers   can you tell us a little more about what visitors to the site would be filling out durchslag in its essence we ask the person to select what category of work they want to get done we have them tell us a little more about the job and get some indication of its urgency we then pass that information on to our qualified service providers and that person’s mobile phone will be ringing pretty quickly   in a release announcing the new program your company stated that leadfeed will initially be offered in “approximately  categories” is flooring one of those categories durchslag yes it is i’m excited about this category particularly it’s one of those areas where when you have the need you want to make sure the person who is going to come into your home understands the right products and the right look flooring is not a “quick fix” but requires experts who can react quickly so i think the leadfeed program lends itself particularly well to this category if visitors to your site can be routed to providers through this program what is their incentive to become members durchslag there are a lot of benefits to membership members can see all of the reviews posted they’ll be covered by the fair price guarantee and service quality guarantee we also find that once visitors to the site have a positive experience with one of our service providers they usually become members anything else you’d like to add durchslag the leadfeed program is us looking at different ways to make our service available to nonmembers because we get so many of them while also being a big benefit to our service providers service providers will pay per lead along with a platform fee of  per year or  a month for those who want to get that experience at a lower initial cost a background check is also required for more information visit wwwangieslistcom and wwwangieslistbusinesscentercomleadfeed did you
