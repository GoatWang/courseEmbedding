christmas sarah gollner sarahgollnernwicom   sarah gollner dec   portage  a portage man was found dead in his home thursday night after suffering massive blood loss from dog bites to his arms and face by his pit bull according to porter county coroner chuck harrisedward l cahill  was pronounced dead at his home at  tulip ave in portage according the portage police department according to harris cahills girlfriend arrived home around  pm and discovered cahill on the floor unresponsivepolice said cahill was found in the living room of the residence covered in what appeared to be several lacerations to his arms and face police said what appeared to be blood was visible on the floor around cahills body on the carpet walls and furniture two pit bulls were in the home when police arrived harris confirmed cahills dog named fat boy was alone responsible for his death the other pit bull was put away in a bedroomthe dog involved in the attack was taken to the humane society of hobart where he was euthanized friday morningit was the only dog that was able to get to the individual harris said it was very obviousaccording to portage police cahills girlfriend told officers she and cahill owned two pit bulls and they gave them some large bones on christmas eveaccording to police reports the girlfriend told police that fat boy was extremely aggressive and protective of his bone she said he would growl and snap at anyone who tried to take the bonepolice said the girlfriend had told cahill to euthanize fat boy in the past because he was extremely aggressive and unpredictablepolice reports state cahills girlfriend was living at the residence with cahill but was visiting family for christmas since about  pm she reportedly spoke to cahill on the phone around  pm and everything was fine harris said the attack was not witnessed the porter county coroners office took possession of the body but no autopsy is plannedaccording to police reports an animal control officer and a police officer on the scene attempted to remove fat boy with an animal control pole known as a trap line police said fat boy was on top of a bed continuously barking growling standing in an aggressive stance and lunging toward officers and when he edged closer to the side of the bed toward the officers a police officer deployed his taser striking the dog in the right side until he fell on the flooraccording to police reports animal control was not able to get the trap line around the dogs neck prior to the end of the second taser cycle so he allowed the taser to cycle through until they could gain control of the dogonce they managed to place the trap line around the pit bulls neck he was removed from the residence and taken to an animal control van according to police reports police reported that fat boy bit the trap line in such a manner that he caused his mouth to bleed until he was secured in the van  the portage police department is investigating the incidentthis is a very tragic incident portage police department chief troy williams said its not something we see too oftentoni bianchi owner and trainer of positive experience training school said although this dog may have been aggressive she believes the dogs breed is not the reason for this incidentpit bulls get a bad rep she said i think this incident has nothing to do with the dogs breedbianchi has been a certified professional dog trainer since november  and a certified dog behavior consultant since december  she said in her experience pit bulls dont appear more aggressive than any other breed of dogive worked with some pit bulls that are therapy dogs and theyre great she said an aggressive dog can be any breed ive seen just as many good pit bulls as bad pit bulls subscribe

url above and paste awayjudy woverallexpertisefacilityprofessionalismi have only seen him at st josephs medical center where he did my surgery he was very knowledgeable i liked the way he explained my options in detail and let me decide which way i wanted to have my broken leg fixed he didnt rush me and continued to answer my questions fully while i was trying to make up my mind at the hospital one day he saw my leg wasnt elevated or being iced and he made the nurses correct that right awayhe did show his impatient side a couple of times when i asked about my test results before they were ready he is not able to control iti think its very poor form when a doctor wants to charge to fill out forms like cindka mentioned in the first post you know they will have an assistant fill it out the doctor will just sign the damn thing anyway the  star rating for facility was for st josephs hospital in stockton ca where i saw dr cahill after my appointment with him at his office on aprill  ill post morehelpfulshareflagcindkaoveralli would not recommend this orthopedic physician to anyone although he was nice during the initial visit i am not exactly sure what happened that changed his bedside manner for the worse during the last two office visits as soon as he became flustered or agitated with something the patient was telling him he began to come off rude and was disrespectful in his tone of voice and actions during both visitshe has very little patience also it is quite evident that the focus for him is to make money versus comprehensively treat or help his patients in order to fill out a twopage functional capacity questionnaire for a disability claim which had simple checkoff multiplechoice items and was  questions long he required payment of  dollars upfront in order to fill out the document at the end of the day or when he had time absolutely ridiculous because this same form was filled out by a primary care physician who knew his patient just as well in about  minutes at no charge if you are searching for an orthopedic physician to treat your condition instead of look for tests paperwork and physical problems to profit from i highly suggest a different physician with better customer service skills we will not be going back to dr cahill or alpine orthopedic group as the office staff is very unfriendly as well fyi i understand physicians are fed up with people applying for disability due to fake complaints and health problems but it is not fair to put all patients applying for disability into this category there are some people out there who really need the assistance of such programs with my family member being one of those people in need in addition as someone in the healthcare field myself i have learned first and foremost that all patients should be treated with respect and without bias or judgment ultimately the problem may come down to health care reform but that does not excuse this physician’s bedside mannerhelpfulshareflagmap  directionspeople also viewedprimary care e pine st stockton camarshall sharon e harding way ste d stockton capediatric associates of stockton w march ln stockton caanchor
