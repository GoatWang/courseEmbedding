a feeonly financial planner all napfa advisors are feeonly is paid directly by the client on a transparent and prearranged payment plan this can be an hourly or project rate monthly retainer or percentage of the investments managed other financial advisors are paid through other sources including by the companies they recommend for example if the planner sells you a specific investment mutual fund insurance or other products they receive a commission or partial commission directly from the company when working with a napfa registered financial advisor there are no hidden fees commissions thirdparty payments or product sales if you are not sure how your financial advisor gets paid just ask them it is not something that is easy to tell how a planner is paid is quite important because it can affect the advice that they offer to their clients professional financial planners need to make a living like everyone else and they are likely to be most loyal to the person who pays them if that person is you the client then pleasing you will bring them longterm business they will consistently offer you the best financial advice that they have a commissionbased financial

new orleans  retirement financial planner  feeonly financial advisor you are here home  investment managementour expertise is balanced portfolio management our performance track record reflects our four principles for managing our balanced portfolio strategy     our four investment management principles   to achieve all four of our investment management principles at deane retirement strategies we avoid investment extremes we avoid chasing stocks that provide high returns but come with extreme price volatility these type of investments jeopardize principal protection and your sleeping at night we equally avoid investments with extremely low price volatility that inevitably produce extremely low returns these type of investments threaten your receiving sustainable income and also hedging inflation…which could result in a reduced lifestyle in the future   to achieve our portfolio investment management goals we use a balanced portfolio strategy that blends highquality stocks with highquality bonds and cash using multiple asset classes allows us to make appropriate asset allocation shifts to potentially avoid excessive portfolio volatility and to reduce risks we use a balanced portfolio strategy exclusively we do not manage portfolios consisting of only stocks or only bonds   our expertise is balanced style portfolio investment management we are an excellent fit for you if you appreciate the value of working with professionals who blend the longterm growth of quality stocks with the stability of principal and income provided by quality bonds our ultimate investment management goal is that “you sleep at night”     why a balanced portfolio for everyone how can only one investment portfolio style our “balanced style” be appropriate for all of our clients regardless of their age or stage of working life   myth says that younger investors should be very aggressive because they have years to make up their portfolio losses while they will earn more when stocks do well they will also lose more when stocks decline if an investor loses  in a bear market they will have to earn  on the remaining assets to erase the loss provided they haven’t bailed out of their aggressive strategy prior to the market rebounding by comparison if losses can be contained to  only a subsequent  gain is needed to erase the loss uncontrolled aggressive investing potentially becomes the “wrecking ball” of their portfolio’s value   a very aggressive investing strategy is also frequently but disastrously used by near retirees who have failed to save adequate retirement money in an effort to play “catchup” they panic and adopt a gambler’s “all or nothing” philosophy hoping to earn maximum returns quickly this reckless aggressive investing strategy almost always ends with further diminished investment returns   the flip side of the coin is the retiree or near retiree who believes in the myth that older investors should only invest in ultra conservative investments while their goal is to eliminate the possibilities of nearterm losses they negatively subject their portfolio to the longrange debilitating effects of inflation that will reduce their standard of living over time our balanced style portfolio provides capital gains and dividends from quality stocks along with interest payments from bonds these three sources collectively provide you with sustainable retirement income along with portfolio growth to hedge against inflation   our balanced portfolio investment management strategy appeals to investors of all ages who are seeking reliable growth reduced volatility protection of principal sustainable income when ready and peaceful nights’ sleep deane retirement strategies’ investment management principles are reflected in our balanced style’s investment return track record that speaks for itself       we do not use mutual funds – why not deane retirement strategies does not use mutual funds in their clients’ portfolios thus avoiding your being charged with each mutual fund’s annual  –  average internal fund expenses such as trading costs management fees advertising expenses brokeradvisor compensation etc mutual funds’ internal expenses are annually reoccurring and are passed along to you “behind the scenes” this is called their “expense ratio” even noload and institutional funds pass along their fund’s expenses to you so for example if you’re paying another financial advisor  and own a portfolio of mutual funds with an average  expense ratio adding together the two fees your effective total annual portfolio fee is  these fees are over and above any additional cost to purchase or sell a mutual fund please note that while we do not use mutual funds in our portfolios we do use etfs that also have internal fees however etf internal fees are generally substantially less than mutual fund internal fees   additionally we do not use mutual funds in our clients’ portfolios because we are prevented from performing thorough due diligence on funds’ portfolio holdings mutual funds only disclose their investment holdings quarterly rendering them blind investment pools for months at a time this lack of transparency often encourages fund managers to purchase investments in the fund that are inappropriate presumably in an attempt to enhance performance results only to return the portfolio to a more marketable “window dressing” status just prior to disclosing their quarterly holdings lack of holdings’ transparency also exposes your portfolio of funds to the probable but undetectable overlapping of individual securities among the various funds this dilutes portfolio diversification that can lead to unnecessary volatility and underperformance of your portfolio using fund overlap software provides analysis that is only valid four days a year the exact days on which funds’ holdings are reported   we do not use mutual funds in our clients’ portfolios thus avoiding additional client costs over and above our advisory fee avoiding mutual funds in our investment strategy also eliminates the issues of due diligence and duplication that compromise volatility risk and performance       we are feeonly retirement advisors our  sole  basis  of  client compensation as a fee only financial planner is advisory fees our “feeonly” commission free approach to retirement financial planning and
