start comparing multiple quotes as you are shopping around there are certain questions that you should ask yourself the best one to start with is “how much coverage do i need” to give you an idea most people opt for a term policy with about  in coverage why this amount or any amount for that matter the answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones another good question to ask yourself or one of the several qualified agents lifeplanscom can connect you with is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you unlike a term policy which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years a permanent policy does not expire typically whole life the most common type of permanent insurance not only serves to payout your beneficiaries upon your passing but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashedout anytime essentially permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not the catch is that they often have
