people randy phillips president and ceo website sfxiicom livestyle is a los angelesbased live events conglomerate founded by media entrepreneur robert f x sillerman the company was formed in june  as sfx entertainment—the new incarnation of sillermans previous company of the same name which was sold to clear channel communications and later spunoff in  as live nation the company focuses primarily on live events and other properties relating to electronic music and its associated culture its holdings include ownership of various major electronic music promoters and festival brands such as tomorrowland electric zoo and a  stake in rock in rio among others the company also owns beatport an online electronic music store and paylogic a provider of online ticketing services growing primarily through the acquisitions of various electronic dance music properties sfx went public on the nasdaq on october   however in  the company began to experience financial issues in august  the companys stock value fell as low as  cents after a failed bid by sillerman to buy out or sell the company and a breached preferred investment sfx filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection in february  and sillerman stepped down as ceo in december  the company emerged from bankruptcy as a private company renamed livestyle and with former aeg live executive randy phillips as a new ceo and charles ciongoli formerly of the universal music group as executive vp  cfo contents  history  early history      decline bankruptcy  emergence rebranding  assets  festivals and promoters  digital  references  external links historyedit early historyedit sfx entertainment was formed by robert f x sillerman in the s its business model surrounded the acquisition and consolidation of regional concert promoters into a single national entity in  sillerman sold the company to the radio broadcasting company clear channel communications for  billion usd clear channel entertainment was spun off in  to form live nation and merged with ticketmaster in  to form live nation entertainment as of  live nation is the largest concert promoter in the world edit former logo used until  in june  sillerman publicized his intent to focus on the growing electronic dance music market by reviving the sfx brand to form a new conglomerate in the electronic music industry similarly to the past incarnation of sfx the companys business model focuses on the consolidation and acquisition of independent edm promoters along with an additional focus on providing digital platforms for fans to connect sillerman expected to spend close to  billion on acquisitions within the first year of operations alone at the time of the companys launch sfx was in negotiations with around  different promoters for possible acquisitions sfxs first acquisitions included disco donnie estopinals disco productions miami nightclub owners opium group and miami marketing group and the tour life in color then known as dayglow however the opium group deal fell through during the due diligence phase as one of sillermans first deals estopinal assisted him in locating other potential acquisition targets by contrast to the previous sfx sillerman intended the new company to be more focused on building relationships and experiences for fans in response to critics who believed that sfx may commercialize the largely underground electronic music industry sillerman stated that if you buy great and successful businesses you try to empower them to do what they do and in this case what they do is provide great entertainment if you or anyone can ever find an example of someone from sfx telling them how much to charge for a bottle of cristal at liv ill give you my shares of sfx sillerman has emphasized his belief that the live events industry can not be operated in a centralized manner noting that sfx is decentralized with full power invested in the entrepreneurs who have made these businesses in january  sfx named chris stephenson as its chief marketing officer—he had previously been the cmo of interscope records and is the ceo of fellow sillerman venture viggle sfx also announced a joint venture with the dutch promoter idt with an intent to organize north american events—idt previously partnered with live nation to hold the first ever american edition of its sensation tour at barclays

that will own the rock music festival sillerman also disclosed plans to bring the festival to the united states for the first time ever in december  sfx acquired a  stake in paylogic a european online ticketing company paylogics services are prominently used by idt and were to be phased in across sfxs other event brands over time as deals with other providers such as eventbrite and disco donnie expire sillerman singled out paylogic for its ability to handle large surges of ticket sales as had been demonstrated at tomorrowworld the first us event to use the system on january   iheartmedia inc formerly clear channel media and entertainment the company which coincidentally sillerman sold the original sfx to in  announced a marketing partnership with sfx which will see the two firms

significant restructuring and consolidation process that would involve a not insignificant shift in assignments and reduction in workforce all of which will go to improve efficiency and of course to improve our ebitda later in the month sfx acquired a  stake in alda events a dutch promoter who produces the concert tours of armin van buuren and hardwell along with the amsterdam music festival alda

itself phillips also began to describe the company as being oriented towards electronic music in general rather than edm and stated that some of their events such as mysteryland will broaden their
