segments include the probe cards segment and systems segment the company designs manufactures and sells multiple product lines including probe cards analytical probes probe stations integrated measurement systems thermal subsystems reliability test systems and related services its products provide electrical information from a range of semiconductor and electrooptical devices and integrated circuits devices from development to productionprobe cards segment consists of probe card products and analytical probes probe cards are used in the semiconductor manufacturing industry to perform wafer test which is the testing of the semiconductor die or chips while those die are constituted on the semiconductor wafer wafer test enables semiconductor manufacturers to determine whether chips will meet specifications and be saleable before the wafer is diced and the die are singulated and individually packaged analytical probes are used in semiconductor engineering device characterizationprobe products are used to test a range of semiconductor device types including system on a chip products mobile application processors microprocessors microcontrollers graphic processors radio frequency analog mixed signal image sensors electrooptical dynamic random access memory dram nand flash memory and nor flash memory devices in both engineering and production use the analytical probes and probe cards serve as the electrical and mechanical interface between the chips being tested and the test instrument that generates the electrical signal used to evaluate the device performancesystems segment consists of wafer probing thermal and reliability products to enable precision onwafer measurement of integrated circuits systems products are used in the early phases of the development and characterization of semiconductor processes many of the companys systems products are also used in production applications to test semiconductor devices prior to completion of the manufacturing process and include probe stations thermal subsystems and reliability test systemsprobe cards utilize a range of technologies and product architectures including microelectromechanical systems mems technologies probe cards are customized for customers wafer and chip designs by modifying and adapting its standard product architectures to meet an individual customers design layout and electrical test requirements as of december   the company offered over  different analytical probe models for engineering and production testing analytical probes are used for a set of applications including device characterization electrical simulation model development failure analysis and prototype design debugging its customers for analytical probes include universities research institutions semiconductor integrated device manufacturers semiconductor foundries and fabless semiconductor companies probing systems are required in the development of new generations of semiconductor processes and designs the company offers preconfigured and customized measurement systems for production testing power device characterization vacuum probing cryogenic probing highpressure probing and a range of other specific applicationsthermal subsystems produce thermal chucks and other test systems used in probe stations thermal chuck systems enable the testing of devices across a range of temperatures the companys reliability test systems enable customers to develop products that are less susceptible to a range of phenomenon that can degrade semiconductor device performance such as electromigration stress migration time dependent dielectric breakdown stress induced leakage current hot carrier injection and bias temperature instability in addition to routine installation services at the time of sale the company offers services to enable its customers to maintain and utilize its products and to enhance its customer relationships in addition to
