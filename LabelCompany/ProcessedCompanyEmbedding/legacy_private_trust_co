and children from a previous marriage at the same time types of trusts trusts are such flexible tools that naming all of the different variations would be impossible we have outlined some of the more common types below within the limitless scope of trusts there are two main categories of trusts inter vivos trusts living trusts created through a trust deed during the settlors lifetime testamentary trusts a trust that is created through a will or codicil legacy private trust can act in many fiduciary capacities such as trustee cotrustee alternate trustee or agent for a trustee in any of the following situations inter vivos trust living trust these types of trusts are established during someone’s lifetime with instructions given to the trustee on how the assets will be used for the beneficiaries these types of trusts can continue after one passes away but they are exempt from probate taxes because they are not considered part of one’s estate and are completely confidential because they never become part of the public record like wills do when they go through the probate process other benefits of this type of trust are confidentiality of assets and beneficiaries and protection of your estate assets from creditors this can be a concern because creditors can sometimes make claims on the assets in your estate that are not in a trust family and personal trusts these types of trusts can be set up for yourself or your family for income splitting succession planning to provide for someone with poor financial management skills to lower probate fees and for other tax planning purposes joint partner trusts these types of trusts are designed to make sure you your partner and your assets are taken care of should you become incapable they allow you to determine exactly how you and your spouse will be cared for personally and financially and how your assets will be managed and administered when one partner passes away the surviving partner becomes the sole beneficiary of the trust when the surviving partner passes away other named beneficiaries such as children charities and foundations become the beneficiaries alter ego trusts alter ego trusts will provide for you during your lifetime with all the benefits of a personal trust and also allow for you to name secondary beneficiaries of the trust for when you have passed away blind trusts these types of trusts are designed for avoiding conflicts of interest and are perfect for politically exposed people but these trusts could be used in other circumstances in a blind trust the trustee is given full discretion over the assets in the trust the key to this type of trust is that the beneficiary usually also the settlor is unaware of the activity or investments made in the trust and therefore avoids any conflict of interest that could arise these types of trusts can be established for a temporary situation henson trusts a henson trust is a way for you to enhance the financial security of a loved one with a disability  it allows your loved one to receive a gift worth any amount without also facing a reduction in the benefits he or she receives from a provincial or territorial government program financial gifts made outside of a henson trust can result in a claw back of government benefits henson trusts must be fully discretionary trusts settlement trusts sometimes a trustee is required when there is a settlement resulting from a class action or a personal injury lawsuit legacy private trust is fully licensed and regulated to take on such appointments charitable remainder trusts this type of trust is used to support your loved ones for a period of time and to help a charitable organization of your choice the income beneficiaries benefit from the income generated from the assets in the trust and the chosen charitable organization benefits from the remaining capital once the trust has run its course as dictated by you in your trust deed these types of trusts can also be transferred into a foundation retirement compensation arrangements rcas an rca is an unregistered retirement plan used to supplement a pension or rrsp it is funded by one’s employer and is payable on retirement or termination these arrangements spread out taxable income over a longer period of time so you pay income tax at a lower rate and less tax overall these are good for people selling their businesses athletes and other people who will be generating a highincome over a relatively short period of time an rca is taxdeductible for the employer international trusts for those with international legacy building requirements we have correspondent trust companies in a variety of jurisdictions these correspondents can assist in acting as a trustee for a variety of international trusts asset protection trusts asset protection trusts are useful for protecting important assets from litigation bankruptcy or other situations these types of trusts are especially useful to protect corporate assets but the planning must be done properly to ensure that certain legal considerations are taken into account doctors lawyers and other professionals often find them useful condominium insurance trusts condominium corporations are required under the law to hold their insurance in trust legacy private trust is able to hold such insurance in trust cemetery trusts cemeteries by law are required to have care and maintenance  monument trusts they are also required to have trusts in some cases for proceeds from prepaid services legacy private trust is able to manage and administer cemetery trust funds funeral home trusts funeral homes are required by law in some cases to have trusts for prepaid services  legacy private trust is able to manage and administer funeral home trust funds first nations trusts first nations or aboriginal trusts can be used as a way to preserve culture and provide for generations to come by protecting key assets such as settlement income and resource revenue immigration trusts inbound migrant trusts this type of trust is designed for people coming to canada it allows you to bring assets into the country tax free for up to five years through the establishment of an inbound migrant trust outbound nonresident trusts this type of trust is designed for those who hold assets usually real estate in canada but wish to sever residential ties by setting up an outbound nonresident trust you can enjoy the benefits of owning property in canada without paying the taxes associated with being a canadian resident the trust provides you with the flexibility to live in another country without having to pay residential taxes in two jurisdictions testamentary trusts these types of trusts are established in a will and become active when one passes away family and personal trusts these types of trusts can be set up for yourself or your family for income splitting succession planning to provide for someone with poor financial management skills to lower probate taxes and for other tax planning purposes spousal trusts this type of trust is established when a partner passes away and provides for the surviving partner it allows you to determine exactly how you or your partner will be cared for personally and financially and how your assets will be managed and administered when the surviving partner passes away other named beneficiaries become entitled to the benefits of the trust henson trusts a henson trust is a way for you to enhance the financial security of a loved one with a disability  it allows your loved one to receive a gift worth any amount without also facing a reduction in the benefits he or she receives from a provincial or territorial government program financial gifts made outside of a henson trust can result in a claw back of government benefits henson trusts must be fully discretionary trusts charitable remainder trusts this type of trust is used to support your loved ones for a period of time and to help a charitable organization of your choice the income beneficiaries benefit from the income generated from the assets in the trust and the chosen charitable organization benefits from the remaining capital once the trust has run its course as dictated by you in your will or trust deed these types of trusts can also be transferred into a foundation intergenerational trusts the ultimate legacy can be achieved through the establishment of an intergenerational trust these types of trusts can work in a number of ways but the basic tenet is that the trust provides for your growing family for generations to come the most common type is the per stirpes type where each branch of the family receives an equal share how can legacy private trust help at legacy private trust we can act as a trustee cotrustee alternate trustee or as an agent for a trustee in all sorts of situations  often a trustee is unable to perform the duties alone due to illness a period where business or personal responsibilities are heavy travels outside of the province for an extended period of time each year discomfort with the multitude of tax accounting trust administration and asset management tasks that are all part of a trustee’s job the archaic trust accounting rules so unlike business accounting rules whether asked to perform all or most of a trustee’s functions during the whole or part of the period of the trusteeship legacy private trust has the expertise to help a trust is such a flexible legacy building tool  james b love founder downloadable brochures contact us

giving  some prefer to give an outright gift through their wills while others choose to leave a lasting gift in the form of a charitable remainder trust or a private foundation  at legacy private trust we can assist families in many ways to ensure that their gift is lasting expert management will leave the important task of choosing the appropriate recipients of the charitable gifts to the family while leaving the administrative tasks to the professionals at legacy private trust private foundations we offer services to help you complete the gruelling tasks associated with establishing your own private foundation once it is setup you can also appoint us as agent to do the administrative work we are flexible and can provide customized packages with partial or full backroom administrative functions and granting services enabling you and your family to focus on charitable giving the legacy private trust foundation the legacy private trust foundation allows you to achieve your charitable goals without undertaking the startup costs lengthy processes and administrative tasks associated with establishing your own private foundation it can also be useful for those who have determined that the amount they wish to give for charitable purposes does not warrant their own private foundation donoradvised funds with a donoradvised fund you make a single or a series of donations to the legacy private trust foundation to be held by it in a separate fund in your name or a name determined by you  the legacy private trust foundation will provide you with a charitable receipt for each of your donations unlike some other foundations that provide donoradvised funds you then have the option of appointing your own investment professional to manage the assets in either case when you determine the assets can be passed onto charities of your choice it can be in a lump sum a series of donations or over a longer period of time temporary holding place it has become surprisingly commonplace for individuals to encounter a situation where they wish to endow their own private foundation however the timing can often be problematic because the establishment and registration of a private foundation usually takes a year to complete instead we offer the legacy private trust foundation as a temporary holding place  make the proposed contribution to a segregated donoradvised fund within the legacy private trust foundation obtain your tax receipt and your capital gains tax relief earlier and then set about establishing your own private foundation once it is setup up you can easily transfer the assets to your own private foundation and also appoint us as agent to do the administrative work anonymous giving being anonymous in charitable giving can be a matter of preference ranging from full anonymity to a wish that a gift not be advertised in a program or donor listing  however those wishing to remain fully anonymous may be forced to use bank drafts to keep the source of the donation confidential and will therefore not be issued a tax receipt legacy private trust can provide the best of both worlds a donation can be made to the legacy private trust foundation and a charitable receipt issued we will then make the donation on your behalf to your selected charity using the legacy private trust foundation name guaranteeing your privacy and anonymity direct donation for some people it may be convenient to make a direct donation to the legacy private trust foundation to receive their tax receipt instantly and have the foundation’s board of directors decide how the charitable donation will be used at legacy private trust we can assist families in many ways to ensure that their gift is lasting  james b love founder downloadable
