introduced in 9 we have seen endless efforts to make bitcoin mainstreamthese efforts have spanned the launches of the world’s ‘easiest bitcoin web wallet’ ‘easiest bitcoin mobile wallet’ ‘consumer multisig wallets’ and ‘easiest way to buy bitcoins’ the user interface has improved by leaps and bounds we as a community even spent more than a year debating ‘bits’ vs ‘bitcoin’ in an effort to make new bitcoin owners feel wealthier startups who act as custodians of customer’s bitcoins began advertising ‘we are fully insured’ ‘we have proof of reserves’ ‘we have the world’s most secure vault’ and ‘we are fully licensed’ what has been achieved from all this so far one could argue that instead of mainstreaming bitcoin as a payment network we’ve instead encouraged the speculation on bitcoin prices in the past couple of years as volatility became an issue in light of a more than 7 drop in bitcoin prices merchant services offered retailers the ability to accept fiat over the bitcoin network the way it works is that consumer bitcoins would be sent to the merchant processor who then settles with the merchant in the desired fiat currency however the benchmark of success for these services have included statistics such as what  of revenues did merchants keep as bitcoin it begs the question why does that even matter this spring on the consumer side services such as oklink coinbase and circle have solved the volatility issue for consumers by adding or preannouncing fiat wallets linked to the bitcoin network cny oklink and usd coinbase  circle this will let users pay and receive in their local currency while the transfer is made using bitcoins in the background and without any currency exchange risk thus far this is being offered as somewhat of a side feature these services are maintaining the dual mode of allowing users the choice to use bitcoin as the front end bitcoin wallet over the bitcoin network or the back end fiat wallet over the bitcoin network this is akin to a gas station offering you a core service of buying and storing oil while giving you the optional side service of filling your car in no way am i disparaging bitcoin’s long term value and the promise it holds as the best money the world has ever seen a different approach towards mainstreaming adoption of the network won’t weaken this function and could in fact strengthen itwe can divide bitcoin into three common user functions  opting out of the system be your own bankservices range from blockchaininfo mycelium breadwallet ledger nano local bitcoins etc investing in bitcoin the asset services range from bitcoin exchanges such as okcoin to investment vehicles including gbtc nasdaq etn to paper wallets using bitcoin as the open payment network what’s magical about bitcoin is that it can be all three it can even be a hundred more things however if we are to accelerate the process of bitcoin becoming mainstream there is good reason to focus on strengthening the third function  the universal payment network the opting out lifestyle is currently a choice made by a minority of people bitcoin as an investment is largely for those looking to diversity their portfolio or those with excess funds to spare bitcoin as an open payment network however is something that the entire planet can use that is mainstream by definition the store of value  unit of account conundrumas long as the currency used for store of value bitcoin and the currency used for unit of account fiat are different the shortterm balance sheet risk is something the majority will not accept even if bitcoin generally appreciates in value to suggest otherwise one would come across as being out of touch with the lives of most people who live paycheck to paycheck we can’t sit around waiting for a financial crises or a massive inflation in fiat currencies to help bitcoin take off the mark of a superior technology is that it never relies on failures of its predecessor bitcoin is not for the unbanked just as email was not for those without access to the post office email did not wait for postage stamps to become more expensive or mail to be lost to gain adoptionsure bitcoin may eventually have the greatest impact on the lives of the unbanked just as 5 android phones have proven to however it should be noted that smartphones did not start in those marketstaking all this into consideration it is my thought that perhaps companies should consider fiat wallets as the sole option for consumers and merchants or at least the default option imagine making micropayments to anyone using any service instantly for free in your preferred currency without any systemic counterparty risk that’s something we could all use the more the bitcoin payment rails are accepted the more those who live on bitcoin and those who invest in bitcoin the asset will benefit it’s virtuous   year ago bitcoin  comments summer day hongkong at hong kong convention and exhibition centre  year ago  notes hongkong  comments general mccarthur’s credo youth is not a time of life it is a state of mind it is not a matter of rosy cheeks red lips and supple knees it is a matter of the will a quality of the imagination a vigor of the emotions it is the freshness of the deep springs of life youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease this often exists in a man of sixty more than a boy of twenty nobody grows old merely by living a number of years we grow old by deserting our ideals years may wrinkle the skin but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul worry fear selfdoubt bows the heart and turns the spirit back to dust whether sixty or sixteen there is in every human being’s heart the lure of wonder the unfailing childlike curiosity of what’s next and the joy of the game of living in the center of your heart and mine there is a wireless station so long as it receives messages of beauty hope cheer and courage you are young when the aerials are down and your spirit is covered with the snows of cynicism and the ice of pessimism then you have grown old even at twenty but as long as your aerials are up to catch the optimism there is hope you may die young at eightyby samuel ullmangeneral macarthur was inspired by it and carried it wherever he went  year ago  notes inspiration youth wonder curiosity
