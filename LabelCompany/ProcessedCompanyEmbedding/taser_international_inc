formation of a new seattlebased division named after the axon brand which would encompass the companys technology businesses including body cameras digital evidence management and analytics rick smith explained that the branch was inspired by microsofts use of the xbox brand to branch into entertainment businesses stating that axon was the name that we used for selling cameras historically but we realized that brand had the room to grow and encompass all of our connected technologies the taser brand would still be used for the companys weapons products on april   taser international announced that it had been renamed axon to reflect its diversification the company also announced an intent to offer free oneyear trials of its body camera products and evidencecom services to us law enforcement agencies while the taser product line still contributes to a significant portion of axons revenue the companys technologies business has seen major gains as of  axons body cameras have been adopted by police departments in  of the united states major cities and comprise a quarter of the companys business smith noted that the taser name had garnered a negative stigma especially among

taser international inc the bear case from a bull the smart weapons and body camera company has a bright future but it could fall apart if a few big risks go wrong travis hoium tmfflushdraw apr   at am in any investment its important to understand both the bull and bear argument with taser international inc nasdaqaaxn ive been firmly on the bull bandwagon for a while now but theres a case to be made by investors who are more bearish on the companys future here are the best arguments against buying taser internationals stock today  body camera competition is more formidable than it appears taser international has the largest market share in tasers and body cameras by a long shot but it isnt the only player in the game in the past year safarilands vievu has emerged as a formidable competitor with improving body cameras and even a cloudbased video management system the safariland group is already a large supplier of holsters tactical gear body armor and many other products to the law enforcement community so adding body cameras to the mix is a natural fit  motorola has also entered the body camera market although it hasnt made as big a splash as investors once feared and then there are players like wolfcom watchguard and l mobilevision that have offerings that could gain market share in the body camera market  financially the risk is that competitors will try to win contracts by underbidding tasers axon body camera system weve already seen the nypd choose vievu because it offered a lower price so theres a lot of margin risk if competitors get aggressive in the market  image source taser international running a race itll never win the competition in body cameras means taser international has to constantly improve its products to stay a step ahead recently thats meant increasing image quality and cloud services a partnership in wireless connectivity last year and two acquisitions in ai early in  give us a clue as to where management sees the body camera products heading in the future but its not clear whether those moves would be valued by customers if they bring more advanced features than competitive products  its possible that theres nothing sustainable about any competitive advantage that taser international builds into body cameras or tasers and competitors will just be able to copy features and make a product that meets customers needs this would eat away at pricing power and market share if products themselves become commoditized it would be terrible for taser internationals bottomline growth prospects  international investments wont pay off over the last three years taser international has made a huge investment in growing its international sales force sga spending has grown  in that time compared to  growth in revenue so the investment is clearly taking away from net income potential but the theory is that it will pay off with higher profits down the road  tasr sga expense ttm data by ycharts the bear case is that taser international wont be able to make a profit on these investments and international markets will either choose competitors or forgo buying body cameras and tasers  what management is really doing is investing a lot in new products and sales capabilities today hoping for a high return on that investment in the future but what if it never comes that would be terrible for taser international

of financial performance we have presented these measures for our investors to be better able to compare our current results with those of previous periods and have shown a reconciliation of gaap to the nongaap financial measures in the tables at the end of this release these nongaap measures include the impact of noncash stockbased compensation expense depreciation and amortization litigation judgment expense asset impairment charges and loss on write down of property and equipment we use these nongaap financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons our management believes that these nongaap financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results meaning our operating performance excluding noncash charges such as stockbased compensation depreciation and amortization and other discrete noncash charges that are infrequent in nature we believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these nongaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods these nongaap financial measures also facilitate managements internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity caution on use of nongaap measures as noted previously these nongaap financial measures are not consistent with gaap because they do not reflect the impact of other noncash charges management believes investors will benefit from greater transparency in referring to these nongaap financial measures when assessing the companys operating results as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods however management recognizes that these nongaap financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered only as a supplement to the companys gaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the companys gaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures should not be considered to be superior to the companys gaap financial measures and these nongaap financial measures were not prepared in accordance with gaap and investors should not assume that the nongaap financial measures presented in this earnings release were prepared under a comprehensive set of rules or principles further these nongaap financial measures may be unique to the company as they may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies as such this presentation of nongaap financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the companys results to the results of other companies a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure or measures appears at the end of this press release about taser international inc taser

lesslethal weapons and body cameras in response to public concerns about policing  the companys strategy for a few years now has been to build out its capability in both product lines in the us and then expand internationally with a known product line body cameras in particular need to be proven out before law enforcement agencies around the world will begin using them as does tasers cloud platform evidencecom but were seeing a lot of evidence that body cameras and cloud services will be big growth drivers in the future and one contract in particular showed the companys progress in   image source taser international  australia goes allin on body cameras  on july   taser announced that the queensland police service in australia had agreed to buy  axon flex cameras adding to  cameras purchased previously plus a threeyear subscription to evidencecom the order is notable for its size outpacing a unit order in atlanta and a unit order in chicago and for the fact that it gives taser a foothold in a large international market as i outlined above international growth is really the key to making the business profitable and justifying investments made to build out the product line  its not surprising that australian and new zealand police agencies also ordered  taser smart weapons announced earlier this month building on the momentum body cameras and tasers have gone hand in hand as law enforcement agencies look for more accountability and lesslethal options for doing their jobs  orders in australia may seem like business as usual but theyre an important expansion of the companys market potential  and theyre signs that years of investment are starting to pay off  revenue growth is a leading indicator if youre looking at taser internationals longterm potential in the stock market its important to understand how to read its financial statements management has been increasing investment in operating expenses  sales and rd staff  to grow out the product line and expand the customer base around the world this investment will result in a decline in net income in the short term but we can see that its working by the growth in revenue over the long term  tasr revenue ttm data by ycharts another sign the strategy is working is growth in future contracted revenue this is mostly evidencecom contracts that are as long as five years and bring extremely high margins to the business at the end of the third quarter future contracted revenue was  million up  from  million at the end of  its hard to find fault in those kind of growth numbers  a bright future is ahead the longterm trends are working to help taser international and the company has shown plenty of evidence that its leading with both its taser and body camera product lines and that its growing its market internationally when combined with the growth thats just beginning to show from longterm evidencecom contracts the financial future of the company is bright thats a great sign for

and regular citizens gunlike nonlethal weapons like the taser devices are often seen on television or in the news where an officer has to subdue a person who is not complying with his verbal commands to stop and desist the subject is often seen posing a threat to him or herself or others and has to be incapacitated for the safety of the officers or of others in the vicinity taser handheld weapons have been shown to be extremely effective in taking down even the most aggressive person   each advanced taser® gun model uses a replaceable cartridge unit which employs compressed nitrogen to fire two barbed probes at  feet per second these probes are connected to the weapon by highvoltage insulated wire when the probes make contact with the target the advanced air taser handgun transmits powerful electrical pulses along the wires and into the body of the target through up to two inches of clothing                                               police stun guns     taser cartridges

weapons combine the injury reducing benefits of traditional stun technology with a quantum leap in stopping power via new neuromuscular incapacitation nmi technology in the newest police studies the new advanced taser models had a higher instant incapacitation rate than a mm hand gun   how does a taser work each taser gun come with a laser sighting and shoot out  darts attached to  feet of wire  only the taser x can hold and fire two cartridges  probes at once   volts travels over the wires and overrides the central nervous system providing incredible takedown power which taser is the most powerful the advanced taser xp is the most powerful discharging  volts at  watts the taser pulse and taser bolt discharge  volts at  watts and the x discharges  volts at  watts please note that even though the pulse and bolt emit less wattage than the other models it discharges  seconds of shock compared to  and  seconds of shock of the other models therefore giving it the same disabling capabilities can taser devices really incapacitate an assailant yes taser devices utilize electromuscular disruption emd technology taser devices use a powerful  volt electrical signal to completely override the central nervous system and directly control all muscles this emd effect causes an uncontrollable contraction of the muscle tissue allowing the taser device to physically debilitate a target regardless of pain tolerance or mental focus taser devices are specifically designed to stop even the most elite aggressive and focused combatants rather than simply interfering with communication between the brain and muscles taser emd systems directly tell the muscles what to do resulting in muscle spasms until the target is in the fetal position on the ground the taser device provides for maximum safety for both the user and the assailant by bringing dangerous situations quickly under control before force escalates to lethal levels there have been hundreds of reports that taser devices disabled attackers and probably saved the owners life how can the taser device be so effective yet noninjurious the taser device does not depend upon impact pain or body penetration to achieve its effect its pulsating electrical output interferes with communication between the brain and the muscular system resulting in loss of control however the taser device is nondestructive to nerves muscles and other body elements it simply affects them in their natural mode more importantly no court of law has ever ruled that a death has ever been directly attributed to the taser device isnt high voltage lethal high voltage in itself is not dangerous one can receive a volt shock of static electricity from a doorknob on a dry day without harm the physiological effect of electrical shock is determined by the current its duration and the power source that produces the shock the typical household current of  volts is dangerous because it can pump many amperes of current throughout the body indefinitely by contrast the taser devices power supply consists of batteries that are capable of supplying electrical power for a few minutes but will not kill the assailant what are the after effects a person hit with a taser device will feel dazed for several minutes the pulsating electrical output causes involuntary muscle contractions and a resulting sense of vertigo it can momentarily stun or render an attacker unconscious yet the taser’s low electrical amperage and short duration of pulsating current ensures a nonlethal charge moreover it does not cause permanent damage or longterm aftereffects to muscles nerves or other body functions a january  annals of emergency medicine study reported taser technology leaves no long term injuries compared with  long term injuries for gunshot injuries must the probes penetrate the body to be effective no the electrical current will jump up to two inches as long as both probes are attached to clothing or skin at most only the inch needlepointhook will penetrate the skin they have less energy than a spring propelled bb what if the probe misses the taser device can be used in a touchstun mode the user is thus provided with a final backup if the probes miss the target should the user miss or engage a second attacker he can touch the unit directly to the target and it will work like a powerful touchstun device are tasers safe to use even if youve never shot a weapon taser guns are one of the best safest and most effective options for personal protection and home defense the technologically advanced

his electric rifle to make it easier to pronounce as a word cover later added an a to the acronym to form taser the taser public defender used gunpowder as its propellant which led the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms to classify it as a firearm in  this limited sales and covers company taser systems inc collapsed in  rick and tom smith formed air taser inc to with cover design a version of the device that would use compressed nitrogen instead of gunpowder as a propellant the pursuit began after two of ricks former high school acquaintances had been murdered in a road rage incident in scottsdale during development the company faced competition from another vendor tasertron whose product had become associated with its alleged ineffectiveness during the police confrontation of rodney king after nearly going bankrupt marketing other products such as an electroshockbased antitheft system for automobiles known as auto taser the company later renamed taser international introduced its taser m weapon in  with a  million deficit in  taser international took steps to improve sales by offering to pay police officers to train others on how to use their products this marketing technique helped improve the companys market share reaching  million in net sales by  and nearly  million in  in may  they filed for an initial public offering and began trading on nasdaq under the stock symbol tasrcitation needed the company also took significant action against competitors having acquired the aforementioned tasertron and aggressively defending its

the company unveiled its first body camera the axon pro it was designed to be headmounted and upload footage for online storage on a webbased service known as evidencecom tasers ceo rick smith explained that the products were designed to help provide revolutionary digital evidence collection storage and retrieval for law enforcement the company piloted axon pro in various small cities and towns in  after prosecutor daniel shue exonerated fort smith police officer brandon davis based on footage from an axon pro camera tasers marketing began to incorporate testimonials by both parties into marketing for the axon line especially in the wake of the michael brown shooting the companys body camera business saw significant growth smith argued that the company was not just about weapons

netherlands in may  in june  the company announced the formation of a new seattlebased division named after the axon brand which would encompass the companys technology businesses including body cameras digital evidence management and analytics rick smith explained that the branch was inspired by microsofts use of the xbox brand to branch into entertainment businesses stating that axon was the name that we used for selling cameras historically but we realized that brand had the room to grow and encompass all of our connected technologies the taser brand would still be used for the companys weapons products on april   taser international announced that it had been renamed axon to reflect its diversification the company also announced an intent to offer free oneyear trials of its body camera products and evidencecom services to us law enforcement agencies while the taser product line still contributes to a significant portion of axons revenue the companys technologies business has seen major gains as of  axons body cameras have been adopted by police departments in  of the united states major cities and comprise a quarter of the companys business smith noted that the taser name had garnered a negative stigma especially among members of the public that have negative views of police due to its association with the weapons and that when recruiting employees he noted that
