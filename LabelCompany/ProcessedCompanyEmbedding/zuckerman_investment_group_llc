our team executive leadership investments client service operations careers investment managementwe manage client investments on a feeonly basis in separate accounts and offer a variety of easytounderstand investment strategies to help you achieve your longterm financial objectives equity zig allcap equity strategy international equities fixed income zig fixed income strategy alternative investments private equity  real estate equities zuckerman investment group allcapitalization equity strategy our proprietary strategy uses a disciplined valuebased approach to manage a concentrated equity portfolio we seek to fulfill our dual mandate of wealth preservation and longterm capital appreciation by constructing a portfolio of easytounderstand investments at a market price below our independent estimate of their intrinsic value we invest in companies in all industries and of all market capitalizations our portfolio will typically hold  equity investments investments in uslisted equities typically comprise a significant majority of our holdings our portfolio contains a mix of quality compounding businesses and opportunistic investments acquired when we believe the market price temporarily undervalues the investment often due to transitory factors or other special situations we manage risk and seek to avoid the permanent loss of capital by understanding all potential risks by producing a comprehensive thesis and a highconfidence independent estimate of intrinsic value for each investment and by taking a longterm perspective when we are unable to find attractive investment opportunities we are willing to hold cash rather than take unnecessary risks in pursuit of shortterm profits equities international equities for clients who desire more meaningful exposure to international equity markets we have carefully curated a select group of thirdparty international equity managers that closely mirror our disciplined valuedbased approach while investing in nonus equity markets fixed income zuckerman investment group fixed income strategy our proprietary fixed income strategy is a concentrated portfolio typically  taxable corporate bonds that leverages our disciplined and independent research process and focuses first on risk minimization and then on achieving an attractive level of income relative to that of the broader taxable corporate fixed income market this approach drives us to invest in bonds of stable highquality businesses that generate strong free cash flow provided that our investment criteria are satisfied we will invest in the bonds of both investmentgrade issuers and highyield issuers further our approach leverages two unique advantages that we have our small size and our flexibility to hold both investment grade and high yield bonds the fixed income market is dominated by very large institutional investors who are often mandated to hold only investment grade or high yield bonds when a bond is splitrated rated investment grade at one credit rating agency and high yield at another or gets upgraded from high yield to investment grade or vice versa those strict mandates can cause buying or selling that creates market distortions that we are able to take advantage of because of our flexibility similarly large institutional investors in the bond markets tend to overlook bonds from small issuances the total amount of the bond offering and “seasoned” bonds bonds trading in the secondary market as opposed to newlyissued bonds these opportunities are too small to be of much significance to investors running a large bond portfolio an inefficiency that we are able to use to our advantage because of our small size alternative investments private equity and real estate when we believe that such investments will benefit our qualifying clients we recommend investment in a select group of private equity and real estate partnerships that apply a similar disciplined and valuebased approach to private market and real property investments   zuckerman investment group llc all rights reserved home    contact us investment philosophy  zuckerman investment group contact us about us what we do our story financial counseling investment management equity fixed income alternative investments investment philosophy our team executive leadership investments client service operations careers investment philosophyour disciplined valuebased approach to asset management emphasizes wealth preservation and longterm capital appreciation to ensure the full alignment of interests we invest our assets directly alongside those of our clients we are disciplined value investors focused on wealth preservation and longterm capital appreciation our investment philosophy is based on the belief that we can deliver attractive absolute returns over a multiyear period by purchasing investments at a market price below our independent estimate of their intrinsic value we pursue this objective by seeking easytounderstand investments that are unloved outoffavor or that run contrary to the prevailing conventional wisdom we do not and will never pursue shortterm fads or trends or take unnecessary risks in pursuit of shortterm performance we identify mispriced investments through a diligent research process vigorous debate draws on the collective wisdom and experience of the sixperson investment team to identify potential risks and possible downside associated with the investment to build a detailed investment thesis and to establish a prudent estimate of the investment’s intrinsic value our longterm investment perspective allows us to take advantage of opportunities created by the shortterm focus of others and also ensures that we stay the course or even invest further when our investment thesis and estimate of intrinsic value are unchanged and shortterm market and economic forces work against the price of an investment that we have made this approach has the added benefit of reducing trading costs and promoting tax efficiency by limiting investment turnover we believe that the extensive nature of our research process gives us the confidence necessary to manage a concentrated portfolio of our highestconviction investments while maintaining an appropriate level of diversification and avoiding the permanent loss of capital   zuckerman investment
