pursuant to rule ec under the exchange act  cfr ec           item  termination of a material definitive agreement   on april   universal power industry corporation the company formed xpal technology inc a colorado corporation xti as a whollyowned subsidiary  on april    xti entered into an asset purchase agreement the agreement with tennrich international corp tennrich to acquire certain assets of xpal power inc xpal a california corporation subsequently on august   the parties amended their agreement to provide that xti would acquire from tennrich  shares equal to  of the common stock of xpal the purchase price was  payable over time and payable in cash or shares of the company the shares if issued were to be issued into escrow however although the parties indicated that the acquisition had been amended to proceed as a stock acquisition of xpal in fact it proceeded as originally contemplated and titles to the xpal assets were transferred to xti by tennrich thereafter in or around august  the company in form  closed on the transaction by issueing an aggregate of  shares of its common stock in consideration for the xpal assets directly to tennrich in addition to the assets that were to be transferred specifically inventory with a purported value of approximately  million  accounts receivable with a purported value of approximately  million and open orders with a purported value of approximately  million in addition tennrich originally stated that xpal owned  of wimo labs llc wimo and the company was to receive  of all wimo revenues in exchange for managing wimo in addition the company was purportedly granted the right until april   to acquire tennrichs  stake in wimo in consideration of payment to tennrich of  less the dollar amount received by tennrich from april   up to the date of purchase or in the alternative the company could pay the option amount in its common stock valued at  per share however notwithstanding the companys issuance of  shares of its common stock to tennrich the value of the assets that were transferred to the company had little or no value and as such it is the companys position that the acquisition failed for lack of consideration  more specifically all of the inventory that the company received was either defective or obsolete shortly after the purported closing customers were returning inventory and it became clear that the receivables were essentially uncollectable because the products that had been sent to xpal customers were defective or were obsolete in the case of one shipment that was accepted however the customer had ordered products made with its label  the product arrived damaged and was returned  xti reshipped the product which was accepted but the customer had incurred such large penalties due to the delay to its buyer that it refused to pay for the product as such the inventory was depleted without payment but even worse the receivable was uncollectible  to make matters worse xti still had inventory that it had purchased from tennrich with the customers label so without the customers approval the product cannot be sold or liquidated without a resulting trademark violation the remaining inventory is either obsolete or is defective and when sold are returned by customers  the company does not believe that the inventory issues are capable of correction because the problems of overheating appear to be a fundamental designengineering issue and there is not a viable market for the other inventory  as for the open orders purchased by xti following the purported closing the company learned that tennrich had been working directly with customers to fill the open orders instead of xti filling them and realizing the profit so there was not value in the open orders contrary to the purchase agreement finally as stated one of the assets purchased by xti from tennrich was suppose to be wimo however following the closing it became evident that tennrich did not own  of wimo but rather  but even then just weeks before the company entered into the transactions with tennrich wimo had licensed all of its ip lunatek labs llc on or about march   and the company has not been able to get any financials from wimo nor has it received any payments under the management agreement that entitled it to  of wimo revenue  however the company believes that the license agreement may have left wimo without revenue and despite repeated requests no information on wimo has been provided to the company that would allow it to deliver on its management responsibilities or audit its financials to determine what its revenues are                finally one of the most valuable assets that the company believed it had purchased was a license agreement among energizer tennrich and xti  under that agreement tennrich was to manufacture portable power devices and remote wireless power chargers with the energizer name for distribution and sale by xti  since the purported closing the company and xti have repeatedly sought samples of the energizer power bank and magcom products so that it could sell them to various mass retail customers  none have been provided despite these requests and recently tennrich attended a trade show where it was representing those magcom and energizer power bank products which should have been represented by xti but which have effectively been kept from xti as a result of the forgoing issues while the acquisition of the xpal business was effected in form and the company believed that it had been completed in reality because of the subsequent issues that only became apparent as it began attempting to operate the xpal business it is now clear to the company that it did not close in substance and that at a minimum the transactions fail for lack of consideration on the part of tennrich   as a result the company is seeking the return of the shares it issued and is treating the transactions as null and void while the company intends to seek an expeditious resolution of this matter and believes that such a resolution is possible without litigation if necessary it will commence an action to recover the shares it had issued and seek redress for any and all damages that is may have sustained while the company believes it would be successful in the litigation it would likely commence against tennrich lawsuits by their very nature are unpredictable and there can be no assurances that it would be successful if an action were commenced  signatures     pursuant to the requirements of the
