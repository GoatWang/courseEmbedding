service meant low quality panera set out to challenge this expectation we believed that food that was good and that you could feel good about served in a warm and welcoming environment by people who cared could bring out the best in all of us to us that is food as it should be and that is why we exist so we began with a simple commitment to bake fresh bread from fresh dough in every bakerycafe every day no short cuts just bakers with simple ingredients and hot ovens each night any unsold bread and baked goods were shared with neighbors in need these traditions carry on today as we have continued to find ways to be an ally to our guests that means crafting a menu of soups salads and sandwiches that we are proud to feed our families like poultry and pork raised without antibiotics on our salads and sandwiches a commitment to transparency and options that empower our guests to eat the way they want seasonal flavors and whole grains and a commitment to removing artificial additives flavors colors sweeteners and preservatives from the food in our bakerycafes why because we think that simpler is better and we believe in serving food as it should be because when you don’t have to compromise to eat well all that is left is the joy of eating we’re also focused on improving quality and convenience with investments in technology and operations we now offer new ways to enjoy your panera favorites – like mobile ordering and rapid pickup for togo orders – all designed to make things easier for our guests as of september  there are  bakerycafes in  states and in ontario canada
