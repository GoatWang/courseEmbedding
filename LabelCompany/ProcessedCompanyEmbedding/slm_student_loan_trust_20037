acceptable servicer of ffelp student loans rating sensitivities since ffelp student loan abs rely on the us government to reimburse defaults aaasf ffelp abs ratings will likely move in tandem with the aaa us sovereign rating aside from the us sovereign rating defaults and basis risk account for the majority of the risk embedded in ffelp student loan transactions additional defaults and basis shock beyond fitchs published stresses could result in future downgrades likewise a buildup of credit enhancement driven by positive excess spread given favorable basis factor conditions could lead to
