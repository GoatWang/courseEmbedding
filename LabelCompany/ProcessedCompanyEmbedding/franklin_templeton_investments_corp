real economic growth aiming to protect investors against significant losses from major market downturns they include government bonds gold indexlinked bonds safe haven currencies and hedging positions stable investments tend to have low or no correlation to equity markets and aim to offer consistently higher returns than money markets while taking on modestly higher amounts of risk they include market neutral strategies carry trades relative value and risk premia to isolate specific risk factors franklin target return funds objective is to achieve a return of  net of fees over the ftse tmx

franklin templeton investments has created a new digital education platform specifically designed to help australian advisers meet their continuing professional development cpd needs speaking to financialobserver the group’s australian head of marketing joe marassa said the launch of the franklin templeton academy online had come in response to larger advice groups increasingly looking for higher educational standards from their service providers following the future of financial advice reforms “we believe that as a large global company with not only the breadth of investment capabilities that offers but a dedicated inhouse learning academy which has been delivering pragmatic and interactive training to financial advisers for over  years places us well to be a leading provider” marassa said franklin templeton academy online is a web training portal featuring webcasts videos and topic papers which are accredited by the financial planning association fpa marassa said there were about a dozen courses available on the platform all of which had been accredited by the fpa for continuing professional development sessions ranged from five to minute videos or papers to fully integrated learning courses that could take up to an hour to complete marassa said educational content was critical for advice professionals given the current regulatory focus on higher educational standards and this was reflected in discussions the firm regularly had with both large advisory groups and independent financial advisers “we offer a range of education materials covering every facet of an adviser’s business  investment concepts professional development and product knowledge  from basic level training to more advanced type courses” he said courses were organised across three categories covering topics such as fixed income hedge funds global macro perspectives and behavioural finance while advisers could track their learning process through the online system “our aim is to bring highquality training to advisers in a convenient and accessible format we are really pleased with the results so far and see great potential for the platform to continue to add value to advisers’ professional development in the future” marassa said « back to articles industry highlights hub recruits btfg exec afa announces new ceo as fox steps down perpetual hires longtime count boss

object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump
