technologies inc delivering low cost emission free power with its heat recovery solutions clean cycle™ generator acquired from general electric international inc mar  6  et from clean energy technologies inc costa mesa calif march  6 prnewswire  clean energy technologies inc otc cety recently announced its acquisition of heat recovery solutions assets patents  licenses from general electric international inc this proprietary magnetic bearing turbine technology will serve as the foundation of the companys new focus on clean energy and environmentally sustainable technologies the heat recovery solutions system hrs captures waste heat from a variety of sources and turns it into electricity that users can use or sell back to the grid there are currently more than  units installed by ge globally with more than  fleet operating hours heat recovery solutions clean cycletm heattopower generator is a compact modular system that converts waste heat – from an array of heat sources – into power the conversion process requires no additional fuel produces no additional emissions and delivers baseload power that may be used onsite or sold to the grid hrs clean cycle is designed for reciprocating engine biomass and gas turbine applications and generates electricity in a process called the organic rankine cycle orc the process is similar to the steam cycle except that the orc uses a working fluid in place of water with a lower boiling point enabling access to a greater range of heat sources many things generate heat but a common easy to access source is the exhaust from power generation equipment  of the primary energy used in power plants becomes waste heat the united states industrial sector accounts for  of all energy used in the united states during these manufacturing processes as much as  to  of the energy consumed is ultimately lost via waste heat contained in streams of hot exhaust gases and liquids heat is the only input required for the clean cycle unit to generate electricity one unit generates kwh of electricity and avoids 96 liters of diesel  year per engine theres a huge global potential of heat to power market in the fuel fired reciprocating engines boilers and geothermal application we offer a proven proprietary technology to recover a significant portion of this lost energy this technology increases efficiency reduces costs increases revenue and lowers the carbon footprint of existing production facilities and processes acquiring a proven proprietary clean technology product that we can offer worldwide to a significant addressable market solidifies the companys strategy to be a clean energy technology solutions provider said kam mahdi ceo of ceti about clean energy technologies inc clean energy technologies inc designs builds and markets clean energy products focused on energy efficiency and environmentally sustainable technologies the companys principal product is the clean cycletm generator offered by heat recovery solutions or hrs wwwheatrecoverysolutionscom  the companys engineering and manufacturing resources support its heat recovery solutions business as well as continuing to support other clean energy emerging growth companies with their technologies ceti is positioned to become a worldwide leader in ever expanding energy efficiency market headquartered in costa mesa
