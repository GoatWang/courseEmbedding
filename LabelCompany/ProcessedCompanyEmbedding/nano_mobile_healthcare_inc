discussed the nano mobile sensor was developed to address one of the longest standing unmet medical needs today which involves early stage lung cancer detection and to do so in an affordable noninvasive safe and convenient way similarly the device will be used by law enforcement to detect the presence of marijuana on a driver’s breath as more and more states legislate the use of marijuana for medical use the risk of driving while drugged increases as does the death toll currently this represents a significant unmet need as law enforcement struggles with multiple interventions to attempt to assess the condition of drivers that if not legally intoxicated appear to be drugged the nano mobile sensor and its application will provide inthemoment results with a goal of making our roads safer for all drivers and creating a more effective tool for law enforcement lung cancer abc in the march   abc  tv newscast  san francisco oakland san jose published a story with news anchor

headquartered in new york city and mountain view ca is a leading mobile health technology company developing pointofcare screening using apps based upon chemical sensing residing within a small bluetooth enabled device that works with any smartphone tablet or laptop called the nano mobile sensor investment highlights with its foundations in advanced nanotechnology the company’s first product the nano mobile sensor is the convergence of nanoelectronics bioinformatics and wireless technology to create the next generation mobile health application nasa invention of the year was awarded in april  nasa grants fiveyear exclusive worldwide license to the company for ip associated with all patents issued and pending for commercialization in areas of healthcare and narcotics strategic partnership for mobile health technology with scripps translational science institute is announced fda clinical trials are expected to start in  and commercialization in  for the lung cancer app total addressable market for lung cancer four main global regions one year is  billion for healthcare providers marketing initially to healthcare providers through strategic large pharmaceutical partners business model is subscription based with recurring revenue occurring after purchase of device and monthly subscription fee per application business model delivers value to all parties healthcare providers pharmacy patients and insurance companies ongoing research collaborations with nasa and the scripps translational science institute   our technology – the nano mobile sensor the nano mobile sensor was birthed via  nasa by taking care of the astronauts in space ensuring the quality of their air was free of carbon monoxide and other noxious gases our founder and chief scientist before his life here at nano mobile was a rocket scientist himself and repurposed the device with other scientists on the sensor team to read our breath signature everyone’s breath is composed of volatile organic compounds and combinations of them can form giving doctors indications of various illnesses that are present in our bodies  those same voc compounds can be used to detect marijuana and other legal and illegal drugs present in our bodies the nano mobile sensor is designed to screen for these various combinations so the doctor can identify them before symptoms appear such as a tumor that appears when patients have a ct scan which means patients will have many more treatment options available the fact that this technology will be bluetooth enabled means that the nano mobile sensor is small and compact and works with any smartphone tablet or laptop making the data collected in realtime and immediately available for analysis to doctor and patient in the case of law enforcement it means that an officer can detect in real time whether a driver has marijuana present in their body the nano mobile sensor will automatically selfflush after each use so the healthcare provider can use the sensor with different patients as well as use the same sensor for different screening applications  in the case of law enforcement the officer can test the driver of all involved and get the results in real time   the unmet need and solutions for cancer detection there are more deaths from lung cancer than from prostate breast and colorectal combined only  percent of lung cancer cases are screened at an early stage the fiveyear survival rate for lung cancer is  percent for cases detected at stage a when the disease is still localized for stage  lung cancer the fiveyear survival rate is only  percent and this is why most people with stage  lung cancer die within one year of being diagnosed there is an opportunity for low cost noninvasive detection of this disease at its earliest stages when treatment options are many and varied and lives can be saved our vision involves a nano mobile sensor for each healthcare provider with the desire to screen for early indications of lung cancer we believe healthcare provider and patients will find breath analysis attractive – noninvasive painless having no side effects and available at an extremely low cost our goal is to with a strategic partners commercialize mobile breath sensor technologies with initial screening for lung cancer that enable healthcare provider to better manage the health care continuum from managing illness to managing wellness early noninvasive inexpensive lung cancer screening is the first step in reducing deaths and lowering healthcare costs once the lung cancer application is launched expected in  nano mobile will start work on the next applications in the pipeline related to breast cancer colorectal cancer prostate cancer and other cancers and infectious diseases   the unmet need and solutions for mobile marijuana detection marijuana is the number one illicit drug in america and the concentrations of thc in marijuana is three times more powerful than in the ’s  fatalities from marijuana use by drivers is rising at a time when we are seeing an increase in state by state legislative approvals for medical marijuana it is inevitable that increased marijuana use will also correlate to impaired driving law enforcement needs mobile technology to save lives law enforcement will need the nano mobile sensor for detecting drivers under the influence of marijuana so they may in turn help protect our communities and save lives nano mobile through its majority shareholder nanobeak is working with nasa to develop a capability which would specifically result in a test for

nasa to develop a mobile app to be used in connection with our sensor that will enable law enforcement to screen for marijuana use and deliver inthemoment results to the officer’s smartphone tablet or laptop in the field given the increase of marijuana legalization and decriminalization efforts by a growing number of states we have made the development of a law enforcement sensor the shortterm priority there is a growing need on the part of law enforcement across the country for a portable sensor to detect marijuana abuse and impaired driving we also plan to incorporate alcohol detection along with the marijuana sensing capability in one device so that law enforcement can have the capability to detect both alcohol dui breathalyzer and marijuana abuse in a single device the law enforcement device offers a quicker path to market based on reduced testing and regulatory requirements as compared to a medical diagnostic device regulatory approval our products as well as our research and development activities are regulated by numerous governmental authorities principally the us food and drug administration fda as well as state and foreign regulatory agencies in the us we believe that the medical diagnostic devices will be classified by the fda as class ii medical devices and require clearance through a form k there can be no assurance that the fda will provide marketing clearance for the device manufacturing distribution sales we intend to outsource manufacturing distribution and sales but we have not entered into any definitive agreements for these functions competition we intend to compete with other detection devices by offering products that have enhanced value ease of use simple functionality compatibility with various platforms reliability attractive price and are high in quality the company also believes its intellectual property provides an advantage over current competitors disease screening there are a variety of methods to screen for the presence of disease we are focused on noninvasive point of care diagnostics following years of research a number of companies are now in prototype phase with devices that can test the chemical compounds in a person’s breath and identify the early stages of disease entry to this market is expected to continue and sharply rise as more prototypes emerge and begin to gain market entry with commercialized products while companies in development tend to be small and privately owned there has been entry by larger publicly owned companies that have greater financial reserves distribution channels and more experience in commercialization acquisitions and collaborations by and companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment this is a global market evidenced by the emergence of companies bringing competitive solutions from different parts of the world new competitors may emerge and may develop products and capabilities which compete directly with our products no assurance can be given that we will be successful in competing in the industries identified or in other industries that would benefit from our technology customers for our medical diagnostic products is expected to include health care providers such as medical doctors nurse practitioners and physician assistants narcotics screening there are currently a variety of breathalyzer smartphone apps which essentially focus on alcohol detection we are developing devices to distinguish between alcohol and narcotics and screen for a variety of narcotics both legal and illicit making up the narcotic detection space are both domestic and international organizations that range from small privately held companies to larger companies that include an array of diagnostic narcotics solutions although this market is more developed than disease detection the space is dominated by a few key players making the possibility for new entrants feasible because toxicology screens are the most common type of narcotics testing products on the market we believe that advanced technology that both detects and monitors discrete drug levels in an individual’s system through exhalation will cause this market to expand the consumer market for mobile applications which provide detection and ongoing monitoring capabilities is anticipated to be significant customers for our product will include the different areas of law enforcement as well as the different areas of professional and amateur sports corporations are also a target area for the narcotics screening technology employees we outsource all of our nonexecutive functions to nanobeak llc as of the date of this filing nanobeak has  employees and consultants both full and part time most of which are shared with nasa and other contractors the employees are not presently covered by any collective bargaining agreement   presentation thursday may  –  am –  am  httpunbelievableverygoodideacomwatchphpviddbea  columbus circle th
