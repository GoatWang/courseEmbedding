incfounded our only real cleverness was in the perception of what was happening and in being quick enough on our feet to take advantage of ifdr charles m geschke mention the names bill gates and steve jobs and most people immediately know whom youre talking about but mention the names dr charles m geschke and john e warnock and chances are youll be met with blank stares ironically these two publicityshy hightech trailblazers played major roles in the success of both microsoft and apple in fact without the postscript language created by the company geschke and warnock cofounded adobe systems inc desktop publishing as we know it wouldnt existlike many silicon valley firms adobe was a spinoff of a bigger companyin this case xerox corp geschke and warnock first met and began working together at xeroxs palo alto research center parc where they helped develop xeroxs pagedescription language interpress the language won accolades within the corporation but to geschke and warnocks dismay xerox decided to keep the technology proprietary rather that release it to public domain geschke and warnock were flabbergasted by the decision as geschke explains in a  pc week interview we didnt see how you could make an industrywide standard with something that was proprietarydeciding that they could get old and gray and frustrated somewhere else and have more fun geschke and warnock left parc to found adobe systems inc in late  originally they planned to build a copyservice business but quickly abandoned the idea next they considered offering a complete turnkey system for office printing but dismissed that idea as well when they realized that the industry would probably head in a different directionfinally they decided to concentrate on what they did bestdeveloping specialized printing software the result of this decision was the adobe postscript pagedescription language a revolutionary breakthrough in printing technology postscript was the first printing software that enabled users to print pages that included text line art and digitized photosrealizing that their best chance for success lay in making postscript an industry standard adobe quickly made the postscript language public domain but if the product was public domain and therefore free how could adobe make money from its new software simple without the postscript program that interprets the postscript language the language itself is useless in a unique twist on the classic sell them the razor cheap then make your profits on supplying the blades adobe would make its money from selling the postscript interpreter which executes page descriptions generated by other software packages such as desktop publishing and word processing programs in addition the company would also provide original equipment manufacturers oems with designs for interpreter boards to be used in their printersthe strategy worked by the end of their first year in business geschke and warnock had licensed postscript to apple computer inc which in turn introduced the first postscriptbased laser printer the apple laserwriter in january  and thus the postscript laser printer industry was bornthanks to what geschke has described as a unique combination of forward thinking marketing savvy timing and luck adobe was a success almost from the very start by the end of  it was posting revenue of  million which grew to  million by the beginning of  based on their rapidly increasing revenue geschke and warnock made an initial public offering in august  and adobe stock immediately became one of wall streets darlings it rocketed from  to a peak of  in may  which in reality was a  peak considering and earlier for stock splitbut more important by  adobes postscript had become the industrystandard printer language more than  thirdparty software programs supported postscript and adobe boasted licensing agreements with  printer companies including ibm digital ast and texas instruments even hewlettpackard which had initially refused to endorse the language in any way was forced to adopt postscript to further increase postscripts popularity adobe began building what would eventually become the worlds largest typeface librarywith postscript firmly entrenched as the industry standard geschke and warnock branched out into the enduser software market with the release of adobe illustrator in march  this highend graphic package for professional artists and illustrators was an instant hit with both users and criticsby  illustrator had also become an industry standard adobes second software program photoshop another professional graphics package that enables users to manipulate both blackandwhite and color photographs was generating impressive reviews and even more impressive sales and adobes typeface library had grown to include  fontsflush with this success geschke and warnock set their sights on a new goal creating a paperless office to this end they developed adobe acrobat an innovative program that enables users to create documents that others can view regardless of their application software in a brilliant marketing move adobe decided to offer acrobat reader the program needed to view acrobat documents free of charge instead they would charge for acrobat distiller the program that creates acrobat documents although its not the raging success postscript or illustrator were acrobat is widely used for transferring sharing and viewing documents electronicallythe duos next big move was to join forces with aldus corp the creator of the popular desktop publishing program pagemaker in  the merger handed adobe unquestioned leadership of the publishingsoftware market creating one vendor with a broad array of products that covers both windows and macintosh usersadobes position as king of the hill would not go unchallenged however by  the once undisputed ruler of desktop publishing was losing market share to quark corpwhose quark xpress desktop publishing program had muscled pagemaker out of the top spot in the macintosh marketand corel corp whose coreldraw was gaining ground on illustrator in the windows marketrather than go toetotoe with these two upandcoming contenders geschke and warnock decided to change the rules on their competitors they attempted to reposition adobe as a highprofile world wide web publisher with the release of two webpage authoring tools pagemill and sitemill they also retooled illustrator pagemaker and photoshop to include webcontent creation tools the gambit proved worthwhile as adobe once again became the kingpin of the professional graphics market averaging nearly  million in sales in by  adobe found itself competing with a new more powerful challengersoftware titan microsoft before microsofts emergence in the imageediting market many industry analysts had noticed a change in adobe while it was still producing innovative products sales were down mostly because its marketing and pr efforts seemed to stall pc magazine columnist john c dvorak suggests that was partially due to the continually increasing isolation of both geschke and warnock which dvorak proposes was caused by geschkes abduction by terrorists in whatever the future may hold for geschke and warnock one thing is certainadobes influence on the computer industry and image editing will be apparent for decades to come whether you

awarded the marconi prize in  cited for his contributions in the field of industrystandard printing and imaging technology the  marconi society prize will be awarded to adobe systems founders john e warnock and charles m geschke visionary business leaders and technological innovators who together helped fundamentally transform the world of print communications from a manual mechanical process to a digital work flow the two were selected for the prestigious award considered the highest honor specifically devoted to the field of communications and information science for their research on printing and imaging technology and their development of adobe® postscript® a revolutionary software technology that is now the worldwide printing and imaging standard used by print service providers publishers corporations and government agencies around the globe the duo will be awarded the  marconi prize october th at the annual marconi awards dinner at the rosewood hotel in menlo park ca “the selection of charles m geschke and john e warnock as corecipients of the  marconi prize signals the evolving nature of what we mean by communications technology” said jim massey the  marconi award winner and fellow the marconi society established in  annually recognizes a living scientist whose work in the field of communications and information technology advances the social economic and cultural improvement of all humanity recent winners have included bell labs scientists andrew chraplyvy and robert tkach for their work on optical fiber communication systems professor david payne of the university of southampton in the uk another optical fiber pioneer who led the development of the erbiumdoped optical fiber amplifier google founders sergey brin and larry page mit professor ron rivest coinventor of rsa encryption stanford professor john cioffi the inventor of modern high speed modems that enabled dsl and vint cerf most commonly known as the father of the internet who developed the first commercial email system geschke and warnock met in the late’s in silicon valley geschke had recently received his phd from carnegie mellon and warnock had received his from the university of utah geschke worked as a researcher and group manager in the computer science lab at xerox parc a renowned research center responsible for such important developments as laser printing ethernet the modern personal computer graphical user interface gui ubiquitous computing and verylargescaleintegration vlsi warnock worked for evans  sutherland at ames research laboratory in  geschke interviewed and hired warnock for a position at parc from the start their similar backgrounds and philosophies forged a close bond between them in  while at parc warnock and a coworker created the precursor to postscript a device independent system called jam that incorporated graphics convinced of its potential warnock and geschke continued to work on its further development in  geschke started the imaging sciences laboratory at xerox dedicated to exploring graphics and printing the new team produced interpress a melding of jam and xerox’s existing printing language though somewhat compromised by the many protocols of xerox interpress was a significant advance but though the xerox parc team was excited at the potential of interpress xerox corporation decided not to include it among the firm’s commercial products undeterred warnock and geschke sensed an opportunity if xerox was not going to seize this moment they were prepared to do it themselves in  they formed a new company adobe systems named after the creek that ran behind warnock’s los altos home they needed funding a former teacher of warnock’s suggested they meet with venture capitalist bill hambrecht of the hambrecht and quist venture capital firm geschke and warnock unveiled a complicated business plan to develop systems composed of highpowered workstations and printers for inhouse use at large corporations leveraging postscript’s deviceindependent design the workstation would be connected to a laser printer for draft copies and to a typesetter for camera ready output six other companies were trying to do the same thing hambrecht found the proposal so appealing he wrote them a personal check for  for startup costs they shook hands and later received  million dollars from hambrecht and quist it was the only venture capital adobe ever needed they moved the business out of their homes and quickly built a small organization that included a few close associates their first product postscript bore little resemblance to xerox’s interpress technically it was much closer to jam but mindful of postscript’s origins as the design system at evans and sutherland adobe entered into a licensing agreement with warnock’s former employer to avoid any intellectual property issues then they made a critical and fortunate decision they had always believed they would be manufacturing hardware but they came to a startling realization by opting for a technology licensing business model they were relieved of the burden of manufacturing yet could profit handsomely they soon were attracting the attention of silicon valley’s heavy hitters including steve jobs who offered them a considerable sum for their business it only served to confirm the value of what they’d created when jobs realized they wouldn’t sell him the company he instead invested  million in adobe apple cashed out the stock six years later for  million the compatibility and success of the adobeapple relationship lay in a shared belief¬ that technology could transcend ordinary computing to achieve a higher aesthetic purpose jobs warnock and geschke believed their companies should stand at the intersection of art and technology the mac was the first computer with commercially available graphical user interface and apple was doing typography on the screen while with postscript adobe was doing type on the printed page apple’s laserwriter the world’s first adobe postscript printer the macintosh and aldus pagemaker enabled adobe apple and aldus to launch the desktop publishing revolution by the end of  the market had embraced postscript which fundamentally improved the cost productivity and efficiency of the graphic arts printing and publishing businesses geschke and warnock’s fledging company had taken communications to a new level and in little more than  years transformed the world of print communications from a manual mechanical process to a digital work flow today all communications technologies are converting to digital and adobe’s products continue to expand the technological frontiers of photography video production animation digital communication and the world wide web its ubiquitous programs include among others adobe photoshop® illustrator® acrobat® indesign® adobe premiere® and adobe flash® adobe’s success has grown over the decades it acquired over  companies and invested in many more always driven by the vision and collaboration between warnock and geschke bill hambrecht the founder of hambrecht  quist says it best “the mutual trust and respect for each other’s ideas never wavered i honestly have never seen a better partnership it’s truly unique they always stayed in sync with each other and were both visionaries in the business from a two employee business in los altos california to over  employees worldwide the adobe culture has always remained the same care and concern taking responsibility managing well and loving your job are the cornerstones of the adobe way of life the skills for their craft coupled with their ability to see beyond the curve of their profession have allowed them to transform step by step an entire universe of work i was taught so much by them” artists graphic designers writers printers publishers have all experienced the adobe products that have transformed their particular fields but probably no one has felt the impact like web users pdf like postscript has become another industry standard charles geschke retired from active management as president of adobe in  john warnock stepped aside as ceo in  and retired in early  today geschke and warnock are cochairmen of the board warnock continues to be active in the software industry he is a frequent speaker on the impact of computing technologies on business and publishing he is active on or a past member of several business and nonprofit boards in addition to adobe including the sundance institute the american film institute and the tech museum of innovation in san jose he is also on the board of ebrary mongonet and the chairman of the board of the salon media group geschke and warnock have both been honored countless times for their technical and managerial achievements in  both were inducted as fellows of the association for computing machinery they received the aea annual medal of achievement award from the american electronics association in  and are the first software executives to receive this honor geschke and warnock were among the  winners of the national medal of technology and innovation which is the usa’s highest honor for technological and scientific achievement and both were honored for their pioneering contributions that spurred the desktop publishing revolution and for changing the way people create and engage with information and entertainment across multiple mediums including print web and video in addition both have won awards from the ieee institute of electrical and electronics engineers the national computer graphics association and the rochester institute of technology they have also received the entrepreneur of the year award from ernst  young merrill lynch and inc magazine and the acm systems award warnock is the recipient of the bodleian medal the land medal and the lovelace medal and a member of the philosophical society they are members of the american academy of arts and sciences founded by benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson and the national academy of engineering geschke is a recipient of the john w gardner leadership award he is a board member for several educational arts and nonprofit organizations geschke is a trustee emeritus of the university of san francisco and currently holds the rossi chair in entrepreneurship at the usf school of business he is a member of the computer science advisory board of carnegiemellon university and santa clara university’s markkula center for applied ethics he is a board member of tableau software he also serves on the boards of the san francisco symphony the commonwealth club of california the egan maritime foundation the national leadership roundtable on church management and the nantucket boys  girls club “geschke and warnock’s leadership of adobe has been and still is today characterized by technical progress coupled with social responsibility” noted massey “adobe is always near the top in rankings of a ‘good place to work’ and ‘environmental concern’ they emphasized service of adobe to the community in winning the marconi prize their entrepreneurial leadership was as important as their extraordinary scientific achievements” about the marconi society the marconi society supports scientific achievements in communications and the internet that significantly benefit

in the future okno thanks john warnock  programmers at work programmers at work john warnock john warnock born in  and raised in utah john warnock was educated at the university of utah where he received both a bachelor’s and master’s degree in mathematics and a phd in computer science he switched to computer science at the time dave evans established the famed research and development group to study interactive design and computer graphics at the university of utah after completing his studies warnock tried his hand at being an entrepreneur with a company in vancouver british columbia for a short time then he joined computer sciences of canada and worked in toronto after that he traveled to washington dc where he was employed at the goddard space flight centerin  warnock moved to california to work with dave evans and ivan sutherland on the illiac iv project the nasa space flight shuttle simulator and airplane simulators in  warnock went to xerox parc where he spent four years working in the computer sciences laboratory while at xerox parc warnock worked on improving the typographic quality of computer grayscale displaysin  drs john e warnock and charles m geshchke formed adobe systems to develop software that integrates text and graphics and is also output device independent their effort resulted in postscript adobe system’s first productone can’t help but notice the sign for adobe systems as you enter the company’s office building located in palo alto off of the embarcadero a road dotted with hightech companies the sign is rather large and it shines like gold it is indicative of the success warnock’s company has recently experienced like so many others warnock took his ideas out of xerox parc into the real world where he turned them into a language postscript and a company adobe system’sjohn warnock has a professorial look with a full beard and tousled brown hair he has an unassuming air and a casual manner he wore a tweed jacket a white shirt with an open collar and wool slacks his corner office is impressive with clean lines and a contemporary look i got the impression my visit was one of many warnock has received since his company has met with such success we swapped gripes about being on the road for so long these days the time warnock spends programming is restricted to doing routines with postscript but he remains one of the programming wonders of our time interviewer what was it like at the university of utah computer center while you were there in the midsixties warnock it was quite interesting because dave evans who had been at berkeley got a huge arpa research and development grant for about five million dollars a year to develop interactive design and computer graphics he was able to attract ivan sutherland tom stockham and some other great professors to work with him the computerscience department went from mediocre to really really good practically overnight at that point i switched my studies from mathematics to computer science while still in the mathematics department i had been doing some work for the computer center a service center for the rest of the university creating a studentregistration system one day at work a student of dave evans came along and said “gee i’m trying to solve this hiddensurface problem can you give me any insight into this” and i said “well it seems to me the problem needs to be organized this way” and i proceeded to get really interested in it and coded up the solution that i had in mind my solution reduced by a large order of magnitude the amount of processing that had to go on all of a sudden the computerscience department dragged me in and i became part of their group instantly giving talks all across the country about my work on this hiddensurface problem and the coding solution i came up with sutherland who did sketchpad in  brought a lot of synergy and fresh ideas to this new group at utah this very talented group did an enormous amount of work in a very short amount of time ed catmull who later became head of lucasfilm ltd and jim blinn who does all the incredible jupiter flybys came out of utah martin newell who later worked for xerox parc and is now at cad link was there alan kay his mentor bob borton and patrick boudelier who did a lot of the research work at parc also came out of utah bob taylor was at utah for a while and henry fuchs most of those people were students of dave evans in fact it’s quite remarkable when you look back and realize that the work done by this small group of people at utah made possible the use of computer graphics in films produced by lucasfilm ltd at digital productions and in much of television advertising today interviewer a lot of dave evans’ students went on to become systems designers what do you think makes a good systems designer warnock there are very few really talented designers some people are very good at one particular thing or another but systems design takes real balance taking a list of options here and a list of options there and combining them so they really work well together a lot of people design an algorithm and then design the system around that algorithm good systems design is much more of an engineering activity it’s a set of tradeoffs and balances among various systems’ components i think the most difficult part of systems design is knowing how to make those tradeoffs and balances among the various components interviewer when did you come up with the original idea for the postscript language warnock postscript started in the evans and sutherland days when we were doing a harbor simulator for the maritime academy we had to build a digital model of new york harbor with  buildings and tank farms and all the bridges and buoys and everything–all the landscape the simulator was going to project the view of the harbor as seen from the bridge of the ship we needed to write a huge threedimensional database and a lot of realtime software to make the simulator work the way they wanted it to we had a year to complete this massive undertaking it was a fullcolor model with all three dimensions we decided the most stupid thing we could do was to design this database in a form that would be used directly by the simulator in other words to bind it up too tightly we decided to create a text file and then write a compiler to compile the text file into the form that the simulator would need whenever we decided what that would be we still didn’t know what the simulator was going to look like so we started building this huge database in text form in digitizing the database and in building this big threedimensional model it became very obvious that rather than having a static data structure in the text file it was much more reasonable to have a language it needed to be a very simple easily parsed and extensible language so that’s where the basic ideas of postscript got started in developing a language for this threedimensional graphic database interviewer after working with evans and sutherland you went to xerox parc correct what was your experience like at xerox parc warnock going to parc was very interesting i went there in  and stayed about four years there were several political factions within parc one was the mesa group that previously had done bcpl the mesa group used traditional languages and then there was the ai group which used lisp i worked for taylor’s lab which was the computer sciences laboratory i prefer the lispstyle languages because they’re more interactive and they’re interpreters i like the interpretive environment but it would have been political suicide to use lisp when i belonged to this group because my work would simply have been ignored martin newell and i decided to reimplement the es design system in mesa we called it jam reimplementing the design system took about three months it became an interpretive language that we could use as an experimental workbench to try out all kinds of new ideas after a couple of years when the imaging sciences laboratory broke away from the computer sciences laboratory jam was used as a primary development tool we started hooking in all the graphics procedures to drive the displays and printers then that basic language structure evolved into interpress which is xerox’s printing protocol this same language structure has again been implemented a third time as postscript they’re essentially all the same language it’s really a ten or elevenyearold language that’s had a lot of proving and a lot of reimplementation ideas in the process interviewer what made you focus on the postscript text printing as pect of the language structure warnock well first of all the language property you want for printing is a straightforward syntax postscript is like forth because the syntax is so simple to parse this means that if i want to communicate to another processor all i have to do is send the serial stuff across the wire and it can be consumed by the processor on the other side in a straightforward way another nice benefit of simple syntax is that other computer programs can generate new programs easier the straightforward simple syntax made this language structure a natural candidate for a printing protocol if you want your printing protocol to be procedurally based and to be a programming language as opposed to a static data structure bob sproull and william newman at parc developed a format called press format that consisted of static data structures but they found that it wasn’t the most flexible way to handle printing to add a feature you had to essentially rebuild the system with more features in it we felt it was really important for the printing protocol to be extensible so if you need more features you can use the machinery of the language itself to build the features as opposed to designing them from the beginning you can’t predict what features you’ll want in the future so interpress was a good candidate for a printing protocol chuck and i tried to get xerox to do something reasonable with interpress for two years but it became clear that in the process of getting it out to consumers they were going to destroy it they were going to add some features and take away other features that would make it not only difficult to implement but difficult to maintain and difficult to educate people about we felt that if we were on our own we could create a product in a much more straightforward and reasonable way essentially we took the original clean design and extended it in a number of ways to make it a practical language then we went after printing we chose printing because all the computer companies were trying to do printer products at that time and were dumping a lot of money into research and development to get laser printers to work but they weren’t having a great deal of success most of the products didn’t adapt easily we felt that we could effectively market postscript to the computer companies because it was deviceindependent it avoided dependencies to a specific machine so the computer companies had the flexibility to take on new technology without having to change software we believed this would be perceived as a great value and easy to sell and it has been whereas in the screen business you’re competing against everybody else’s screen package and you have operatingsystems considerations this was a nice clean separate piece of business without a lot of the hassle interviewer in what direction is the postscript language still evolving warnock well for the printing application it probably has slowed down to a crawl now i think it makes sense to go into the screen world and give work stations the model that the printer has there we must adapt it considerably because of the different requirements of the screen the requirements are very highspeed activity for certain kinds of garbagecollecting operations and the memorymanagement tasks aren’t necessarily part of the printer world were writing that code and it’s evolving in that direction interviewer do you still write code warnock oh absolutely almost every day it has a great intellectual value it’s fun interviewer what kind of code do you write now warnock mostly postscript code just making a more elaborate page than the last time or some little utility function i don’t do any of the serious system code around here i get involved a lot in the design aspects and things like that and the general philosophy and direction and how things should be done but i don’t actually sit down and put pen to paper we have people who are a lot better at it than i am it’s much easier to get their brains to work together with mine interviewer is it easier for you to write good code today than it was back ten or twenty years ago warnock the tools are better the programming environments are better the languages are more expressive computers are much more powerful now than ten or twenty years ago but there are more options available which also means more options for many more mistakes interviewer but doesn’t all of your experience make it a lot easier warnock oh yes it’s a tradeoff–all of the experience for the vitality i had when i was younger as i get older perhaps i don’t take as many false steps but i don’t have the strength to get up and run as hard as i used to interviewer do you approach writing code differently today do you have a different method do you plan everything out beforehand warnock i think a lot before i do anything and once i do something i’m not afraid to throw it away it’s very important that a programmer be able to look at a piece of code like a bad chapter of a book and scrap it without looking back never get too enamored with one idea never hang onto anything tenaciously without being able to throw it away when necessary that should be the programmer’s attitude also never make an assumption that you know something somebody else doesn’t know there will always be some smart guy who will come along and figure out a better algorithm or figure out an easier way of performing some task one of the tricks of the trade is to recognize this early adopt it quickly and exploit it without having a “notinventedhere” hangup about doing it your way interviewer what makes for a good program warnock when you run a performance check on a good program the performance looks flat this tells you there are no bottlenecks in the code the balance of the program makes it good it’s not one particular clever trick i’ve been in the business since  so i’ve been writing programs for more than twenty years with lots of experience you collect hundreds of algorithms over the years you remember tricks you’ve learned you remember bugs you’ve had and blind alleys you’ve gone down you remember all the things you’ve done wrong and all the things that have worked out well it’s a matter of picking and choosing from that smorgasbord to make a good menu so to speak to do a given task you can have a great dish here and a great dish there but together they may taste like dog food putting a meal together in a very delicate and sophisticated way is what makes a good cook putting the pieces of a program together in the same way is what makes a good computer programmer interviewer how do you discern a good programmer from an ordinary programmer warnock it’s hard the interview process normally doesn’t distinguish the good programmers from the bad ones it’s like hiring a writer you can’t tell how well someone writes simply from an interview but if the person has written a number of prizewinning novels you have a much better understanding of their talent so we hire most of our people through the grapevine when you’ve been in the business a long time you get to know a lot of the people you can pretty much find who you’re looking for by their reputation in the industry interviewer there aren’t any set rules warnock i have never figured out any the range of personalities and different kinds of talent in this business are just enormous some people are really good at certain kinds of programming and some people are good at other kinds it’s like writing comedy versus writing a serious dramatic novel interviewer when did you get interested in computers and computer programming warnock i had planned on becoming a college professor and teaching mathematics in  near the end of my graduate studies i was looking for a summer job it was late to be looking and the only summer job i could find was recapping tires for firestone working there was hot dirty and incredibly noisy after just three weeks i said “i have a master’s degree in mathematics i don’t need this” i went to the local ibm office and applied for a job they put me through all of their tests and then made me an offer for more money than i had ever heard of ibm sent me to seattle and los angeles for training to become a systems engineer then ibm gave me the two largest accounts in the salt lake district after a while i decided to leave ibm and go back to school at the university of utah to get my doctorate in mathematics then i got married and needed a real job to support myself so i worked at the computer center at the university and that’s what led me into the computerscience field interviewer if you had your education to do over again would you concentrate in mathematics or computer science warnock oh i’ve always liked mathematics problem solving has always been fun my saving grace in life is that i was not introduced to computers at an early age interviewer why wouldn’t it help to learn about computers earlier warnock i went through the university all the way to the master’s level so i got a good solid liberal education i believe it’s really important to have a very solid foundation in mathematics english and the basic sciences then when you become a graduate student it’s okay to learn as much as you can about computers if you really want to be successful being acculturated to the rest of the society and then going into computers is a much more reasonable way to approach the problem i like computers because they let you realize things that you can only put on paper in mathematics you get a tangible result and debugging programs actually getting them to work is fascinating you can finally give the machine a set of parameters and have it come out with the correct answers it’s just great fun it’s very satisfying sort of like mountain climbing it’s like a lot of activities in life when you’re successful at it and you finally get it to work right it feels good and you get a big kick out of it interviewer when you were working at parc did you ever think you would have a business like the one you have today warnock no starting the business was interesting when we first thought about it we thought about what the world could probably use and we concluded that we ought go into the service business we could build electronic printers that personal computers could dial up to do the printing then we went to hambrecht and quist for venture capital but they said the service business was no good the service business is something venture capital people won’t talk to you about it’s very specialized financially and the only way you make money is through franchising it that’s really hard unless you’re gifted at franchising and we weren’t we decided we needed a more traditional business plan we came up with creating a work station with documentpreparation software hooking laser printers and typesetters to that and selling documentation systems this is the same sort of business plan as viewtech interleaf xyvision and texetthe whole list it’s the same business plan that they’ve all had after three months of work and after talking with a couple of major computer companies we decided it was a silly business plan we would have to build a marketing distribution channel and a lightmanufacturing facility essentially we would have to build the whole business and we obviously had no particular expertise in that domain we did have expertise at building a specialized piece of software in demand by computer companies so we switched our business plan and became an oem supplier of software we wouldn’t have to be in manufacturing marketing or distribution and we could service the generalized computer community it has turned out very well interviewer in the future do you see computers basically the same as they are today  or do you see radical changes warnock considering the level of change over the past four or five years i think it’s enormously difficult to predict technological growth has been spectacular in this period for instance five years ago k chips were about all you had and now we’re talking about megabit chips and cd roms i don’t see anything to indicate that the growth is going to slow down today no one can say what the next innovation is going to be the information age is just a giant feedback loop every new tool you get helps you build another tool that’s much better so if anything the growth will probably be more explosive interviewer what role do you think computers will play in society in the future warnock computer literacy will have to become essential people deal with computers every day and don’t realize it there will have to be a corresponding improvement in user interfaces so that people can deal more effectively with machines those go hand in hand society is totally dependent upon technology today and i don’t see any reason why that will ever change interviewer what do you think is going to happen to the publishing industry warnock the publishing industry is adopting technological innovations much more rapidly than i expected i thought this whole process would take years to mature that it would come through a slow evolution into the use of electronicpublishing techniques but it’s happening at an unbelievable rate the heavyduty publishers are accepting the technology immediately the knightridder chain has many laser printers and macintosh computers the gannett newspaper chain has purchased a lot of laser printers the hearst paper chain has bought some and recently we heard that the associated press is sending postscript programs across the wire that’s incredibly gratifying because it’s been just a few months since the laser printers entered the market i thought that kind of acceptance would take many more years as opposed to a few months many businesses are now doing their own newsletters on macintosh computers and laserwriter printers instead of going to traditional typesetters people are seeing the benefit of the new technology the office market the traditional wordprocessing market is going to move fairly quickly to the laser printers for better quality interviewer how long do you think it will be before the quality of output from laser printers will be comparable to typesetters warnock it will be a while certain physical properties of toner particles and other problems make it difficult to get very high resolution typesetters are inherently precise devices that expose very clean edges and it’s very hard to reproduce that xerography has a basic toner particlesize problem to deal with it works with little spots of charge so it’s a matter of how small the charge units can be and still attract toner the quality is good now but if you compare pages done with typesetting and xerography under a magnifying glass you can see that xerography can’t compare yet maybe some of the thermal technologies and inkjet technologies will succeed before xerography typesetters will get cheaper and the quality of xerography will get better xerography will also get cheaper you will see laser printers in the  range in a couple of years i think typewriters using fixedpitch fonts will be replaced by highquality typefaces–at least that’s what i hope interviewerwhat’s the secret of success in this industry warnock to be successful you want to surround yourself with very talented folks whose skills blend very well that’s the secret of success interviewer what is your approach to programming warnock i don’t know if there’s a single set of things i’ve touched on some don’t bind early don’t ever make decisions earlier than you have to stay an order of magnitude more general than you think you need because you will end up needing it in the long term get something working very quickly and then be able to throw it away learn from small experiments rather than large ones don’t go into a twoyear development with nothing coming out in the middle have something come out every two months so you can evaluate regroup and restart often programmers overdefine their approach from the beginning they may start out with a central idea and begin coding on day one then they find that they have a concentricring approach where everything starts to grow because of the dependency on so many other factors but if you keep the process fairly loose and free and move quickly at the end you get a much better product in the long term interviewer why do you think you’re in software instead of hardware warnock it’s probably the mathematician in me i prefer the abstract i would rather play with ideas and combinations of ideas than combinations of objects i was never very mechanical interviewer what do you like about writing software warnock it’s always challenging i look at software writing like authorship like normal writing you’re trying to combine ideas and concepts in a way that will make other people think that will be new and exciting the software business is like the publishing business you’re trading ideas that’s your commodity i like it because i’m moderately good at it and i’ve had success in thinking of some new ideas along the line that’s a great kick interviewer what would you pinpoint as the new ideas you’ve thought of for software warnock the most obvious is the original hiddenline work i did at utah it was fairly original at the time and a lot of programs have been built on top of it i really get a kick out of solving something that looks hard and making it look easy that was ivan sutherland’s great claim to fame he could dissect any problem pull it apart and make it look easy he was very good at that kind of work i also enjoy having people use the things i create i was very frustrated at xerox because i’d see great products coming out in the marketplace and i knew that i could do the same thing now to pick up a magazine and leaf through it and see pictures and advertisements clone on a laserwriter is a great kick i really enjoy seeing other people use the fruits of my labor that’s the ultimate satisfaction interviewer what’s your work routine do you work mostly at your office or home warnock i do work at home but i also work at the office and travel a lot i talk to customers and i speak at conferences right now my function is a combination of doing some inside work and a lot of outside work interviewer has owning your own business changed your life in a significant way warnock yes in the first year and a half i worked almost totally on development getting everything to work now the project has gone into a marketing public relations and customersupport phase most of my daily activity is meeting people and dealing with corporations talking to vps within corporations and signing contracts but it’s all fun it’s a little different this year than it was last year and last year was a little different from the year before that’s what life’s all about interviewer how many people were working on postscript during the development period warnock postscript probably took twenty manyears to develop it’s a fairly substantial piece of code when you consider all the fonts in the laserwriter we blew half a megabyte of rom and none of it could be wrong it’s all cast in concrete going out with every machine i think that’s one of the larger single pieces of code ever put into rom getting the testing done was a shaky period around here interviewer what was the biggest problem faced in the development of postscript warnock as with most projects the last  percent takes  percent of the time getting the code to completely hold together took a while then you have to be sure you can exercise it by all the communication protocols that you can have all the interrupts and everything and that it doesn’t break interviewer do you prefer any language in general warnock people around here are experienced enough so they don’t necessarily prefer one thing over another we use whatever has the most reasonable environment and set of compilers those are the considerations computer languages are computer languages once you’ve learned a half dozen the next half dozen aren’t very hard to learn interviewer why do you think there are so few languages being used by designers today warnock there’s no motivation to have a great variety some people take certain design lines as mesa took a particular design line but they felt that the problem was getting thirty or forty programmers to write a huge system together so it was designed to aid in that process if you believe good software is written that way that might be a language you would design but i believe good software is written by small teams of two three or four people interacting with each other at a very high dense level the best pieces of code come out of those kinds of effort i would try to make the system so it would be impossible to get twenty people involved interviewer is that because there are too many different ideas or too many ways of approaching a design warnock there are too many styles and interfaces i once heard that any programs you write reflect the organization in which you work at parc the computer sciences laboratory was an incredibly flat structure with bob taylor at the top but they had to have a common tool for this diverse group because there were about thirty people designing this one huge programming system so mesa and its programming environment modeled the way parc worked adobe was started as a very small company with about a half dozen people the code was written by a half dozen people and the structure shows it certain parts belong to person x and certain parts belong to person y and they all have their own character and their own interfaces on the other hand ibm is a huge organization and their code is convoluted with self feedbacks and different strategies that reflect separate divisions of the company a fairly standard rule is that if you want to keep something simple then the organization that develops it has to be simple interviewer what happens when little companies grow up into huge corporations warnock the trick is to learn from the hewlettpackard approach keep it as twenty different small companies keep breaking it up and never let it become a huge organization except at some level that nobody cares about in terms of working relationships keep the number of people small and their focus localized projectoriented so they can work at their best that would be my goal interviewer before computers what did mathematicians do warnock a lot of mathematics actually i really don’t know whether mathematics is as good as it was ten years ago there probably has been a huge drain on the number of mathematicians in the world it seems that some of the early theory the best theoretical work on computers was done in the fifties the best mathematics of computation was done before the advent of computers mathematicians laid much of the groundwork of what could and couldn’t be done in computers i don’t know if there is any good theoretical work in computing being done now i guess there is but there are none of the huge major breakthroughs that occurred earlier interviewer do you consider computer science a science warnock no not really it’s more of an engineering discipline a very good fruitful engineering discipline to me science is postulating hypotheses and doing experiments to create models in the world computers have nothing to do with that they are selffulfilling prophecies about a model of the world they’re great information tools they’re great artifacts of the society for manipulating and controlling information but i don’t know what truth

search world search innovation adobe cofounder john warnock on the competitive advantages of aesthetics and the ‘right’ technology jan   north america photo by kendall whitehouse twitter facebook linkedin google email print comment quote twitter facebook linkedin google email print comment quote supports kws innovation content john warnock’s sense of aesthetics — his love of visual design and fine typography — is evident as soon you step inside his home in the entryway is an elegant stone carving of the latin alphabet a page from an illuminated manuscript is displayed in the corner of the living room that sense of aesthetics combined with a strong belief “in doing things right” technically has driven adobe systems — the company warnock founded with charles “chuck” geshcke — throughout much of its history this passion convinced warnock to focus on the company’s acrobat product line even though the market initially showed little interest and adobe’s own board of directors sought to kill the product warnock’s instincts proved accurate in this instance after years of floundering acrobat later grew to become one of adobe’s most profitable products yet that vision of what is technically and aesthetically “right” has also blinded the company to some of the major shifts in technology during the rise of the web adobe sat on the sidelines longer than most companies partly because as warnock characterizes it “early versions of html — from a design point of view — were awful” given these steadfast views it is perhaps surprising that much of adobe’s competitive strategy has long depended on a delicate balance between publicly documenting its intellectual property and gaining a competitive advantage through proprietary software this approach has led the company to establish several of the key standards for print and interactive publishing the postscript printer language acrobat’s portable document format pdf and the flash format the company gained from its acquisition of macromedia in  adobe has generated significant revenue by selling software tools to create and modify these openly published file formats knowledgewharton recently met with adobe systems cofounder and cochairman john warnock in his home in los altos calif to talk about the company’s history and its business strategy as well as topics like why he avoids using microsoft software and why he believes apple ceo steve jobs should reengage a partnership with adobe and make flash available on the iphone an edited version of that conversation follows knowledgewharton how did you first meet adobe cofounder chuck geschke warnock i was working for computer graphics firm evans  sutherland in the bay area and they wanted to give me a promotion and move me back to salt lake city my wife and i decided we didn’t want to do that i had a friend william newman at xerox parc palo alto research center he asked around and chuck’s name came up as starting a new endeavor at the parc so chuck and i met on a job interview he was about to start a lab called the imaging sciences laboratory they built the first version of a personal computer in the xerox alto and had the beginnings of graphic user interfaces they were going to the next generation machine and all of the stuff they had done was very machinespecific i was chartered with building the deviceindependent data representation for dealing with graphics knowledgewharton was this for the screen or for hardcopy warnock both they had started using laser printers and xerox’s printing protocols were not terribly flexible — they had very very specific bitmaps fixed resolution images that they used for fonts they were okay for producing letters and reports but they could not deal with sophisticated graphics at evans  sutherland john gaffney and i developed a language called the design system that ran on digital equipment corp pdps it was an interpretive language and had the same syntax and structure that postscript ended up having i decided that i needed an interactive interpretive tool bench at parc to do my experiments so i reimplemented the design system with martin newell we added all the graphic operators so we could do graphics and test out ideas on screens and different medium we called it jam for “john and martin” xerox was then starting development with the star computer workstation and they needed a printer protocol i proposed using jam as a framework for a printer protocol we got five designers into the process butler lampson bob sproull jerry mendelson chuck and myself over a twoyear period we designed the xerox printer protocol interpress knowledgewharton why did you and geschke decide to leave xerox parc to form your own company warnock we sold interpress throughout the xerox organization for two years they said “oh we love it we’ll make it a standard we are going to put the locks on it and wait until all of our printers can do this before we release it” chuck and i found this totally unacceptable and realized “that will never happen in our lifetime” the only way to make standards is to get them out and just compete i went into chuck’s office one day and said “chuck we can stay at a very cushy wonderful job here or we could try to get something done why don’t i get on an airplane go talk to dave evans my old thesis adviser and get some advice from him evans introduced us to investment banker bill hambrecht who said “sure let’s go for it” we founded adobe on december   —  years ago knowledgewharton you mentioned making postscript a standard was that a practical need — because you needed software to support your printer or was it a strategic business decision warnock we felt that if we wanted this broadly adopted that we had to do exactly the opposite of what xerox wanted to do we had to publish it we had to make it very very open — because the trick was to get both software application developers and operating system developers to support it without documentation that was never going to happen knowledgewharton you said that your goal was to make postscript very very open there was one aspect of it that wasn’t so open postscript’s “type ” font format was initially a proprietary secret warnock yes knowledgewharton what drove the decision to keep that secret — was it a requirement of your font vendors or was it to give you a competitive edge warnock there were two major technological developments that made postscript successful the first was that this was the first time a full programming language had been used to control a printer there was a very strategic reason to do that most software application programs have their own model of how they work and typically it’s not the way that the printer wants to work this was true with apple apple had the macintosh graphics system quickdraw and they had their own model for how quickdraw worked the strategy was to write a program that would interpret quickdraw but load the program into the printer as a postscript program and let the printer do the work of transforming the quickdraw graphics into the image that way all the quickdraw applications could work out of the gate the same was true with some of the early word processors the second technological development was the font problem the highest resolution printers at that time were  spots to the inch if you represented characters as outlines the obvious way the fonts looked terrible the sampling artifacts the side effects of digitization were horrendous we knew that no publication or office environment would live with that we had to solve the font problem stanford university computer scientist don knuth worked on it for years and years and years trying to get good looking fonts for tex digital typesetting software and he never succeeded i had a sort of backward idea of how to do it if you put down the outline of the character on a low resolution device the rasters the lines the device is able to render don’t line up — you will get some staffs that are pixels wide and some that are  it makes the fonts look horrible the very simple idea is rather than figuring out what dots to turn on you stretch the characters so that they line up with the rasters so if you had the left side of the letter ‘n’ and the right side of the ‘n’ — all you have to do is make sure that they are in phase with the frequency of the rasters and then cache that character that guarantees that all the staffs are uniform thickness and all the xheights hit at the right place it turned awful looking fonts into incredible looking fonts we never published it because it is such a simple idea that if you applied for a patent everyone could figure a workaround knowledgewharton why not document this feature as you did the rest of the postscript language warnock because then everyone could do what we could do knowledgewharton so you saw this as a strategic advantage warnock oh yes this was kept as a company trade secret for years knowledgewharton keeping it a secret worked for a while then in september of  two of your biggest competitors microsoft and apple teamed up to create an alternate font format — what later became truetype — as well as market a postscript clone printer how did you first hear of this plan warnock it all transpired within about two weeks before the september  seybold conference we found out from jeanlouis gassée at apple jeanlouis wanted his imprint on apple and he wanted to remove all imprints of steve jobs steve was very closely associated with postscript and the laserwriter in some sense jeanlouis wanted to reinvent all of that from my point of view it was totally an ego thing he got together with microsoft we talked to bill gates and said “this is totally stupid we will open up the details of the font format” microsoft at that point perceived us as a threat they said “no we’re going to compete with you” we essentially just outinvented them we got atm adobe type manager working for screen resolutions postscript’s type  fonts have always been in my opinion a better solution than truetype at one point we had  postscript competitors there were  clones out there that were trying to undercut us in the market and as far as i know not one of them succeeded — including microsoft’s i think they produced exactly one printer of which they sold zero it was a disaster knowledgewharton with postscript such a success why did adobe then move into desktop software warnock postscript was an enormously profitable product it was growing like crazy but during its maximum growth i said “you know if we don’t start doing other products we are going to be a oneproduct company we are going to diversify as painful this is we are going to take intellectual resources off of postscript and put them on things like illustrator” so we started the illustrator project then we got approached by john and thomas knoll in  and we licensed photoshop — which ran on a a k mac and a mb disk i knew that machines would get faster and memory would get cheaper but i had no idea that it would go to the extent that it has i said “look i know that photography is going to become important” so i made the decision to license photoshop in the mids the knoll brothers said “photoshop is going to run out of gas” we offered to buy it and gave them a lump sum payment to buy photoshop little did they know that photoshop would continue to blossom and grow knowledgewharton how did the idea for pdf adobe acrobat’s portable document format emerge knowledgewharton high school warnock in the early s we were starting to use local area networks more sending postscript files around was not terribly compelling so i started to think about the problem there is a property of postscript that made acrobat possible every one of the operators postscript’s basic commands can be redefined if you take all the graphic operators and define them so that they output just the parameters you get a static file of all the graphics that are in a postscript file — but the pages have all been delimited everything is now a data structure as opposed to a program in other words we flatten out the program to make a very simple file that program is also very very efficient all the computing has been distilled out of it — hence the name of the acrobat creation tool “distiller” i first used this trick with postscript when steve jobs had this tax form that he wanted to use as a demo it used to take two minutes to print on the classic laserwriter because there was so much computing involved i wrote a basic version of the distiller in the early s that would flatten the file and make it an efficient postscript file which got the execution down from a couple of minutes to  seconds steve was delighted because he could now demo this thing i said “let’s take this basic idea and write out a file and see if it works on the screen with a reasonable performance” and it did the piece of code that they used you would never use to build a product we got our best architects and said “we need to build this into a file format that really has legs under it” if video or other media types come along we want this format to stand the test of time and be really extensible so we got our best engineers to design the pdf file format the other problem we had to solve was font substitution we didn’t have all the licenses to ship fonts with the electronic document if the receiver of the document didn’t have the right font you still wanted the layout to be exactly right so i invented a variation of the type solution so that you could vary the widths of the typefaces with these specially designed fonts to make substitution fonts if i had times roman i could import the widths table of times roman and generate characters so that they would fit exactly the same way times roman did we put that into the early versions of pdf knowledgewharton acrobat didn’t take off at first warnock when acrobat was announced the world didn’t get it they didn’t understand how important sending documents around electronically was going to be we met with someone from the gartner group who said “this is the dumbest idea i’ve ever heard in my life” but i said “no people have been trying to figure out universal document formats for decades and no one has succeeded the reason we can succeed is that we don’t have to ask anybody’s permission no one has to do any development we can capture the postscript files and convert any postscript file into a pdf file and no one has to say this is a good idea or a bad idea we can just make it a fait accompli” when i described acrobat to ibm executives i said “there is a trick you can use to capture all the printout and make it into a device independent thing that you can ship around networks” they absolutely didn’t get it they were into the semantic markup languages sgml and xml and those levels of abstraction in some sense the gartner group was in the sgml world where you need to have this differentiation between the rendition and the semantic intent i said “it’s easy to add that afterwards if you have the page it is much easier to start with something that actually works and back out into the applications than it is to get applications to change” knowledgewharton in some ways that tension between presentation and structure persisted throughout much of adobe’s history warnock absolutely and that was a battle that i was always happy to take on knowledgewharton despite this sluggish start you continued to support acrobat warnock adobe’s board wanted to kill it i said “there’s just no way this is solving an important problem and we are going to hang in there until it works” knowledgewharton acrobat reader  cost between  and  a seat depending on volume by version  it was free was that a difficult choice to make inside the company warnock very risky choice — because we then had to rely on the creation process for any revenue stream but it was the right decision knowledgewharton around this time the web started to take off adobe took a while to get on board with the rise of the web why do you think that was warnock we had a lot invested in doing things right the early versions of html — from a design point of view — were awful there was nothing beautiful about it you had different browsers that displayed web pages differently adobe always prided itself on making software that ran the same way on a pc the mac or any other operating system we didn’t plunge into “well here is what the web is — let’s just go get it” instead we were always searching for “how can we do this right how can we build a better infrastructure” knowledgewharton shortly afterwards you made a couple of major acquisitions with aldus and later framemaker what drove those warnock in the case of aldus it was just getting a jumpstart into document production in the case with framemaker the framemaker architecture was infinitely better — infinitely better — than the aldus architecture i could never get anybody except the exframe employees at adobe to understand that the architecture was fundamentally more sound in framemaker than in aldus the aldus side won essentially with the development of adobe’s page layout product indesign we’re still trying to catch up to framemaker knowledgewharton in the summer of  when most technology companies were booming adobe went through a difficult period your sales stalled your stock price slumped and one of your major competitors — quark — tried to acquire you what happened warnock i think the cause was we didn’t have a good story on the web our customers and everybody wondered what the relationship of adobe was going to be with the web we really didn’t have our act together unfortunately chuck and i had talked about “at some point we have to retire so we should hire some management that could be potential successors” — which was the worst decision it was the stupidest thing we had an executive team that wouldn’t work together no matter how many times we pounded the table saying “you have to cooperate” they built their little political silos and power empires within their own groups we had to fire the whole bunch of them at one point we fired everybody we promoted bruce chizen we said “look we just have to have a whole different view of how we interact with wall street how we interact with each other we have to be perfectly candid about what we are going to accomplish and do it — and announce it to the street ahead of time” we changed our strategy we said what we were we were going to do over the next year and we executed on it the company completely changed bruce was very very good he had come up inside of adobe and he was very good at working with the various groups we essentially cleaned house knowledgewharton what drove your decision to step down from the ceo role in  warnock bruce chizen was a very strong candidate i was getting on i had to retire at some point i wanted to travel and enjoy some of the success and do other things being a ceo of a company that is over  billion is not all it is cracked up to be the thing i really enjoy is the invention process i enjoy figuring out how to do things other people don’t know how to do as ceo you’re dealing with employment suits and with reporting to the irs and the early parts of sarbanesoxley and you know life is too short knowledgewharton how actively involved were you in the acquisition of macromedia in  warnock bruce really wanted to do that he saw a strategic fit and i concurred it was really one of the best acquisitions we have done we got in the process adobe chief technology officer kevin lynch who is a pure inventor — great guy very visionary knowledgewharton adobe has now introduced cloudbased services such as buzzword and photoshopcom which are available for free what motivated these warnock the monetization strategy is changing for the longest time you tried to get adobe to look at different business models getting companies to change when they know how to do something really well is difficult adobe was sort of a welloiled machine in this software arena and getting them to think about doing business differently was challenging we have a saying around adobe that the antibodies will kill off any new idea companies build antibodies they build resistance to change they get comfort zones where they want to work and employees don’t want to try something new for fear that they are going to fail so they reject ideas one of the hardest things about keeping a company innovative is killing off the antibodies and forcing change knowledgewharton speaking of change it was reported that you were actively involved in the recent omniture acquisition warnock yes we tracked it and chuck and i met with josh james who was head of omniture i use the web i use all the products everyday i build websites i try things from google like adsense i try to look at the world from a customer point of view in terms of what you need to solve your problems most of the time there isn’t something out there so this is a market opportunity knowledgewharton what problem is omniture solving warnock when you have a website one of the things you really want to know is how people interact with that website where do they go what do they find interesting what gets them from one point to another adobe now makes almost all the tools everybody uses to build their websites if in that website building process you got automatic tooling for measuring things then you could find out all of the interactions that people have with the website if they are changing the color of a tshirt do they change it more to orange or do they change it more to navy blue what do they do when they interact with the images you want to know that information because that makes you figure out better products knowledgewharton over the years adobe’s strategy seems to be trying to strike a balance between open source initiatives and proprietary software adobe has a history of being somewhere in the middle by having open file formats around which you develop proprietary software warnock yes knowledgewharton was this a conscious choice warnock it was a conscious choice i guess we were egoistic enough to believe that we knew how to implement things better than other people adobe has participated in standards bodies standards bodies are horrible horrible horrible things they design by committee the things that come out of them are a hodgepodge of stuff if you look at html — oh man knowledgewharton over the years microsoft has been a frequent and intense competitor of yours but in most markets it hasn’t succeeded warnock no knowledgewharton why not warnock you know i’ve always believed that microsoft has never had good taste i try to avoid using their software whenever possible because i find it jarring to the sensibilities knowledgewharton and you think that has hurt them competitively warnock yes they have attempted in their ads to represent themselves as cool but they aren’t it’s just not cool stuff knowledgewharton have you looked at microsoft’s silverlight and how it compares to flash warnock yes we looked at silverlight on paper it looked like it would probably be a competitive threat but i don’t think they have executed well flash now finally has topography in it it’s got all the things that now make it a real adobe product that has the depth that it needs and i think the new strategy with air the adobe integrated runtime crossplatform software application platform is right on cloud computing is fine — except if you are dealing with large stuff and with computeintensive things like graphics air gives you an application that is on your desktop but it has full access to the web and full access to the file system — which is actually the best of all possible worlds in my opinion knowledgewharton another company that you have interacted with a long time is apple that relationship seems to have ebbed and flowed over the years they were originally a very close partner — one of your first oems original equipment manufacturers warnock yes knowledgewharton but now there is a lot of contention around getting flash on the iphone warnock oh yes knowledgewharton have you talked to steve jobs about that warnock no i haven’t knowledgewharton have you thought about calling him warnock i’ve thought about calling him and saying “steve you know at this point you want might to engage the partnership again” because i think otherwise he is going to get some competitive pressures from outside that he is not going to like he has never been great at hitting that middle ground between openness and proprietary products he has always seemed to lean to the proprietary side to want to own everything i think this is one case where he probably would do better if he didn’t do that knowledgewharton yet the vertical integration between the iphone the mac and the itunes store has been key to apple’s success but you think that long term that will run out of steam warnock well he will keep inventing steve is great steve is one of the truly great innovators who sees a path goes to the path and does it with great taste i love his phone knowledgewharton but you would love it more if it had flash warnock well you could go to more websites and you could do more things and he could get more applications — not that he needs them knowledgewharton looking back over your entire career what are you most proud of warnock from a technical side — postscript and acrobat knowledgewharton what surprised you most about the evolution of these technologies — postscript and pdf warnock the fact that there was this whole cult group that fell in love with postscript and making postscript programs that was a little surprising it’s a “write once” language it’s not terribly selfdocumenting it is very hard to figure out what is going on knowledgewharton is there anything you would do differently if you could warnock i think if we did anything differently we would have missed one of those magic paths and from a stock point of view adobe is the most successful stock i have ever owned i don’t know that i would have done anything differently i wish i would have had some of the insight about where you find people to manage your company i wish i had that insight earlier knowledgewharton now that you’ve stepped down from the ceo role how do you spend your time warnock i am on the boards of little companies trying to help them i’m programming and i build websites i try to do things with the products that nobody has done before knowledgewharton some of the boards you have been on are publishing and media companies knightridder salon the american film institute and sundance warnock i wanted to find out about the media space so i joined the knightridder board to find out how that works how they see the world i joined the american film institute and sundance to try to understand the world of the movies knowledgewharton these are areas facing a number of difficulties warnock at the first board meeting at knightridder i said “you guys need to decide whether you are in the communication business or in the newspaper business” and i said “if you decide that you are in the newspaper business you’re toast” knowledgewharton what does it mean for them to be a communications company versus a newspaper company warnock it means that they are doing the same thing but they have to go through a drastic monetary model change a drastic business model change newspapers and magazines are capitalintensive businesses that buy a lot of newsprint buy a lot of paper buy a lot of presses those big capital investments protected them from competition in the world of the internet that is not what protects you from competition being light on your feet being innovative being new into a space is what is going to win because the whole economic model is gone knowledgewharton the fear is there is no economic model on the other side of the fence either warnock but you know at some point you have to make a leap of faith that either there is one or you are going to be out of business no matter what you can’t cling to the past supports kws innovation content citing knowledgewharton

object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump
