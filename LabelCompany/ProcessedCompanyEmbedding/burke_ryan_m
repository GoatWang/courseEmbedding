waves of energy there are  main types of radiationnonionizing radiation which is not considered dangerous ionizing radiation which in high levels or large doses can be harmful to cellseven so at lower levels nonionizing radiation can have several highly beneficial uses in medical care  for example we use ionizing radiation in controlled ways to help create diagnostic images such as xrays ct scans and nuclear scans radiation can also in the treatment of some cancers our goal is to avoid unnecessary patient exposure can i avoid radiation you cannot avoid radiation entirely ionizing radiation comes from cosmic rays that reach us from space and also from radioactive elements present in rocks and soil you can minimize your exposure to ionizing radiation but not eliminate it the low level of radiation that we are exposed to at all times in our environment is known as “background” radiation are medical xrays dangerous most medical xrays use small amounts of ionizing radiation a standard chest xray for example uses approximately the same amount of ionizing radiation as  days of natural background radiation which we are all exposed to in daytoday life a mammogram has similar amounts of radiation exposure as  months of natural background radiationct scans use more radiation and the amount depends on how much of the body is scanned for example a ct scan of the head is equivalent to several months of normal background radiation while a ct scan of the pelvis and abdomen may be similar to several years of natural background radiation even then a ct scan can be lifesaving when used appropriately however repeated ct scans may increase cancer risk do the risks of using diagnostic images or radiation therapy outweigh the benefits in most instances the diagnostic value of an xray or ct scan is considered well worth the small risk associated with the amount of radiation delivered no single test can significantly increase a person’s lifetime chance of developing cancer however if someone has previously had radiation treatments or many ct scans over the course of a lifetime this can add up to a risk factor that may be taken into account before ordering additional tests and procedureswe work hard to ensure that our imaging machines only use the lowest effective dose of radiation to get the images we need what can i do the help prevent unnecessary radiation exposure ask if there are safe alternatives to ordering tests especially the higher dosage ct scans if you are tempted to ask your doctor for a test consider the possible risks remember that in many conditions the test results are unlikely to change the treatment and many tests show unimportant abnormalities that may require additional testing and even more unnecessary radiation exposure if a diagnostic test is strongly recommended it is done so with good reason for example the small radiation exposure of regular mammograms in women may save lives by detecting early curable breast cancer we will work closely with you to help make sure you get only the essential tests you need and help you avoid unnecessary radiation exposure can an ultrasound during pregnancy hurt my unborn baby no ultrasound imaging uses sound waves not xrays or ionizing radiation the ultrasound cannot harm an unborn baby during pregnancy can an xray during pregnancy hurt my unborn baby in general xray exposure from a single diagnostic procedure does not result in harmful effects to the baby this is also true if you receive an xray before you know you are pregnant however we make every effort to avoid any xray procedures in women who are pregnant if you continue to have concerns be sure to discuss these concerns with us what is a nuclear scan nuclear scans involve swallowing or injecting a tiny amount of radioactive material that acts as a tracking dye or coloring inside the body the radioactivity allows a special camera to detect abnormalities or problems in targeted areas of the body such as bones or organs the amount of ionizing radiation in a typical dose of nuclear medicine is very small and passes through the body in a few days if i am breastfeeding can nuclear medicine enter breast milk certain types of nuclear medicine may affect a mother’s breast milk for a short period of time typically  to  hours many lactating mothers use a breast pump before a nuclear imaging study so that they can bottle feed breast milk to their babies for a few days following a nuclear medicine test can radiation therapy used to treat cancer cause more cancer the type of radiation used to destroy cancer cells is ionizing radiation during treatments the radiation is focused as much as possible on the cancer cells and avoids healthy tissue however there is some risk that radiation therapy may increase a person’s chances for developing a second cancer years later or other problems do cell phones and other technology create harmful radiation current evidence suggests that cell phone use does not pose a significant health hazard in terms or radiation exposure radio waves power lines cell phones cell phone towers tv screens computer monitors and microwave ovens all emit lowfrequency nonionizing radiation which is not considered a health hazardairport security scanners emit a very tiny amount of ionizing radiation – about onethousandth of a standard chest xray ionizing radiation may be used to kill harmful germs on irradiated food but the food itself does not remain radioactivecigarettes and tobacco products however do contain low levels of ionizing radiation that come from the soil and may significantly increase smokers’ exposure to radiation over time can too much sun cause cancers other than skin cancer no because the sun’s ultraviolet rays – which are the ones that can potentially cause skin cancer – are not strong enough to penetrate through the skin however ultraviolet radiation used in tanning beds and sun lamps can increase the risk of skin cancer should i take iodine pills to protect myself from radiation exposure no iodine pills also known as potassium iodide decrease or even shut down thyroid function which can cause many problems if an emergency situation arises health officials will advise the public about the best and safest ways to prevent radiation exposure managing my care online how can i manage my or my family’s care online act for a family member we
