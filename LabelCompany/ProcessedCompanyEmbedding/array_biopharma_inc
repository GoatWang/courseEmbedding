cancer introduction  brief description binimetinib is an oral smallmolecule mek inhibitor invented by array mek is a key protein kinase in the rasrafmekerk pathway which regulates several key cellular activities including proliferation differentiation migration survival and angiogenesis inappropriate activation of this pathway has been shown to occur in many cancers in particular through mutations in braf kras and nras there are two phase  trials with binimetinib in advanced cancer patients columbus encorafenib in combination with binimetinib in brafmutant melanoma and beacon crc encorafenib binimetinib and erbitux® cetuximab in brafmutant colorectal cancer   in june  array submitted two ndas to the fda to support use of the combination of binimetinib  mg twice daily and encorafenib  mg once daily combo for the treatment of patients with brafmutant advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma the submissions are supported by data from the pivotal phase  columbus study which showed that patients who received binimetinib and encorafenib had a significantly longer progression free survival pfs compared to patients receiving vemurafenib   columbus results as presented at the  society for melanoma research annual congress results from part  of the columbus study showed that combo significantly extend pfs in patients with advanced brafmutant melanoma with a pfs of  months compared with  months observed with vemurafenib hazard ratio hr   ci  p as part of the trial design the primary analysis was based on a blinded independent central review bicr of patient scans while

mekbrafinhibitor treatments for patients receiving combo included rash  pyrexia  retinal pigment epithelial detachment  and photosensitivity   full safety results of columbus part  were presented at the  society for melanoma research annual congress columbus part  was designed specifically to assess the contribution of binimetinib to the combination of binimetinib and encorafenib by reducing the dose of encorafenib to mg in the combination arm to allow for a comparison of equal doses across arms in columbus part  the primary analysis compared pfs in patients treated with binimetinib mg twice

solid tumors and hematologic malignancies  importantly array is collaborating with merck and bristolmyers squibb to study binimetinib plus antipd therapy in patients with microsatellite stable metastatic crc mss crc   brafmutant melanoma  metastatic melanoma is the most serious and lifethreatening type of skin cancer and is associated with low survival rates only about  of people will survive for at least five years following a diagnosis with latestage disease there are about  new cases of melanoma diagnosed worldwide each year approximately half of which have braf mutations a key target in the treatment of metastatic melanoma  brafmutant colorectal cancer worldwide colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in men and the second most common in women with approximately  million new diagnoses in  of these nearly  were diagnosed in men and  in women globally in  approximately  deaths were attributed to colorectal cancer in the us alone an estimated  patients will be diagnosed with cancer of the colon or rectum in  and approximately  are estimated to die of their disease there is wide variation in year survival rates across the globe with year survival expected to be around  in the developed world and dropping to around  in some developing countries in the united states braf mutations occur in  to  percent of patients with colorectal cancer

antagonist designed to treat patients with thdriven allergic diseases  the crth receptor is expressed on th t cells basophils and eosinophils and its ligand prostaglandin d pgd is released by mast cells  results of a phase  study with arry in patients with mild to moderate thdriven asthma demonstrate that antagonism of the pgdcrth axis results in significant improvements in lung function asthma control symptoms and patientreported qualityoflife outcomes  arry provided control of allergic inflammation and clinically meaningful benefit to these asthma patients  because current asthma therapies do not fully control the th pathophysiology antagonism of crth represents an exciting new approach to enhance disease control in asthma and other allergic inflammatory diseases  based on its mechanism of action arry will provide the greatest patient benefit in a th signatureenriched population  several baseline threlated biomarkers were evaluated in the phase  study including fractional exhaled nitric oxide feno  the th signature which is present in about half of the asthma population spans mild moderate and severe disease and suggests broad applicability for arry in these patients as well as in other thdriven diseases such as allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis  array is seeking a partner for further development of arry  about asthma it is estimated that approximately  million people in the united states have asthma causing significant morbidity and mortality  the worldwide estimates are approximately  million people with  deaths annually  mild to moderate persistent allergic asthma represents more than  million patients in the us and while only  of all asthmatics are considered severe they are responsible for a disproportionate share of asthmarelated expenditures due to frequent exacerbations that result in emergency room visits and hospitalization  despite the range of available asthma treatments there remains a significant need for a convenient safe and

aslan initiated a phase b trial to evaluate safety of the combination of varlintinib with standard of car chemotherapy in patients with first line gastric cancer  pending appropriate results aslan intends to begin a randomized phase b study in gastric cancer and is exploring the use of varlintinib in other indications aslan is funding and developing varlintinib through clinical proofofconcept upon achievement of proofofconcept aslan will identify a global partner for phase  development and commercialization array will share a significant portion of the proceeds of such partnering transaction  gastric cancer is a major public health problem in east asia patients with locally advanced metastatic or recurrent disease have a poor prognosis with an overall median survival of approximately  months egfr and her receptors are commonly overexpressed together in gastric cancer data from pivotal studies of herceptin® trastuzumab indicate that the activity of this drug is

go binimetinib mektarget mek  indication melanoma and colorectal cancer introduction  brief description binimetinib is an oral smallmolecule mek inhibitor invented by array mek is a key protein kinase in the rasrafmekerk pathway which regulates several key cellular activities including proliferation differentiation migration survival and angiogenesis inappropriate activation of this pathway has been shown to occur in many cancers in particular through mutations in braf kras and nras there are two phase  trials with binimetinib in advanced cancer patients columbus encorafenib in combination with binimetinib in brafmutant melanoma and beacon crc encorafenib binimetinib and erbitux® cetuximab in brafmutant colorectal cancer   in june  array submitted two ndas to the fda to support use of the combination of binimetinib  mg twice daily and encorafenib  mg once daily combo for the treatment of patients with brafmutant advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma the submissions are supported by data from the pivotal phase  columbus study which showed that patients who received binimetinib and encorafenib had a significantly longer progression free survival pfs compared to patients receiving vemurafenib   columbus results as presented at the  society for melanoma research annual congress results from part  of the columbus study showed that combo significantly extend pfs in patients with advanced brafmutant melanoma with a pfs of  months compared with  months observed with vemurafenib hazard ratio hr   ci  p as part of the trial design the primary analysis was based on a blinded independent central review bicr of patient scans while results by local review at the investigative site were also analyzed the table below outlines the median pfs mpfs results as determined by both assessments for combo versus vemurafenib combo versus encorafenib and encorafenib versus vemurafenib     mpfs bicr   mpfs local review combo vs vemurafenib    combo vemurafenib

with a median duration of treatment of  weeks and median relative dose intensity for encorafenib and binimetinib of  and  respectively grade  adverse events aes that occurred in more than  of patients receiving combo were increased blood creatine phosphokinase ck  increased gammaglutamyltransferase ggt  and hypertension  the incidence of any grade of aes of special interest defined based on toxicities commonly associated with commercially available mekbrafinhibitor treatments for patients receiving combo included rash  pyrexia  retinal pigment epithelial detachment  and photosensitivity   full safety results of columbus part  were presented at the  society for melanoma research annual congress columbus part  was designed specifically to assess the contribution of binimetinib to the combination of binimetinib and encorafenib by reducing the dose of encorafenib to mg in the combination arm to allow for a comparison of equal doses across arms in columbus part  the primary analysis compared pfs in patients treated with binimetinib mg twice daily plus encorafenib mg daily combo to patients treated with encorafenib mg daily as a single agent  topline results showed the mpfs for patients treated with combo was  months compared to  months for patients treated with single agent encorafenib with hr of   ci  p combo was generally welltolerated and reported dose intensity and aes were consistent with combo results in columbus part  further results from columbus part  will be presented at the  esmo congress in addition to these registration trials earlystage studies have been initiated or announced to evaluate binimetinib in numerous solid tumors and hematologic malignancies  importantly array is collaborating with merck and bristolmyers squibb to study binimetinib plus antipd therapy in patients with microsatellite stable metastatic crc mss crc   brafmutant melanoma  metastatic melanoma is the most serious and lifethreatening type of skin cancer and is associated with low survival rates only about  of people will survive for at least five years following a diagnosis with latestage disease there are about  new cases of melanoma diagnosed worldwide each year approximately half of which have braf mutations a key target in the treatment of metastatic melanoma  brafmutant colorectal cancer worldwide colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in men and the second most common in women with approximately  million new diagnoses in  of these nearly  were diagnosed in men and  in women globally in  approximately  deaths were attributed to colorectal cancer in the us alone an estimated  patients will be diagnosed with cancer of the colon or rectum in  and approximately  are estimated to die of their disease there is wide variation in year survival rates across the globe with year survival expected to be around  in the developed world and dropping to around  in some developing countries in the united states braf mutations occur in  to  percent of patients with colorectal cancer and represent a poor prognosis for these patients      clinical trials trial data trial title program binimetinib mekphase status active not

progress for granted we cannot take progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our

thrive helping diabetes patients thrive share tweet link email print diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes
