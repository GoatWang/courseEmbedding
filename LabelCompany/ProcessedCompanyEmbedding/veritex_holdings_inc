deposit intangibles and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization and we calculate tangible assets as total assets less goodwill and core deposit intangibles and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization tangible common equity to tangible assets is a nongaap financial measure and as we calculate tangible common equity to tangible assets the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is total stockholders equity to total assets our management believe that this measure is important to many investors in the market place who are interested in relative changes from period to period in common equity and total assets each exclusive of changes in intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing both total stockholders equity and
