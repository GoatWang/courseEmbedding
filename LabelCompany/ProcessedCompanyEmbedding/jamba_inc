vitamin and protein supplements operating under the jamba juice brand name jamba has about  locations including full size stores and onsite kiosks jamba differentiates itself from other beverage and fast food outlets by focusing on fresh and healthy drinks and food products jamba inc has a market cap of about  million cash of about  million and no significant long term debt on june th jamba announced earnings for the first quarter of  of  million or  cents per share versus a year ago loss of  million or  per share although these first quarter results included a pretax gain of  million after backing out this gain the results still handily beat analyst expectations revenues increased  year over year coming in at  million jamba opened  new stores in the first quarter of  although jamba is already expanding at a brisk pace the long term goal for jamba is to open over  stores worldwide jamba says that this number can be reached without cannibalizing existing stores by expanding to new areas with residential density of  within one mile average household incomes over  and strong vehicular and pedestrian traffic counts fueled by these expansion plans and increasing same store sales jamba is forecasting revenues of at least  million a year by  we think that yesterday’s weak market conditions helped create a rather subdued movement in shares of jamba after the company reported excellent results for the first quarter at this point shares of jamba are only about  higher than they were before the first quarter results were announced even though jamba beat top line expectations by  and it appears that jamba’s growth is accelerating faster than expected currently  of jamba’s revenues come from “light” users these light users visit jamba juice stores  or  times a month if jamba can entice these light users to visit jamba juice  more time per month total company revenues would rise by  in order to increase the frequency of customer visits jamba is implementing various new initiatives designed to compliment jamba’s core competency of healthy fun and onthego product offerings a healthy version of a stuffed pocket breakfast product will be offered at select locations starting this summer a ready to drink bottled product is also in development and should be ready in the second half of  one of the jamba juice stores located in the bahamas recently started selling salads and other prepackaged healthy food options jamba has reported that sales at this location have been brisk and that the additional food offerings have helped increase customer retention rates and customer visit frequency jamba is currently evaluating options for including similar healthy food options in at many jamba juice locations on the marketing front jamba recently partnered with nike to promote jamba juice at marathons and other sporting events this cross promotion with nike is typical of jamba juice marketing which tends to shun traditional media outlets in favor of grass roots campaigns and viral marketing opportunities jamba hopes to become the world’s leading brand focusing on what the company calls “healthy energy” the core of the healthy energy concept revolves around fresh fruit high in antioxidants vitamins minerals natural sugars and fiber consumers in the us are increasingly health conscious and although fast food chains have attempted to increase healthy food options jamba juice is well positioned to become the market leader for healthy drinks snacks and light meals jamba does not have to reposition itself to appeal to the health conscious consumer healthy drinks and food are part of the core concept of the jamba juice brand recently companies like chipotle nysecmg and buffalo wild wings nasdaqbwld have seen their stock prices soar due to increasing revenues and profits largely fueled by aggressive expansion plans jamba inc could be poised to follow in the footsteps of these companies revenues jumped in the first quarter of  and analysts expect jamba to become profitable without one time gains in the seasonally strong second quarter at wall street mayhem we think that the riskreward ratio for shares of jamba is excellent at this point jamba’s growth should continue to accelerate due to expansion and recent initiatives designed to drive customer frequency rates additionally over  of jamba shares are held short as seen by the recent moves in wall street mayhem picks cree nasdaqcree and taser tasr high short percentages can create quick surges in share price when companies receive positive news or increased investor attention jamba is poised to report an excellent nd quarter for  revenues exploded in the first quarter and traditionally the nd quarter is much stronger for jamba juice due to favorable weather conditions now is a good time to buy shares of jamba juice before the second quarter results and before the short covering starts to accelerate the board of directors and the management at jamba juice have made quality strategic decisions and they have an exceptional pedigree although jamba is a small company from a market cap perspective management has extensive experience in food and beverage retail ceo paul clayton is the former president of burger king bkc north america while board member craig foley was the early lead investor in starbucks nasdaqsbux and costco nasdaqcost and was on the board of directors at starbucks for  years other jamba board members also serve on the boards of ebay nasdaqebay burger king bkc and pf chang’s nasdaqpfcb jamba inc is a growth story in its early stages although jamba must increase customer frequency rates to become a highly profitable company recent initiatives including prepacked bottled beverages and healthy food products should open jamba juice to a wider range of customers while increasing visit frequency for current customers with a market cap of only  million rapid growth and a healthy brand image jamba has the makings of an appealing takeover target if starbucks wanted to extend their dominance of the beverage industry while improving their appeal to health conscious consumers jamba seems like an excellent fit suggested
