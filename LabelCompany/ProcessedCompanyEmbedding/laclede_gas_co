business elsewhere i received a letter from laclede stating they needed to perform a meter change to stay compliant with missouri public service commission regulations and that i should call their customer service line to schedule this appointment being a responsible adult i called the same day i received this letter what happened after that just shows their complete lack of respect for their customers in the following bullet points  long hold times   plus minutes always on hold   hour windows for appointments  am to pm or pm to pm thats an extremely long window and some of us work  hours a week to pay our bills so have to take off for work for a long period of time for this kind of thing i dont consider doing waiting for laclede service a vacation do you most other businesses like cable companies have  hour appointment windows for scheduled service  customer service people who tell you one appointment time say a specific day from ampm and then actually book it wrong and book it for the entire possible day from ampm in the computer you discover this of course after you spend another  minutes on hold after calling back because its pm and someone was supposed to have shown up between ampm it took another two hours to get someone there  customer service people who despite you always paying your bills on time because you work very hard refuse to compensate you anything for their mistake when you ask if they can do anything to make it up to you on your next bill with a credit or something  having the nerve to tell me that you could have compensated me something for your mistake if i had a late fee on my account by waving the late fee so youre telling me that if im not a responsible adult and dont pay my bills on time when your customer service is bad that youll do something to give me a discount but when im actually a responsible adult i get nothing that just makes me feel great i think i hung up the phone at this point enough said they have a monopoly i cant do anything about how much this company is terrible and take my business elsewhere but oh how i wish i could at least i can yelp i dont give the lowest star to lacked gas company because this company is a giant rip off unfortunately nothing is being done leclade gas company is making millions of dollars off of local customers and yet there is no justification customers must pay exactly as laclede gas company and its unqualified staff demand otherwise go elsewhere which is lackede gas company but this time you must pay triple and plus times of the amount that you couldnt afford and your gas got cut off  simply customers have to deposited their whole paychecks to leclade gas account or go to your backyard and invent fire to cook or dont take a bath  basically living a primitive life in an advanced democracy country congratulations the usa so i arrived this morning at  to my old villa that i have listed on the market my appointment to turn on the gas was from am to  at  still nothing so already highly irritated that a large company cant get better than a  hour window on an appt call wait was  min so when they finally spoke with me only to find out that i was actually scheduled for an all day appointment all day meaning they can come whenever they feel like it and i am stranded in a house that doesnt even have a chair to sit on this is the highly advance and innovative company called laclede gas company now that was funny is there another business outside of utility companys and government that can pull this pathetic service off in  no we miss an appointment by  min and we are getting an ear full why do they not have any competition in the market that will force companys like laclede gas company to actually consider that not everyone can just burn a vacation day waiting around with a smile on their face for them to do business with them i am giving this company  star because that is as low as the ratings could get if it werent for the monopoly that lacede gas has they would have no customers at all a  bill costs over  per month because of their fees a customer fee of  is the equivalent of  months of their product ive called several times and no one at lacede can explain what this fee is or what it goes towards other than lacede charging you for the honor of being their customer they also charge a separate fee for use of their pipes when you go to pay your bill online  fee by phone  fee at a payment center  fee the only way to avoid the fees is to mail a hard copy check in or set up autopay options why anyone would give a company this unethical access to their account is beyond me buyer beware lacede will bilk you for everything they can and because of their monopoly laugh at you when you complain about it or as one customer service rep told me if you dont like it go somewhere else avoid this company if at all possible laclede took over mge at some point in the past when this happened they changed their billing systems changed their internet portal moved the customer service out of the area changed policies without notice and lost touch with their customer base you can no longer even access via the internet any records prior to that transition the customer service reps are also unable to access any records prior to that transition in the process they also lost over  worth of payments we made after several months of calls and countless hours spent on the phone at various levels of the laclede organization we received a letter that patronizingly told us the payments had been received and applied appropriately mind you no proof was provided no statements were offered that would demonstrate that the payments had been appropriately applied none of the statements we received in the past show the payments being applied we are just expected by laclede to trust them when they tell us that they did a good job and its all fine so we called the missouri public service commission who has opened an investigation into our situation they also informed us that since mge was taken over by laclede they are receiving a highly escalated flow of calls about missing money its no wonder their customer ratings are so poor laclede is a dragon that owns the only gas utility available to us and controls our service without any understanding of the responsibility that this should imply if i could i would vote them out of business with my dollars i most certainly would from what im reading here and on their fb page it looks like the vote would be pretty unanimous even the employees feel the company is corrupt and nonresponsive really even the irs has higher reviews on all review platforms including yelp you would think laclede would notice this and do something to improve the way service is provided and accounted for but when you have no competition and you dont care about your customer this is the result you get theyve apparently just changed their name to spire do they think a name change will somehow change our perception of the monster they have become ill be posting this same review for spire just to make sure this doesnt happen worst customer service i have ever received in my life paid  for a tech to diagnosisfix our gas logs that were originally installed by laclede dwayne was at our house less than thirty minutes and told me he would order the part needed and get back to me to install it shortly two and a half weeks later he calls and says that since the pilot stayed lit that his co worker said it was not the part he diagnosed and that they could not order the part that i would need i asked to speak to his manager and he said his manager john evans would call me never received a call so i called customer service and spoke to mindy who was extremely rude and of no help i asked to be transferred to the tech department but she said that was impossible i asked to speak to a manager but nope she would need to put in a request that would take  hours so again i wait now four days later and no call i call again and speak to dina same bs and no manager return call laclede gas is the biggest fn joke ever stay away from these horrible crooks if you can good luck if you have to deal with them laclede gas company has proven to be a complete nightmare for my family a quick search of their facebook page will tell you everything you need to know about how incompetent or crooked they are their customer service is terrible  im an expert on after  hourlong and a few  minute phone calls which accomplished nothing there are hundreds of reports of them not meeting service date deadlines and taking too much money out of your account and not owning up to it my issue was the latter they double billed my for a payment that was missed because their autopay feature glitched this was not my fault at all so i told them yes please take it out so they took out twice what they should have now theyre telling me its a good thing you have a credit on your account with winter coming up are you kidding you took too much of my money and when i ask for it back you tell me i should be thankful that you stole from me i dont think this is a good way to run a business at all this monopoly should be punished forced to disband and sell terrible customer service terrible service terrible experience oh and their website is a convoluted mess youll find that in almost every review of the company that you read also avoid if possible if you must use them like me be ready to be charged incorrectly for poor service and watch your accounts like a hawk how many people do they steal
