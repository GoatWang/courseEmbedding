supreme court of the state of new york on june   by a group of investors in  privatelabel rmbs trusts for which citibank serves or did serve as trustee asserting claims for alleged violations of the trust indenture act of  breach of contract breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on citibanks alleged failure to perform its duties as trustee for the  rmbs trusts on november   plaintiffs sought leave to withdraw this action on the same day a smaller subset of similar plaintiff investors in  privatelabel rmbs trusts for which citibank serves or did serve as trustee filed a new civil action against citibank in the southern district of new york asserting similar claims as the prior action filed in state court in january  the court closed plaintiffs original state court action citibanks motion to dismiss the federal complaint was fully briefed as of may   on september   the federal court dismissed all claims as to  of the  trusts and allowed certain of the claims to proceed
