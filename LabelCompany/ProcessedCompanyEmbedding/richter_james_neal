relates generally to sales automation and forecasting systems and more particularly to tracking and storing sales data for performance prediction backgroundsales automation systems are common in the art in standard usage these systems aid a sales representative a sales manager or both to be more efficient at selling a product or service sales forecasting analytics are commonly a component of a sales automation systems and are largely focused towards the sales manager to help forecast and manage the sales processa sales automation system is generally a tool that allows sales representatives and managers to organize contact records as well as manage records associated with sales quotes and invoices it can also work in the context of a ‘sales methodology’ where the sales process is structured around the representative working though a set of stages in an attempt to complete a sale sales automation tools typically allow the tracking of such records in terms of time periods associated with fiscal or financial accounting during these ‘sale periods’ it is important for sales representatives and managers to have analytical reports defining progress towards various goalstypically the sales representative recognizes the benefit of using a sales automation system for maintaining their list of contacts but most other tasks are considered overhead with little benefit thus sales automation systems commonly suffer from a lack of full acceptance by the sales staff which limits their usefulness to the sales managers as well—if the sales representative doesnt utilize the system then the manager does not have a full picture of the sales process as the sales representative is responsible for using the system to track individual deal progress through the sales stage should they fail to log the sales progress the system is left without the valuable data necessary for the sales manager to forecast and manage the sales goals a system that provides incentive to a sales representative to use features beyond a contact management system is needed additionally in part because of the lack of sales data and in part because of the prior state of the art many analytics used by the sales manager are quite simple models with manual parameters based upon the sales managers intuitions about prior performancemany algorithms in the general field of data mining provide resources to a knowledgeable individual for extracting relevant information from large amounts of data there exist data mining applications to aid in this process in some instances there are data mining approaches incorporated into other systems such as sales automation systems these incorporated techniques are usually quite rudimentary compared to the full suite of techniques available in a complete data mining system yet still require some level of sophistication on the part of the user in sales automation systems the user would be the sales manager some of the more advanced techniques available would be standard statistical approaches for assigning error bars or applying a linear regression analysis these statistical approaches are often guided by or overridden with adhoc scaling factors based upon the sales managers intuition such as “bob usually over promises his amount sold by about  yet sue is more conservative and usually under promises by  therefore i will adjust bobs sales predictions down by  but increase sues predictions by ”there exist new data mining and machine learning techniques which can go beyond the traditional analyses above but they require data to work accurately to overcome the adhoc manual scaling factors to collect this data the sales representative must be motivated to provide the information stereotypically sales people are motivated by two goals meeting personal monetary targets and out performing their peers methods that target these motivations are needed and will increase the acceptance of a sales automation system by the sales people and hence provide a richer set of useful data to the sales manager most prior systems have failed to adequately provide features found compelling to the sales representative and have overlooked the connection that the sales managers job is best done with the full data available from an engaged sales representative some prior systems have recognized the benefits of catering to the interests of a sales representative but have neglected to use the data naturally collected by the sales automation system to reflect back and help provide the necessary feedback to keep the system accurately tuned—commonly the systems relied on a manual configuration of the various parametersa better sales automation and forecasting management system is needed to address the above noted shortcomings in the prior artsummaryone aspect of the inventive subject matter includes a sales automation system and a method for scoring sales representative performance and forecasting future sales representative performance these scoring and forecasting techniques can apply to a sales representative monitoring his own performance comparing himself to others within the organization or even between organizations using methods described in application contemplating which job duties are falling behind and which are ahead of schedule and numerous other related activities similarly with the sales representative providing a full set of performance data the system is in a position to aid a sales manager identify which sales representatives are behind others and why as well as help with resource planning should requirements such as quotas or staffing changefurther aspects include a central repository of logged sales related data including data representative of the progress made through the various sales stages of the sale cycle the logged sales data is extracted to support the learning forecasting and prediction functions of the present invention numerical and quantitative data records can be retrieved based on user request for data still further aspects include an incentive because of the ability to provide a sales representative through a user interface current and predictive analysis of their performance relative to their peers and groups of other sales representatives some embodiments also provide a tool that allows the sales representative and manager to perform a predictive analysis of their conversion rate to monitor monetary performancefor example all calculations can be done to score the performance of individual people and groups with respect to learned data models of top performing sales people as well as with respect to userentered ideal models of performance an example of this would be an ideal revenue growth of a sales person over time a second example is a relative analysis of the persons ongoing sales ‘pipeline’ with respect to learned and ideal models of good performance in either case the system can learn the historical sales models for an individual or high performing sales representative using any of a variety of machine learning techniques in addition an idealized model can be entered by the sales manager the resulting comparison can aid in the understanding of how individuals relate to one another and to an idealized individual this helps sales representatives understand their relative performance and it helps sales managers understand if there is a general deviation between their idealized model and the actual performance of an individual or groupanother example can be evaluating an entire sales process sales methodology with respect to the ideal model of the process as well as compared to other good performing processes or methodologies note that this analysis can be independent of individuals looking at the process in isolation it can also be used to identify weak individuals or groups that bring the overall performance of the process or methodology down one aspect of the embodiments is

now be providedexample forecasting revenueusing the data query and display module sales data is retrieved representing some windowintime of sales revenue as well as ongoing inprocess sales records from the dw  a configuration is retrieved defining the data flow and data transformed to be used also from the dw  a cache of data from the previous runs of the data caching and agglomeration module metric scores and derived data from previous runs of this module is fetchedthe data manipulation algorithm dma module  figs  and  is applied to the raw sales data to align it with records from the ‘data cache’ using data transforms supplementary calculations are also made to the metric scores an example output data stream from the module would be a large list of quantitative data associated with salespeople salesperiods products sold and performance metrics for each of these unitsthe output of this module is fed to the he  one example function of the he module  is to clean the data of statistical outliers before passing to the dmf module  another example is to create additional quantitative metrics an example of this is to assign a heuristic category to individual sales people sales people who have consistently met or exceeded goals as defined by evaluating any number of factors for a large percentage of sales periods would be marked as ‘top performers’ people who meet most goals for the same time period would be marked as ‘average performers’ the rest as ‘underperforming’ a third example would flag particular metrics as having an anomaly without necessarily excluding it such as a sales person who had his or her performance enhanced or degraded by an anomalous event and this should not unduly influence later calculationsthe next submodule in the chain is the code dmf  figs  and  this module uses the data and metric stream as an attribute set in the combination of data models with a suite of forecasting algorithms to establish a set of revenue forecasts an example data model would be a userentered ideal profile of how a sales person or groups various metrics should be shaped numerically it may contain various weights for how individual metrics would be used in forecasting algorithms in addition other parts of the dmf module figs  and  could be applied to learn a data model or profile of how attribute values progress in time associated with performance levels sales groups and products this engine also is able to learn new data models with various algorithms by examining previous data in a posteriori plus feedback fashionthe output of the dmf module  flows to the he submodule  figs  and  in this scenario he  would be used to take the suite of revenue forecasts and assign quality scores based upon both user entered heuristics and learned heuristics this engine also is able to learn new heuristics with various algorithms by examining previous data in a posteriori plus feedback fashion the final output of the example scenario is a set of revenue forecasts for each person group and aggregate forecasts for sales in addition accuracy scores for each forecast as well as learned data models and heuristics are storedexample scoring the performance of sales people and groupssimilar to example  with the modification that all calculations are done to score the performance of individual people and groups with respect to learned data models of topperformers as well as with respect to userentered ideal models of performance an example of this would be an ideal revenue growth of a sales person over time a second example is a relative analysis of the persons ongoing sales ‘pipeline’ with respect to learned and ideal models of good performance in either case the system can learn the historical sales models for an individual or high performing sales representative using any of a variety of machine learning techniques in addition an idealized model can be entered by the sales manager the resulting comparison can aid in the understanding of how individuals relate to one another and to an idealized individual this helps sales representatives understand their relative performance and it helps sales managers understand if there is a general deviation between their idealized model and the actual performance of an individual or groupexample  detailsideal revenue growth or progression of a sales person over past time and into the futurethis analysis occurs in the mlf and dqdm modules see figs    for diagrammatic details the methods purpose is to extract raw data and learn a central pattern for revenue progression in time of a sales person or group that is relative to a combination of an idealized pattern and the revenue progression pattern of the group of top performersmlf module operation for example the sales data for all persons groups is queried from the ‘sales records’ and from the ‘data warehouse’ also from the data warehouse the various heuristics are retrieved the sales records consist of the ‘closed lost and deferred’ sales revenue for a range of hierarchical sales periods over the past x periods in time this data is extracted per person and per group aggregate individuals in the topperformer group are included in this query with their membership in this group tagged as such the following heuristics are retrieved from the dw note that these examples are not exhaustive and one of ordinary skill in the art can easily add to this listmlfmodule preheuristicengine examples learned sales revenue variance number of sales periods where the revenue variance of an individual customer or class or group of customers have variance below some percentage threshold variance is the percentage drop or gain compared to last periodidealized sales revenue variance profile the ideal profile of revenue variance this is characterized by a range of growth or decrease percentages periodoverperiod an example would be that ideal growth or expected decrease in sales periodoverperiod should vary between − and  in the rd month of a given year vs the nd month learned sales revenue profile of top performers form an aggregate profile of the progression of the revenue profile for all ‘top performers’ this profile would be normalized to be a numerical curve of percentage increases starting from the initial revenue goal of the starting sales period of the analysis the profile would be weighted by the overall ‘performance score’ of the individual the basic computation is a smoothed weighted average using any combination of classical methods iterative exponential smoothing or newer timeseries analysis methods with or without seasonality adjustments learned sales revenue profile of sales group same as the previous analysis but using the subjectsalespersons peergroup learned sales revenue profile of sales person same as previous analysis except done for each individual in isolation idealized sales revenue profile this is an idealized profile established  input by sales managers or executives that gives an ideal average and spread of a revenue curve over time main dmf module detailsin this step previous learned profiles and new sales records are used to learn updated profiles this may be accomplished by running a suite of classical forecasting methods time series analysis methods smoothing methods and seasonality adjustments the outputs of the individual analysis methods are aggregated via a weighted scheme note that the weights of each method are learned as well after a run is performed and forecasts are stored they are used in the next run and compared to the actual reported revenue gained lost or otherwise deferred the aggregation weights of the different methods are adjusted based upon the success or failure of the particular methods predicted data vs actual datathe output of the dmf module fig  is processed by the mlf postheuristics engine  fig  here each learned profile is given a quality score that is a function of the accuracy of the predictions from the dmf module and its similarity to the idealized models in particular embodiments the heuristic analysis is a set of fuzzy logic rulesoutput of mlf modulequality score for each person or groupupdated ‘learned’ profilesupdated metadata for idealized modelprofilesdqdm module for example given a ‘subject’ sales representative or group of analysis the following is performed to display to the user a graded analysis of the subjects revenue growth or progression see figs  and from the dw the following can be retrievedruntime profile comparison and analysis methodslearned revenue profile

variance profile for the subjects grouplearned revenue variance profile for the top performersidealized revenue variance profilethe runtime heuristics are performed on the above data the heuristics produce two types of output comparative grading and absolute grading the comparative grading assigns a quality score for the subjects profile relative to a comparisongroup typically this is the subjects peer group in the organization and the group of topperformers the absolute grading is similar except that a score is assigned assessing how well the subjects profile fits the idealized profiles fig  has an example chart and assigned grade for an absolute revenue trend and profile analysis one of average skill in the art can easily see other variations of this exampleexample scoring sales processessimilar to examples    the module is applied to the problem of evaluating an entire sales processor sales methodology with respect to the ideal model of the process as well as compared to other good performing processes or methodologies note that this analysis can be independent of individuals looking at the process in isolation it can also be used to identify weak individuals or groups that bring the overall performance of the process or methodology down the novelty of this approach is its usage in crm software applied to sales process analysis and its combination with iterative machine learning methodsexample aideal pipeline analysis of sales pipeline  strategybackground for example aa sales pipeline is an abstract construct consisting of series of ‘stages’ at each stage a set of tasks is to be performed by the sales representative for example stage  might be called ‘leads’ where potential deals are placed in this first stage upon initial contact with the sales representative to progress to stage  ‘demo product’ the deals primary contact must exchange preliminary information with the sales representative and agree to schedule a product demonstration stage  for example could be the ‘negotiation’ phase where representative and client agree to financial terms of a deal the set of stages is generally referred to as a sales strategy representatives may be working on potential clients using a plurality of sales strategiesthe active deals of a given representative can be assigned to a stage in a particular strategy a representatives ‘raw pipeline’ is a set of monetary values that are the sum of the assumed value potential deals in a given stage a representatives ‘forecasted pipeline’ is a set of values as above except that each stage is assigned a conversion rate percentage the raw values in each stage are multiplied by the conversion rate percentage to form a set of monetary values that a representative terms his or her expected forecast ordinarily these percentages are manually assigned by userssales strategy and pipeline analysis ‘learning method’various data is requested from the dw  and sales records  a representative outline of this data is shown belowclosed or lost or deferred revenue historydate and time of each stage transition for all dealssales process stages and stageforecastpercentagessales goalsongoing active dealsquality heuristics revenue model see example strategy quality rulesdata cleaning procedures the data above is loaded and a set of algorithms is applied to them to extract statistical information on the stage transition timings stage abandonment rates lost deals and deferred or backward stage moves all sales strategies are modeled with a multilevel queuing model such as mms queuing network for further details see an introduction to stochastic modeling by samuel karlin howard m taylor academic press  edition february  which is hereby incorporated by reference herein for all purposesthis analysis allows the predictive modeling of the sales strategy and compares it to the user entered expected conversion rates from one stage to the next this analysis also allows the modeling of how changing human resources allocated to specific stage will affect the behavior of the strategy as a wholethis queuing network method is combined with a set of fuzzy logic rule sets for example that classify deals based upon their characteristics specifically the attributes of a deal are used to perform a supervised machine learning algorithm based upon the outputs of the queuing model and the system learns a classification system for assigning quality scores to deals these scores are used to prioritize attention to deals of various types deals that the classifier system and queuing model predict will transition quickly between stages are given an increased ‘forecast percentage’ while deals with some attribute that the ml algorithm has identified as correlated with slow progress will be assigned a lower forecast percentagenote also that this analysis allows prediction of deal close times and assigning scoring metrics to individual sales representatives and groups based upon how a particular deal is progressing for example—being  days past typical transition times in stage  indicates that the predicted close date will be  days behind typical another algorithm in this suite is the forecasting smoothing and time series analysis algorithms mentioned in example  here these techniques can be used to both repair missing data and to provide compatible sales strategy forecasts for comparative analysis and decisioning it is also used to provide seasonality adjustments to the output of the queuing networkthis system can be run at a frequency relevant to the typical business cycle of a sales strategy for example if a typical deal is closed in  days and some component of a deal is likely to change every day then the system would be run at least twice a day the data and models built from the last run are loaded and their predictions checked the various quality weights on the output of each algorithm are adjusted by a reinforcement learning algorithmsales strategy and pipeline analysis ‘query analytic comparison and display method’fig  is an illustration of this process it is similar to fig  the aggregate outputs of the mlf module for this task are loaded along with the subject sales process an example output is given on fig the basic method is shared with example s dqdm section along with fig this following data can be loadedfrom the dw the following can be retrieved runtime profile of the current sales strategylearned forecast stage percentagesquality metrics for poor average and excellent performing dealsseasonality modeldata associated with the subject sales strategysales records for open deals within this strategy the output of this model is an aggregated summary of the open deals in the current sales period for a given sales period each stage in the strategy is assigned a score for overall execution and a forecasted overall conversion rate fig  described above provides an example algorithm that details how the modules interact with each other to provide this example a analysisexample bideal pipeline analysis of sales representative or groupsales strategy and pipeline analysis ‘learning method’ example b is similar to example a except that the analysis is done for a specific sales representative or group across the range of sales strategies they work on sales strategy or pipeline analysis ‘query analytic comparison and display method’ see example a except that this analysis is done for a specific sales representative or group across the range of sales strategies they work on example allocation of quotasthe system can be used to allocate or reallocate sales goals or quotas using a suite of machine learning or optimization algorithm one can learn optimal allocation of quotas such that some fitness function can be maximized the fitness function would be comprised of a weighted sum of factors and use the outputs of example a as primary inputs to the fitness function to reallocate quotasexample allocation of territoriesthe system can be used to allocate or reallocate sales territories for example using a suite of machine learning or optimization algorithm one can learn optimal allocation of quotas such that some fitness function is maximized the fitness function may be comprised of a weighted sum of factors and use the outputs of example a as primary inputs to the fitness function to reallocate territoriesthe fp module  as supported by the dw  allows sales people to execute ‘what if’ scenarios for planning various organization attributes for the future the basic idea is to solve by isolated analysis approximation or by a direct techniquein spirit not necessarily literal solving for a particular variable in basic algebra when one solves equationss some number of variables are chosen as ‘unknown’ while the rest of the variables that are known are used to identify values and ranges of values for the unknown variables that fulfill the equationsthe input to the fp  can be made up of the raw sales record data  as well as the dw  using all previously mentioned elements and an additional ‘scenarios’ element the processing submodules are the mlf  a scenario analysis engine sae  and a display and user interface element  a display and user interface components allow the user to see the output of the fp  as well as interact with some number of quantitative attributes additionally the sae  may contain specific processes as described hereinthe display  and user interface element  can communicate bidirectionally with the sae   mlf  the fp  can also store scenarios that users have created during the use of the fp  one purpose of the sae  and mlf  is to use ‘conditional’ data to create new mlf analysis outputs given this conditional data the outputs conditional data and associated elements of the dw  are termed a ‘scenario’ and also stored in an area of the dw  the scenario engine  contains a number of algorithms as described hereinexample goal based revenue planninga manager has in mind a particular goal for a given metric in this case goalrevenue for some number of time periods into the future however after looking at revenue forecasts from the mlf it is apparent that revenue forecasts are short of the goal at this point a manager has a number of business factors that can be adjusted sales peoples individual goals can be altered product pricing can be adjusted and new sales people can be hired as an example a manager may use the system to determine which of these factors should be altered to best meet the desired goalfor example using the fp  a manager can input the desired goalrevenue and look at how factors can be altered to meet this goal taking one factor as an example the individual revenue goals the system can be asked to meet the new revenue goal by assigning new individual goals the output here would be a breakdown of goal changes as well as a likelihood score of the users meeting the new goals given past history and current status it would also output an overall likelihood score of meeting the new goalrevenueexample hiring and firing of individualsbuilding on example  of the fp  the manger can also attempt to meet some new goal by examining the effect of hiring additional individuals plus firing andor replacing existing individuals the manger is presented with a list of individuals their past metrics future goals and future forecasts each individual is also assigned various performance scores the manger can in the simplest case eliminate individuals from the list and look at the effect on the future goals forecasts and likelihood numbers another action would be to add an individual to the list of some performance level presumable either ‘average’ or ‘top’ and look at the effect on forecasts likelihood and goals the third action would be the combination of the two replacing an individual with a new individuala slightly more complex embodiment is to set up a schedule of hiring of new people at a given performance level to see how the forecasts are effected over longer time scales this staged hiring model would benefit from the accurate historical models of how long it took existing sales people to come up to their current level of performance and similarly indicate the growth rate for individual performance as they learn the particulars of the current product and sales environmentan embodiment of the heuristics would be both simple rulesets as well as fuzzy rule sets to assign grades or scores to individual metrics an embodiment of a datamodel is a set of values describing how given metrics change over some other variable an example would be a metric over timethus as is evident from the above the various embodiments may provide a revenue forecasting system to learn to forecast revenue as a combination of standard approaches as well as ones based upon learning a profile of the members of the organization and their historical attributes performance classification etcfurther the various embodiments may provide for scoring the performance of sales people and groups including scoring a persongroups learned profile against knowngood profiles and entered
