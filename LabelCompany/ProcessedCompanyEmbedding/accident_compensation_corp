the acc scheme provides a range of entitlements to injured people however  percent of new claims in – were for treatment costs only other entitlements include weekly compensation for lost earnings

works with trusted partners and communities to prevent injuries these initiatives include but are not limited to rugbysmart with new zealand rugby ride forever mates and dates and ‘make your home a safety zone’ with safekids historyedit acc has its origins in the  workers compensation act workers compensation for accidents act  which established a limited compensation scheme for workers who had suffered injuries where there was no directly responsible party in  a new zealand royal commission chaired by high court judge owen woodhouse recommended extending this compensation to cover all injuries on a nofault basis following this report on  april  the new zealand government established the accident compensation commission to implement the requirements of the  accident compensation act and the  amendments the act was later replaced by the injury prevention rehabilitation and compensation act  which was renamed the accident compensation act  in  the annual report  of the accident compensation commission proposed that the distinction between accidents which are covered and illness which is not should be dropped but this proposal was not taken up by the government in  the government renamed the accident compensation commission as the accident compensation corporation from  july  the fourth national government allowed private insurance operators to provide workrelated accident insurance and acc was briefly exposed to competition the fifth labour government elected in november  repealed this change and as of  july  reinstated the acc as the sole provider of accident insurance coverage administration of leviesedit acc is primarily funded through a combination of levies and government contributions income collected from each source goes into predetermined account based on the source costs relating to an injury are paid from one of these accounts based on the type and cause of the injury the four main accounts are work earners nonearners and motor vehicle there is also a fifth account treatment injury formerly medical misadventure that draws on both the earners and nonearners account account covers income sources work workrelated injuries levies collected from employers and selfemployed people the amount payable averages  of an employers payroll or income earned as of  april  rates vary depending on the employers industry and risks associated with it earners nonwork injuries by income earners levies collected in conjunction with tax deductions on income paid by employees through paye or by selfemployed people directly the amount payable is  of

relating to motor vehicles on public roads levies included in the price of petrol not diesel or lpg and through motor vehicle license fees levies average  gst exclusive per vehicle per year as of july  with motorcycles and heavy vehicles paying more than average due to the increased likelihood of injury associated with these modes of transport the petrol levy set at c per litre gst exclusive treatment injury injuries as a result of medical treatment funded from the earners and nonearners accounts depending on the clients employment status acc for the selfemployed – acc coverplus extraedit acc coverplus extra was introduced by acc to provide cover for selfemployed workers and business owners that would fail to otherwise be covered adequately by the standard acc cover plus policy it works by paying an agreed level of compensation in the event of an injury resulting in time off from work with this cover already agreed upon any business would not have to prove loss of income and has certainty on their amount of cover in the event of an accident injury acc cover plus policy was designed to cover employees and would only pay  of the net taxable income with acc cover plus extra a selfemployed contractor would get  of the preagreed compensation cover until one was fit for fulltime work a business owner would be able to get compensation under acc cover plus extra even if the business continued to earn income whilst the business owner was off work injured this would not be possible with the standard policy fundingedit acc offices in palmerston north acc initially had a payasyougo funding model which collected only enough levies during the year to cover the cost of claims for that particular year in  a fully funded model was adopted whereby sufficient levies were collected to cover the lifetime cost of each injury – which might require compensation over a period of  years or more however getting acc onto a strong financial footing was not easy and in  acc posted a  billion loss – described as the biggest corporate loss in new zealands history this cost escalation is thought to have been due to an increase in the number of claims a widening of entitlements and increased costs of meeting the claims another factor was physiotherapy services being made free at the point of delivery leading to overservicing of clients between  and  this appears to have contributed to an increase in physiotherapy costs of  the  reimbursement scheme for physiotherapist services was ended and acc levies on wages and motorists were increased acc chairman john judge told the sunday startimes that it was going to take a hardnosed approach to get acc into a sustainable position this would require substantial levy increases and legislative change to get people off the scheme and back to work quicker by  acc had made good progress towards its goal of being fully funded and was  billion short of matching liabilities b with its assets b towards the end of  acc minister judith collins announced that government would not cut acc levies for the – year while the acc board and ministry of business innovation and employment had recommended reducing the levies by between  and  per cent collins stated that the governments decision was motivated by the uncertain economic conditions and a desire to ensure that reductions to the levy were sustainable andrew little the labour partys acc spokesman criticised this decision claiming that it was driven by the governments attempt to bring the budget into surplus and reducing the levy would provide a boost to the economy in the  budget collins announced a  billion cut in acc levies over the next two years collins said the earners and workers accounts were now fully funded after the corporation reduced the number of long term acc claimants from  to less than  in  acc’s outstanding claims liability ocl increased by  billion which lead to a net deficit of  billion the ocl measures the future cost of all existing acc claims that year also saw  million claims accepted a  increase from the previous year  billion was paid out to all new and existing claims there has been some conjecture over whether or

several other occasions in  there were a total of  recorded threats made against staff  the majority against case managers making difficult decisions on clients cases client fraudedit in  it was reported that  people have been convicted of defrauding acc of a total of more than  million over the past four years this includes clients claiming they were injured but who kept working while

their injured partners have subsequently died sometimes these payments went on for nearly  years before the fraud came to light – with one woman receiving nearly  after her husband had died staff

necessary part or ordinary consequence of the treatment bronwyn pullar privacy breachedit acc has had a number of breaches of privacy relating to claimants the most significant occurred in  after the release of details of  claimants to an acc claimant bronwyn pullar pullar had been battling acc since suffering a head injury in —and had  separate complaints against the agency—only one of which was about the privacy breaches in  she and former national party president michelle boag had a meeting with two senior acc managers to discuss her concerns acc referred the matter to the police claiming pullar had threatened to go to the media about the privacy breaches if she didnt get what she wanted the police listened to a tape recording of the meeting and decided there was no case to answer in march  acc minister nick smith resigned from cabinet after it was revealed that he had written letters on behalf of pullar who was a personal friend of his while he was acc minister acc chairman john judge continued to insist his version of events was correct and as a result acc minister judith collins did not renew his tenure on the acc board the chief executive of acc ralph stewart also resigned the next day three other board members – murray hilder rob campbell and john mccliskie – also resigned the fallout from the affair continued in may  when collins sued labour mps trevor mallard and andrew little for defamation over comments they made on radio new zealand broadcasts linking her to the leak of an email from michelle boag following the release of the files the case was settled after a high court hearing in november  an independent review of acc was conducted towards the end of  and found the organisation lacked a comprehensive strategy for protecting and managing claimants

partners and communities to prevent injuries these initiatives include but are not limited to rugbysmart with new zealand rugby ride forever mates and dates and ‘make your home a safety zone’ with safekids historyedit acc has its origins in the  workers compensation act workers compensation for accidents act  which established a limited compensation scheme for workers who had suffered injuries where there was no directly responsible party in  a new zealand royal commission chaired by high court judge owen woodhouse recommended extending this compensation to cover all injuries on a nofault basis following this report on  april  the new zealand government established the accident compensation commission to implement the requirements of the  accident compensation act and the  amendments the act was later replaced by the injury prevention rehabilitation and compensation act  which was renamed the accident compensation act  in  the annual report  of the accident compensation commission proposed that the distinction between accidents which are covered and illness which is not should be dropped but this proposal was not taken up by the government in  the government renamed the accident compensation commission as the accident compensation corporation from  july  the fourth national government allowed private insurance operators to provide workrelated accident insurance and acc was briefly exposed to competition the fifth labour government elected in november  repealed this change and as of  july  reinstated the acc as the sole provider of accident insurance coverage administration of leviesedit acc is primarily funded through a combination of levies and government contributions income collected from each source goes into predetermined account based on the source costs relating to an injury are paid from one of these accounts based on the type and cause of the injury the four main accounts are work earners nonearners and motor vehicle there is also a fifth account treatment injury formerly medical misadventure that draws on both the earners and nonearners account account covers income sources work workrelated injuries levies collected from employers and selfemployed people the amount payable averages  of an employers payroll or income earned as of  april  rates vary depending on the employers industry and risks associated with it earners nonwork injuries by income earners levies collected in conjunction with tax deductions on income paid by employees through paye or by selfemployed people directly the amount payable is  of income earned as of  april  nonearners nonwork injuries by nonincome earners eg children elderly unemployed visitors government contribution from the general taxation pool motor vehicle injuries relating to motor vehicles on public roads levies included in the price of petrol not diesel or lpg and through motor vehicle license fees levies average  gst exclusive per vehicle per year as of july  with motorcycles and heavy vehicles paying more than average due to the increased likelihood of injury associated with these modes of transport the petrol levy set at c per litre gst exclusive treatment injury injuries as a result of medical treatment funded from the earners and nonearners accounts depending on the clients employment status acc for the selfemployed – acc coverplus extraedit acc coverplus extra was introduced by acc to provide cover for selfemployed workers and business owners that would fail to otherwise be covered adequately by the standard acc cover plus policy it works by paying an agreed level of compensation in the event of an injury resulting in time off from work with this cover already agreed upon any business would not have to prove loss of income and has certainty on their amount of cover in the event of an accident injury acc cover plus policy was designed to cover employees and would only pay  of the net taxable income with acc cover plus extra a selfemployed contractor would get  of the preagreed compensation cover until one was fit for fulltime work a business owner would be able to get compensation under acc cover plus extra even if the business continued to earn income whilst the business owner was off work injured this would not be possible with the standard policy fundingedit acc offices in palmerston north acc initially had a payasyougo funding model which collected only enough levies during the year to cover the cost of claims for that particular year in  a fully funded model was adopted whereby sufficient levies were collected to cover the lifetime cost of each injury – which might require compensation over a period of  years or more however getting acc onto a strong financial footing was not easy and in  acc posted a  billion loss – described as the biggest corporate loss in new zealands history this cost escalation is thought to have been due to an increase in the number of claims a widening of entitlements and increased costs of meeting the claims another factor was physiotherapy services being made free at the point of delivery leading to overservicing of clients between  and  this appears to have contributed to an increase in physiotherapy costs of  the  reimbursement scheme for physiotherapist services was ended and acc levies on wages and motorists were increased acc chairman john judge told the sunday startimes that it was going to take a hardnosed approach to get acc into a sustainable position this would require substantial levy increases and legislative change to get people off the scheme and back to work quicker by  acc had made good progress towards its goal of being fully funded and was  billion short of matching liabilities b with its assets b towards the end of  acc minister judith collins announced that government would not cut acc levies for the – year while the acc board and ministry of business innovation and employment had recommended reducing the levies by between  and  per cent collins stated that the governments decision was motivated by the uncertain economic conditions and a desire to ensure that reductions to the levy were sustainable andrew little the labour partys acc spokesman criticised this decision claiming that it was driven by the governments attempt to bring the budget into surplus and reducing the levy would provide a boost to the economy in the  budget collins announced a  billion cut in acc levies over the next two years collins said the earners and workers accounts were now fully funded after the corporation reduced the number of long term acc claimants from  to less than  in  acc’s outstanding claims liability ocl increased by  billion which lead to a net deficit of  billion the ocl measures the future cost of all existing acc claims that year also saw  million claims accepted a  increase from the previous year  billion was paid out to all new and existing claims there has been some conjecture over whether or not acc staff were paid incentives to remove long term clients off weekly compensation this was refuted by exceo ralph stewart in  that year there were  longterm claimants registered with acc – down by over  notable

henderson in  acc logos were removed from company vehicles after several staff were rammed or driven off the road by other drivers the following year a threat against former chief executive ralph stewart led to a decision for security staff to be posted outside his home there have been at least two threats to blow up a car bomb outside acc offices and police have had to be called on several other occasions in  there were a total of  recorded threats made against staff  the majority against case managers making difficult decisions on clients cases client fraudedit in  it was reported that  people have been convicted of defrauding acc of a total of more than  million over the past four years this includes clients claiming they were injured but who kept working while receiving acc benefits and medical practitioners who billed acc for more treatment than they actually provided another category of acc fraudster includes widows who continued claiming payments after their injured partners have subsequently died sometimes these payments went on for nearly  years before the fraud came to light – with one woman receiving nearly  after her husband had died staff fraudedit there have been a number of cases where acc staff have defrauded the corporation jeffrey chapman former acc chief executive from  to  was imprisoned for defrauding acc and other government agencies gavin robbins his successor from  to  was also charged with fraud but was acquitted in  a senior manager was convicted of dishonesty offences involving property leased to acc by private business interests

were relabelled as treatment injury claims ti in  a treatment injury is when an injury is caused by treatment provided by a registered health professional these injuries are not a necessary part or ordinary consequence of the treatment bronwyn pullar privacy breachedit acc has had a number of breaches of privacy relating to claimants the most significant occurred in  after the release of details of  claimants to an acc claimant bronwyn pullar pullar had been battling acc since suffering a head injury in —and had  separate complaints against the agency—only one of which was about the privacy breaches in  she and former national party president michelle boag had a meeting with two senior acc managers to discuss her concerns acc referred the matter to the police claiming pullar had threatened to go to the media about the privacy breaches if she didnt get what she wanted the police listened to a tape recording of the meeting and decided there was no case to answer in march  acc minister nick smith resigned from cabinet after it was revealed that he had written letters on behalf of pullar who was a personal friend of his while he was acc minister acc chairman john judge continued to insist his version of events was correct and as a result acc minister judith collins did not renew his tenure on the acc board the chief executive of acc ralph stewart also resigned the next day three other board members – murray hilder rob campbell and john mccliskie – also resigned the fallout from the affair continued in may  when collins sued labour mps trevor mallard and andrew little for defamation over comments they made on radio new zealand broadcasts linking her to the leak of an email from michelle boag following the release of the files the case was settled after a high court hearing in november  an independent review of acc was conducted towards the end of  and found the organisation lacked a comprehensive strategy for protecting and managing claimants information and said acc had an almost cavalier attitude toward its clients the review showed that the culture within acc enabled its staff to target clients involved in privacy breaches and

persons preinjury earnings and the cost of home or vehicle modifications for the seriously injured the scheme offers entitlements subject to various eligibility criteria acc works with trusted partners and communities to prevent injuries these initiatives include but are not limited to rugbysmart with new zealand rugby ride forever mates and dates and ‘make your home a safety zone’ with safekids historyedit acc has its origins in the  workers compensation act workers compensation for accidents act  which established a limited compensation scheme for workers who had suffered injuries where there was no directly responsible party in  a new zealand royal commission chaired by high court judge owen woodhouse recommended extending this compensation to cover all injuries on a nofault basis following this report on  april  the new zealand government established the accident compensation commission to implement the requirements of the  accident compensation act and the  amendments the act was later replaced by the injury prevention rehabilitation and compensation act  which was renamed the accident compensation act  in  the annual report  of the accident compensation commission proposed that the distinction between accidents which are covered and illness which is not should be dropped but this proposal was not taken up by the government in  the government renamed the accident compensation commission as the accident compensation corporation from  july  the fourth national government allowed private insurance operators to provide workrelated accident insurance and acc was briefly exposed to competition the fifth labour government elected in november  repealed this change and as of  july  reinstated the acc as the sole provider of accident insurance coverage administration of leviesedit acc is primarily funded through a combination of levies and government contributions income collected from each source goes into predetermined account based on the source costs relating to an injury are paid from one of these accounts based on the type and cause of the injury the four main accounts are work earners nonearners and motor vehicle there is also a fifth account treatment injury formerly medical misadventure that draws on both the earners and nonearners account account covers income sources work workrelated injuries levies collected from employers and selfemployed people the amount payable averages  of an employers payroll or income earned as of  april  rates vary depending on the employers industry and risks associated with it earners nonwork injuries by income earners levies collected in conjunction with tax deductions on income paid by employees through paye or by selfemployed people directly the amount payable is  of income earned as of  april  nonearners nonwork injuries by nonincome earners eg children elderly unemployed visitors government contribution from the general taxation pool motor vehicle injuries relating to motor vehicles on public roads levies included in the price of petrol not diesel or lpg and through motor vehicle license fees levies average  gst exclusive per vehicle per year as of july  with motorcycles and heavy vehicles paying more than average due to the increased likelihood of injury associated with these modes of transport the petrol levy set at c per litre gst exclusive treatment injury injuries as a result of medical treatment funded from the earners and nonearners accounts depending on the clients employment status acc for the selfemployed – acc coverplus extraedit acc coverplus extra was introduced by acc to provide cover for selfemployed workers and business owners that would fail to otherwise be covered adequately by the standard acc cover plus policy it works by paying an agreed level of compensation in the event of an injury resulting in time off from work with this cover already agreed upon any business would not have to prove loss of income and has certainty on their amount of cover in the event of an accident injury acc cover plus policy was designed to cover employees and would only pay  of the net taxable income with acc cover plus extra a selfemployed contractor would get  of the preagreed compensation cover until one was fit for fulltime work a business owner would be able to get compensation under acc cover plus extra even if the business continued to earn income whilst the business owner was off work injured this would not be possible with the standard policy fundingedit acc offices in palmerston north acc initially had a payasyougo funding model which collected only enough levies during the year to cover the cost of claims for that particular year in  a fully funded model was adopted whereby sufficient levies were collected to cover the lifetime cost of each injury – which might require compensation over a period of  years or more however getting acc onto a strong financial footing was not easy and in  acc posted a  billion loss – described as the biggest corporate loss in new zealands history this cost escalation is thought to have been due to an increase in the number of claims a widening of entitlements and increased costs of meeting the claims another factor was physiotherapy services being made free at the point of delivery leading to overservicing of clients between  and  this appears to have contributed to an increase in physiotherapy costs of  the  reimbursement scheme for physiotherapist services was ended and acc levies on wages and motorists were increased acc chairman john judge told the sunday startimes that it was going to take a hardnosed approach to get acc into a sustainable position this would require substantial levy increases and legislative change to get people off the scheme and back to work quicker by  acc had made good progress towards its goal of being fully funded and was  billion short of matching liabilities b with its assets b towards the end of  acc minister judith collins announced that government would not cut acc levies for the – year while the acc board and ministry of business innovation and employment had recommended reducing the levies by between  and  per cent collins stated that the governments decision was motivated by the uncertain economic conditions and a desire to ensure that reductions to the levy were sustainable andrew little the labour partys acc spokesman criticised this decision claiming that it was driven by the governments attempt to bring the budget into surplus and reducing the levy would provide a boost to the economy in the  budget collins announced a  billion cut in acc levies over the next two years collins said the earners and workers accounts were now fully funded after the corporation reduced the number of long term acc claimants from  to less than  in  acc’s outstanding claims liability ocl increased by  billion which lead to a net deficit of  billion the ocl measures the future cost of all existing acc claims that year also saw  million claims accepted a  increase from the previous year  billion was paid out to all new and existing claims there has been some conjecture over whether or not acc staff were paid incentives to remove long term clients off weekly compensation this was refuted by exceo ralph stewart in  that year there were  longterm claimants registered with acc – down by over  notable

other occasions in  there were a total of  recorded threats made against staff  the majority against case managers making difficult decisions on clients cases client fraudedit in  it was reported that  people have been convicted of defrauding acc of a total of more than  million over the past four years this includes clients claiming they were injured but who kept working while receiving acc

of  claimants to an acc claimant bronwyn pullar pullar had been battling acc since suffering a head injury in —and had  separate complaints against the agency—only one of which was about the privacy breaches in  she and former national party president michelle boag had a meeting with two senior acc managers to discuss her concerns acc referred the matter to the police claiming pullar had threatened to go to the media about the privacy breaches if she didnt get what she wanted the police listened to a tape recording of the meeting and decided there was no case to answer in march  acc minister nick smith resigned from cabinet after it was revealed that he had written letters on behalf of pullar who was a personal friend of his while he was acc minister acc chairman john judge continued to insist his version of events was correct and as a result acc minister judith collins did not renew his tenure on the acc board the chief executive of acc ralph stewart also resigned the next day three other board members – murray hilder rob campbell and john mccliskie – also resigned the fallout from the affair continued in may  when collins sued labour mps trevor mallard and andrew

the business for over  years located in australia also the company is the top five manufacturing organizations in the country but effective toward the goldenstate operating manufacturing purpose is not to do with expectations that the speed of production and dissemination showed their own weaknesses coordinated traffic is limited the lack of capacity of the team leaders and supervisors the problems are that a considerable decrease of  the growth of the companys manufacturing customer dissatisfaction reduced in quality products in addition the communication barriers between company managers and ways of thinking and management methods are different for example adam knitted manager and ron complete the manager they all adhere to the concept of my way or no way also james printing and dyeing managers do not emphasize the tasks among staff but only worry about their emotions affect productivity their aim is to provide highquality products rather than using chaos sector relations and leadership to solve the problem b list four main management skills or competencies needed for it to be competitive c explain why you feel each of the four skills or competencies list in b are important conceptual skills ability to use information to solve business problems identification of opportunities for innovation recognizing problem areas and implementing solutions selecting critical information from masses of data understanding the business uses of technology understanding the organizations business model communication skills ability to transform ideas into words and actions

mentoring diversity  working with diverse people and culture networking within the organization networking outside the organization working in teams cooperation and commitment  a from any of the leadership theories you have studied on the course identify and briefly explain which theory ron the finishing manager most closely aligns with giving evidence from the case study to support your comments ron the finishing manager does not allow his staff the liberty to take any action or make any decisions without his acknowledgment so that means the staffs should ask his opinion before make any decision and he most closely aligns with transactional theory b identify and explain the leadership styles of adam the knitting manager and james the dyeing manager giving evidence from the case study to support your comments adam the knitting manager believes in the philosophy of my way or no way she shows an example of an autocratic leadership style this type of leadership is said to be synonymous with dictatorship where only one person presides with complete authority over the followers or workers their decision has to be taken as the golden rule and is never to be questioned or challenged they plan out everything and order their subordinates to work according to their rules for instance if a company has an authoritarian leader as the managing director the employees in the company would have to work as per the rules set by him they would not be allowed to participate in any kind of decisionmaking process this may hinder the growth of the company by enhancing the productivity in short the authoritative leader has full control on those around him and has complete authority to treat them as he wants james the dyeing manager does not take much notice if workers do not do their jobs he likes to be liked by his staffs and refrains from taking any actions which might upset the team and turn them against him his style and adam’ style is the opposite so he shows an example of a laissez faire leadership style laissezfaire leadership is not ideal in situations where group members lack the knowledge or experience they need to complete tasks and make decisions some people are not good at setting their own deadlines managing their own projects and solving problems on their own in such situations projects can go offtrack and deadlines can be missed when team members do not get enough guidance or feedback from leaders laissezfaire leadership can be effective in situations where group members are highly skilled motivated and capable of working on their own while the conventional term for this style is laissezfaire and implies a completely handsoff approach many leaders still remain open and available to group members for consultation and feedback c comment on how appropriate you feel each of these leadership styles are in the current situation give two reasons for your answer to each style adam the knitting manager shows an example of an autocratic leadership style this style is not helpful to the current situation it is harmful to the communication between manager and staffs also it will create a gap and adam should give the staffs that work for him a chance and receive their suggestion instead of asking them to do work directly when the managers use this style the staffs must be working with too much pressure they will not be succeed james the dyeing manager shows an example of a laissez faire leadership style this is not available for goldenstate manufacturers if employees work with too much freedom they will become lazy even they are working with good mood the result with no quality also it is difficult to make decision because everyone has different opinion the manager should listen to all the staffs it is waste time and money  a select one motivational theory herzberg’s twofactor theory the two factor theory has had a considerable amount of practical and as well as theoretical influences in fact from a practical perspective the influence of herzbergs motivation theory can be seen at every organizational level as well as within every department from a theoretical perspective herzbergs motivation theory can be perceived as having similarities to maslows theory of need with the exception that for herzbergs theory the needs arent placed in a progressive continuum rather they are divided into two independent factors in fact herzberg would argue that the opposite of satisfaction is not dissatisfaction since different stimuli are involved in generating each of those emotional states reinforcing the fact that they are not on the same continuum as a result these states must be measured on different scales the two factor theory or herzbergs theory of motivation is still to this day holding to the test of time however through its existence there have been many critiques in  herzberg indicated that there were  other studies from various parts of the world that use different population samples that are supportive of his original findings among the criticism of the theory the list below is representative of the most cited ones the two factor theory assumes that happy employees produce more what motivates one individual might be a demotivator for another individual doesnt account for individual personality traits that could provide a different response to a motivator or hygiene factor communication management departments as a new goldenstate manufacturer pvt ltd chief executive officer mark fraser incentive business general manager carl herzbergs twofactor theory let him open the other members of the excitation lead carlcases technical management personnel hesitation in hiring new employees so that he could not do their jobs effectively using this theory of motivation mark should have a general manager with the regular meeting of the entire team a monthly meeting to the part of the management and staff the opportunity to say their new ideas and share their ideas with which will help improve the companys thus karl and his staff meet each other but also the application of this technology other factors health mark first supervise him how to deal with his subordinates and guide his policy management and management team to achieve the companys goals carl in this method there will be a united group to establish a relationship with their manager as well as their colleagues b advise adam the knitting manager of four ways he might motivate his staff so they will remain with the company adam needs to ensure that the physical needs of his staff which means that he in order to ensure that the salaries and wages of all employees must be paid time without any delay money come from wages is an important part of the life of his staff without it they could not afford their basic needs in their daily lives do not have the money they will not be able to buy food another way to motivate his staff adam respect of his subordinates in order to gain their respect and his team completed their purpose way equally important is that he received from staff feedback and analysis of the strengths and weaknesses as a result adam is able to monitor and evaluate progress as well as how to deal with the problem to solve these problems such as bulletin boards email meetings video conferencing and telephone with the team to have an open communication line monitoring progress finally adam can adjust his leadership style to be more open more space and provde a better working environment to his employees work performance to meet the skills needs of the selfrealization of his staff he can motivate his employees in their work to become more creative innovative applications properly as long as the changes can help improve the quality of their work and effectively to achieve their goals adam am pleased to open to accept changes  mark the ceo has hold ron the finishing manager that he should delegate more you are a assigned to coach ron though the steps he must take to delegate effectively aexplain to ron  benefits of delegation  using information from the case study to ill ustrate your comments the benefits of the delegation ron can be achieved • accountability some of the specific tasks assigned to his staff ron employees can do a better job because they can feel that they have personal accountability results of the tasks they perform despite the fact that the final decision and responsibility to remain in the decision delegation who hand worker  employee who is assigned the task will be the implementation of responsible for their work in addition ron lost his staff to minimize the risk in the finishing department some accountability results are set out below  performance will be improved  better employee participation and participation  increase employee commitment and ability to feel  allow for more innovation and creativity  better employees and their job satisfaction and morale • opportunities for staff development his staff assigned new tasks so that they feel that they have more responsibility and his staff have the opportunity to be stretched and the challenges of the new position because you want to open several employees every day work and do the same tasks day after day appoint ron can give employees the opportunity to develop more professional skills and work experience this experiential development of the best things most cost manager sometimes monitoring and presentation • empowerment finish manager can benefit from the delegation of the development department ron this will help to build and strengthen his personal capacity and his staff will be valued more respect for his staff and superiors delegation here too there are some more benefits streamline his workload ron can have more time to focus more on the essentials of management tasks his staff will feel more motivated and selfconfidence because they already trust as well as the stress level of the entire labor force also declined b explain to ron  steps needed to be taken for effective delegation the need for effective delegation the first step is to select a team this step includes the causes and attributes of the person  team appointed to know the goals and objectives of the program whether it is a delegate should be aware that the idea of a delegate the second step is to assess their requirements and needs their ability to do the task and how they understand their duties and responsibilities explained they are assigned capacities and specific job or task has been delegated training should be provided if it is considered necessary the chosen people should be trusted and have the basic skills of a manager the third step is the expected results including the final product of a task and its corresponding result negotiations the discussion a prerequisite to participate in other services required by the financial budget functional equipment and production such as the work done the date stated deadline and reviews while observing their reactions give directions at the same time the fourth step support and communication with other departments and section chief task is delegated as far as possible should be a delegate is responsible for notifying the team about delegating responsibilities the final step is the evaluation after the evaluation of work performance it is important to let others know of their progress and whether they are able to achieve the target specified by the department ron should discuss things did not go well this point needs to be improved staff solve their reaction to the task and results  whether it may be a good result or not always the goal has not been achieved to determine the point need to be developed in order to pass to the

available in a personal injury lawsuit by david goguen jd share on google plus share on facebook if youre considering filing a personal injury lawsuit over a car accident slip and fall or any other kind of injury you may be wondering what is my case really worth the answer comes down to damages  figuring out what your injuries have cost you monetarily physically and mentally and in some cases whether the defendants conduct should be punished in a personal injury case money damages are paid to an injured person the plaintiff by the person or company who is found to be legally responsible for the accident the defendant or their insurer a damage award can be agreed upon after a negotiated settlement  among the parties their insurance companies and their attorneys for example  or may be ordered by a judge or jury following a court trial to learn more about how insurance companies value a claim after an accident see nolos article how do insurers value an injury claim below youll find an explanation of the different kinds of damages that are common in many personal injury cases and how a personal injury damages award can be affected by the plaintiffs action or inaction compensatory damages in personal injury cases most personal injury damages are classified as compensatory meaning that they are intended to compensate the injured plaintiff for what was lost due to the accident or injury a compensatory damages award is meant to make the injured plaintiff whole again from a monetary standpoint to the extent thats possible this means trying to put a dollar figure on all the consequences of an accident some compensatory damages are relatively easy to quantify  like reimbursement for property damage and medical bills but its harder to place a monetary value on pain and suffering or the inability to enjoy hobbies because of physical limitations caused by lingering accidentrelated injuries heres a rundown of the different types of compensatory damages that are common in many personal injury cases medical treatment a personal injury damages award almost always includes the cost of medical care associated with the accident  reimbursement for treatment youve already received and compensation for the estimated cost of medical care youll need in the future because of the accident income you may be entitled to compensation for the accidents impact on your salary and wages  not just income youve already lost but also the money you would have been able to make in the future were it not for the accident in personal injury legalese a damage award based on future income is characterized as compensation for an accident victims loss of earning capacity property loss if any vehicles clothing or other items were damaged as a result of the accident youll likely be entitled to reimbursement for repairs or compensation for the fair market value of the property that was lost pain and suffering you may be entitled to get compensation for pain and serious discomfort you suffered during the accident and in its immediate aftermath  also for any ongoing pain that can be attributed to the accident learn more what is pain and suffering emotional distress usually linked to more serious accidents emotional distress damages are meant to compensate a personal injury plaintiff for the psychological impact of an injury  including fear anxiety and sleep loss some states consider emotional distress as part of any pain and suffering damage that is awarded to a personal injury plaintiff loss of enjoyment when injuries caused by an accident keep you from enjoying daytoday pursuits like hobbies exercise and other recreational activities you may be entitled to receive loss of enjoyment damages loss of consortium in personal injury cases loss of consortium damages typically relate to the impact the injuries have on the plaintiffs relationship with their spouse  the loss of companionship or the inability to maintain a sexual relationship for example some states also consider the separate impact on the relationship between a parent and their child when one is injured in some cases loss of consortium damages are awarded directly to the affected family member rather than to the injured plaintiff punitive damages in personal injury cases in cases where the defendants conduct is deemed particularly egregious or outrageously careless a personal injury plaintiff may be awarded punitive damages on top of any compensatory damages award punitive damages stem from a rationale that is quite different from the justification tied to compensatory damages which attempt to make someone whole punitive damages are awarded to the injured plaintiff but the real goal of these kinds of damages is to punish the defendant for its conduct  to hit them in the pocketbook so to speak  and to act as a deterrent since it isnt unusual for punitive damage awards to top tens of millions of dollars most states have set some type of cap on punitive damage awards in personal injury cases how plaintiffs actions or inaction can affect a damages award in some cases an injured persons role in causing an accident  or their inaction after being injured  can diminish the amount of damages available in a personal injury case comparative negligence if youre at fault even partially for the accident that caused your injuries chances are that any damage award will reflect that thats because most states adhere to a comparative negligence standard that links damages to degree of fault in a personal injury case contributory negligence in the small handful of states that follow the concept of contributory negligence for personal injury lawsuits you may not be able to recover any compensation at all if youre deemed partially to blame for the accident after the accident failure to mitigate damages the law in most states expects plaintiffs in personal injury cases to take reasonable steps to minimize or mitigate the financial impact of the harm caused by the accident if an injured plaintiff just sits back and rests on their proverbial laurels when it isnt reasonable to do so by failing to get necessary medical treatment after an accident and making their injuries much worse for example a damages award might be significantly reduced for more information on defense strategies that can counter an injury claim read nolos article defenses in personal
