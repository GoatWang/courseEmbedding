godaddycom llc godaddys motion to preclude testimony of defendants damages expert gregory smith docs   at  the court now rules on the mot ion i background godaddy moves the court to exclude the testimony of defendants damages expert gregory smith as unreliable under federal rule of evidence fre  id godaddy contends that mr smiths testimony is unreliable for two reasons  mr smith inappropriately accounted for noninfringing features in his royalty rate analysis rather than apportioning the royalty base and  he applied the entire market value rule without demonstrating that the patented features form the basis of consumer demand as required by binding federal circuit precedent id at  according to godaddy the law is clear that there is only one scenario where a patentee may use the entire market value of an accused product as its royalty base without further apportioning that base as smith did which is under the entire market value rule    doc  at  because godaddy believes mr smith did not satisfy the entire market value rule emvrs requirements it contends that should be the end of the inquiry id in response rpost insists that mr smith unequivocally did not apply the emvr because the accused products are the smallest saleable unit ssu doc  at  according to rpost the federal circuit has not defined a particular formula for apportioning damages for ssu products and mr smith properly followed the federal circuitendorsed apportionment factors outlined in georgiapacific corp v us plywood corp  fsupp  sdny  id specifically rpost insists that the federal circuit has never held that a royalty base must be apportioned to account for noninfringing elements in lieu of the corresponding royalty rate id at  further rpost contends that the accused products are not multicomponent products but that the accused products as a whole infringe its patents id at  nonetheless by apportioning the operating margin of the accused products to obtain the royalty rate rpost argues that mr smith calculated a rate that reflects the patented technologys contribution to the profitability of the accused products id at  the question before the court is relatively straightforward did mr smith calculate damages using a methodology that is consistent with federal circuit precedent there are two general methods for determining infringement compensation  the lost profits method which estimates a patentees lost income due to the alleged infringement or  the application of a reasonable royalty rate to a royalty base see lucent techs inc v gateway inc  fd   fed cir  in this case mr smith calculated rposts damages using the reasonable royalty method see doc  at  ii legal standards a expert opinion testimony in patent infringement litigation regional circuit

expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case fed r evid  in daubert v merrell dow pharmaceuticals inc the supreme court of the united states held that fre  imposes an obligation upon trial courts to ensure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant but reliable  us    thus fre  cloaks trial courts with the role of gatekeeper to determine pursuant to fre a whether expert testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand id at  it is the proponent of the expert who has the burden of proving admissibility lust v merrell dow pharms inc  fd   th cir  daubert which concerned the admission of expert testimony based upon scientific studies enumerated several nonexclusive factors that a trial court may use to determine whether testimony based upon scientific knowledge is sufficiently reliable these factors include whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication the known or potential rate of error the existence and maintenance of standards controlling the techniques application and whether the technique has been generally accepted in the relevant scientific community daubert  us at  nevertheless the supreme court hinted that a trial courts gatekeeping obligation under fre  extended to all forms of expert testimony not just those concerning scientific knowledge see id at  n our discussion is limited to the scientific context because that is the nature of the expertise offered here the court emphasized that the inquiry was a flexible one with its overarching subject as the scientific validity and thus the evidentiary relevance and reliability—of the principles that underlie a proposed submission id at  in kumho tire co v carmichael the supreme court clarified that a trial courts gatekeeping obligation indeed applies to all expert testimony even if for example that testimony is based upon experiential or other nonscientific knowledge  us    although a trial court may find the factors enumerated in daubert to be appropriate for use in determining the reliability of challenged expert testimony even for testimony based upon other than scientific knowledge id at  it is not constrained to such questions the trial court has considerable leeway in deciding in a particular case how to go about determining whether particular expert testimony is reliable id at  thus where such testimonys factual basis data principles methods or their application are called sufficiently into question    the trial judge must determine whether the testimony has a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of the relevant discipline id quoting daubert  us at  a trial court must do more than ensure that expert testimony is reliable however it must also ensure that such testimony is relevant to an issue in the case fre  requires a valid    connection to the pertinent inquiry as a precondition to admissibility daubert  us

llc  fd  fed cir  a judge must be cautious to not overstep its gatekeeping role and weigh facts evaluate the correctness of conclusions impose its own preferred methodology or judge credibility including the credibility of one expert over another these tasks are reserved solely for the fact finder b calculating damages under the reasonable royalty method the starting point for damages in a patent infringement lawsuit is  usc §  which limits damages to those adequate to compensate for the infringement  usc §  for reasonable royalties the damages must reflect the use made of the invention by the infringer id the most common method to determine a reasonable royalty is the hypothetical negotiation approach which attempts to ascertain the royalty upon which the parties would have agreed had they successfully negotiated an agreement just before infringement began lucent  fd at  although a hypothetical negotiation necessarily involves an element of approximation and uncertainty id at  it must be based on sound economic and factual predicates laserdynamics  fd at  quotation omitted a reasonable royalty may be a lumpsum payment not calculated on a per unit basis but it may also be and often is a running payment that varies with the number of infringing units in that event it generally has two prongs a royalty base and a royalty rate virnetx inc v cisco sys inc  fd   fed cir  thus to calculate a reasonable running royalty two steps are required first it requires the determination of a royalty base or the revenue pool implicated by the infringement the second determination is the royalty rate or the percentage of that pool adequate to compensate the plaintiff for that infringement dynetix design sols inc v synopsys inc  us dist lexis  at  nd cal aug   quoting cornell univ v hewlettpackard co  fsuppd   ndny  the federal circuit has warned that where small elements of multicomponent products are accused of infringement calculating a royalty on the entire product carries a considerable risk that the patentee will be improperly compensated for noninfringing components of that product laserdynamics  fd at  for that reason it is generally required that royalties be based not on the entire product but instead on the smallest salable patentpracticing unit id quoting cornell  f supp d at   once the ssu has been identified the royalty must be further apportioned to reflect the incremental value that the patented invention adds to the end product commonwealth sci  indus research organisation v cisco sys inc  fd   fed cir  quoting ericsson inc v dlink sys inc  fd   fed cir  see eg uniloc usa inc v microsoft corp  fd   fed cir  holding that a patentee must in every case give evidence tending to separate or apportion the defendants profits and the patentees damages between the patented feature and the unpatented features quoting garretson v clark  us    as the federal circuit recently explained the ssu approach was intended to produce a royalty base much more closely tied to the claimed invention than the entire market value of the accused products    in other words the requirement that a patentee identify damages associated with the smallest salable patentpracticing unit is simply a step toward meeting the requirement of apportionment where the smallest salable unit is in fact a multicomponent product containing several noninfringing features with no relation to the patented feature    the patentee must do more to estimate what portion of the value of that product is attributable to the patented technology to hold otherwise would permit the entire market value exception to swallow the rule of apportionment virnetx  fd at  emphasis added in  the federal circuit clarified that a patentee need not apportion a royalty base in lieu of the royalty rate in every case in ericsson a case involving a randencumbered patent the federal circuit further explained apportionment principles in light of virnetx as follows where multicomponent products are involved the governing rule is that the ultimate combination of royalty base and royalty rate must reflect the value attributable to the infringing features of the product and no more virnetx  fd at      when the accused infringing products have both patented and unpatented features measuring this value requires a determination of the value added by such features indeed apportionment is required even for nonroyalty forms of damages a jury must ultimately apportion the defendants profits and the patentees damages between the patented feature and the unpatented features using reliable and tangible evidence garretson  us at  logically an economist could do this in various ways—by careful selection of the royalty base to reflect the value added by the patented feature where that differentiation is possible by adjustment of the royalty rate so as to discount the value of a products nonpatented features or by a combination thereof the essential requirement is that the ultimate reasonable royalty award must be based on the incremental value that the patented invention adds to the end product our cases have added to that governing legal rule an important evidentiary principle the point of the evidentiary principle is to help our jury system reliably implement the substantive statutory requirement of apportionment of royalty damages to the inventions value the principle applicable specifically to the choice of a royalty base is that where a multicomponent product is at issue and the patented feature is not the item which imbues the combination of the other features with value care must be taken to avoid misleading the jury by placing undue emphasis on the value of the entire product it is not that an appropriately apportioned royalty award could never be fashioned by starting with the entire market value of a multicomponent product—by for instance dramatically reducing the royalty rate to be applied in those cases—it is that reliance on the entire market value might mislead the jury who may be less equipped to understand the extent to which the royalty rate would need to do the work in such instances see laserdynamics  fd at   barring the use of too high a royalty base—even if mathematically offset by a low enough royalty rate—because such a base carries a considerable risk of misleading a jury into overcompensating stating that such a base cannot help but skew the damages horizon for the jury and make a patentees proffered damages amount appear modest by comparison quoting uniloc  fd at  thus where the entire value of a machine as a marketable article is properly and legally attributable to the patented feature the damages owed to the patentee may be calculated by reference to that value id where it is not however courts must insist on a more realistic starting point for the royalty calculations by juries—often the ssu and at times even less virnetx  fd at   fd at  at bottom the essential requirement for an experts damages analysis is that the damages figure be based on the incremental value that the patented invention adds to the end product id at  the emvr is a narrow exception to the apportionment requirement and allows for the recovery of damages based on the value of an entire apparatus containing several features when the feature patented constitutes the basis for customer demand twm mfg co v dura corp  fd   fed cir  see versata software inc v sap am inc  fd   fed cir  a patentee may assess damages based on the entire market value of the accused product only where the patented feature creates the basis for customer demand or substantially creates the value of the component parts quotation omitted thus if the patented feature creates the basis for consumer demand of a multicomponent product a royalty may be calculated based on the value of the complete product even though the patent does not cover the complete product see laserdynamics  fd at  lucent  fd at  the strict standards curtailing the emvr ensure that the royalty does not overreach and encompass components not covered by the patent laserdynamics  fd at  thus it is not enough to merely show that the patented feature is viewed as valuable important or even essential to the use of the overall product or that a product without the patented feature would not be commercially viable id at  instead a reasonable royalty analysis requires a court to    carefully tie proof of damages to the claimed inventions footprint in the market place resqnetcom inc v lansa inc  fd   fed cir  to that end the federal circuit prudently cautioned against reliance on the entire market value of the accused products because it cannot help but skew the damages horizon for the jury regardless of the contribution of the patented component to this revenue virnetx  fd at  quoting uniloc  fd at  see laserdynamics  fd at  admission of an entire products revenues which have no demonstrated correlation to the value of the patented feature alone only serve to make a patentees proffered damages amount appear modest by comparison and to artificially inflate the jurys damages calculation beyond that which is adequate to compensate for the infringement quotation omitted if a patentee fails to show that the patented technology satisfies the emvrs requirements principles of apportionment apply id thus where multicomponent products are involved the governing rule is that the ultimate combination of royalty base and royalty rate must reflect the value attributable to the infringing features of the product and no more ericsson  fd at  citing virnetx  fd at  in this regard the patentee must give evidence tending to separate or apportion the defendants profits and the patentees damages between the patented feature and the unpatented features and such evidence must be reliable and tangible and not conjectural or speculative laserdynamics  fd at  citing garretson  us at  in this regard the supreme court and federal circuits precedents do not allow consideration of the entire market value of accused products for minor patent improvements simply by asserting a low enough royalty rate uniloc  fd at  citations omitted see virnetx  fd at  deeming defective a jury instruction that mistakenly suggested that when the ssu is used as the royalty base there is necessarily no further constraint on the selection of the base iii analysis godaddy contends that mr smiths damages report is unreliable as to both the feldbau and tomkow patents see doc  the court will analyze each in turn a feldbau patent  mr smiths approach applying the wellknown hypothetical negotiation approach mr smith determined that authentix authentication technologies ltd authentix and godaddy would have agreed to a  running royalty of the accused products net revenues doc  at  according to mr smith his royalty rate and royalty base are appropriate because  the accused products are essentially the smallest saleable unit   of godaddys profits for the accused products are attributable to the feldbau patent as godaddy marketed the authentication functionality as one of nine major features   is less than  of godaddys operating margins for the accused products  authentix was in financial distress at the time of the hypothetical negotiation and  rpost rejected a licensing offer from authentix that included a royalty rate of  increasing to  of total revenues derived from the feldbau patents technology and  is half of this offer id at  thus mr smith attempted to separate rposts damages from godaddys profits by apportioning the royalty rate instead of the royalty base id  analysis to begin the court is highly skeptical of mr smiths swift conclusion that profits attributable to the feldbau patents technology constitute  of the accused products overall profits in making this determination the only evidence mr smith relies on is one internet marketing webpage with an indian internet country code toplevel domain and a statement from godaddy marketing official eric scott gilbert that a basic expectation for an email marketing service is knowledge that content has been sent without tampering see doc  at  while it is true that shaky but admissible evidence is to be attacked by crossexamination contrary evidence and attention to the burden of proof not exclusion primiano  fd at  the evidence relied on by mr smith in his report is irrelevant conjectural and simply not enough to satisfy daubert the federal circuit is clear that a patentees evidence to separate or apportion the defendants profits and the patentees damages between the patented feature and the unpatented features    must be reliable and tangible    not conjectural or speculative laserdynamics  fd at  citing garretson  us at  this is not a case where mr smith relied on shaky evidence that should be weighed by the jury—the evidence is completely irrelevant to the apportionment inquiry how godaddy markets the accused products to its indian consumers is immaterial to how the accused products function within the united states particularly without any evidence showing that godaddys products are the same across both countries as to mr gilberts testimony there is no indication that he ever stated that  of the accused products profits are attributable to the patented technology simply put mr smith relies on entirely irrelevant evidence and vague qualitative notions of the relative importance of the patented technology to assert that  of the accused products profits should be apportioned to the patented technology see laserdynamics  fd at  this does not satisfy daubert even if there was reliable and tangible evidence to support mr smiths  apportionment figure rpost and mr smith failed to provide the court with any evidence showing that the accused products are in fact the ssu and it is rposts burden to do so see eg uniloc  fd at  noting that a patentee bears the burden of proving damages by sufficiently tying the expert testimony on damages to the facts of the case citations omitted the only sentence in mr smiths report that even arguably identifies the accused products as the ssu is opaque at best while the accused services are essentially the smallest saleable unit these other features contribute to the overall value of the service doc  at  the federal circuit makes clear that an ssu containing infringing and noninfringing features may be used as the basis for a reasonable royalty only if the product overall bears a sufficiently close relation to the claimed functionality virnetx  fd at  mr smith did not support his loose statement with any evidence nor did he expound upon his assertion during his deposition see docs  at   at  while problematic rposts unsupported claim that the accused products are the ssu vanishes in the shadow of godaddys evidence tending to demonstrate the exact opposite see doc  at  in short there is no evidence establishing that the accused products overall bear a sufficiently close relation to the feldbau patent technology such that the accused products total net revenue may be used as a royalty base virnetx  fd at  finally the problems with mr smiths analysis are camouflaged by his conflated pronouncement that the  royalty rate is well below the expectation of authentix half of the initial rate    doc  at  in his report mr smith considered the licensing offer rpost received from authentix that included a  royalty of total revenues generated by the feldbau patents technology id at   pragmatically this licensing offer concerned a royalty based on revenues generated by the patented technology only in contrast the feldbau patents technology—essential as it may be— is not the accused products only feature see docs  at    at   at  in fact mr smith observed that in this case there are several features that    drive consumer demand doc  at  and even attempted to apportion  of the accused products profits to those noninfringing components id at  because authentixs licensing offer to rpost was based on revenues generated by one patented technology while the accused products generate revenue due to multiple noninfringing features beyond the feldbau patents technology mr smith incorrectly assumed that the terms of the authentix offer were suitable comparators for the terms of a licensing agreement between authentix and godaddy without highlighting the circumstantial differences see eg virnetx  fd at  licenses relied on by the patentee in proving damages must be sufficiently comparable to the hypothetical license at issue in suit although the circumstances need not be identical see ericsson  fd at  it was disingenuous for mr smith to conflate the authentix offer with the hypothetical negotiation without discussing the fundamental differences see id holding that licensebased evidence can be relevant and reliable if the expert testimony explains the need to discount reliance on a given license in order to account only for the value attributed to the licensed technology rpost insists that there may be more than one reliable method for estimating a reasonable royalty doc  at  quoting apple  fd at  although this statement is certainly true the data utilized in mr smiths methodology is not sufficiently tied to the facts of the case summit  llc v samsung elecs co  fd   fed cir  none of the examples listed by the federal circuit in apple as reliable methods—such as using the royalty rate from sufficiently comparable licenses valuing the infringed features based upon comparable features in the marketplace or estimateing the value of the benefit provided by the infringed features by a sic comparing the accused product to noninfringing alternatives  fd at —entitle mr smith to commit the foundational errors peppered throughout his report mr smith failed to provide evidence showing that the accused products are the ssu or that the accused products have a sufficiently close relation to the claimed functionality of the feldbau patents asserted claims such that the accused products net revenues may be used as the royalty base see virnetx  fd at  nor did mr smith point to any reliable tangible evidence to support his testimony that  of the accused products profits is directly attributable to the feldbau patents technology finally mr smith incorrectly assumed that the licensing offer authentix made to rpost was an unblemished indicator of authentixs expectations for licensing negotiations with godaddy for these reasons the portion of mr smiths damages report pertaining to the feldbau patent is excludable as unreliable under federal circuit law and fre  b tomkow patents godaddy also challenges mr smiths determination that rpost and godaddy would have entered into a licensing agreement for the tomkow patents technology with a  royalty of the accused products net revenues doc  at  godaddy relies primarily on the arguments it made in regards to the feldbau patent namely that mr smith did not apportion the royalty base and failed to prove that the tomkow patents technology drove consumer demand for the accused products id at  in response rpost contends that mr smiths  royalty rate was reasonable and calculated pursuant to federal circuit law doc  at  as before rpost asserts that apportionment of the royalty base is not required by the federal circuit id  mr smiths approach mr smith begins his analysis of the tomkow patents by observing that in  rpost was targeting penetration of between  and  of the relevant market as being appropriate for its services and was achieving margins of around  after sales costs if both parties were charging the same prices this indicates that the cost to rpost of licensing a party such as godaddy would equate to  and  of godaddys revenue doc  at  mr smith continues by describing that rposts prices are at least  times godaddys prices even at a much lower target penetration rate rposts effective cost of licensing would still be a multiple many times the  to  range calculated above in fact even at half of the actual price multiple and a  target penetration rate rposts expected cost of licensing would equate to a royalty of greater than  of net sales id ultimately mr smith concludes that because email marketing programs are comprised of four main elements and the tomkow patents constitute the core of one element a reasonable royalty for the portfolio of the tomkow patents    is  of net revenue id at  according to mr smith while this would not fully compensate rpost for the potential costs of licensing it would provide it with a revenue stream from its patents id at   analysis notwithstanding the inherent difficulties of estimating damages in a patent infringement lawsuit the court is perplexed as to how mr smith determined that  of the accused products net revenue was a reasonable royalty rate initially mr smith and rpost again fail to present any evidence showing that the accused products are the ssu as noted above this is rposts burden see uniloc  fd at  notwithstanding this fundamental issue additional problems plague mr smiths report as well to begin mr smith does not explain how rposts targeted market penetration rate and operating margins can lead to a royalty rate based on godaddys revenue even if the parties were charging the same prices there are numerous other reasons why a consumer might choose to utilize the accused products services rather than those offered by rpost as mr smith explained there are several essential noninfringing features of the accused products such as message creation contact management and transmission that might entice a consumer to select godaddys offerings doc  at  in fact godaddy presented survey evidence showing that other features of the accused products drove consumer demand see docs  at   at  to that end mr smith presents no evidence that every targeted rpost customer would select godaddys products if the parties entered into a licensing agreement instead mr smith assumes that if the parties had entered into a licensing agreement then all of rposts targeted customers would have flocked—exclusively—to godaddy for these reasons using godaddys revenue as a royalty base is questionable at best beyond these evidentiary deficiencies because mr smith used the entire net revenue stream of the accused products as the royalty base the royalty rate would need to do the work ericsson  fd at  to that end mr smith failed to explain how his  royalty rate adequately separated godaddys profits from rposts damages ie did the work bizarrely mr smith does not even mention in his report that he apportioned for any noninfringing features when he determined that  was an appropriate royalty rate see doc  at  in spite of rposts attempts to clarify mr smiths royalty rate see doc  at  it appears that mr smith plucked  out of thin air see laserdynamics  fd at  rejecting an apportionment that was plucked out of thin air based on vague qualitative notions of the relative importance of the accused technology furthermore mr smith failed to identify how and why the actual price multiple applies to this analysis but concluded that half of the actual price multiple with a  target penetration rate means that the royalty would be  or higher of net sales doc  at  mr smith never describes the significance of those factors or why he selected a market penetration rate less than rposts targeted rate the mere fact of selecting a lower rate is not sufficient—there must be reliable and tangible evidence tending to separate or apportion the defendants profits and the patentees damages between the patented feature and the unpatented features laserdynamics  fd at  instead mr smith simply states in a vacuum that  of the accused products net revenue is appropriate although mr smith implied that  was a conservative estimate in light of rposts potential costs of licensing doc  at  this arbitrary gesture did not come with the reward of not supporting the gesture with evidence accordingly the problems plaguing mr smiths damages analysis for the feldbau patent arise again with the tomkow patents mr smith failed to provide any evidence showing that his royalty rate was justified and instead grounded the majority of his analysis on speculation and conjecture mr smith also failed to provide any evidence showing that the accused products are the ssu most problematic however is the fact that mr smith did not even attempt to apportion his royalty rate and simply pronounced that  of the accused products net revenue was adequate the arbitrariness found in mr smiths conclusions violates federal circuit precedent c conclusion for patentsinsuit for the reasons set forth above the court concludes that the conclusions of mr smiths damages report are inadmissible there is no evidence in the record to show that the accused products are in fact the ssu regardless of whether or not the accused products are the ssu mr smith was obligated to attempt the exceedingly difficult and errorprone task of discerning the patented technologys value relative to all other components in the accused products laserdynamics  fd at  in this regard there is no reliable and tangible evidence to support mr smiths selected royalty rates for the feldbau patent or the tomkow patents accordingly mr smiths report is excludable d rposts request to cure rpost requests that the court give it an opportunity to cure any deficiencies in mr smiths report doc  at  in consideration of rposts due process rights and because rpost would be left without any real evidence of damages at trial the court will permit it one more opportunity to offer a new expert report on damages see eg synopsys  us dist lexis  at  cornell  f

ordered that godaddys motion to preclude testimony of defendants damages expert gregory smith doc  is granted it is further ordered that by no later than  pm on monday may   rpost is permitted to serve a new expert damages report on godaddy it is finally ordered that by no later than monday may   godaddy is permitted to redepose rposts expert and serve on rpost any update to its own expert

hypothetical negotiation in  the feldbau patent was owned by a company called authentix doc  at  on february   rpost acquired the feldbau patent from authentix along with another us patent and certain foreign patents for  id thus mr smith crafted his hypothetical negotiation between authentix and godaddy id  in its response brief rpost claims that authentixs proposed royalty rate increased from  to

indian marketing website is misplaced  rpost argues that this is not a case where small elements of multicomponent products are accused of infringement rather rpost accuses godaddys email marketing products as a whole of infringement doc  at  citations omitted rpost however points to no evidence to support this argument and the record evidence rposts infringement positions and the multiple technological features that comprise the accused products all point to the contrary at the outset rpost unequivocally asserts that only certain technological components of the accused products infringe the tomkow and feldbau patents and argues that mr smith expressly accounted for the noninfringing aspects of the accused products by excluding them from his damages estimate doc  at  see doc  at  the accused email marketing services do contain features that are not covered by the patentsinsuit these facts alone make it inconsistent for rpost to claim that the accused products are not multicomponent products that violate its patents as a whole furthermore despite rposts claim to the contrary this is not a case where the patented technology fully represents the product that is the subject of the claims see astrazeneca ab v apotex corp  fd   fed cir  instead numerous noninfringing features are integrated into the accused products such as message creation transmission contacts management user interface storage and customer support see docs  at   consequently rpost is not asserting—nor has it ever asserted—that the accused products as a whole violate its patents see emerson elec co v suzhou cleva elec appliance co ltd  wl  at  ed mo dec   rejecting patentees argument that patented feature constituted the accused product as a whole because it was inconsistent with experts report and the record  also problematic is the lack of any evidence supporting rposts targeted market rate the court questions what would prevent rpost from claiming a  targeted market thereby dramatically increasing the damages figure  the court notes the paradigm shift in mr smiths methodology between the feldbau and tomkow patents for the feldbau patent mr smith attempted to apportion a percentage of the accused products operating margin to the feldbau patents technology as to the tomkow patents however mr smith did not attempt to apportion the accused products operating margin at all instead mr smith nakedly asserted that  of the accused products net revenue was an appropriate royalty rate with no mention of the operating margin  godaddy argues that even if smith apportioned the royalty rate    smiths obligation to apportion the royalty base is not satisfied by selecting an ssu that encompasses unpatented features and even if the entire accused products were the ssu    smith still failed to apportion a royalty base skipping that step to apportion the royalty rate instead doc  at  this statement is not an accurate recitation of federal circuit law for multicomponent ssu products with noninfringing features the federal circuit requires a patentee to apportion the patentees damages from the alleged infringers profits there is not however a brightline rule obligating a patentee to apportion the royalty base in lieu of the royalty rate in every circumstance see ericsson  fd at  logically an economist could apportion damages from profits in various ways—by careful selection of the royalty base to reflect the value added by the patented feature where that differentiation is possible by adjustment of the royalty rate so as to discount the value of a products nonpatented features or by a combination thereof virnetx  fd at  a patentees obligation to apportion damages only to the patented feature does not end with the identification of the smallest salable unit if that unit contains signification unpatented features indeed when a multicomponent product is at issue the federal circuit instead requires that the ultimate combination of royalty base and royalty rate must reflect the value attributable to the infringing features of the product and no more ericsson  fd at  citing virnetx  fd at  in infringement litigation a patentee is entitled to the total profit earned by the infringing party for the unauthorized use of a patentees patent  usc §  under mr smiths approach the ultimate damages figure is not more than the profits attributable to the patented technology had mr smith first reduced the royalty base by  and then multiplied that base by godaddys operating margin thus godaddys complaint that mr smiths theory would result in rpost disgorging all of godaddys profits earned from the patented features doc  at  is baseless see golight inc v walmart stores inc  fd   fed cir  there is no rule that a royalty be no higher than the infringers net profit margin citation omitted  should mr smith continue his use of the accused products total net revenues as a royalty base the court reminds rpost that it will be given only one opportunity to cure and emphasizes the hazards of using a multicomponent products total net revenues as a royalty base see eg ericsson  fd at  highlighting the evidentiary concerns with using the total net revenues as a royalty base virnetx  fd at   rejecting damages award because patent covered security over networks used in apples iphone ipod ipad and mac computers but damages were based on the market value of the products laserdynamics  fd at  rejecting damages award because patent only covered an optical disc drive but damages were based on the entire computer uniloc  fd at   rejecting damages award because patent only covered microsofts product activation feature but royalty was based on sales of microsoft office and windows lucent  fd at  rejecting damages award because patent at issue covered only the datepicker tool in microsoft outlook and was only a very small component of a much larger software program to be sure mr smith must provide evidence that the accused products are in fact the ssu and if the ssu still contains significant unpatented features with no relation to the patented feature virnetx  fd at  the ultimate combination of royalty base and royalty rate must reflect the value attributable to the infringing features of the product and no more ericsson  fd at  citing virnetx  fd at   any update to godaddys expert report must be limited to refutingaddressing changes to rposts expert report  in other words rpost will not be permitted to redepose godaddys expert after he or she amends godaddys report nor will either party have any other

technology companies rpost communications ltd the los angelesbased creator of the rmail secure and certified electronic communications company that also is a patent holding company claimed godaddy’s email marketing product infringed on a broad patent regarding how email works including how email bounces back when sent to an address that is no longer active enlarge brian lacorte since rpost was threatening to sue godaddy nyse gddy the domain name registrar and small business tech provider instead decided to “take a stand” in january  and filed its own lawsuit against rpost in january  arizona federal court judge james teilborg agreed with godaddy granting a motion for summary judgment june  that said rpost’s patents were invalid and in turn the issue was moot “godaddy believes that it is important to vigorously defend itself and the industries in which it serves against meritless patent claims as was the case in this matter” said nima kelly godaddy executive vice president and general counsel in an email “we are pleased with the court’s decision showing that the asserted patent claims are invalid and should not be enforced against godaddy or anyone else” godaddy’s legal team said they thought rposts patents were invalid because they were so broad said brian lacorte a ballard spahr partner and head of the firm’s phoenix intellectual property team that represented godaddy in the case “what’s happening in these patent cases is that tech companies are saying these patents are invalid because they cover the most basic abstract concepts” lacorte said “rpost obtained patents that cover the basic functions of how email works the patents claimed to cover collecting information and tracking email to its point of destination” godaddy wasn’t seeking money just a ruling rpost counter sued for infringement and requested millions of dollars in damages lacorte said the case is the first major decision in the district of arizona on this issue following a us supreme court ruling in alice corp v cls bank international in which the court laid out new guidelines for patent eligibility “by invalidating these patents it’s a considerable ruling because it not only allows godaddy to operate but it allows other companies in the email marketing space to avoid these rpost patents” lacorte said in the past rpost has sued dozens of large tech companies including amazon adobe and ebaypaypal and has many lawsuits still making its way through court involving these patents rpost is in active litigation against tech companies such as epsilon experian strongmail docusign and symantec since godaddy is the first to actually get a judgment striking down these patents it could impact the ongoing cases lacorte said godaddy’s case was set to go to trial in august but the trial was vacated because of the judge’s decision rpost did not respond to an emailed request for comment many tech companies are taking a stand against patent infringement claims by filing suit instead of waiting to be sued lacorte said “this took a lot of perseverance and diligence” lacorte said “this costs large and small companies a lot of money at some point you stand firm and say you’re not going to pay godaddy took a stand and the judge gave good guidance” hayley ringle covers technology and startups for the phoenix business journal enlarge nima kelly is godaddys… more

inc v rpost communications ltd – ptab finds electronic messaging a “technological invention” outside ambit of covered business method review friday july   in experian marketing solutions inc v rpost communications ltd case cbm june   the patent trial and appeal board denied a request for covered business method patent review even though it found that the patent included claims for “performing data processing or other operations used in the practice administration or management of a financial product or service”  experian petition experianmktgsolutionsvrpostcommltdcbm when determining whether to grant cbm review the board considers three elements  first if the patent includes the aforementioned financial claims  second at least one of the financial claims must not be directed to a “technological invention”  third the petitioner must provide information that demonstrates that it is more likely than not that at least  challenged claimed is unpatentable in experian the board applied its broad interpretation “operations used in … a financial product or service” to encompass the challenged claims even though the language of the claims does not mention finance at all as can be seen by example claim  below  a method of transmitting a message from a sender to a recipient through a server acting as a mail transport agent including the steps at the server of transmitting the message to the recipient’s mail transport agent in a protocol dialog selected from a group consisting of the selected one of the smtp and esmtp protocols and recording at the server some portion of the selected one of the smtp and esmtp protocol dialog between the server and the recipient through the server including those portions of the selected one of the smtp and esmtp protocol dialog between the server and the recipient in which the receiving mail transport agent accepts or declines delivery of the transmitted message the board justified this finding based on the disclosure in the specification of the patent of an “ecommerce embodiment”  since many data processing claims are applicable in a financial setting this bar is quite low however if the claims include a “novel and unobvious technological feature” or “solve a technical problem” they are directed to a technological invention and not subject to cbm review  accordingly the patentee identified the technical problem solved by the challenged claims as “providing reliable proof of content and delivery of electronic messages … without requiring use of special email software by the sender or the recipient” by using “an intermediary server”  since the petitioner did not “provide persuasive evidence” that the technological feature was known in the art and instead relied on “conclusory language … that none of the steps … requires any novel and unobvious technological implementation or solves a technical problem” the board found that the petitioner’s burden was not met  accordingly the board found that the claims were not directed to covered business methods and denied the petition in this case the board did not reach the third stage of determining whether the petitioner had a probability of success  accordingly it appears that the board did not consider the petitioner’s three separate § arguments that claim  was anticipated by the prior art  in order to make the claim that the invention was not technological because it was wellknown in the art the petitioner might have been wellserved to explicitly invoke the three references instead of relying on broad conclusory statements my thanks to
