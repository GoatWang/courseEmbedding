finance banks and banking financial regulation fund governance v t e a hedge fund is an investment fund that pools capital from accredited individuals or institutional investors and invests in a variety of assets often with complex portfolioconstruction and riskmanagement techniques it is administered by a professional investment management firm and often structured as a limited partnership limited liability company or similar vehicle hedge funds are generally distinct from mutual funds as their use of leverage is not capped by regulators and distinct from private equity funds as the majority of hedge funds invest in relatively liquid assets the term hedge fund originated from the paired long and short positions that the first of these funds used to hedge market risk over time the types and nature of the hedging concepts expanded as did the different types of investment vehicles today hedge funds engage in a diverse range of markets and strategies and employ a wide variety of financial instruments and risk management techniques hedge funds are made available only to certain sophisticated or accredited investors and cannot be offered or sold to the general public as such they generally avoid direct regulatory oversight bypass licensing requirements applicable to investment companies and operate with greater flexibility than mutual funds and other investment funds however following the financial crisis of – regulations were passed in the united states and europe with intentions to increase government oversight of hedge funds and eliminate certain regulatory gaps hedge funds have existed for many decades and have become increasingly popular they have now grown to be a substantial fraction of asset management with assets now totaling around  trillion hedge funds are almost always openended and allow additions or withdrawals by their investors generally on a monthly or quarterly basis the value of an investors holding is directly related to the fund net asset value many hedge fund investment strategies aim to achieve a positive return on investment regardless of whether markets are rising or falling absolute return hedge fund managers often invest money of their own in the fund they manage a hedge fund typically pays its investment manager an annual management fee for example  of the assets of the fund and a performance fee for example  of the increase in the funds net asset value during the year both coinvestment and performance fees serve to align the interests of managers with those of the investors in the fund some hedge funds have

used as a metaphor for the placing of limits on risk early hedge funds sought to hedge specific investments against general market fluctuations by shorting the market hence the name nowadays however many different investment strategies are used many of which do not hedge risk– historyedit during the us bull market of the s there were numerous private investment vehicles available to wealthy investors of that period the best known today is the grahamnewman partnership founded by benjamin graham and jerry newman this was cited by warren buffett in a  letter to the museum of american finance as an early hedge fund the sociologist alfred w jones is credited with coining the phrase hedged fund and is credited with creating the first hedge fund structure in  although this has been disputed jones referred to his fund as being hedged a term then commonly used on wall street to describe the management of investment risk due to changes in the financial markets in the s hedge funds specialized in a single strategy with most fund managers following the longshort equity model many hedge funds closed during the recession of – and the – stock market crash due to heavy losses they received renewed attention in the late s during the s the number of hedge funds increased significantly with the s stock market rise the alignedinterest compensation structure ie common financial

fund managers bill ackman of pershing square capital management lp strategiesedit hedge fund strategies are generally classified among four major categories global macro directional eventdriven and relative value arbitrage strategies within these categories each entail characteristic risk and return profiles a fund may employ a single strategy or multiple strategies for flexibility risk management or diversification the hedge funds prospectus also known as an offering memorandum offers potential investors information about key aspects of the fund including the funds investment strategy investment type and leverage limit the elements contributing to a hedge fund strategy include the hedge funds approach to the market the particular instrument used the market sector the fund specializes in eg healthcare the method used to select investments and the amount of diversification within the fund there are a variety of market approaches to different asset classes including equity fixed income commodity and currency instruments used include equities fixed income futures options and swaps strategies can be divided into those in which investments can be selected by managers known as discretionaryqualitative or those in which investments are selected using a computerized system known as systematicquantitative the amount of diversification within the fund can vary funds may be multistrategy multifund multimarket multimanager or a combination sometimes hedge fund strategies are described as absolute return and are classified as either market neutral or directional market neutral funds have less correlation to overall market performance by neutralizing the effect of market swings whereas directional funds utilize trends and inconsistencies in the market and have greater exposure to the markets fluctuations global macroedit main article global macro hedge funds using a global macro investing strategy take sizable positions in share bond or currency markets in anticipation of global macroeconomic events in order to generate a riskadjusted return global macro fund managers use macroeconomic big picture analysis based on global market events and trends to identify opportunities for investment that would profit from anticipated price movements while global macro strategies have a large amount of flexibility due to their ability to use leverage to take large positions in diverse investments in multiple markets the timing of the implementation of the strategies is important in order to generate attractive riskadjusted returns global macro is often categorized as a directional investment strategy global macro strategies can be divided into discretionary and systematic approaches discretionary trading is carried out by investment managers who identify and select investments whereas systematic trading is based on mathematical models and executed by software with limited human involvement beyond the programming and updating of the software these strategies can also be divided into trend or countertrend approaches depending on whether the fund attempts to profit from following trends long or shortterm or attempts to anticipate and profit from reversals in trends within global macro strategies there are further substrategies including systematic diversified in which the fund trades in diversified markets or systematic currency in which the fund trades in currency markets other substrategies include those employed by commodity trading advisors ctas where the fund trades in futures or options in commodity markets or in swaps this is also known as a managed future fund ctas trade in commodities such as gold and financial instruments including stock indices they also take both long and short positions allowing them to make profit in both market upswings and downswings directionaledit directional investment strategies use market movements trends or inconsistencies when picking stocks across a variety of markets computer models can be used or fund managers will identify and select investments these types of strategies have a greater exposure to the fluctuations of the overall market than do market neutral strategies directional hedge fund strategies include us and international longshort equity hedge funds where long equity positions are hedged with short sales of equities or equity index options within directional strategies there are a number of substrategies emerging markets funds focus on emerging markets such as china and india whereas sector funds specialize in specific areas including technology healthcare biotechnology pharmaceuticals energy and basic materials funds using a fundamental growth strategy invest in companies with more earnings growth than the overall stock market or relevant sector while funds using a fundamental value strategy invest in undervalued companies funds that use quantitative and financial signal processing techniques for equity trading are described as using a quantitative directional strategy funds using a short bias strategy take advantage of declining equity prices using short positions eventdrivenedit main article eventdriven investing eventdriven strategies concern situations in which the underlying investment opportunity and risk are associated with an event an eventdriven investment strategy finds investment opportunities in corporate transactional events such as consolidations acquisitions recapitalizations bankruptcies and liquidations managers employing such a strategy capitalize on valuation inconsistencies in the market before or after such events and take a position based on the predicted movement of the security or securities in question large institutional investors such as hedge funds are more likely to pursue eventdriven investing strategies than traditional equity investors because they have the expertise and resources to analyze corporate transactional events for investment opportunities corporate transactional events generally fit into three categories distressed securities risk arbitrage and special situations distressed securities include such events as restructurings recapitalizations and bankruptcies a distressed securities investment strategy involves investing in the bonds or loans of companies facing bankruptcy or severe financial distress when these bonds or loans are being traded at a discount to their value hedge fund managers pursuing the distressed debt investment strategy aim to capitalize on depressed bond prices hedge funds purchasing distressed debt may prevent those companies from going bankrupt as such an acquisition deters foreclosure by banks while eventdriven investing in general tends to thrive during a bull market distressed investing works best during a bear market risk arbitrage or merger arbitrage includes such events as mergers acquisitions liquidations and hostile takeovers risk arbitrage typically involves buying and selling the stocks of two or more merging companies to take advantage of market discrepancies between acquisition price and stock price the risk element arises from the possibility that the merger or acquisition will not go ahead as planned hedge fund managers will use research and analysis to determine if the event will take place special situations are events that impact the value of a companys stock including the restructuring of a company or corporate transactions including spinoffs sharebuybacks security issuancerepurchase asset sales or other catalystoriented situations to take advantage of special situations the hedge fund manager must identify an upcoming event that will increase or decrease the value of the companys equity and equityrelated instruments other eventdriven strategies include credit arbitrage strategies which focus on corporate fixed income securities an activist strategy where the fund takes large positions in companies and uses the ownership to participate in the management a strategy based on predicting the final approval of new pharmaceutical drugs and legal catalyst strategy which specializes in companies involved in major lawsuits relative valueedit main article relative value economics relative value arbitrage strategies take advantage of relative discrepancies in price between securities the price discrepancy can occur due to mispricing of securities compared to related securities the underlying security or the market overall hedge fund managers can use various types of analysis to identify price discrepancies in securities including mathematical technical or fundamental techniques relative value is often used as a synonym for market neutral as strategies in this category typically have very little or no directional market exposure to the market as a whole other relative value substrategies include fixed income arbitrage exploit pricing inefficiencies between related fixed income securities equity market neutral exploits differences in stock prices by being long and short in stocks within the same sector industry market capitalization country which also creates a hedge against broader market factors convertible arbitrage exploit pricing inefficiencies between convertible securities and the corresponding stocks assetbacked securities fixedincome assetbacked fixed income arbitrage strategy using assetbacked securities credit long  short the same as long  short equity but in credit markets instead of equity markets statistical arbitrage identifying pricing inefficiencies between securities through mathematical modeling techniques volatility arbitrage exploit the change in implied volatility instead of the change in price yield alternatives nonfixed income arbitrage strategies based on the yield instead of the price regulatory arbitrage the practice of taking advantage of regulatory differences between two or more markets risk arbitrage exploiting market discrepancies between acquisition price and stock price miscellaneousedit in addition to those strategies within the four main categories there are several strategies that do not fit into these categorizations or can apply across several of them fund of hedge funds multimanager a hedge fund with a diversified portfolio of numerous underlying singlemanager hedge funds multistrategy a hedge fund using a combination of different strategies to reduce market risk minimum account fund the minimum amount to open a hedge fund account is say  million dollars with  nonholding or  million dollars with holding multimanager a hedge fund wherein the investment is spread along separate submanagers investing in their own strategy withdraw holding a hold is placed on all major withdrawals for  days prior and after hedge fund is created and established  funds equity funds with  long and  short positions leaving a net long position of  risk parity equalizing risk by allocating funds to a wide range of categories while maximizing gains through financial leveraging riskedit for an investor who already holds large quantities of equities and bonds investment in hedge funds may provide diversification and reduce the overall portfolio risk managers of hedge funds use particular trading strategies and instruments with the specific aim of reducing market risks to produce riskadjusted returns that are consistent with investors desired level of risk hedge funds ideally produce returns relatively uncorrelated with market indices while hedging can be a way of reducing the risk of an investment hedge funds like all other investment types are not immune to risk according to a report by the hennessee group hedge funds were approximately onethird less volatile than the sp  between  and  risk managementedit investors in hedge funds are in most countries required to be qualified investors who are assumed to be aware of the investment risks and accept these risks because of the potential returns relative to those risks fund managers may employ extensive risk management strategies in order to protect the fund and investors according to the financial times big hedge funds have some of the most sophisticated and exacting risk management practices anywhere in asset management hedge fund managers that hold a large number of investment positions for short durations are likely to have a particularly comprehensive risk management system in place and it has become usual for funds to have independent risk officers who assess and manage risks but are not otherwise involved in trading a variety of different measurement techniques and models are used to estimate risk according to the funds leverage liquidity and investment strategy nonnormality of returns volatility clustering and trends are not always accounted for by conventional risk measurement methodologies and so in addition to value at risk and similar measurements funds may use integrated measures such as drawdowns  in addition to assessing the marketrelated risks that may arise from an investment investors commonly employ operational due diligence to assess the risk that error or fraud at a hedge fund might result in loss to the investor considerations will include the organization and management of operations at the hedge fund manager whether the investment strategy is likely to be sustainable and the funds ability to develop as a company transparency and regulatory considerationsedit since hedge funds are private entities and have few public disclosure requirements this is sometimes perceived as a lack of transparency another common perception of hedge funds is that their managers are not subject to as much regulatory oversight andor registration requirements as other financial investment managers and more prone to managerspecific idiosyncratic risks such as style drifts faulty operations or fraud new regulations introduced in the us and the eu as of  require hedge fund managers to report more information leading to greater transparency in addition investors particularly institutional investors are encouraging further developments in hedge fund risk management both through internal practices and external regulatory requirements the increasing influence of institutional investors has led to greater transparency hedge funds increasingly provide information to investors including valuation methodology positions and leverage exposure risks shared with other investment typesedit hedge funds share many of the same types of risk as other investment classes including liquidity risk and manager risk liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset can be bought and sold or converted to cash similar to private equity funds hedge funds employ a lockup period during which an investor cannot remove money manager risk refers to those risks which arise from the management of funds as well as specific risks such as style drift which refers to a fund manager drifting away from an area of specific expertise manager risk factors include valuation risk capacity risk concentration risk and leverage risk valuation risk refers to the concern that the net asset value of investments may be inaccurate capacity risk can arise from placing too much money into one particular strategy which may lead to fund performance deterioration and concentration risk may arise if a fund has too much exposure to a particular investment sector trading strategy or group of correlated funds these risks may be managed through defined controls over conflict of interest restrictions on allocation of funds and set exposure limits for strategies many investment funds use leverage the practice of borrowing money trading on margin or using derivatives to obtain market exposure in excess of that provided by investors capital although leverage can increase potential returns the opportunity for larger gains is weighed against the possibility of greater losses hedge funds employing leverage are likely to engage in extensive risk management practices in comparison with investment banks hedge fund leverage is relatively low according to a national bureau of economic research working paper the average leverage for investment banks is  compared to between  and  for hedge funds some types of funds including hedge funds are perceived as having a greater appetite for risk with the intention of maximizing returns subject to the risk tolerance of investors and the fund manager managers will have an additional incentive to increase risk oversight when their own capital is invested in the fund notable failuresedit longterm capital management founded in  by john meriwether following backtoback financial crises in asia in  and russia in  the fund ended up losing  billion in less than four months the primary catalyst for the failure was russias default and a model that advised the fund to hold its position even as losses mounted tiger management run by julian robertson robertson founded the fund in  with  million and grew it to  billion by  making it the secondlargest hedge fund in the world at the time one year later assets under management reached  billion a series of bad investments greatly harmed tigers returns causing investors to redeem out of the fund atticus global founded by activist investor tim barakett in  with less than  million in hand and by  was one of the largest hedge funds in the world with  billion of assets under management barakett earned marketbeating returns over a long time period until the financial crisis in  after two years of losses barakett closed the fund in  atticus globals reported a compounded annual return of  compared to just  for the sp  fees and remunerationedit fees paid to hedge fundsedit hedge fund management firms typically charge their funds both a management fee and a performance fee management fees are calculated as a percentage of the funds net asset value and typically range from  to  per annum with  being standard they are usually expressed as an annual percentage but calculated and paid monthly or quarterly management fees for hedge funds are designed to cover the operating costs of the manager whereas the performance fee provides the managers profits however due to economies of scale the management fee from larger funds can generate a significant part of a managers profits and as a result some fees have been criticized by some public pension funds such as calpers for being too high the performance fee is typically  of the funds profits during any year though they range between  and  performance fees are intended to provide an incentive for a manager to generate profits performance fees have been criticized by warren buffett who believes that because hedge funds share only the profits and not the losses such fees create an incentive for highrisk investment management performance fee rates have fallen since the start of the credit crunch almost all hedge fund performance fees include a high water mark or loss carryforward provision which means that the performance fee only applies to net profits ie profits after losses in previous years have been recovered this prevents managers from receiving fees for volatile performance though a manager will sometimes close a fund that has suffered serious losses and start a new fund rather than attempting to recover the losses over a number of years without performance fee some performance fees include a hurdle so that a fee is only paid on the funds performance in excess of a benchmark rate eg libor or a fixed percentage a soft hurdle means the performance fee is calculated on all the funds returns if the hurdle rate is cleared a hard hurdle is calculated only on returns above the hurdle rate a hurdle is intended to ensure that a manager is only rewarded if the fund generates returns in excess of the returns that the investor would have received if they had invested their money elsewhere some hedge funds charge a redemption fee or withdrawal fee for early withdrawals during a specified period of time typically a year or when withdrawals exceed a predetermined percentage of the original investment the purpose of the fee is to discourage shortterm investing reduce turnover and deter withdrawals after periods of poor performance unlike management fees and performance fees redemption fees are usually kept by the fund remuneration of portfolio managersedit hedge fund management firms are usually owned by their portfolio managers who are therefore entitled to any profits that the business makes as management fees are intended to cover the firms operating costs performance fees and any excess management fees are generally distributed to the firms owners as profits funds do not tend to report compensation and so published lists of the amounts earned by top managers tend to be estimates based on factors such as the fees charged by their funds and the capital they are thought to have invested in them many managers have accumulated large stakes in their own funds and so top hedge fund managers can earn extraordinary amounts of money perhaps up to  billion in a good year earnings at the very top are higher than in any other sector of the financial industry  and collectively the top  hedge fund managers regularly earn more than all  of the chief executives in the sp  most hedge fund managers are remunerated much less however and if performance fees are not earned then small managers at least are unlikely to be paid significant amounts in  the top manager earned m the tenth earned m and the th earned m in  the average earnings for the  highest compensated hedge fund managers in the united states was  million while the mean total compensation for all hedge fund investment professionals was  and the median was  the same figures for hedge fund ceos were  and  and for chief investment officers were  and  respectively of the  people on the forbes worlds billionaires list for   of the financiers listed derived significant chunks of their wealth from hedge fund management among the richest  people in the united kingdom  were hedge fund managers according to the sunday times rich list for  structureedit a hedge fund is an investment vehicle that is most often structured as an offshore corporation limited partnership or limited liability company the fund is managed by an investment manager in the form of an organization or company that is legally and financially distinct from the hedge fund and its portfolio of assets many investment managers utilize service providers for operational support service providers include prime brokers banks administrators distributors and accounting firms prime brokers clear trades and provide leverage and shortterm financing they are usually divisions of large investment banks the prime broker acts as a counterparty to derivative contracts and lends securities for particular investment strategies such as longshort equities and convertible bond arbitrage it can provide custodial services for the funds assets and execution and clearing services for the hedge fund manager hedge fund administrators are responsible for operations accounting and valuation services this back office support allows fund managers to concentrate on trades administrators also process subscriptions and redemptions and perform various shareholder services hedge funds in the united states are not required to appoint an administrator and all of these functions can be performed by an investment manager a number of conflict of interest situations may arise in this arrangement particularly in the calculation of a funds net asset value nav some funds voluntarily employ external auditors thereby offering a greater degree of transparency a distributor is an underwriter broker dealer or other person who participates in the distribution of securities the distributor is also responsible for marketing the fund to potential investors many hedge funds do not have distributors and in such cases the investment manager will be responsible for distribution of securities and marketing though many funds also use placement agents and brokerdealers for distribution most funds use an independent accounting firm to audit the assets of the fund provide tax services and perform a complete audit of the funds financial statements the yearend audit is often performed in accordance with the standard accounting practices enforced within the country the fund it established or the international financial reporting standards ifrs the auditor may verify the funds nav and assets under management aum some auditors only provide nav lite services meaning that the valuation is based on prices received from the manager rather than independent assessment domicile and taxationedit the legal structure of a specific hedge fund in particular its domicile and the type of legal entity in use is usually determined by the tax expectations of the funds investors regulatory considerations will also play a role many hedge funds are established in offshore financial centers to avoid adverse tax consequences for its foreign and taxexempt investors offshore funds that invest in the us typically pay withholding taxes on certain types of investment income but not us capital gains tax however the funds investors are subject to tax in their own jurisdictions on any increase in the value of their investments this tax treatment promotes crossborder investments by limiting the potential for multiple jurisdictions to layer taxes on investors us taxexempt investors such as pension plans and endowments invest primarily in offshore hedge funds to preserve their tax exempt status and avoid unrelated business taxable income the investment manager usually based in a major financial center pays tax on its management fees per the tax laws of the state and country where it is located in  half of the existing hedge funds were registered offshore and half onshore the cayman islands was the leading location for offshore funds accounting for  of the total number of global hedge funds the us had  luxembourg  ireland  the british virgin islands  and bermuda had  basket optionsedit deutsche bank and barclays created special options accounts for hedge fund clients in the banks’ names and claimed to own the assets when in fact the hedge fund clients had full control of the assets and reaped the profits the hedge funds would then execute trades — many of them a few seconds in duration — but wait until just after a year had passed to exercise the options allowing them to report the profits at a lower longterm capital gains tax rate — alexandra stevenson july   new york times the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations chaired by carl levin resulted in a  report that found that from  and  hedge funds avoided billions of dollars in taxes by using basket options the internal revenue service began investigating renaissance technologies in  and levin criticized the irs for taking six years to investigate the company using basket options renaissance avoided more than  billion in taxes over more than a decade these banks and hedge funds involved in this case used dubious structured financial products in a giant game of let’s pretend costing the treasury billions and bypassing safeguards that protect the economy from excessive bank lending for stock speculation — carl levin  senate permanent subcommittee on investigations a dozen other hedge funds along with renaissance technologies used deutsche banks and barclays basket options renaissance argued that basket options were extremely important because they gave the hedge fund the ability to increase its returns by borrowing more and to protect against model and programming failures in july  the united states internal revenue claimed hedge funds used basket options to bypass taxes on shortterm trades these basket options will now be labeled as listed transactions that must be declared on tax returns and a failure to do would result in a penalty investment manager locationsedit in contrast to the funds themselves investment managers are primarily located onshore the united states remains the largest center of investment with usbased funds managing around  of global assets at the end of  as of april  there were approximately  investment advisers managing one or more private hedge funds registered with the securities and exchange commission new york city and the gold coast area of connecticut are the leading locations for us hedge fund managers london is europes leading center for hedge fund managers according to eurohedge data around  funds located in the uk managed some  of europeanbased hedge fund assets in  interest in hedge funds in asia has increased significantly since  especially in japan hong kong and singapore however the uk and the us remain the leading locations for management of asian hedge fund assets the legal entityedit hedge fund legal structures vary depending on location and the investors us hedge funds aimed at usbased taxable investors are generally structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies limited partnerships and other flowthrough taxation structures assure that investors in hedge funds are not subject to both entitylevel and personallevel taxation a hedge fund structured as a limited partnership must have a general partner the general partner may be an individual or a corporation the general partner serves as the manager of the limited partnership and has unlimited liability the limited partners serve as the funds investors and have no responsibility for management or investment decisions their liability is limited to the amount of money they invest for partnership interests as an alternative to a limited partnership arrangement us domestic hedge funds may be structured as limited liability companies with members acting as corporate shareholders and enjoying protection from individual liability by contrast offshore corporate funds are usually used for nonus investors and when they are domiciled in an applicable offshore tax haven no entitylevel tax is imposed many managers of offshore funds permit the participation of taxexempt us investors such as pensions funds institutional endowments and charitable trusts as an alternative legal structure offshore funds may be formed as an openended unit trust using an unincorporated mutual fund structure japanese investors prefer to invest in unit trusts such as those available in the cayman islands the investment manager who organizes the hedge fund may retain an interest in the fund either as the general partner of a limited partnership or as the holder of founder shares in a corporate fund for offshore funds structured as corporate entities the fund may appoint a board of directors the boards primary role is to provide a layer of oversight while representing the interests of the shareholders however in practice board members may lack sufficient expertise to be effective in performing those duties the board may include both affiliated directors who are employees of the fund and independent directors whose relationship to the fund is limited types of fundsedit openended hedge funds continue to issue shares to new investors and allow periodic withdrawals at the net asset value nav for each share closedended hedge funds issue a limited number of tradeable shares at inception shares of listed hedges funds are traded on stock exchanges such as the irish stock exchange and may be purchased by nonaccredited investors side pocketsedit a side pocket is a mechanism whereby a fund compartmentalizes assets that are relatively illiquid or difficult to value reliably when an investment is sidepocketed its value is calculated separately from the value of the fund’s main portfolio because side pockets are used to hold illiquid investments investors do not have the standard redemption rights with respect to the side pocket investment that they do with respect to the fund’s main portfolio profits or losses from the investment are allocated on a pro rata basis only to those who are investors at the time the investment is placed into the side pocket and are not shared with new investors funds typically carry side pocket assets at cost for purposes of calculating management fees and reporting net asset values this allows fund managers to avoid attempting a valuation of the underlying investments which may not always have a readily available market value side pockets were widely used by hedge funds during the  financial crisis amidst a flood of withdrawal requests side pockets allowed fund managers to lay away illiquid securities until market liquidity improved a move that could reduce losses however as the practice restricts investors ability to redeem their investments it is often unpopular and many have alleged that it has been abused or applied unfairly the sec also has expressed concern about aggressive use of side pockets and has sanctioned certain fund managers for inappropriate use of them regulationedit hedge funds must conform to the national federal and state regulatory laws in their respective locations the us regulations and restrictions that apply to hedge funds differ from its mutual funds mutual funds unlike hedge funds and other private funds are subject to the investment company act of  which is a highly detailed and extensive regulatory regime according to a report by the international organization of securities commissions the most common form of regulation pertains to restrictions on financial advisers and hedge fund managers in an effort to minimize client fraud on the other hand us hedge funds are exempt from many of the standard registration and reporting requirements because they only accept accredited investors in  regulations were enacted in the us and european union which introduced additional hedge fund reporting requirements these included the uss doddfrank wall street reform act and european alternative investment fund managers directive in  in an attempt for selfregulation  leading hedge fund managers developed a voluntary set of international standards in best practice and known as the hedge fund standards they were designed to create a … framework of transparency integrity and good governance in the hedge fund industry the hedge fund standards board was set up to prompt and maintain these standards going forward and by  it had approximately  hedge fund managers and institutional investors with a value of us tn investment endorsing the standards united statesedit hedge funds within the us are subject to regulatory reporting and record keeping requirements many hedge funds also fall under the jurisdiction of the commodity futures trading commission and are subject to rules and provisions of the  commodity exchange act which prohibits fraud and manipulation the securities act of  required companies to file a registration statement with the sec to comply with its private placement rules before offering their securities to the public the securities exchange act of  required a fund with more than  investors to register with the sec the investment advisers act of  contained antifraud provisions that regulated hedge fund managers and advisers created limits for the number and types of investors and prohibited public offerings the act also exempted hedge funds from mandatory registration with the us securities and exchange commission sec when selling to accredited investors with a minimum of us million in investment assets companies and institutional investors with at least us million in investment assets also qualified in december  the sec began requiring hedge fund advisers managing more than us million and with more than  investors to register with the sec under the investment advisers act the sec stated that it was adopting a riskbased approach to monitoring hedge funds as part of its evolving regulatory regimen for the burgeoning industry the new rule was controversial with two commissioners dissenting and was later challenged in court by a hedge fund manager in june  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia overturned the rule and sent it back to the agency to be reviewed in response to the court decision in  the sec adopted rule  which unlike the earlier challenged rule does not impose additional filing reporting or disclosure obligations but does potentially increase the risk of enforcement action for negligent or fraudulent activity hedge fund managers with at least us million in assets under management are required to file publicly quarterly reports disclosing ownership of registered equity securities and are subject to public disclosure if they own more than  of the class of any registered equity security registered advisers must report their business practices and disciplinary history to the sec and to their investors they are required to have written compliance policies a chief compliance officer and their records and practices may be examined by the sec the uss doddfrank wall street reform act was passed in july  and requires sec registration of advisers who manage private funds with more than us million in assets registered managers must file form adv with the sec as well as information regarding their assets under management and trading positions previously advisers with fewer than  clients were exempt although many hedge fund advisers voluntarily registered with the sec to satisfy institutional investors under doddfrank investment advisers with less than us million in assets under management became subject to state regulation this increased the number of hedge funds under state supervision overseas advisers who managed more than us million were also required to register with the sec the act requires hedge funds to provide information about their trades and portfolios to regulators including the newly created financial stability oversight council in this regard most hedge funds and other private funds including private equity funds must file form pf with the sec which is an extensive reporting form with substantial data on the funds activities and positions under the volcker rule regulators are also required to implement regulations for banks their affiliates and holding companies to limit their relationships with hedge funds and to prohibit these organizations from proprietary trading and to limit their investment in and sponsorship of hedge funds europeedit within the european union eu hedge funds are primarily regulated through their managers in the united kingdom where  of europes hedge funds are based hedge fund managers are required to be authorised and regulated by the financial conduct authority fca each country has their own specific restrictions on hedge fund activities including controls on use of derivatives in portugal and limits on leverage in france in the eu managers are subject to the eus directive on alternative investment fund managers aifmd according to the eu the aim of the directive is to provide greater monitoring and control of alternative investment funds aifmd requires all eu hedge fund managers to register with national regulatory authorities and to disclose more information on a more frequent basis it also directs hedge fund managers to hold larger amounts of capital aifmd also introduced a passport for hedge funds authorised in one eu country to operate throughout the eu the scope of aifmd is broad and encompasses managers located within the eu as well as noneu managers that market their funds to european investors an aspect of aifmd which challenges established practices in the hedge funds sector is the potential restriction of remuneration through bonus deferrals and clawback provisions otheredit some hedge funds are established in offshore centres such as the cayman islands dublin luxembourg the british virgin islands and bermuda which have different regulations concerning nonaccredited investors client confidentiality and fund manager independence in south africa investment fund managers must be approved by and register with the financial services board fsb performanceedit measurementedit performance statistics for individual hedge funds are difficult to obtain as the funds have historically not been required to report their performance to a central repository and restrictions against public offerings and advertisement have led many managers to refuse to provide performance information publicly however summaries of individual hedge fund performance are occasionally available in industry journals and databases and investment consultancy hennessee group one estimate is that the average hedge fund returned  per year representing a  return above overall market performance before fees based on performance data from  hedge funds another is that between january  and december  the hedge funds outperformed other investments were significantly less volatile with stocks falling  per year over the decade and hedge funds rising  more recent data show that hedge fund performance has declined and underperformed the market hedge funds performance is measured by comparing their returns to an estimate of their risk common measures are the sharpe ratio treynor measure and jensens alpha these measures work best when returns follow normal distributions without autocorrelation and these assumptions are often not met in practice new performance measures have been introduced that attempt to address some of theoretical concerns with traditional indicators including modified sharpe ratios the omega ratio introduced by keating and shadwick in  alternative investments risk adjusted performance airap published by sharma in  and kappa developed by kaplan and knowles in  sectorsize effectedit there is a debate over whether alpha the managers skill element in performance has been diluted by the expansion of the hedge fund industry two reasons are given first the increase in traded volume may have been reducing the market anomalies that are a source of hedge fund performance second the remuneration model is attracting more managers which may dilute the talent available in the industry hedge fund indicesedit indices that track hedge fund returns are in order of development called noninvestable investable and clone they play a central and unambiguous role in traditional asset markets where they are widely accepted as representative of their underlying portfolios equity and debt index fund products provide investable access to most developed markets in these asset classes hedge funds however are actively managed so that tracking is impossible noninvestable hedge fund indices on the other hand may be more or less representative but returns data on many of the reference group of funds is nonpublic this may result in biased estimates of their returns in an attempt to address this problem clone indices have been created in an attempt to replicate the statistical properties of hedge funds without being directly based on their returns data none of these approaches achieves the accuracy of indices in other asset classes for which there is more complete published data concerning the underlying returns noninvestable indicesedit noninvestable indices are indicative in nature and aim to represent the performance of some database of hedge funds using some measure such as mean median or weighted mean from a hedge fund database the databases have diverse selection criteria and methods of construction and no single database captures all funds this leads to significant differences in reported performance between different indices although they aim to be representative noninvestable indices suffer from a lengthy and largely unavoidable list of biases funds participation in a database is voluntary leading to selfselection bias because those funds that choose to report may not be typical of funds as a whole for example some do not report because of poor results or because they have already reached their target size and do not wish to raise further money the short lifetimes of many hedge funds means that there are many new entrants and many departures each year which raises the problem of survivorship bias if we examine only funds that have survived to the present we will overestimate past returns because many of the worstperforming funds have not survived and the observed association between fund youth and fund performance suggests that this bias may be substantial when a fund is added to a database for the first time all or part of its historical data is recorded expost in the database it is likely that funds only publish their results when they are favorable so that the average performances displayed by the funds during their incubation period are inflated this is known as instant history bias or backfill bias investable indicesedit investable indices are an attempt to reduce these problems by ensuring that the return of the index is available to shareholders to create an investable index the index provider selects funds and develops structured products or derivative instruments that deliver the performance of the index when investors buy these products the index provider makes the investments in the underlying funds making an investable index similar in some ways to a fund of hedge funds portfolio to make the index investable hedge funds must agree to accept investments on the terms given by the constructor to make the index liquid these terms must include provisions for redemptions that some managers may consider too onerous to be acceptable this means that investable indices do not represent the total universe of hedge funds most seriously they underrepresent more successful managers who typically refuse to accept such investment protocols hedge fund replicationedit the most recent addition to the field approach the problem in a different manner instead of reflecting the performance of actual hedge funds they take a statistical approach to the analysis of historic hedge fund returns and use this to construct a model of how hedge fund returns respond to the movements of various investable financial assets this model is then used to construct an investable portfolio of those assets this makes the index investable and in principle they can be as representative as the hedge fund database from which they were constructed however these clone indices rely on a statistical modelling process such indices have too short a history to state whether this approach will be considered successful closuresedit in march  hfr – a hedge fund research data and service provider – reported that there were more hedgefund closures in  than during the  recession according to the report several large public pension funds pulled their investments in hedge funds because the funds’ subpar performance as a group did not merit the high fees they charged despite the hedge fund industry topping  trillion for the first time ever in  the number of new hedge funds launched fell short of crisisera figures there were  hedge fund launches in  fewer than the  opened in  and dramatically less than the  launches in  debates and controversiesedit systemic riskedit systemic risk refers to the risk of instability across the entire financial system as opposed to within a single company such risk may arise following a destabilizing event or events affecting a group of financial institutions linked through investment activity organizations such as the national bureau of economic research and the european central bank have charged that hedge funds pose systemic risks to the financial sector and following the failure of hedge fund longterm capital management ltcm in  there was widespread concern about the potential for systemic risk if a hedge fund failure led to the failure of its counterparties as it happens no financial assistance was provided to ltcm by the us federal reserve so there was no direct cost to us taxpayers but a large bailout had to be mounted by a number of financial institutions however these claims are widely disputed by the financial industry who typically regard hedge funds as small enough to fail since most are relatively small in terms of the assets they manage and operate with low leverage thereby limiting the potential harm to the economic system should one of them fail formal analysis of hedge fund leverage before and during the  financial crisis suggests that hedge fund leverage is both fairly modest and countercyclical to the market leverage of investment banks and the larger financial sector hedge fund leverage decreased prior to the financial crisis even while the leverage of other financial intermediaries continued to increase hedge funds fail regularly and numerous hedge funds failed during the financial crisis in testimony to the house financial services committee in  ben bernanke the federal reserve board chairman said he would not think that any hedge fund or private equity fund would become a systemically critical firm individually nevertheless although hedge funds go to great lengths to reduce the ratio of risk to reward inevitably a number of risks remain systemic risk is increased in a crisis if there is herd behaviour which causes a number of similar hedge funds to make losses in similar trades in addition while most hedge funds make only modest use of leverage hedge funds differ from many other market participants such as banks and mutual funds in that there are no regulatory constraints on their use of leverage and some hedge funds seek large amounts of leverage as part of their market strategy the extensive use of leverage can lead to forced liquidations in a crisis particularly for hedge funds that invest at least in part in illiquid investments the close interconnectedness of the hedge funds with their prime brokers typically investment banks can lead to domino effects in a crisis and indeed failing counterparty banks can freeze hedge funds these systemic risk concerns are exacerbated by the prominent role of hedge funds in the financial markets the global hedge fund industry has over  trillion in assets and this does not take into account the full effect of leverage which by definition is market exposure in excess of the amount invested an august  survey by the financial services authority concluded that risks were limited and had reduced as a result inter alia of larger margins being required by counterparty banks but might change rapidly according to market conditions in stressed market conditions investors might suddenly withdraw large sums resulting in forced asset sales this might cause liquidity and pricing problems if it occurred across a number of funds or in one large highly leveraged fund transparencyedit hedge funds are structured to avoid most direct regulation although their managers may be regulated and are not required to publicly disclose their investment activities except to the extent that investors generally are subject to disclosure requirements this is in contrast to a regulated mutual fund or exchangetraded fund which will typically have to meet regulatory requirements for disclosure an investor in a hedge fund usually has direct access to the investment adviser of the fund and may enjoy more personalized reporting than investors in retail investment funds this may include detailed discussions of risks assumed and significant positions however this high level of disclosure is not available to noninvestors contributing to hedge funds reputation for secrecy while some hedge funds have very limited transparency even to investors funds may choose to report some information in the interest of recruiting additional investors much of the data available in consolidated databases is selfreported and unverified a study was done on two major databases containing hedge fund data the study noted that  common funds had significant differences in reported information eg returns inception date net assets value incentive fee management fee investment styles etc and that  of return numbers and  of nav numbers were dramatically different with these limitations investors have to do their own research which may cost on the scale of us for a fund that is not wellestablished a lack of verification of financial documents by investors or by independent auditors has in some cases assisted in fraud in the mids kirk wright of international management associates was accused of mail fraud and other securities violations which allegedly defrauded clients of close to us million in december  bernard madoff was arrested for running a us billion ponzi scheme that closely resembled a hedge fund and was incorrectly described as one several feeder hedge funds of which the largest was fairfield sentry channeled money to it following the madoff case the sec adopted reforms in december  that required hedge funds managed by registered investment advisers to have their assets in the custody of a qualified custodian and subjected them to an audit requirement the process of matching hedge funds to investors has traditionally been fairly opaque with investments often driven by personal connections or recommendations of portfolio managers many funds disclose their holdings strategy and historic performance relative to market indices giving investors some idea of how their money is being allocated although individual holdings are often not disclosed investors are often drawn to hedge funds by the possibility of realizing significant returns or hedging against volatility in the market the complexity and fees associated with hedge funds are causing some to exit the market – calpers the largest pension fund in the us announced plans to completely divest from hedge funds in  some services are attempting to improve matching between hedge funds and investors hedgez is designed to allow investors to easily search and sort through funds imatchative aims to match investors to funds through algorithms that factor in an investors goals and behavioral profile in hopes of helping funds and investors understand the how their perceptions and motivations drive investment decisions links with analystsedit in june  prompted by a letter from gary j aguirre the senate judiciary committee began an investigation into the links between hedge funds and independent analysts aguirre was fired from his job with the sec when as lead investigator of insider trading allegations against pequot capital management he tried to interview john mack then being considered for chief executive officer at morgan stanley the judiciary committee and the us senate finance committee issued a scathing report in  which found that aguirre had been illegally fired in reprisal for his pursuit of mack and in  the sec was forced to reopen its case against pequot pequot settled with the sec for us million and arthur j samberg chief investment officer of pequot was barred from working as an investment advisor pequot closed its doors under the pressure of investigations the systemic practice of hedge funds submitting periodic electronic questionnaires to stock analysts as a part of market research was reported in by the new york times in july  according to the report one motivation for the questionnaires was to obtain subjective information not available to the public and possible early notice of trading recommendations that could produce short term market movements value in meanvariance efficient portfoliosedit according to modern portfolio theory rational investors will seek to hold portfolios that are meanvariance efficient that is portfolios that offer the highest level of return per unit of risk one of the attractive features of hedge funds in particular market neutral and similar funds is that they sometimes have a modest correlation with traditional assets such as equities this means that hedge funds have a potentially quite valuable role in investment portfolios as diversifiers reducing overall portfolio risk however there are three reasons why one might not wish to allocate a high proportion of assets into hedge funds these reasons are hedge funds are highly individual and it is hard to estimate the likely returns or risks hedge funds low correlation with other assets tends to dissipate during stressful market events making them much less useful for diversification than they may appear hedge fund returns are reduced considerably by the high fee structures that are typically charged several studies have suggested that hedge funds are sufficiently diversifying to merit inclusion in investor portfolios but this is disputed for example by mark kritzman who performed a meanvariance optimization calculation on an opportunity set that consisted of a stock index fund a bond index fund and ten hypothetical hedge funds the optimizer found that a meanvariance efficient portfolio did not contain any allocation to hedge funds largely because of the impact of performance fees to demonstrate this kritzman repeated the optimization using an assumption that the hedge funds incurred no performance fees the result from this second optimization was an allocation of  to hedge funds the other factor reducing the attractiveness of hedge funds in a diversified portfolio is that they tend to perform poorly during equity bear markets just when an investor needs part of their portfolio to add value for example in january–september  the credit suissetremont hedge fund index was down  according to the same index series even dedicated short bias funds had a return of − during september  in other words even though low average correlations may appear to make hedge funds attractive this may not work in turbulent period for example around the collapse of lehman brothers in september  see alsoedit activist shareholder alternative asset board of directors corporate governance fund governance investment banking list of

corporate finance personal finance public finance banks and banking financial regulation fund governance v t e a hedge fund is an investment fund that pools capital from accredited individuals or institutional investors and invests in a variety of assets often with complex portfolioconstruction and riskmanagement techniques it is administered by a professional investment management firm and often structured as a limited partnership limited liability company or similar vehicle hedge funds are generally distinct from mutual funds as their use of leverage is not capped by regulators and distinct from private equity funds as the majority of hedge funds invest in relatively liquid assets the term hedge fund originated from the paired long and short positions that the first of these funds used to hedge market risk over time the types and nature of the hedging concepts expanded as did the different types of investment vehicles today hedge funds engage in a diverse range of markets and strategies and employ a wide variety of financial instruments and risk management techniques hedge funds are made available only to certain sophisticated or accredited investors and cannot be offered or sold to the general public as such they generally avoid direct regulatory oversight bypass licensing requirements applicable to investment companies and operate with greater flexibility than mutual funds and other investment funds however following the financial crisis of – regulations were passed in the united states and europe with intentions to increase government oversight of hedge funds and eliminate certain regulatory gaps hedge funds have existed for many decades and have become increasingly popular they have now grown to be a substantial fraction of asset management with assets now totaling around  trillion hedge funds are almost always openended and allow additions or withdrawals by their investors generally on a monthly or quarterly basis the value of an investors holding is directly related to the fund net asset value many hedge fund investment strategies aim to achieve a positive return on investment regardless of whether markets are rising or falling absolute return hedge fund managers often invest money of their own in the fund they manage a hedge fund typically pays its investment manager an annual management fee for example  of the assets of the fund and a performance fee for example  of the increase in the funds net asset value during the year both coinvestment and performance fees serve to align the interests of managers with those of the investors in the fund some hedge funds have several billion dollars of assets under management aum contents  introduction  history  notable hedge fund managers  strategies  global macro

meaning a line of bushes around a field has long been used as a metaphor for the placing of limits on risk early hedge funds sought to hedge specific investments against general market fluctuations by shorting the market hence the name nowadays however many different investment strategies are used many of which do not hedge risk– historyedit during the us bull market of the s there were numerous private investment vehicles available to wealthy investors of that period the best known today is the grahamnewman partnership founded by benjamin graham and jerry newman this was cited by warren buffett in a  letter to the museum of american finance as an early hedge fund the sociologist alfred w jones is credited with coining the phrase hedged fund and is credited with creating the first hedge fund structure in  although this has been disputed jones referred to his fund as being hedged a term then commonly used on wall street to describe the management of investment risk due to changes in the financial markets in the s hedge funds specialized in a single strategy with most fund managers following the longshort equity model many hedge funds closed during the recession of – and the – stock market crash due to heavy losses they received renewed attention in the late s during the s the number of hedge funds increased significantly with the s stock market rise the

global macro directional eventdriven and relative value arbitrage strategies within these categories each entail characteristic risk and return profiles a fund may employ a single strategy or multiple strategies for flexibility risk management or diversification the hedge funds prospectus also known as an offering memorandum offers potential investors information about key aspects of the fund including the funds investment strategy investment type and leverage limit the elements contributing to a hedge fund strategy include the hedge funds approach to the market the particular instrument used the market sector the fund specializes in eg healthcare the method used to select investments and the amount of diversification within the fund there are a variety of market approaches to different asset classes including equity fixed income commodity and currency instruments used include equities fixed income futures options and swaps strategies can be divided into those in which investments can be selected by managers known as discretionaryqualitative or those in which investments are selected using a computerized system known as systematicquantitative the amount of diversification within the fund can vary funds may be multistrategy multifund multimarket multimanager or a combination sometimes hedge fund strategies are described as absolute return and are classified as either market neutral or directional market neutral funds have less correlation to overall market performance by neutralizing the effect of market swings whereas directional funds utilize trends and inconsistencies in the market and have greater exposure to the markets fluctuations global macroedit main article global macro hedge funds using a global macro investing strategy take sizable positions in share bond or currency markets in anticipation of global macroeconomic events in order to generate a riskadjusted return global macro fund managers use macroeconomic big picture analysis based on global market events and trends to identify opportunities for investment that would profit from anticipated price movements while global macro strategies have a large amount of flexibility due to their ability to use leverage to take large positions in diverse investments in multiple markets the timing of the implementation of the strategies is important in order to generate attractive riskadjusted returns global macro is often categorized as a directional investment strategy global macro strategies can be divided into discretionary and systematic approaches discretionary trading is carried out by investment managers who identify and select investments whereas systematic trading is based on mathematical models and executed by software with limited human involvement beyond the programming and updating of the software these strategies can also be divided into trend or countertrend approaches depending on whether the fund attempts to profit from following trends long or shortterm or attempts to anticipate and profit from reversals in trends within global macro strategies there are further substrategies including systematic diversified in which the fund trades in diversified markets or systematic currency in which the fund trades in currency markets other substrategies include those employed by commodity trading advisors ctas where the fund trades in futures or options in commodity markets or in swaps this is also known as a managed future fund ctas trade in commodities such as gold and financial instruments including stock indices they also take both long and short positions allowing them to make profit in both market upswings and downswings directionaledit directional investment strategies use market movements trends or inconsistencies when picking stocks across a variety of markets computer models can be used or fund managers will identify and select investments these types of strategies have a greater exposure to the fluctuations of the overall market than do market neutral strategies directional hedge fund strategies include us and international longshort equity hedge funds where long equity positions are hedged with short sales of equities or equity index options within directional strategies there are a number of substrategies emerging markets funds focus on emerging markets such as china and india whereas sector funds specialize in specific areas including technology healthcare biotechnology pharmaceuticals energy and basic materials funds using a fundamental growth strategy invest in companies with more earnings growth than the overall stock market or relevant sector while funds using a fundamental value strategy invest in undervalued companies funds that use quantitative and financial signal processing techniques for equity trading are described as using a quantitative directional strategy funds using a short bias strategy take advantage of declining equity prices using short positions eventdrivenedit main article eventdriven investing eventdriven strategies concern situations in which the underlying investment opportunity and risk are associated with an event an eventdriven investment strategy finds investment opportunities in corporate transactional events such as consolidations acquisitions recapitalizations bankruptcies and liquidations managers employing such a strategy capitalize on valuation inconsistencies in the market before or after such events and take a position based on the predicted movement of the security or securities in question large institutional investors such as hedge funds are more likely to pursue eventdriven investing strategies than traditional equity investors because they have the expertise and resources to analyze corporate transactional events for investment opportunities corporate transactional events generally fit into three categories distressed securities risk arbitrage and special situations distressed securities include such events as restructurings recapitalizations and bankruptcies a distressed securities investment strategy involves investing in the bonds or loans of companies facing bankruptcy or severe financial distress when these bonds or loans are being traded at a discount to their value hedge fund managers pursuing the distressed debt investment strategy aim to capitalize on depressed bond prices hedge funds purchasing distressed debt may prevent those companies from going bankrupt as such an acquisition deters foreclosure by banks while eventdriven investing in general tends to thrive during a bull market distressed investing works best during a bear market risk arbitrage or merger arbitrage includes such events as mergers acquisitions liquidations and hostile takeovers risk arbitrage typically involves buying and selling the stocks of two or more merging companies to take advantage of market discrepancies between acquisition price and stock price the risk element arises from the possibility that the merger or acquisition will not go ahead as planned hedge fund managers will use research and analysis to determine if the event will take place special situations are events that impact the value of a companys stock including the restructuring of a company or corporate transactions including spinoffs sharebuybacks security issuancerepurchase asset sales or other catalystoriented situations to take advantage of special situations the hedge fund manager must identify an upcoming event that will increase or decrease the value of the companys equity and equityrelated instruments other eventdriven strategies include credit arbitrage strategies which focus on corporate fixed income securities an activist strategy where the fund takes large positions in companies and uses the ownership to participate in the management a strategy based on predicting the final approval of new pharmaceutical drugs and legal catalyst strategy which specializes in companies involved in major lawsuits relative valueedit main article relative value economics relative value arbitrage strategies take advantage of relative discrepancies in price between securities the price discrepancy can occur due to mispricing of securities compared to related securities the underlying security or the market overall hedge fund managers can use various types of analysis to identify price discrepancies in securities including mathematical technical or fundamental techniques relative value is often used as a synonym for market neutral as strategies in this category typically have very little or no directional market exposure to the market as a whole other relative value substrategies include fixed income arbitrage exploit pricing inefficiencies between related fixed income securities equity market neutral exploits differences in stock prices by being long and short in stocks within the same sector industry market capitalization country which also creates a hedge against broader market factors convertible arbitrage exploit pricing inefficiencies between convertible securities and the corresponding stocks assetbacked securities fixedincome assetbacked fixed income arbitrage strategy using assetbacked securities credit long  short the same as long  short equity but in credit markets instead of equity markets statistical arbitrage identifying pricing inefficiencies between securities through mathematical modeling techniques volatility arbitrage exploit the change in implied volatility instead of the change in price yield alternatives nonfixed income arbitrage strategies based on the yield instead of the price regulatory arbitrage the practice of taking advantage of regulatory differences between two or more markets risk arbitrage exploiting market discrepancies between acquisition price and stock price miscellaneousedit in addition to those strategies within the four main categories there are several strategies that do not fit into these categorizations or can apply across several of them fund of hedge funds multimanager a hedge fund with a diversified portfolio of numerous underlying singlemanager hedge funds multistrategy a hedge fund using a combination of different strategies to reduce market risk minimum account fund the minimum amount to open a hedge fund account is say  million dollars with  nonholding or  million dollars with holding multimanager a hedge fund wherein the investment is spread along separate submanagers investing in their own strategy withdraw holding a hold is placed on all major withdrawals for  days prior and after hedge fund is created and established  funds equity funds with  long and  short positions leaving a net long position of  risk parity equalizing risk by allocating funds to a wide range of categories while maximizing gains through financial leveraging riskedit for an investor who already holds large quantities of equities and bonds investment in hedge funds may provide diversification and reduce the overall portfolio risk managers of hedge funds use particular trading strategies and instruments with the specific aim of reducing market risks to produce riskadjusted returns that are consistent with investors desired level of risk hedge funds ideally produce returns relatively uncorrelated with market indices while hedging can be a way of reducing the risk of an investment hedge funds like all other investment types are not immune to risk according to a report by the hennessee group hedge funds were approximately onethird less volatile than the sp  between  and  risk managementedit investors in hedge funds are in most countries required to be qualified investors who are assumed to be aware of the investment risks and accept these risks because of the potential returns relative to those risks fund managers may employ extensive risk management strategies in order to protect the fund and investors according to the financial times big hedge funds have some of the most sophisticated and exacting risk management practices anywhere in asset management hedge fund managers that hold a large number of investment positions for short durations are likely to have a particularly comprehensive risk management system in place and it has become usual for funds to have independent risk officers who assess and manage risks but are not otherwise involved in trading a variety of different measurement techniques and models are used to estimate risk according to the funds leverage liquidity and investment strategy nonnormality of returns volatility clustering and trends are not always accounted for by conventional risk measurement methodologies and so in addition to value at risk and similar measurements funds may use integrated measures such as drawdowns  in addition to assessing the marketrelated risks that may arise from an investment investors commonly employ operational due diligence to assess the risk that error or fraud at a hedge fund might result in loss to the investor considerations will include the organization and management of operations at the hedge fund manager whether the investment strategy is likely to be sustainable and the funds ability to develop as a company transparency and regulatory considerationsedit since hedge funds are private entities and have few public disclosure requirements this is sometimes perceived as a lack of transparency another common perception of hedge funds is that their managers are not subject to as much regulatory oversight andor registration requirements as other financial investment managers and more prone to managerspecific idiosyncratic risks such as style drifts faulty operations or fraud new regulations introduced in the us and the eu as of  require hedge fund managers to report more information leading to greater transparency in addition investors particularly institutional investors are encouraging further developments in hedge fund risk management both through internal practices and external regulatory requirements the increasing influence of institutional investors has led to greater transparency hedge funds increasingly provide information to investors including valuation methodology positions and leverage exposure risks shared with other investment typesedit hedge funds share many of the same types of risk as other investment classes including liquidity risk and manager risk liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset can be bought and sold or converted to cash similar to private equity funds hedge funds employ a lockup period during which an investor cannot remove money manager risk refers to those risks which arise from the management of funds as well as specific risks such as style drift which refers to a fund manager drifting away from an area of specific expertise manager risk factors include valuation risk capacity risk concentration risk and leverage risk valuation risk refers to the concern that the net asset value of investments may be inaccurate capacity risk can arise from placing too much money into one particular strategy which may lead to fund performance deterioration and concentration risk may arise if a fund has too much exposure to a particular investment sector trading strategy or group of correlated funds these risks may be managed through defined controls over conflict of interest restrictions on allocation of funds and set exposure limits for strategies many investment funds use leverage the practice of borrowing money trading on margin or using derivatives to obtain market exposure in excess of that provided by investors capital although leverage can increase potential returns the opportunity for larger gains is weighed against the possibility of greater losses hedge funds employing leverage are likely to engage in extensive risk management practices in comparison with investment banks hedge fund leverage is relatively low according to a national bureau of economic research working paper the average leverage for investment banks is  compared to between  and  for hedge funds some types of funds including hedge funds are perceived as having a greater appetite for risk with the intention of maximizing returns subject to the risk tolerance of investors and the fund manager managers will have an additional incentive to increase risk oversight when their own capital is invested in the fund notable failuresedit longterm capital management founded in  by john meriwether following backtoback financial crises in asia in  and russia in  the fund ended up losing  billion in less than four months the primary catalyst for the failure was russias default and a model that advised the fund to hold its position even as losses mounted tiger management run by julian robertson robertson founded the fund in  with  million and grew it to  billion by  making it the secondlargest hedge fund in the world at the time one year later assets under management reached  billion a series of bad investments greatly harmed tigers returns causing investors to redeem out of the fund atticus global founded by activist investor tim barakett in  with less than  million in hand and by  was one of the largest hedge funds in the world with  billion of assets under management barakett earned marketbeating returns over a long time period until the financial crisis in  after two years of losses barakett closed the fund in  atticus globals reported a compounded annual return of  compared to just  for the sp  fees and remunerationedit fees paid to hedge fundsedit hedge fund management firms typically charge their funds both a management fee and a performance fee management fees are calculated as a percentage of the funds net asset value and typically range from  to  per annum with  being standard they are usually expressed as an annual percentage but calculated and paid monthly or quarterly management fees for hedge funds are designed to cover the operating costs of the manager whereas the performance fee provides the managers profits however due to economies of scale the management fee from larger funds can generate a significant part of a managers profits and as a result some fees have been criticized by some public pension funds such as calpers for being too high the performance fee is typically  of the funds profits during any year though they range between  and  performance fees are intended to provide an incentive for a manager to generate profits performance fees have been criticized by warren buffett who believes that because hedge funds share only the profits and not the losses such fees create an incentive for highrisk investment management performance fee rates have fallen since the start of the credit crunch almost all hedge fund performance fees include a high water mark or loss carryforward provision which means that the performance fee only applies to net profits ie profits after losses in previous years have been recovered this prevents managers from receiving fees for volatile performance though a manager will sometimes close a fund that has suffered serious losses and start a new fund rather than attempting to recover the losses over a number of years without performance fee some performance fees include a hurdle so that a fee is only paid on the funds performance in excess of a benchmark rate eg libor or a fixed percentage a soft hurdle means the performance fee is calculated on all the funds returns if the hurdle rate is cleared a hard hurdle is calculated only on returns above the hurdle rate a hurdle is intended to ensure that a manager is only rewarded if the fund generates returns in excess of the returns that the investor would have received if they had invested their money elsewhere some hedge funds charge a redemption fee or withdrawal fee for early withdrawals during a specified period of time typically a year or when withdrawals exceed a predetermined percentage of the original investment the purpose of the fee is to discourage shortterm investing reduce turnover and deter withdrawals after periods of poor performance unlike management fees and performance fees redemption fees are usually kept by the fund remuneration of portfolio managersedit hedge fund management firms are usually owned by their portfolio managers who are therefore entitled to any profits that the business makes as management fees are intended to cover the firms operating costs performance fees and any excess management fees are generally distributed to the firms owners as profits funds do not tend to report compensation and so published lists of the amounts earned by top managers tend to be estimates based on factors such as the fees charged by their funds and the capital they are thought to have invested in them many managers have accumulated large stakes in their own funds and so top hedge fund managers can earn extraordinary amounts of money perhaps up to  billion in a good year earnings at the very top are higher than in any other sector of the financial industry  and collectively the top  hedge fund managers regularly earn more than all  of the chief executives in the sp  most hedge fund managers are remunerated much less however and if performance fees are not earned then small managers at least are unlikely to be paid significant amounts in  the top manager earned m the tenth earned m and the th earned m in  the average earnings for the  highest compensated hedge fund managers in the united states was  million while the mean total compensation for all hedge fund

company the fund is managed by an investment manager in the form of an organization or company that is legally and financially distinct from the hedge fund and its portfolio of assets many investment managers utilize service providers for operational support service providers include prime brokers banks administrators distributors and accounting firms prime brokers clear trades and provide leverage and shortterm financing they are usually divisions of large investment banks the prime broker acts as a counterparty to derivative contracts and lends securities for particular investment strategies such as longshort equities and convertible bond arbitrage it can provide custodial services for the funds assets and execution and clearing services for the hedge fund manager hedge fund administrators are responsible for operations accounting and valuation services this back office support allows fund managers to concentrate on trades administrators also process subscriptions and redemptions and perform various shareholder services hedge funds in the united states are not required to appoint an administrator and all of these functions can be performed by an investment manager a number of conflict of interest situations may arise in this arrangement particularly in the calculation of a funds net asset value nav some funds voluntarily employ external auditors thereby offering a greater degree of transparency a distributor is an underwriter broker dealer or other person who participates in the distribution of securities the distributor is also responsible for marketing the fund to potential investors many hedge funds do not have distributors and in such cases the investment manager will be responsible for distribution of securities and marketing though many funds also use placement agents and brokerdealers for distribution most funds use an independent accounting firm to audit the assets of the fund provide tax services and perform a complete audit of the funds financial statements the yearend audit is often performed in accordance with the standard accounting practices enforced within the country the fund it established or the international financial reporting standards ifrs the auditor may verify the funds nav and assets under management aum some auditors only provide nav lite services meaning that the valuation is based on prices received from the manager rather than independent assessment domicile and taxationedit the legal structure of a specific hedge fund in particular its domicile and the type of legal entity in use is usually determined by the tax expectations of the funds investors regulatory considerations will also play a role many hedge funds are established in offshore financial centers to avoid adverse tax consequences for its foreign and taxexempt investors offshore funds that invest in the us typically pay withholding taxes on certain types of investment income but not us capital gains tax however the funds investors are subject to tax in their own jurisdictions on any increase in the value of their investments this tax treatment promotes crossborder investments by limiting the potential for multiple jurisdictions to layer taxes on investors us taxexempt investors such as pension plans and endowments invest primarily in offshore hedge funds to preserve their tax exempt status and avoid unrelated business taxable income the investment manager usually based in a major financial center pays tax on its management fees per the tax laws of the state and country where it is located in  half of the existing hedge funds were registered offshore and half onshore the cayman islands was the leading location for offshore funds accounting for  of the total number of global hedge funds the us had  luxembourg  ireland  the british virgin islands  and bermuda had  basket optionsedit deutsche bank and barclays created special options accounts for hedge fund clients in the banks’ names and claimed to own the assets when in fact the hedge fund clients had full control of the assets and reaped the profits the hedge funds would then execute trades — many of them a few seconds in duration — but wait until just after a year had passed to exercise the options allowing them to report the profits at a lower longterm capital gains tax rate — alexandra stevenson july   new york times the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations chaired by carl levin resulted in a  report that found that from  and  hedge funds avoided billions of dollars in taxes by using basket options the internal revenue service began investigating renaissance technologies in  and levin criticized the irs for taking six years to investigate the company using basket options renaissance avoided more than  billion in taxes over more than a decade these banks and hedge funds involved in this case used dubious structured financial products in a giant game of let’s pretend costing the treasury billions and bypassing safeguards that protect the economy from excessive bank lending for stock speculation — carl levin  senate permanent subcommittee on investigations a dozen other hedge funds along with renaissance technologies used deutsche banks and barclays basket options renaissance argued that basket options were extremely important because they gave the hedge fund the ability to increase its returns by borrowing more and to protect against model and programming failures in july  the united states internal revenue claimed hedge funds used basket options to bypass taxes on shortterm trades these basket options will now be labeled as listed transactions that must be declared on tax returns and a failure to do would result in a penalty investment manager locationsedit in contrast to the funds themselves investment managers are primarily located onshore the united states remains the largest center of investment with usbased funds managing around  of global assets at the end of  as of april  there were approximately  investment advisers managing one or more private hedge funds registered with the securities and exchange commission new york city and the gold coast area of connecticut are the leading locations for us hedge fund managers london is europes leading center for hedge fund managers according to eurohedge data around  funds located in the uk managed some  of europeanbased hedge fund assets in  interest in hedge funds in asia has increased significantly since  especially in japan hong kong and singapore however the uk and the us remain the leading locations for management of asian hedge fund assets the legal entityedit hedge fund legal structures vary depending on location and the investors us hedge funds aimed at usbased taxable investors are generally structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies limited partnerships and other flowthrough taxation structures assure that investors in hedge funds are not subject to both entitylevel and personallevel taxation a hedge fund structured as a limited partnership must have a general partner the general partner may be an individual or a corporation the general partner serves as the manager of the limited partnership and has unlimited liability the limited partners serve as the funds investors and have no responsibility for management or investment decisions their liability is limited to the amount of money they invest for partnership interests as an alternative to a limited partnership arrangement us domestic hedge funds may be structured as limited liability companies with members acting as corporate shareholders and enjoying protection from individual liability by contrast offshore corporate funds are usually used for nonus investors and when they are domiciled in an applicable offshore tax haven no entitylevel tax is imposed many managers of offshore funds permit the participation of taxexempt us investors such as pensions funds institutional endowments and charitable trusts as an alternative legal structure offshore funds may be formed as an openended unit trust using an unincorporated mutual fund structure japanese investors prefer to invest in unit trusts such as those available in the cayman islands the investment manager who organizes the hedge fund may retain an interest in the fund either as the general partner of a limited partnership or as the holder of founder shares in a corporate fund for offshore funds structured as corporate entities the fund may appoint a board of directors the boards primary role is to provide a layer of oversight while representing the interests of the shareholders however in practice board members may lack sufficient expertise to be effective in performing those duties the board may include both affiliated directors who are employees of the fund and independent directors whose relationship to the fund is limited types of fundsedit openended hedge funds continue to issue shares to new investors and allow periodic withdrawals at the net asset value nav for each share closedended hedge funds issue a limited number of tradeable shares at inception shares of listed hedges funds are traded on stock exchanges such as the irish stock exchange and may be purchased by nonaccredited investors side pocketsedit a side pocket is a mechanism whereby a fund compartmentalizes assets that are relatively illiquid or difficult to value reliably when an investment is sidepocketed its value is calculated separately from the value of the fund’s main portfolio because side pockets are used to hold illiquid investments investors do not have the standard redemption rights with respect to the side pocket investment that they do with respect to the fund’s main portfolio profits or losses from the investment are allocated on a pro rata basis only to those who are investors at the time the investment is placed into the side pocket and are not shared with new investors funds typically carry side pocket assets at cost for purposes of calculating management fees and reporting net asset values this allows fund managers to avoid attempting a valuation of the underlying investments which may not always have a readily available market value side pockets were widely used by hedge funds during the  financial crisis amidst a flood of withdrawal requests side pockets allowed fund managers to lay away illiquid securities until market liquidity improved a move that could reduce losses however as the practice restricts investors ability to redeem their investments it is often unpopular and many have alleged that it has been abused or applied unfairly the sec also has expressed concern about aggressive use of side pockets and has sanctioned certain fund managers for inappropriate use of them regulationedit hedge funds must conform to the national federal and state regulatory laws in their respective locations the us regulations and restrictions that apply to hedge funds differ from its mutual funds mutual funds unlike hedge funds and other private funds are subject to the investment company act of  which is a highly detailed and extensive regulatory regime according to a report by the international organization of securities commissions the most common form of regulation pertains to restrictions on financial advisers and hedge fund managers in an effort to minimize client fraud on the other hand us hedge funds are exempt from many of the standard registration and reporting requirements because they only accept accredited investors in  regulations were enacted in the us and european union which introduced additional hedge fund reporting requirements these included the uss doddfrank wall street reform act and european alternative investment fund managers directive in  in an attempt for selfregulation  leading hedge fund managers developed a voluntary set of international standards in best practice and known as the hedge fund standards they were designed to create a … framework of transparency integrity and good governance in the hedge fund industry the hedge fund standards board was set up to prompt and maintain these standards going forward and by  it had approximately  hedge fund managers and institutional investors with a value of us tn investment endorsing the standards united statesedit hedge funds within the us are subject to regulatory reporting and record keeping requirements many hedge funds also fall under the jurisdiction of the commodity futures trading commission and are subject to rules and provisions of the  commodity exchange act which prohibits fraud and manipulation the securities act of  required companies to file a registration statement with the sec to comply with its private placement rules before offering their securities to the public the securities exchange act of  required a fund with more than  investors to register with the sec the investment advisers act of  contained antifraud provisions that regulated hedge fund managers and advisers created limits for the number and types of investors and prohibited public offerings the act also exempted hedge funds from mandatory registration with the us securities and exchange commission sec when selling to accredited investors with a minimum of us million in investment assets companies and institutional investors with at least us million in investment assets also qualified in december  the sec began requiring hedge fund advisers managing more than us million and with more than  investors to register with the sec under the investment advisers act the sec stated that it was adopting a riskbased approach to monitoring hedge funds as part of its evolving regulatory regimen for the burgeoning industry the new rule was controversial with two commissioners dissenting and was later challenged in court by a hedge fund manager in june  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia overturned the rule and sent it back to the agency to be reviewed in response to the court decision in  the sec adopted rule  which unlike the earlier challenged rule does not impose additional filing reporting or disclosure obligations but does potentially increase the risk of enforcement action for negligent or fraudulent activity hedge fund managers with at least us million in assets under management are required to file publicly quarterly reports disclosing ownership of registered equity securities and are subject to public disclosure if they own more than  of the class of any registered equity security registered advisers must report their business practices and disciplinary history to the sec and to their investors they are required to have written compliance policies a chief compliance officer and their records and practices may be examined by the sec the uss doddfrank wall street reform act was passed in july  and requires sec registration of advisers who manage private funds with more than us million in assets registered managers must file form adv with the sec as well as information regarding their assets under management and trading positions previously advisers with fewer than  clients were exempt although many hedge fund advisers voluntarily registered with the sec to satisfy institutional investors under doddfrank investment advisers with less than us million in assets under management became subject to state regulation this increased the number of hedge funds under state supervision overseas advisers who managed more than us million were also required to register with the sec the act requires hedge funds to provide information about their trades and portfolios to regulators including the newly created financial stability oversight council in this regard most hedge funds and other private funds including private equity funds must file form pf with the sec which is an extensive reporting form with substantial data on the funds activities and positions under the volcker rule regulators are also required to implement regulations for banks their affiliates and holding companies to limit their relationships with hedge funds and to prohibit these organizations from proprietary trading and to limit their investment in and sponsorship of hedge funds europeedit within the european union eu hedge funds are primarily regulated through their managers in the united kingdom where  of europes hedge funds are based hedge fund managers are required to be authorised and regulated by the financial conduct authority fca each country has their own specific restrictions on hedge fund activities including controls on use of derivatives in portugal and limits on leverage in france in the eu managers are subject to the eus directive on alternative investment fund managers aifmd according to the eu the aim of the directive is to provide greater monitoring and control of alternative investment funds aifmd requires all eu hedge fund managers to register with national regulatory authorities and to disclose more information on a more frequent basis it also directs hedge fund managers to hold larger amounts of capital aifmd also introduced a passport for hedge funds authorised in one eu country to operate throughout the eu the scope of aifmd is broad and encompasses managers located within the eu as well as noneu managers that market their funds to european investors an aspect of aifmd which challenges established practices in the hedge funds sector is the potential restriction of remuneration through bonus deferrals and clawback provisions otheredit some hedge funds are established in offshore centres such as the cayman islands dublin luxembourg the british virgin islands and bermuda which have different regulations concerning nonaccredited investors client confidentiality and fund manager independence in south africa investment fund managers must be approved by and register with the financial services board fsb performanceedit measurementedit performance statistics for individual hedge funds are difficult to obtain as the funds have historically not been required to report their performance to a central repository and restrictions against public offerings and advertisement have led many managers to refuse to provide performance information publicly however summaries of individual hedge fund performance are occasionally available in industry journals and databases and investment consultancy hennessee group one estimate is that the average hedge fund returned  per year representing a  return above overall market performance before fees based on performance data from  hedge funds another is that between january  and december  the hedge funds outperformed other investments were significantly less volatile with stocks falling  per year over the decade and hedge funds rising  more recent data show that hedge fund performance has declined and underperformed the market hedge funds performance is measured by comparing their returns to an estimate of their risk common measures are the sharpe ratio treynor measure and jensens alpha these measures work best when returns follow normal distributions without autocorrelation and these assumptions are often not met in practice new performance measures have been introduced that attempt to address some of theoretical concerns with traditional indicators including modified sharpe ratios the omega ratio introduced by keating and shadwick in  alternative investments risk adjusted performance airap published by sharma in  and kappa developed by kaplan and knowles in  sectorsize effectedit there is a debate over whether alpha the managers skill element in performance has been diluted by the expansion of the hedge fund industry two reasons are given first the increase in traded volume may have been reducing the market anomalies that are a source of hedge fund performance second the remuneration model is attracting more managers which may dilute the talent available in the industry hedge fund indicesedit indices that track hedge fund returns are in order of development called noninvestable investable and clone they play a central and unambiguous role in traditional asset markets where they are widely accepted as representative of their underlying portfolios equity and debt index fund products provide investable access to most developed markets in these asset classes hedge funds however are actively managed so that tracking is impossible noninvestable hedge fund indices on the other hand may be more or less representative but returns data on many of the reference group of funds is nonpublic this may result in biased estimates of their returns in an attempt to address this problem clone indices have been created in an attempt to replicate the statistical properties of hedge funds without being directly based on their returns data none of these approaches achieves the accuracy of indices in other asset classes for which there is more complete published data concerning the underlying returns noninvestable indicesedit noninvestable indices are indicative in nature and aim to represent the performance of some database of hedge funds using some measure such as mean median or weighted mean from a hedge fund database the databases have diverse selection criteria and methods of construction and no single database captures all funds this leads to significant differences in reported performance between different indices although they aim to be representative noninvestable indices suffer from a lengthy and largely unavoidable list of biases funds participation in a database is voluntary leading to selfselection bias because those funds that choose to report may not be typical of funds as a whole for example some do not report because of poor results or because they have already reached their target size and do not wish to raise further money the short lifetimes of many hedge funds means that there are many new entrants and many departures each year which raises the problem of survivorship bias if we examine only funds that have survived to the present we will overestimate past returns because many of the worstperforming funds have not survived and the observed association between fund youth and fund performance suggests that this bias may be substantial when a fund is added to a database for the first time all or part of its historical data is recorded expost in the database it is likely that funds only publish their results when they are favorable so that the average performances displayed by the funds during their incubation period are inflated this is known as instant history bias or backfill bias investable indicesedit investable indices are an attempt to reduce these problems by ensuring that the return of the index is available to shareholders to create an investable index the index provider selects funds and develops structured products or derivative instruments that deliver the performance of the index when investors buy these products the index provider makes the investments in the underlying funds making an investable index similar in some ways to a fund of hedge funds portfolio to make the index investable hedge funds must agree to accept investments on the terms given by the constructor to make the index liquid these terms must include provisions for redemptions that some managers may consider too onerous to be acceptable this means that investable indices do not represent the total universe of hedge funds most seriously they underrepresent more successful managers who typically refuse to accept such investment protocols hedge fund replicationedit the most recent addition to the field approach the problem in a different manner instead of reflecting the performance of actual hedge funds they take a statistical approach to the analysis of historic hedge fund returns and use this to construct a model of how hedge fund returns respond to the movements of various investable financial assets this model is then used to construct an investable portfolio of those assets this makes the index investable and in principle they can be as representative as the hedge fund database from which they were constructed however these clone indices rely on a statistical modelling process such indices have too short a history to state whether this approach will be considered successful closuresedit in march  hfr – a hedge fund research data and service provider – reported that there were more hedgefund closures in  than during the  recession according to the report several large public pension funds pulled their investments in hedge funds because the funds’ subpar performance as a group did not merit the high fees they charged despite the hedge fund industry topping  trillion for the first time ever in  the number of new hedge funds launched fell short of crisisera figures there were  hedge fund launches in  fewer than the  opened in  and dramatically less than the  launches in  debates and controversiesedit systemic riskedit systemic risk refers to the risk of instability across the entire financial system as opposed to within a single company such risk may arise following a destabilizing event or events affecting a group of financial institutions linked through investment activity organizations such as the national bureau of economic research and the european central bank have charged that hedge funds pose systemic risks to the financial sector and following the failure of hedge fund longterm capital management ltcm in  there was widespread concern about the potential for systemic risk if a hedge fund failure led to the failure of its counterparties as it happens no financial assistance was provided to ltcm by the us federal reserve so there was no direct cost to us taxpayers but a large bailout had to be mounted by a number of financial institutions however these claims are widely disputed by the financial industry who typically regard hedge funds as small enough to fail since most are relatively small in terms of the assets they manage and operate with low leverage thereby limiting the potential harm to the economic system should one of them fail formal analysis of hedge fund leverage before and during the  financial crisis suggests that hedge fund leverage is both fairly modest and countercyclical to the market leverage of investment banks and the larger financial sector hedge fund leverage decreased prior to the financial crisis even while the leverage of other financial intermediaries continued to increase hedge funds fail regularly and numerous hedge funds failed during the financial crisis in testimony to the house financial services committee in  ben bernanke the federal reserve board chairman said he would not think that any hedge fund or private equity fund would become a systemically critical firm individually nevertheless although hedge funds go to great lengths to reduce the ratio of risk to reward inevitably a number of risks remain systemic risk is increased in a crisis if there is herd behaviour which causes a number of similar hedge funds to make losses in similar trades in addition while most hedge funds make only modest use of leverage hedge funds differ from many other market participants such as banks and mutual funds in that there are no regulatory constraints on their use of leverage and some hedge funds seek large amounts of leverage as part of their market strategy the extensive use of leverage can lead to forced liquidations in a crisis particularly for hedge funds that invest at least in part in illiquid investments the close interconnectedness of the hedge funds with their prime brokers typically investment banks can lead to domino effects in a crisis and indeed failing counterparty banks can freeze hedge funds these systemic risk concerns are exacerbated by the prominent role of hedge funds in the financial markets the global hedge fund industry has over  trillion in assets and this does not take into account the full effect of leverage which by definition is market exposure in excess of the amount invested an august  survey by the financial services authority concluded that risks were limited and had reduced as a result inter alia of larger margins being required by counterparty banks but might change rapidly according to market conditions in stressed market conditions investors might suddenly withdraw large sums resulting in forced asset sales this might cause liquidity and pricing problems if it occurred across a number of funds or in one large highly leveraged fund transparencyedit hedge funds are structured to avoid most direct regulation although their managers may be regulated and are not required to publicly disclose their investment activities except to the extent that investors generally are subject to disclosure requirements this is in contrast to a regulated mutual fund or exchangetraded fund which will typically have to meet regulatory requirements for disclosure an investor in a hedge fund usually has direct access to the investment adviser of the fund and may enjoy more personalized reporting than investors in retail investment funds this may include detailed discussions of risks assumed and significant positions however this high level of disclosure is not available to noninvestors contributing to hedge funds reputation for secrecy while some hedge funds have very limited transparency even to investors funds may choose to report some information in the interest of recruiting additional investors much of the data available in consolidated databases is selfreported and unverified a study was done on two major databases containing hedge fund data the study noted that  common funds had significant differences in reported information eg returns inception date net assets value incentive fee management fee investment styles etc and that  of return numbers and  of nav numbers were dramatically different with these limitations investors have to do their own research which may cost on the scale of us for a fund that is not wellestablished a lack of verification of financial documents by investors or by independent auditors has in some cases assisted in fraud in the mids kirk wright of international management associates was accused of mail fraud and other securities violations which allegedly defrauded clients of close to us million in december  bernard madoff was arrested for running a us billion ponzi scheme that closely resembled a hedge fund and was incorrectly described as one several feeder hedge funds of which the largest was fairfield sentry channeled money to it following the madoff case the sec adopted reforms in december  that required hedge funds managed by registered investment advisers to have their assets in the custody of a qualified custodian and subjected them to an audit requirement the process of matching hedge funds to investors has traditionally been fairly opaque with investments often driven by personal connections or recommendations of portfolio managers many funds disclose their holdings strategy and historic performance relative to market indices giving investors some idea of how their money is being allocated although individual holdings are often not disclosed investors are often drawn to hedge funds by the possibility of realizing significant returns or hedging against volatility in the market the complexity and fees associated with hedge funds are causing some to exit the market – calpers the largest pension fund in the us announced plans to completely divest from hedge funds in  some services are attempting to improve matching between hedge funds and investors hedgez is designed to allow investors to easily search and sort through funds imatchative aims to match investors to funds through algorithms that factor in an investors goals and behavioral profile in hopes of helping funds and investors understand the how their perceptions and motivations drive investment decisions links with analystsedit in june  prompted by a letter from gary j aguirre the senate judiciary committee began an investigation into the links between hedge funds and independent analysts aguirre was fired from his job with the sec when as lead investigator of insider trading allegations against pequot capital management he tried to interview john mack then being considered for chief executive officer at morgan stanley the judiciary committee and the us senate finance committee issued a scathing report in  which found that aguirre had been illegally fired in reprisal for his pursuit of mack and in  the sec was forced to reopen its case against pequot pequot settled with the sec for us million and arthur j samberg chief investment officer of pequot was barred from working as an investment advisor pequot closed its doors under the pressure of investigations the systemic practice of hedge funds submitting periodic electronic questionnaires to stock analysts as a part of market research was reported in by the new york times in july  according to the report one motivation for the questionnaires was to obtain subjective information not available to the public and possible early notice of trading recommendations that could produce short term market movements value in meanvariance efficient portfoliosedit according to modern portfolio theory rational investors will seek to hold portfolios that are meanvariance efficient that is portfolios that offer the highest level of return per unit of risk one of the attractive features of hedge funds in particular market neutral and similar funds is that they sometimes have a modest correlation with traditional assets such as equities this means that hedge funds have a potentially quite valuable role in investment portfolios as diversifiers reducing overall portfolio risk however there are three reasons why one might not wish to allocate a high proportion of assets into hedge funds these reasons are hedge funds are highly individual and it is hard to estimate the likely returns or risks hedge funds low correlation with other assets tends to dissipate during stressful market events making them much less useful for diversification than they may appear hedge fund returns are reduced considerably by the high fee structures that are typically charged several studies have suggested that hedge funds are sufficiently diversifying to merit inclusion in investor portfolios but this is disputed for example by mark kritzman who performed a meanvariance optimization calculation on an opportunity set that consisted of a stock index fund a bond index fund and ten hypothetical hedge funds the optimizer found that a meanvariance efficient portfolio did not contain any allocation to hedge funds largely because of the impact of performance fees to demonstrate this kritzman repeated the optimization using an assumption that the hedge funds incurred no performance fees the result from this second optimization was an allocation of  to hedge funds the other factor reducing the attractiveness of hedge funds in a diversified portfolio is that they tend to perform poorly during equity bear markets just when an investor needs part of their portfolio to add value for example in january–september  the credit suissetremont hedge fund index was down  according to the same index series even dedicated short bias funds had a return of − during september  in other words even though low average correlations may appear to make hedge funds attractive this may not work in turbulent period for example around the collapse of lehman brothers in september  see alsoedit activist shareholder alternative asset board of directors corporate governance fund governance investment banking list of

corporate finance personal finance public finance banks and banking financial regulation fund governance v t e a hedge fund is an investment fund that pools capital from accredited individuals or institutional investors and invests in a variety of assets often with complex portfolioconstruction and riskmanagement techniques it is administered by a professional investment management firm and often structured as a limited partnership limited liability company or similar vehicle hedge funds are generally distinct from mutual funds as their use of leverage is not capped by regulators and distinct from private equity funds as the majority of hedge funds invest in relatively liquid assets the term hedge fund originated from the paired long and short positions that the first of these funds used to hedge market risk over time the types and nature of the hedging concepts expanded as did the different types of investment vehicles today hedge funds engage in a diverse range of markets and strategies and employ a wide variety of financial instruments and risk management techniques hedge funds are made available only to certain sophisticated or accredited investors and cannot be offered or sold to the general public as such they generally avoid direct regulatory oversight bypass licensing requirements applicable to investment companies and operate with greater flexibility than mutual funds and other investment funds however following the financial crisis of – regulations were passed in the united states and europe with intentions to increase government oversight of hedge funds and eliminate certain regulatory gaps hedge funds have existed for many decades and have become increasingly popular they have now grown to be a substantial fraction of asset management with assets now totaling around  trillion hedge funds are almost always openended and allow additions or withdrawals by their investors generally on a monthly or quarterly basis the value of an investors holding is directly related to the fund net asset value many hedge fund investment strategies aim to achieve a positive return on investment regardless of whether markets are rising or falling absolute return hedge fund managers often invest money of their own in the fund they manage a hedge fund typically pays its investment manager an annual management fee for example  of the assets of the fund and a performance fee for example  of the increase in the funds net asset value during the year both coinvestment and performance fees serve to align the interests of managers with those of the investors in the fund some hedge funds have several billion dollars of assets under management aum contents  introduction  history  notable hedge fund managers  strategies  global macro

meaning a line of bushes around a field has long been used as a metaphor for the placing of limits on risk early hedge funds sought to hedge specific investments against general market fluctuations by shorting the market hence the name nowadays however many different investment strategies are used many of which do not hedge risk– historyedit during the us bull market of the s there were numerous private investment vehicles available to wealthy investors of that period the best known today is the grahamnewman partnership founded by benjamin graham and jerry newman this was cited by warren buffett in a  letter to the museum of american finance as an early hedge fund the sociologist alfred w jones is credited with coining the phrase hedged fund and is credited with creating the first hedge fund structure in  although this has been disputed jones referred to his fund as being hedged a term then commonly used on wall street to describe the management of investment risk due to changes in the financial markets in the s hedge funds specialized in a single strategy with most fund managers following the longshort equity model many hedge funds closed during the recession of – and the – stock market crash due to heavy losses they received renewed attention in the late s during the s the number of hedge funds increased significantly with the s stock market rise the

global macro directional eventdriven and relative value arbitrage strategies within these categories each entail characteristic risk and return profiles a fund may employ a single strategy or multiple strategies for flexibility risk management or diversification the hedge funds prospectus also known as an offering memorandum offers potential investors information about key aspects of the fund including the funds investment strategy investment type and leverage limit the elements contributing to a hedge fund strategy include the hedge funds approach to the market the particular instrument used the market sector the fund specializes in eg healthcare the method used to select investments and the amount of diversification within the fund there are a variety of market approaches to different asset classes including equity fixed income commodity and currency instruments used include equities fixed income futures options and swaps strategies can be divided into those in which investments can be selected by managers known as discretionaryqualitative or those in which investments are selected using a computerized system known as systematicquantitative the amount of diversification within the fund can vary funds may be multistrategy multifund multimarket multimanager or a combination sometimes hedge fund strategies are described as absolute return and are classified as either market neutral or directional market neutral funds have less correlation to overall market performance by neutralizing the effect of market swings whereas directional funds utilize trends and inconsistencies in the market and have greater exposure to the markets fluctuations global macroedit main article global macro hedge funds using a global macro investing strategy take sizable positions in share bond or currency markets in anticipation of global macroeconomic events in order to generate a riskadjusted return global macro fund managers use macroeconomic big picture analysis based on global market events and trends to identify opportunities for investment that would profit from anticipated price movements while global macro strategies have a large amount of flexibility due to their ability to use leverage to take large positions in diverse investments in multiple markets the timing of the implementation of the strategies is important in order to generate attractive riskadjusted returns global macro is often categorized as a directional investment strategy global macro strategies can be divided into discretionary and systematic approaches discretionary trading is carried out by investment managers who identify and select investments whereas systematic trading is based on mathematical models and executed by software with limited human involvement beyond the programming and updating of the software these strategies can also be divided into trend or countertrend approaches depending on whether the fund attempts to profit from following trends long or shortterm or attempts to anticipate and profit from reversals in trends within global macro strategies there are further substrategies including systematic diversified in which the fund trades in diversified markets or systematic currency in which the fund trades in currency markets other substrategies include those employed by commodity trading advisors ctas where the fund trades in futures or options in commodity markets or in swaps this is also known as a managed future fund ctas trade in commodities such as gold and financial instruments including stock indices they also take both long and short positions allowing them to make profit in both market upswings and downswings directionaledit directional investment strategies use market movements trends or inconsistencies when picking stocks across a variety of markets computer models can be used or fund managers will identify and select investments these types of strategies have a greater exposure to the fluctuations of the overall market than do market neutral strategies directional hedge fund strategies include us and international longshort equity hedge funds where long equity positions are hedged with short sales of equities or equity index options within directional strategies there are a number of substrategies emerging markets funds focus on emerging markets such as china and india whereas sector funds specialize in specific areas including technology healthcare biotechnology pharmaceuticals energy and basic materials funds using a fundamental growth strategy invest in companies with more earnings growth than the overall stock market or relevant sector while funds using a fundamental value strategy invest in undervalued companies funds that use quantitative and financial signal processing techniques for equity trading are described as using a quantitative directional strategy funds using a short bias strategy take advantage of declining equity prices using short positions eventdrivenedit main article eventdriven investing eventdriven strategies concern situations in which the underlying investment opportunity and risk are associated with an event an eventdriven investment strategy finds investment opportunities in corporate transactional events such as consolidations acquisitions recapitalizations bankruptcies and liquidations managers employing such a strategy capitalize on valuation inconsistencies in the market before or after such events and take a position based on the predicted movement of the security or securities in question large institutional investors such as hedge funds are more likely to pursue eventdriven investing strategies than traditional equity investors because they have the expertise and resources to analyze corporate transactional events for investment opportunities corporate transactional events generally fit into three categories distressed securities risk arbitrage and special situations distressed securities include such events as restructurings recapitalizations and bankruptcies a distressed securities investment strategy involves investing in the bonds or loans of companies facing bankruptcy or severe financial distress when these bonds or loans are being traded at a discount to their value hedge fund managers pursuing the distressed debt investment strategy aim to capitalize on depressed bond prices hedge funds purchasing distressed debt may prevent those companies from going bankrupt as such an acquisition deters foreclosure by banks while eventdriven investing in general tends to thrive during a bull market distressed investing works best during a bear market risk arbitrage or merger arbitrage includes such events as mergers acquisitions liquidations and hostile takeovers risk arbitrage typically involves buying and selling the stocks of two or more merging companies to take advantage of market discrepancies between acquisition price and stock price the risk element arises from the possibility that the merger or acquisition will not go ahead as planned hedge fund managers will use research and analysis to determine if the event will take place special situations are events that impact the value of a companys stock including the restructuring of a company or corporate transactions including spinoffs sharebuybacks security issuancerepurchase asset sales or other catalystoriented situations to take advantage of special situations the hedge fund manager must identify an upcoming event that will increase or decrease the value of the companys equity and equityrelated instruments other eventdriven strategies include credit arbitrage strategies which focus on corporate fixed income securities an activist strategy where the fund takes large positions in companies and uses the ownership to participate in the management a strategy based on predicting the final approval of new pharmaceutical drugs and legal catalyst strategy which specializes in companies involved in major lawsuits relative valueedit main article relative value economics relative value arbitrage strategies take advantage of relative discrepancies in price between securities the price discrepancy can occur due to mispricing of securities compared to related securities the underlying security or the market overall hedge fund managers can use various types of analysis to identify price discrepancies in securities including mathematical technical or fundamental techniques relative value is often used as a synonym for market neutral as strategies in this category typically have very little or no directional market exposure to the market as a whole other relative value substrategies include fixed income arbitrage exploit pricing inefficiencies between related fixed income securities equity market neutral exploits differences in stock prices by being long and short in stocks within the same sector industry market capitalization country which also creates a hedge against broader market factors convertible arbitrage exploit pricing inefficiencies between convertible securities and the corresponding stocks assetbacked securities fixedincome assetbacked fixed income arbitrage strategy using assetbacked securities credit long  short the same as long  short equity but in credit markets instead of equity markets statistical arbitrage identifying pricing inefficiencies between securities through mathematical modeling techniques volatility arbitrage exploit the change in implied volatility instead of the change in price yield alternatives nonfixed income arbitrage strategies based on the yield instead of the price regulatory arbitrage the practice of taking advantage of regulatory differences between two or more markets risk arbitrage exploiting market discrepancies between acquisition price and stock price miscellaneousedit in addition to those strategies within the four main categories there are several strategies that do not fit into these categorizations or can apply across several of them fund of hedge funds multimanager a hedge fund with a diversified portfolio of numerous underlying singlemanager hedge funds multistrategy a hedge fund using a combination of different strategies to reduce market risk minimum account fund the minimum amount to open a hedge fund account is say  million dollars with  nonholding or  million dollars with holding multimanager a hedge fund wherein the investment is spread along separate submanagers investing in their own strategy withdraw holding a hold is placed on all major withdrawals for  days prior and after hedge fund is created and established  funds equity funds with  long and  short positions leaving a net long position of  risk parity equalizing risk by allocating funds to a wide range of categories while maximizing gains through financial leveraging riskedit for an investor who already holds large quantities of equities and bonds investment in hedge funds may provide diversification and reduce the overall portfolio risk managers of hedge funds use particular trading strategies and instruments with the specific aim of reducing market risks to produce riskadjusted returns that are consistent with investors desired level of risk hedge funds ideally produce returns relatively uncorrelated with market indices while hedging can be a way of reducing the risk of an investment hedge funds like all other investment types are not immune to risk according to a report by the hennessee group hedge funds were approximately onethird less volatile than the sp  between  and  risk managementedit investors in hedge funds are in most countries required to be qualified investors who are assumed to be aware of the investment risks and accept these risks because of the potential returns relative to those risks fund managers may employ extensive risk management strategies in order to protect the fund and investors according to the financial times big hedge funds have some of the most sophisticated and exacting risk management practices anywhere in asset management hedge fund managers that hold a large number of investment positions for short durations are likely to have a particularly comprehensive risk management system in place and it has become usual for funds to have independent risk officers who assess and manage risks but are not otherwise involved in trading a variety of different measurement techniques and models are used to estimate risk according to the funds leverage liquidity and investment strategy nonnormality of returns volatility clustering and trends are not always accounted for by conventional risk measurement methodologies and so in addition to value at risk and similar measurements funds may use integrated measures such as drawdowns  in addition to assessing the marketrelated risks that may arise from an investment investors commonly employ operational due diligence to assess the risk that error or fraud at a hedge fund might result in loss to the investor considerations will include the organization and management of operations at the hedge fund manager whether the investment strategy is likely to be sustainable and the funds ability to develop as a company transparency and regulatory considerationsedit since hedge funds are private entities and have few public disclosure requirements this is sometimes perceived as a lack of transparency another common perception of hedge funds is that their managers are not subject to as much regulatory oversight andor registration requirements as other financial investment managers and more prone to managerspecific idiosyncratic risks such as style drifts faulty operations or fraud new regulations introduced in the us and the eu as of  require hedge fund managers to report more information leading to greater transparency in addition investors particularly institutional investors are encouraging further developments in hedge fund risk management both through internal practices and external regulatory requirements the increasing influence of institutional investors has led to greater transparency hedge funds increasingly provide information to investors including valuation methodology positions and leverage exposure risks shared with other investment typesedit hedge funds share many of the same types of risk as other investment classes including liquidity risk and manager risk liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset can be bought and sold or converted to cash similar to private equity funds hedge funds employ a lockup period during which an investor cannot remove money manager risk refers to those risks which arise from the management of funds as well as specific risks such as style drift which refers to a fund manager drifting away from an area of specific expertise manager risk factors include valuation risk capacity risk concentration risk and leverage risk valuation risk refers to the concern that the net asset value of investments may be inaccurate capacity risk can arise from placing too much money into one particular strategy which may lead to fund performance deterioration and concentration risk may arise if a fund has too much exposure to a particular investment sector trading strategy or group of correlated funds these risks may be managed through defined controls over conflict of interest restrictions on allocation of funds and set exposure limits for strategies many investment funds use leverage the practice of borrowing money trading on margin or using derivatives to obtain market exposure in excess of that provided by investors capital although leverage can increase potential returns the opportunity for larger gains is weighed against the possibility of greater losses hedge funds employing leverage are likely to engage in extensive risk management practices in comparison with investment banks hedge fund leverage is relatively low according to a national bureau of economic research working paper the average leverage for investment banks is  compared to between  and  for hedge funds some types of funds including hedge funds are perceived as having a greater appetite for risk with the intention of maximizing returns subject to the risk tolerance of investors and the fund manager managers will have an additional incentive to increase risk oversight when their own capital is invested in the fund notable failuresedit longterm capital management founded in  by john meriwether following backtoback financial crises in asia in  and russia in  the fund ended up losing  billion in less than four months the primary catalyst for the failure was russias default and a model that advised the fund to hold its position even as losses mounted tiger management run by julian robertson robertson founded the fund in  with  million and grew it to  billion by  making it the secondlargest hedge fund in the world at the time one year later assets under management reached  billion a series of bad investments greatly harmed tigers returns causing investors to redeem out of the fund atticus global founded by activist investor tim barakett in  with less than  million in hand and by  was one of the largest hedge funds in the world with  billion of assets under management barakett earned marketbeating returns over a long time period until the financial crisis in  after two years of losses barakett closed the fund in  atticus globals reported a compounded annual return of  compared to just  for the sp  fees and remunerationedit fees paid to hedge fundsedit hedge fund management firms typically charge their funds both a management fee and a performance fee management fees are calculated as a percentage of the funds net asset value and typically range from  to  per annum with  being standard they are usually expressed as an annual percentage but calculated and paid monthly or quarterly management fees for hedge funds are designed to cover the operating costs of the manager whereas the performance fee provides the managers profits however due to economies of scale the management fee from larger funds can generate a significant part of a managers profits and as a result some fees have been criticized by some public pension funds such as calpers for being too high the performance fee is typically  of the funds profits during any year though they range between  and  performance fees are intended to provide an incentive for a manager to generate profits performance fees have been criticized by warren buffett who believes that because hedge funds share only the profits and not the losses such fees create an incentive for highrisk investment management performance fee rates have fallen since the start of the credit crunch almost all hedge fund performance fees include a high water mark or loss carryforward provision which means that the performance fee only applies to net profits ie profits after losses in previous years have been recovered this prevents managers from receiving fees for volatile performance though a manager will sometimes close a fund that has suffered serious losses and start a new fund rather than attempting to recover the losses over a number of years without performance fee some performance fees include a hurdle so that a fee is only paid on the funds performance in excess of a benchmark rate eg libor or a fixed percentage a soft hurdle means the performance fee is calculated on all the funds returns if the hurdle rate is cleared a hard hurdle is calculated only on returns above the hurdle rate a hurdle is intended to ensure that a manager is only rewarded if the fund generates returns in excess of the returns that the investor would have received if they had invested their money elsewhere some hedge funds charge a redemption fee or withdrawal fee for early withdrawals during a specified period of time typically a year or when withdrawals exceed a predetermined percentage of the original investment the purpose of the fee is to discourage shortterm investing reduce turnover and deter withdrawals after periods of poor performance unlike management fees and performance fees redemption fees are usually kept by the fund remuneration of portfolio managersedit hedge fund management firms are usually owned by their portfolio managers who are therefore entitled to any profits that the business makes as management fees are intended to cover the firms operating costs performance fees and any excess management fees are generally distributed to the firms owners as profits funds do not tend to report compensation and so published lists of the amounts earned by top managers tend to be estimates based on factors such as the fees charged by their funds and the capital they are thought to have invested in them many managers have accumulated large stakes in their own funds and so top hedge fund managers can earn extraordinary amounts of money perhaps up to  billion in a good year earnings at the very top are higher than in any other sector of the financial industry  and collectively the top  hedge fund managers regularly earn more than all  of the chief executives in the sp  most hedge fund managers are remunerated much less however and if performance fees are not earned then small managers at least are unlikely to be paid significant amounts in  the top manager earned m the tenth earned m and the th earned m in  the average earnings for the  highest compensated hedge fund managers in the united states was  million while the mean total compensation for all hedge fund investment professionals was  and the median was  the same figures for hedge fund ceos were  and  and for chief investment officers were  and  respectively of the  people on the forbes worlds billionaires list for   of the financiers listed derived significant chunks of their wealth from hedge fund management among the richest  people in the united kingdom  were hedge fund managers according to the sunday times rich list for  structureedit a hedge fund is an investment vehicle that is most often structured as an offshore corporation limited partnership or limited liability company the fund is managed by an investment manager in the form of an organization or company that is legally and financially distinct from the hedge fund and its portfolio of assets many investment managers utilize service providers for operational support service providers include prime brokers banks administrators distributors and accounting firms prime brokers clear trades and provide leverage and shortterm financing they are usually divisions of large investment banks the prime broker acts as a counterparty to derivative contracts and lends securities for particular investment strategies such as longshort equities and convertible bond arbitrage it can provide custodial services for the funds assets and execution and clearing services for the hedge fund manager hedge fund administrators are responsible for operations accounting and valuation services this back office support allows fund managers to concentrate on trades administrators also process subscriptions and redemptions and perform various shareholder services hedge funds in the united states are not required to appoint an administrator and all of these functions can be performed by an investment manager a number of conflict of interest situations may arise in this arrangement particularly in the calculation of a funds net asset value nav some funds voluntarily employ external auditors thereby offering a greater degree of transparency a distributor is an underwriter broker dealer or other person who participates in the distribution of securities the distributor is also responsible for marketing the fund to potential investors many hedge funds do not have distributors and in such cases the investment manager will be responsible for distribution of securities and marketing though many funds also use placement agents and brokerdealers for distribution most funds use an independent accounting firm to audit the assets of the fund provide tax services and perform a complete audit of the funds financial statements the yearend audit is often performed in accordance with the standard accounting practices enforced within the country the fund it established or the international financial reporting standards ifrs the auditor may verify the funds nav and assets under management aum some auditors only provide nav lite services meaning that the valuation is based on prices received from the manager rather than independent assessment domicile and taxationedit the legal structure of a specific hedge fund in particular its domicile and the type of legal entity in use is usually determined by the tax expectations of the funds investors regulatory considerations will also play a role many hedge funds are established in offshore financial centers to avoid adverse tax consequences for its foreign and taxexempt investors offshore funds that invest in the us typically pay withholding taxes on certain types of investment income but not us capital gains tax however the funds investors are subject to tax in their own jurisdictions on any increase in the value of their investments this tax treatment promotes crossborder investments by limiting the potential for multiple jurisdictions to layer taxes on investors us taxexempt investors such as pension plans and endowments invest primarily in offshore hedge funds to preserve their tax exempt status and avoid unrelated business taxable income the investment manager usually based in a major financial center pays tax on its management fees per the tax laws of the state and country where it is located in  half of the existing hedge funds were registered offshore and half onshore the cayman islands was the leading location for offshore funds accounting for  of the total number of global hedge funds the us had  luxembourg  ireland  the british virgin islands  and bermuda had  basket optionsedit deutsche bank and barclays created special options accounts for hedge fund clients in the banks’ names and claimed to own the assets when in fact the hedge fund clients had full control of the assets and reaped the profits the hedge funds would then execute trades — many of them a few seconds in duration — but wait until just after a year had passed to exercise the options allowing them to report the profits at a lower longterm capital gains tax rate — alexandra stevenson july   new york times the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations chaired by carl levin resulted in a  report that found that from  and  hedge funds avoided billions of dollars in taxes by using basket options the internal revenue service began investigating renaissance technologies in  and levin criticized the irs for taking six years to investigate the company using basket options renaissance avoided more than  billion in taxes over more than a decade these banks and hedge funds involved in this case used dubious structured financial products in a giant game of let’s pretend costing the treasury billions and bypassing safeguards that protect the economy from excessive bank lending for stock speculation — carl levin  senate permanent subcommittee on investigations a dozen other hedge funds along with renaissance technologies used deutsche banks and barclays basket options renaissance argued that basket options were extremely important because they gave the hedge fund the ability to increase its returns by borrowing more and to protect against model and programming failures in july  the united states internal revenue claimed hedge funds used basket options to bypass taxes on shortterm trades these basket options will now be labeled as listed transactions that must be declared on tax returns and a failure to do would result in a penalty investment manager locationsedit in contrast to the funds themselves investment managers are primarily located onshore the united states remains the largest center of investment with usbased funds managing around  of global assets at the end of  as of april  there were approximately  investment advisers managing one or more private hedge funds registered with the securities and exchange commission new york city and the gold coast area of connecticut are the leading locations for us hedge fund managers london is europes leading center for hedge fund managers according to eurohedge data around  funds located in the uk managed some  of europeanbased hedge fund assets in  interest in hedge funds in asia has increased significantly since  especially in japan hong kong and singapore however the uk and the us remain the leading locations for management of asian hedge fund assets the legal entityedit hedge fund legal structures vary depending on location and the investors us hedge funds aimed at usbased taxable investors are generally structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies limited partnerships and other flowthrough taxation structures assure that investors in hedge funds are not subject to both entitylevel and personallevel taxation a hedge fund structured as a limited partnership must have a general partner the general partner may be an individual or a corporation the general partner serves as the manager of the limited partnership and has unlimited liability the limited partners serve as the funds investors and have no responsibility for management or investment decisions their liability is limited to the amount of money they invest for partnership interests as an alternative to a limited partnership arrangement us domestic hedge funds may be structured as limited liability companies with members acting as corporate shareholders and enjoying protection from individual liability by contrast offshore corporate funds are usually used for nonus investors and when they are domiciled in an applicable offshore tax haven no entitylevel tax is imposed many managers of offshore funds permit the participation of taxexempt us investors such as pensions funds institutional endowments and charitable trusts as an alternative legal structure offshore funds may be formed as an openended unit trust using an unincorporated mutual fund structure japanese investors prefer to invest in unit trusts such as those available in the cayman islands the investment manager who organizes the hedge fund may retain an interest in the fund either as the general partner of a limited partnership or as the holder of founder shares in a corporate fund for offshore funds structured as corporate entities the fund may appoint a board of directors the boards primary role is to provide a layer of oversight while representing the interests of the shareholders however in practice board members may lack sufficient expertise to be effective in performing those duties the board may include both affiliated directors who are employees of the fund and independent directors whose relationship to the fund is limited types of fundsedit openended hedge funds continue to issue shares to new investors and allow periodic withdrawals at the net asset value nav for each share closedended hedge funds issue a limited number of tradeable shares at inception shares of listed hedges funds are traded on stock exchanges such as the irish stock exchange and may be purchased by nonaccredited investors side pocketsedit a side pocket is a mechanism whereby a fund compartmentalizes assets that are relatively illiquid or difficult to value reliably when an investment is sidepocketed its value is calculated separately from the value of the fund’s main portfolio because side pockets are used to hold illiquid investments investors do not have the standard redemption rights with respect to the side pocket investment that they do with respect to the fund’s main portfolio profits or losses from the investment are allocated on a pro rata basis only to those who are investors at the time the investment is placed into the side pocket and are not shared with new investors funds typically carry side pocket assets at cost for purposes of calculating management fees and reporting net asset values this allows fund managers to avoid attempting a valuation of the underlying investments which may not always have a readily available market value side pockets were widely used by hedge funds during the  financial crisis amidst a flood of withdrawal requests side pockets allowed fund managers to lay away illiquid securities until market liquidity improved a move that could reduce losses however as the practice restricts investors ability to redeem their investments it is often unpopular and many have alleged that it has been abused or applied unfairly the sec also has expressed concern about aggressive use of side pockets and has sanctioned certain fund managers for inappropriate use of them regulationedit hedge funds must conform to the national federal and state regulatory laws in their respective locations the us regulations and restrictions that apply to hedge funds differ from its mutual funds mutual funds unlike hedge funds and other private funds are subject to the investment company act of  which is a highly detailed and extensive regulatory regime according to a report by the international organization of securities commissions the most common form of regulation pertains to restrictions on financial advisers and hedge fund managers in an effort to minimize client fraud on the other hand us hedge funds are exempt from many of the standard registration and reporting requirements because they only accept accredited investors in  regulations were enacted in the us and european union which introduced additional hedge fund reporting requirements these included the uss doddfrank wall street reform act and european alternative investment fund managers directive in  in an attempt for selfregulation  leading hedge fund managers developed a voluntary set of international standards in best practice and known as the hedge fund standards they were designed to create a … framework of transparency integrity and good governance in the hedge fund industry the hedge fund standards board was set up to prompt and maintain these standards going forward and by  it had approximately  hedge fund managers and institutional investors with a value of us tn investment endorsing the standards united statesedit hedge funds within the us are subject to regulatory reporting and record keeping requirements many hedge funds also fall under the jurisdiction of the commodity futures trading commission and are subject to rules and provisions of the  commodity exchange act which prohibits fraud and manipulation the securities act of  required companies to file a registration statement with the sec to comply with its private placement rules before offering their securities to the public the securities exchange act of  required a fund with more than  investors to register with the sec the investment advisers act of  contained antifraud provisions that regulated hedge fund managers and advisers created limits for the number and types of investors and prohibited public offerings the act also exempted hedge funds from mandatory registration with the us securities and exchange commission sec when selling to accredited investors with a minimum of us million in investment assets companies and institutional investors with at least us million in investment assets also qualified in december  the sec began requiring hedge fund advisers managing more than us million and with more than  investors to register with the sec under the investment advisers act the sec stated that it was adopting a riskbased approach to monitoring hedge funds as part of its evolving regulatory regimen for the burgeoning industry the new rule was controversial with two commissioners dissenting and was later challenged in court by a hedge fund manager in june  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia overturned the rule and sent it back to the agency to be reviewed in response to the court decision in  the sec adopted rule  which unlike the earlier challenged rule does not impose additional filing reporting or disclosure obligations but does potentially increase the risk of enforcement action for negligent or fraudulent activity hedge fund managers with at least us million in assets under management are required to file publicly quarterly reports disclosing ownership of registered equity securities and are subject to public disclosure if they own more than  of the class of any registered equity security registered advisers must report their business practices and disciplinary history to the sec and to their investors they are required to have written compliance policies a chief compliance officer and their records and practices may be examined by the sec the uss doddfrank wall street reform act was passed in july  and requires sec registration of advisers who manage private funds with more than us million in assets registered managers must file form adv with the sec as well as information regarding their assets under management and trading positions previously advisers with fewer than  clients were exempt although many hedge fund advisers voluntarily registered with the sec to satisfy institutional investors under doddfrank investment advisers with less than us million in assets under management became subject to state regulation this increased the number of hedge funds under state supervision overseas advisers who managed more than us million were also required to register with the sec the act requires hedge funds to provide information about their trades and portfolios to regulators including the newly created financial stability oversight council in this regard most hedge funds and other private funds including private equity funds must file form pf with the sec which is an extensive reporting form with substantial data on the funds activities and positions under the volcker rule regulators are also required to implement regulations for banks their affiliates and holding companies to limit their relationships with hedge funds and to prohibit these organizations from proprietary trading and to limit their investment in and sponsorship of hedge funds europeedit within the european union eu hedge funds are primarily regulated through their managers in the united kingdom where  of europes hedge funds are based hedge fund managers are required to be authorised and regulated by the financial conduct authority fca each country has their own specific restrictions on hedge fund activities including controls on use of derivatives in portugal and limits on leverage in france in the eu managers are subject to the eus directive on alternative investment fund managers aifmd according to the eu the aim of the directive is to provide greater monitoring and control of alternative investment funds aifmd requires all eu hedge fund managers to register with national regulatory authorities and to disclose more information on a more frequent basis it also directs hedge fund managers to hold larger amounts of capital aifmd also introduced a passport for hedge funds authorised in one eu country to operate throughout the eu the scope of aifmd is broad and encompasses managers located within the eu as well as noneu managers that market their funds to european investors an aspect of aifmd which challenges established practices in the hedge funds sector is the potential restriction of remuneration through bonus deferrals and clawback provisions otheredit some hedge funds are established in offshore centres such as the cayman islands dublin luxembourg the british virgin islands and bermuda which have different regulations concerning nonaccredited investors client confidentiality and fund manager independence in south africa investment fund managers must be approved by and register with the financial services board fsb performanceedit measurementedit performance statistics for individual hedge funds are difficult to obtain as the funds have historically not been required to report their performance to a central repository and restrictions against public offerings and advertisement have led many managers to refuse to provide performance information publicly however summaries of individual hedge fund performance are occasionally available in industry journals and databases and investment consultancy hennessee group one estimate is that the average hedge fund returned  per year representing a  return above overall market performance before fees based on performance data from  hedge funds another is that between january  and december  the hedge funds outperformed other investments were significantly less volatile with stocks falling  per year over the decade and hedge funds rising  more recent data show that hedge fund performance has declined and underperformed the market hedge funds performance is measured by comparing their returns to an estimate of their risk common measures are the sharpe ratio treynor measure and jensens alpha these measures work best when returns follow normal distributions without autocorrelation and these assumptions are often not met in practice new performance measures have been introduced that attempt to address some of theoretical concerns with traditional indicators including modified sharpe ratios the omega ratio introduced by keating and shadwick in  alternative investments risk adjusted performance airap published by sharma in  and kappa developed by kaplan and knowles in  sectorsize effectedit there is a debate over whether alpha the managers skill element in performance has been diluted by the expansion of the hedge fund industry two reasons are given first the increase in traded volume may have been reducing the market anomalies that are a source of hedge fund performance second the remuneration model is attracting more managers which may dilute the talent available in the industry hedge fund indicesedit indices that track hedge fund returns are in order of development called noninvestable investable and clone they play a central and unambiguous role in traditional asset markets where they are widely accepted as representative of their underlying portfolios equity and debt index fund products provide investable access to most developed markets in these asset classes hedge funds however are actively managed so that tracking is impossible noninvestable hedge fund indices on the other hand may be more or less representative but returns data on many of the reference group of funds is nonpublic this may result in biased estimates of their returns in an attempt to address this problem clone indices have been created in an attempt to replicate the statistical properties of hedge funds without being directly based on their returns data none of these approaches achieves the accuracy of indices in other asset classes for which there is more complete published data concerning the underlying returns noninvestable indicesedit noninvestable indices are indicative in nature and aim to represent the performance of some database of hedge funds using some measure such as mean median or weighted mean from a hedge fund database the databases have diverse selection criteria and methods of construction and no single database captures all funds this leads to significant differences in reported performance between different indices although they aim to be representative noninvestable indices suffer from a lengthy and largely unavoidable list of biases funds participation in a database is voluntary leading to selfselection bias because those funds that choose to report may not be typical of funds as a whole for example some do not report because of poor results or because they have already reached their target size and do not wish to raise further money the short lifetimes of many hedge funds means that there are many new entrants and many departures each year which raises the problem of survivorship bias if we examine only funds that have survived to the present we will overestimate past returns because many of the worstperforming funds have not survived and the observed association between fund youth and fund performance suggests that this bias may be substantial when a fund is added to a database for the first time all or part of its historical data is recorded expost in the database it is likely that funds only publish their results when they are favorable so that the average performances displayed by the funds during their incubation period are inflated this is known as instant history bias or backfill bias investable indicesedit investable indices are an attempt to reduce these problems by ensuring that the return of the index is available to shareholders to create an investable index the index provider selects funds and develops structured products or derivative instruments that deliver the performance of the index when investors buy these products the index provider makes the investments in the underlying funds making an investable index similar in some ways to a fund of hedge funds portfolio to make the index investable hedge funds must agree to accept investments on the terms given by the constructor to make the index liquid these terms must include provisions for redemptions that some managers may consider too onerous to be acceptable this means that investable indices do not represent the total universe of hedge funds most seriously they underrepresent more successful managers who typically refuse to accept such investment protocols hedge fund replicationedit the most recent addition to the field approach the problem in a different manner instead of reflecting the performance of actual hedge funds they take a statistical approach to the analysis of historic hedge fund returns and use this to construct a model of how hedge fund returns respond to the movements of various investable financial assets this model is then used to construct an investable portfolio of those assets this makes the index investable and in principle they can be as representative as the hedge fund database from which they were constructed however these clone indices rely on a statistical modelling process such indices have too short a history to state whether this approach will be considered successful closuresedit in march  hfr – a hedge fund research data and service provider – reported that there were more hedgefund closures in  than during the  recession according to the report several large public pension funds pulled their investments in hedge funds because the funds’ subpar performance as a group did not merit the high fees they charged despite the hedge fund industry topping  trillion for the first time ever in  the number of new hedge funds launched fell short of crisisera figures there were  hedge fund launches in  fewer than the  opened in  and dramatically less than the  launches in  debates and controversiesedit systemic riskedit systemic risk refers to the risk of instability across the entire financial system as opposed to within a single company such risk may arise following a destabilizing event or events affecting a group of financial institutions linked through investment activity organizations such as the national bureau of economic research and the european central bank have charged that hedge funds pose systemic risks to the financial sector and following the failure of hedge fund longterm capital management ltcm in  there was widespread concern about the potential for systemic risk if a hedge fund failure led to the failure of its counterparties as it happens no financial assistance was provided to ltcm by the us federal reserve so there was no direct cost to us taxpayers but a large bailout had to be mounted by a number of financial institutions however these claims are widely disputed by the financial industry who typically regard hedge funds as small enough to fail since most are relatively small in terms of the assets they manage and operate with low leverage thereby limiting the potential harm to the economic system should one of them fail formal analysis of hedge fund leverage before and during the  financial crisis suggests that hedge fund leverage is both fairly modest and countercyclical to the market leverage of investment banks and the larger financial sector hedge fund leverage decreased prior to the financial crisis even while the leverage of other financial intermediaries continued to increase hedge funds fail regularly and numerous hedge funds failed during the financial crisis in testimony to the house financial services committee in  ben bernanke the federal reserve board chairman said he would not think that any hedge fund or private equity fund would become a systemically critical firm individually nevertheless although hedge funds go to great lengths to reduce the ratio of risk to reward inevitably a number of risks remain systemic risk is increased in a crisis if there is herd behaviour which causes a number of similar hedge funds to make losses in similar trades in addition while most hedge funds make only modest use of leverage hedge funds differ from many other market participants such as banks and mutual funds in that there are no regulatory constraints on their use of leverage and some hedge funds seek large amounts of leverage as part of their market strategy the extensive use of leverage can lead to forced liquidations in a crisis particularly for hedge funds that invest at least in part in illiquid investments the close interconnectedness of the hedge funds with their prime brokers typically investment banks can lead to domino effects in a crisis and indeed failing counterparty banks can freeze hedge funds these systemic risk concerns are exacerbated by the prominent role of hedge funds in the financial markets the global hedge fund industry has over  trillion in assets and this does not take into account the full effect of leverage which by definition is market exposure in excess of the amount invested an august  survey by the financial services authority concluded that risks were limited and had reduced as a result inter alia of larger margins being required by counterparty banks but might change rapidly according to market conditions in stressed market conditions investors might suddenly withdraw large sums resulting in forced asset sales this might cause liquidity and pricing problems if it occurred across a number of funds or in one large highly leveraged fund transparencyedit hedge funds are structured to avoid most direct regulation although their managers may be regulated and are not required to publicly disclose their investment activities except to the extent that investors generally are subject to disclosure requirements this is in contrast to a regulated mutual fund or exchangetraded fund which will typically have to meet regulatory requirements for disclosure an investor in a hedge fund usually has direct access to the investment adviser of the fund and may enjoy more personalized reporting than investors in retail investment funds this may include detailed discussions of risks assumed and significant positions however this high level of disclosure is not available to noninvestors contributing to hedge funds reputation for secrecy while some hedge funds have very limited transparency even to investors funds may choose to report some information in the interest of recruiting additional investors much of the data available in consolidated databases is selfreported and unverified a study was done on two major databases containing hedge fund data the study noted that  common funds had significant differences in reported information eg returns inception date net assets value incentive fee management fee investment styles etc and that  of return numbers and  of nav numbers were dramatically different with these limitations investors have to do their own research which may cost on the scale of us for a fund that is not wellestablished a lack of verification of financial documents by investors or by independent auditors has in some cases assisted in fraud in the mids kirk wright of international management associates was accused of mail fraud and other securities violations which allegedly defrauded clients of close to us million in december  bernard madoff was arrested for running a us billion ponzi scheme that closely resembled a hedge fund and was incorrectly described as one several feeder hedge funds of which the largest was fairfield sentry channeled money to it following the madoff case the sec adopted reforms in december  that required hedge funds managed by registered investment advisers to have their assets in the custody of a qualified custodian and subjected them to an audit requirement the process of matching hedge funds to investors has traditionally been fairly opaque with investments often driven by personal connections or recommendations of portfolio managers many funds disclose their holdings strategy and historic performance relative to market indices giving investors some idea of how their money is being allocated although individual holdings are often not disclosed investors are often drawn to hedge funds by the possibility of realizing significant returns or hedging against volatility in the market the complexity and fees associated with hedge funds are causing some to exit the market – calpers the largest pension fund in the us announced plans to completely divest from hedge funds in  some services are attempting to improve matching between hedge funds and investors hedgez is designed to allow investors to easily search and sort through funds imatchative aims to match investors to funds through algorithms that factor in an investors goals and behavioral profile in hopes of helping funds and investors understand the how their perceptions and motivations drive investment decisions links with analystsedit in june  prompted by a letter from gary j aguirre the senate judiciary committee began an investigation into the links between hedge funds and independent analysts aguirre was fired from his job with the sec when as lead investigator of insider trading allegations against pequot capital management he tried to interview john mack then being considered for chief executive officer at morgan stanley the judiciary committee and the us senate finance committee issued a scathing report in  which found that aguirre had been illegally fired in reprisal for his pursuit of mack and in  the sec was forced to reopen its case against pequot pequot settled with the sec for us million and arthur j samberg chief investment officer of pequot was barred from working as an investment advisor pequot closed its doors under the pressure of investigations the systemic practice of hedge funds submitting periodic electronic questionnaires to stock analysts as a part of market research was reported in by the new york times in july  according to the report one motivation for the questionnaires was to obtain subjective information not available to the public and possible early notice of trading recommendations that could produce short term market movements value in meanvariance efficient portfoliosedit according to modern portfolio theory rational investors will seek to hold portfolios that are meanvariance efficient that is portfolios that offer the highest level of return per unit of risk one of the attractive features of hedge funds in particular market neutral and similar funds is that they sometimes have a modest correlation with traditional assets such as equities this means that hedge funds have a potentially quite valuable role in investment portfolios as diversifiers reducing overall portfolio risk however there are three reasons why one might not wish to allocate a high proportion of assets into hedge funds these reasons are hedge funds are highly individual and it is hard to estimate the likely returns or risks hedge funds low correlation with other assets tends to dissipate during stressful market events making them much less useful for diversification than they may appear hedge fund returns are reduced considerably by the high fee structures that are typically charged several studies have suggested that hedge funds are sufficiently diversifying to merit inclusion in investor portfolios but this is disputed for example by mark kritzman who performed a meanvariance optimization calculation on an opportunity set that consisted of a stock index fund a bond index fund and ten hypothetical hedge funds the optimizer found that a meanvariance efficient portfolio did not contain any allocation to hedge funds largely because of the impact of performance fees to demonstrate this kritzman repeated the optimization using an assumption that the hedge funds incurred no performance fees the result from this second optimization was an allocation of  to hedge funds the other factor reducing the attractiveness of hedge funds in a diversified portfolio is that they tend to perform poorly during equity bear markets just when an investor needs part of their portfolio to add value for example in january–september  the credit suissetremont hedge fund index was down  according to the same index series even dedicated short bias funds had a return of − during september  in other words even though low average correlations may appear to make hedge funds attractive this may not work in turbulent period for example around the collapse of lehman brothers in september  see alsoedit activist shareholder alternative asset board of directors corporate governance fund governance investment banking list of

corporate finance personal finance public finance banks and banking financial regulation fund governance v t e a hedge fund is an investment fund that pools capital from accredited individuals or institutional investors and invests in a variety of assets often with complex portfolioconstruction and riskmanagement techniques it is administered by a professional investment management firm and often structured as a limited partnership limited liability company or similar vehicle hedge funds are generally distinct from mutual funds as their use of leverage is not capped by regulators and distinct from private equity funds as the majority of hedge funds invest in relatively liquid assets the term hedge fund originated from the paired long and short positions that the first of these funds used to hedge market risk over time the types and nature of the hedging concepts expanded as did the different types of investment vehicles today hedge funds engage in a diverse range of markets and strategies and employ a wide variety of financial instruments and risk management techniques hedge funds are made available only to certain sophisticated or accredited investors and cannot be offered or sold to the general public as such they generally avoid direct regulatory oversight bypass licensing requirements applicable to investment companies and operate with greater flexibility than mutual funds and other investment funds however following the financial crisis of – regulations were passed in the united states and europe with intentions to increase government oversight of hedge funds and eliminate certain regulatory gaps hedge funds have existed for many decades and have become increasingly popular they have now grown to be a substantial fraction of asset management with assets now totaling around  trillion hedge funds are almost always openended and allow additions or withdrawals by their investors generally on a monthly or quarterly basis the value of an investors holding is directly related to the fund net asset value many hedge fund investment strategies aim to achieve a positive return on investment regardless of whether markets are rising or falling absolute return hedge fund managers often invest money of their own in the fund they manage a hedge fund typically pays its investment manager an annual management fee for example  of the assets of the fund and a performance fee for example  of the increase in the funds net asset value during the year both coinvestment and performance fees serve to align the interests of managers with

meaning a line of bushes around a field has long been used as a metaphor for the placing of limits on risk early hedge funds sought to hedge specific investments against general market fluctuations by shorting the market hence the name nowadays however many different investment strategies are used many of which do not hedge risk– historyedit during the us bull market of the s there were numerous private investment vehicles available to wealthy investors of that period the best known today is the grahamnewman partnership founded by benjamin graham and jerry newman this was cited by warren buffett in a  letter to the museum of american finance as an early hedge fund the sociologist alfred w jones is credited with coining the phrase hedged fund and is credited with creating the first hedge fund structure in  although this has been disputed jones referred to his fund as being hedged a term then commonly used on wall street to describe the management of investment risk due to changes in the financial markets in the s hedge funds specialized in a single strategy with most fund managers following the longshort equity model many hedge funds closed during the recession of – and the – stock market crash due to heavy losses they received renewed attention in the late s during the s the number of hedge funds increased significantly with the s stock market rise the

capital as the top twenty billionaire hedge fund managers bill ackman of pershing square capital management lp strategiesedit hedge fund strategies are generally classified among four major categories global macro directional eventdriven and relative value arbitrage strategies within these categories each entail characteristic risk and return profiles a fund may employ a single strategy or multiple strategies for flexibility risk management or diversification the hedge funds prospectus also known as an offering memorandum offers potential investors information about key aspects of the fund including the funds investment strategy investment type and leverage limit the elements contributing to a hedge fund strategy include the hedge funds approach to the market the particular instrument used the market sector the fund specializes in eg healthcare the method used to select investments and the amount of diversification within the fund there are a variety of market approaches to different asset classes including equity fixed income commodity and currency instruments used include equities fixed income futures options and swaps strategies can be divided into those in which investments can be selected by managers known as discretionaryqualitative or those in which investments are selected using a computerized system known as systematicquantitative the amount of diversification within the fund can vary funds may be multistrategy multifund multimarket multimanager or a combination sometimes hedge fund strategies are described as absolute return and are classified as either market neutral or directional market neutral funds have less correlation to overall market performance by neutralizing the effect of market swings whereas directional funds utilize trends and inconsistencies in the market and have greater exposure to the markets fluctuations global macroedit main article global macro hedge funds using a global macro investing strategy take sizable positions in share bond or currency markets in anticipation of global macroeconomic events in order to generate a riskadjusted return global macro fund managers use macroeconomic big picture analysis based on global market events and trends to identify opportunities for investment that would profit from anticipated price movements while global macro strategies have a large amount of flexibility due to their ability to use leverage to take large positions in diverse investments in multiple markets the timing of the implementation of the strategies is important in order to generate attractive riskadjusted returns global macro is often categorized as a directional investment strategy global macro strategies can be divided into discretionary and systematic approaches discretionary trading is carried out by investment managers who identify and select investments whereas systematic trading is based on mathematical models and executed by software with limited human involvement beyond the programming and updating of the software these strategies can also be divided into trend or countertrend approaches depending on whether the fund attempts to profit from following trends long or shortterm or attempts to anticipate and profit from reversals in trends within global macro strategies there are further substrategies including systematic diversified in which the fund trades in diversified markets or systematic currency in which the fund trades in currency markets other substrategies include those employed by commodity trading advisors ctas where the fund trades in futures or options in commodity markets or in swaps this is also known as a managed future fund ctas trade in commodities such as gold and financial instruments including stock indices they also take both long and short positions allowing them to make profit in both market upswings and downswings directionaledit directional investment strategies use market movements trends or inconsistencies when picking stocks across a variety of markets computer models can be used or fund managers will identify and select investments these types of strategies have a greater exposure to the fluctuations of the overall market than do market neutral strategies directional hedge fund strategies include us and international longshort equity hedge funds where long equity positions are hedged with short sales of equities or equity index options within directional strategies there are a number of substrategies emerging markets funds focus on emerging markets such as china and india whereas sector funds specialize in specific areas including technology healthcare biotechnology pharmaceuticals energy and basic materials funds using a fundamental growth strategy invest in companies with more earnings growth than the overall stock market or relevant sector while funds using a fundamental value strategy invest in undervalued companies funds that use quantitative and financial signal processing techniques for equity trading are described as using a quantitative directional strategy funds using a short bias strategy take advantage of declining equity prices using short positions eventdrivenedit main article eventdriven investing eventdriven strategies concern situations in which the underlying investment opportunity and risk are associated with an event an eventdriven investment strategy finds investment opportunities in corporate transactional events such as consolidations acquisitions recapitalizations bankruptcies and liquidations managers employing such a strategy capitalize on valuation inconsistencies in the market before or after such events and take a position based on the predicted movement of the security or securities in question large institutional investors such as hedge funds are more likely to pursue eventdriven investing strategies than traditional equity investors because they have the expertise and resources to analyze corporate transactional events for investment opportunities corporate transactional events generally fit into three categories distressed securities risk arbitrage and special situations distressed securities include such events as restructurings recapitalizations and bankruptcies a distressed securities investment strategy involves investing in the bonds or loans of companies facing bankruptcy or severe financial distress when these bonds or loans are being traded at a discount to their value hedge fund managers pursuing the distressed debt investment strategy aim to capitalize on depressed bond prices hedge funds purchasing distressed debt may prevent those companies from going bankrupt as such an acquisition deters foreclosure by banks while eventdriven investing in general tends to thrive during a bull market distressed investing works best during a bear market risk arbitrage or merger arbitrage includes such events as mergers acquisitions liquidations and hostile takeovers risk arbitrage typically involves buying and selling the stocks of two or more merging companies to take advantage of market discrepancies between acquisition price and stock price the risk element arises from the possibility that the merger or acquisition will not go ahead as planned hedge fund managers will use research and analysis to determine if the event will take place special situations are events that impact the value of a companys stock including the restructuring of a company or corporate transactions including spinoffs sharebuybacks security issuancerepurchase asset sales or other catalystoriented situations to take advantage of special situations the hedge fund manager must identify an upcoming event that will increase or decrease the value of the companys equity and equityrelated instruments other eventdriven strategies include credit arbitrage strategies which focus on corporate fixed income securities an activist strategy where the fund takes large positions in companies and uses the ownership to participate in the management a strategy based on predicting the final approval of new pharmaceutical drugs and legal catalyst strategy which specializes in companies involved in major lawsuits relative valueedit main article relative value economics relative value arbitrage strategies take advantage of relative discrepancies in price between securities the price discrepancy can occur due to mispricing of securities compared to related securities the underlying security or the market overall hedge fund managers can use various types of analysis to identify price discrepancies in securities including mathematical technical or fundamental techniques relative value is often used as a synonym for market neutral as strategies in this category typically have very little or no directional market exposure to the market as a whole other relative value substrategies include fixed income arbitrage exploit pricing inefficiencies between related fixed income securities equity market neutral exploits differences in stock prices by being long and short in stocks within the same sector industry market capitalization country which also creates a hedge against broader market factors convertible arbitrage exploit pricing inefficiencies between convertible securities and the corresponding stocks assetbacked securities fixedincome assetbacked fixed income arbitrage strategy using assetbacked securities credit long  short the same as long  short equity but in credit markets instead of equity markets statistical arbitrage identifying pricing inefficiencies between securities through mathematical modeling techniques volatility arbitrage exploit the change in implied volatility instead of the change in price yield alternatives nonfixed income arbitrage strategies based on the yield instead of the price regulatory arbitrage the practice of taking advantage of regulatory differences between two or more markets risk arbitrage exploiting market discrepancies between acquisition price and stock price miscellaneousedit in addition to those strategies within the four main categories there are several strategies that do not fit into these categorizations or can apply across several of them fund of hedge funds multimanager a hedge fund with a diversified portfolio of numerous underlying singlemanager hedge funds multistrategy a hedge fund using a combination of different strategies to reduce market risk minimum account fund the minimum amount to open a hedge fund account is say  million dollars with  nonholding or  million dollars with holding multimanager a hedge fund wherein the investment is spread along separate submanagers investing in their own strategy withdraw holding a hold is placed on all major withdrawals for  days prior and after hedge fund is created and established  funds equity funds with  long and  short positions leaving a net long position of  risk parity equalizing risk by allocating funds to a wide range of categories while maximizing gains through financial leveraging riskedit for an investor who already holds large quantities of equities and bonds investment in hedge funds may provide diversification and reduce the overall portfolio risk managers of hedge funds use particular trading strategies and instruments with the specific aim of reducing market risks to produce riskadjusted returns that are consistent with investors desired level of risk hedge funds ideally produce returns relatively uncorrelated with market indices while hedging can be a way of reducing the risk of an investment hedge funds like all other investment types are not immune to risk according to a report by the hennessee group hedge funds were approximately onethird less volatile than the sp  between  and  risk managementedit investors in hedge funds are in most countries required to be qualified investors who are assumed to be aware of the investment risks and accept these risks because of the potential returns relative to those risks fund managers may employ extensive risk management strategies in order to protect the fund and investors according to the financial times big hedge funds have some of the most sophisticated and exacting risk management practices anywhere in asset management hedge fund managers that hold a large number of investment positions for short durations are likely to have a particularly comprehensive risk management system in place and it has become usual for funds to have independent risk officers who assess and manage risks but are not otherwise involved in trading a variety of different measurement techniques and models are used to estimate risk according to the funds leverage liquidity and investment strategy nonnormality of returns volatility clustering and trends are not always accounted for by conventional risk measurement methodologies and so in addition to value at risk and similar measurements funds may use integrated measures such as drawdowns  in addition to assessing the marketrelated risks that may arise from an investment investors commonly employ operational due diligence to assess the risk that error or fraud at a hedge fund might result in loss to the investor considerations will include the organization and management of operations at the hedge fund manager whether the investment strategy is likely to be sustainable and the funds ability to develop as a company transparency and regulatory considerationsedit since hedge funds are private entities and have few public disclosure requirements this is sometimes perceived as a lack of transparency another common perception of hedge funds is that their managers are not subject to as much regulatory oversight andor registration requirements as other financial investment managers and more prone to managerspecific idiosyncratic risks such as style drifts faulty operations or fraud new regulations introduced in the us and the eu as of  require hedge fund managers to report more information leading to greater transparency in addition investors particularly institutional investors are encouraging further developments in hedge fund risk management both through internal practices and external regulatory requirements the increasing influence of institutional investors has led to greater transparency hedge funds increasingly provide information to investors including valuation methodology positions and leverage exposure risks shared with other investment typesedit hedge funds share many of the same types of risk as other investment classes including liquidity risk and manager risk liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset can be bought and sold or converted to cash similar to private equity funds hedge funds employ a lockup period during which an investor cannot remove money manager risk refers to those risks which arise from the management of funds as well as specific risks such as style drift which refers to a fund manager drifting away from an area of specific expertise manager risk factors include valuation risk capacity risk concentration risk and leverage risk valuation risk refers to the concern that the net asset value of investments may be inaccurate capacity risk can arise from placing too much money into one particular strategy which may lead to fund performance deterioration and concentration risk may arise if a fund has too much exposure to a particular investment sector trading strategy or group of correlated funds these risks may be managed through defined controls over conflict of interest restrictions on allocation of funds and set exposure limits for strategies many investment funds use leverage the practice of borrowing money trading on margin or using derivatives to obtain market exposure in excess of that provided by investors capital although leverage can increase potential returns the opportunity for larger gains is weighed against the possibility of greater losses hedge funds employing leverage are likely to engage in extensive risk management practices in comparison with investment banks hedge fund leverage is relatively low according to a national bureau of economic research working paper the average leverage for investment banks is  compared to between  and  for hedge funds some types of funds including hedge funds are perceived as having a greater appetite for risk with the intention of maximizing returns subject to the risk tolerance of investors and the fund manager managers will have an additional incentive to increase risk oversight when their own capital is invested in the fund notable failuresedit longterm capital management founded in  by john meriwether following backtoback financial crises in asia in  and russia in  the fund ended up losing  billion in less than four months the primary catalyst for the failure was russias default and a model that advised the fund to hold its position even as losses mounted tiger management run by julian robertson robertson founded the fund in  with  million and grew it to  billion by  making it the secondlargest hedge fund in the world at the time one year later assets under management reached  billion a series of bad investments greatly harmed tigers returns causing investors to redeem out of the fund atticus global founded by activist investor tim barakett in  with less than  million in hand and by  was one of the largest hedge funds in the world with  billion of assets under management barakett earned marketbeating returns over a long time period until the financial crisis in  after two years of losses barakett closed the fund in  atticus globals reported a compounded annual return of  compared to just  for the sp  fees and remunerationedit fees paid to hedge fundsedit hedge fund management firms typically charge their funds both a management fee and a performance fee management fees are calculated as a percentage of the funds net asset value and typically range from  to  per annum with  being standard they are usually expressed as an annual percentage but calculated and paid monthly or quarterly management fees for hedge funds are designed to cover the operating costs of the manager whereas the performance fee provides the managers profits however due to economies of scale the management fee from larger funds can generate a significant part of a managers profits and as a result some fees have been criticized by some public pension funds such as calpers for being too high the performance fee is typically  of the funds profits during any year though they range between  and  performance fees are intended to provide an incentive for a manager to generate profits performance fees have been criticized by warren buffett who believes that because hedge funds share only the profits and not the losses such fees create an incentive for highrisk investment management performance fee rates have fallen since the start of the credit crunch almost all hedge fund performance fees include a high water mark or loss carryforward provision which means that the performance fee only applies to net profits ie profits after losses in previous years have been recovered this prevents managers from receiving fees for volatile performance though a manager will sometimes close a fund that has suffered serious losses and start a new fund rather than attempting to recover the losses over a number of years without performance fee some performance fees include a hurdle so that a fee is only paid on the funds performance in excess of a benchmark rate eg libor or a fixed percentage a soft hurdle means the performance fee is calculated on all the funds returns if the hurdle rate is cleared a hard hurdle is calculated only on returns above the hurdle rate a hurdle is intended to ensure that a manager is only rewarded if the fund generates returns in excess of the returns that the investor would have received if they had invested their money elsewhere some hedge funds charge a redemption fee or withdrawal fee for early withdrawals during a specified period of time typically a year or when withdrawals exceed a predetermined percentage of the original investment the purpose of the fee is to discourage shortterm investing reduce turnover and deter withdrawals after periods of poor performance unlike management fees and performance fees redemption fees are usually kept by the fund remuneration of portfolio managersedit hedge fund management firms are usually owned by their portfolio managers who are therefore entitled to any profits that the business makes as management fees are intended to cover the firms operating costs performance fees and any excess management fees are generally distributed to the firms owners as profits funds do not tend to report compensation and so published lists of the amounts earned by top managers tend to be estimates based on factors such as the fees charged by their funds and the capital they are thought to have invested in them many managers have accumulated large stakes in their own funds and so top hedge fund managers can earn extraordinary amounts of money perhaps up to  billion in a good year earnings at the very top are higher than in any other sector of the financial industry  and collectively the top  hedge fund managers regularly earn more than all  of the chief executives in the sp  most hedge fund managers are remunerated much less however and if performance fees are not earned then small managers at least are unlikely to be paid significant amounts in  the top manager earned m the tenth earned m and the th earned m in  the average earnings for the  highest compensated hedge fund managers in the united states was  million while the mean total compensation for all hedge fund investment professionals was  and the median was  the same figures for hedge fund ceos were  and  and for chief investment officers were  and  respectively of the  people on the forbes worlds billionaires list for   of the financiers listed derived significant chunks of their wealth from hedge fund management among the richest  people in the united kingdom  were hedge fund managers according to the sunday times rich list for  structureedit a hedge fund is an investment vehicle that is most often structured as an offshore corporation limited partnership or limited liability company the fund is managed by an investment manager in the form of an organization or company that is legally and financially distinct from the hedge fund and its portfolio of assets many investment managers utilize service providers for operational support service providers include prime brokers banks administrators distributors and accounting firms prime brokers clear trades and provide leverage and shortterm financing they are usually divisions of large investment banks the prime broker acts as a counterparty to derivative contracts and lends securities for particular investment strategies such as longshort equities and convertible bond arbitrage it can provide custodial services for the funds assets and execution and clearing services for the hedge fund manager hedge fund administrators are responsible for operations accounting and valuation services this back office support allows fund managers to concentrate on trades administrators also process subscriptions and redemptions and perform various shareholder services hedge funds in the united states are not required to appoint an administrator and all of these functions can be performed by an investment manager a number of conflict of interest situations may arise in this arrangement particularly in the calculation of a funds net asset value nav some funds voluntarily employ external auditors thereby offering a greater degree of transparency a distributor is an underwriter broker dealer or other person who participates in the distribution of securities the distributor is also responsible for marketing the fund to potential investors many hedge funds do not have distributors and in such cases the investment manager will be responsible for distribution of securities and marketing though many funds also use placement agents and brokerdealers for distribution most funds use an independent accounting firm to audit the assets of the fund provide tax services and perform a complete audit of the funds financial statements the yearend audit is often performed in accordance with the standard accounting practices enforced within the country the fund it established or the international financial reporting standards ifrs the auditor may verify the funds nav and assets under management aum some auditors only provide nav lite services meaning that the valuation is based on prices received from the manager rather than independent assessment domicile and taxationedit the legal structure of a specific hedge fund in particular its domicile and the type of legal entity in use is usually determined by the tax expectations of the funds investors regulatory considerations will also play a role many hedge funds are established in offshore financial centers to avoid adverse tax consequences for its foreign and taxexempt investors offshore funds that invest in the us typically pay withholding taxes on certain types of investment income but not us capital gains tax however the funds investors are subject to tax in their own jurisdictions on any increase in the value of their investments this tax treatment promotes crossborder investments by limiting the potential for multiple jurisdictions to layer taxes on investors us taxexempt investors such as pension plans and endowments invest primarily in offshore hedge funds to preserve their tax exempt status and avoid unrelated business taxable income the investment manager usually based in a major financial center pays tax on its management fees per the tax laws of the state and country where it is located in  half of the existing hedge funds were registered offshore and half onshore the cayman islands was the leading location for offshore funds accounting for  of the total number of global hedge funds the us had  luxembourg  ireland  the british virgin islands  and bermuda had  basket optionsedit deutsche bank and barclays created special options accounts for hedge fund clients in the banks’ names and claimed to own the assets when in fact the hedge fund clients had full control of the assets and reaped the profits the hedge funds would then execute trades — many of them a few seconds in duration — but wait until just after a year had passed to exercise the options allowing them to report the profits at a lower longterm capital gains tax rate — alexandra stevenson july   new york times the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations chaired by carl levin resulted in a  report that found that from  and  hedge funds avoided billions of dollars in taxes by using basket options the internal revenue service began investigating renaissance technologies in  and levin criticized the irs for taking six years to investigate the company using basket options renaissance avoided more than  billion in taxes over more than a decade these banks and hedge funds involved in this case used dubious structured financial products in a giant game of let’s pretend costing the treasury billions and bypassing safeguards that protect the economy from excessive bank lending for stock speculation — carl levin  senate permanent subcommittee on investigations a dozen other hedge funds along with renaissance technologies used deutsche banks and barclays basket options renaissance argued that basket options were extremely important because they gave the hedge fund the ability to increase its returns by borrowing more and to protect against model and programming failures in july  the united states internal revenue claimed hedge funds used basket options to bypass taxes on shortterm trades these basket options will now be labeled as listed transactions that must be declared on tax returns and a failure to do would result in a penalty investment manager locationsedit in contrast to the funds themselves investment managers are primarily located onshore the united states remains the largest center of investment with usbased funds managing around  of global assets at the end of  as of april  there were approximately  investment advisers managing one or more private hedge funds registered with the securities and exchange commission new york city and the gold coast area of connecticut are the leading locations for us hedge fund managers london is europes leading center for hedge fund managers according to eurohedge data around  funds located in the uk managed some  of europeanbased hedge fund assets in  interest in hedge funds in asia has increased significantly since  especially in japan hong kong and singapore however the uk and the us remain the leading locations for management of asian hedge fund assets the legal entityedit hedge fund legal structures vary depending on location and the investors us hedge funds aimed at usbased taxable investors are generally structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies limited partnerships and other flowthrough taxation structures assure that investors in hedge funds are not subject to both entitylevel and personallevel taxation a hedge fund structured as a limited partnership must have a general partner the general partner may be an individual or a corporation the general partner serves as the manager of the limited partnership and has unlimited liability the limited partners serve as the funds investors and have no responsibility for management or investment decisions their liability is limited to the amount of money they invest for partnership interests as an alternative to a limited partnership arrangement us domestic hedge funds may be structured as limited liability companies with members acting as corporate shareholders and enjoying protection from individual liability by contrast offshore corporate funds are usually used for nonus investors and when they are domiciled in an applicable offshore tax haven no entitylevel tax is imposed many managers of offshore funds permit the participation of taxexempt us investors such as pensions funds institutional endowments and charitable trusts as an alternative legal structure offshore funds may be formed as an openended unit trust using an unincorporated mutual fund structure japanese investors prefer to invest in unit trusts such as those available in the cayman islands the investment manager who organizes the hedge fund may retain an interest in the fund either as the general partner of a limited partnership or as the holder of founder shares in a corporate fund for offshore funds structured as corporate entities the fund may appoint a board of directors the boards primary role is to provide a layer of oversight while representing the interests of the shareholders however in practice board members may lack sufficient expertise to be effective in performing those duties the board may include both affiliated directors who are employees of the fund and independent directors whose relationship to the fund is limited types of fundsedit openended hedge funds continue to issue shares to new investors and allow periodic withdrawals at the net asset value nav for each share closedended hedge funds issue a limited number of tradeable shares at inception shares of listed hedges funds are traded on stock exchanges such as the irish stock exchange and may be purchased by nonaccredited investors side pocketsedit a side pocket is a mechanism whereby a fund compartmentalizes assets that are relatively illiquid or difficult to value reliably when an investment is sidepocketed its value is calculated separately from the value of the fund’s main portfolio because side pockets are used to hold illiquid investments investors do not have the standard redemption rights with respect to the side pocket investment that they do with respect to the fund’s main portfolio profits or losses from the investment are allocated on a pro rata basis only to those who are investors at the time the investment is placed into the side pocket and are not shared with new investors funds typically carry side pocket assets at cost for purposes of calculating management fees and reporting net asset values this allows fund managers to avoid attempting a valuation of the underlying investments which may not always have a readily available market value side pockets were widely used by hedge funds during the  financial crisis amidst a flood of withdrawal requests side pockets allowed fund managers to lay away illiquid securities until market liquidity improved a move that could reduce losses however as the practice restricts investors ability to redeem their investments it is often unpopular and many have alleged that it has been abused or applied unfairly the sec also has expressed concern about aggressive use of side pockets and has sanctioned certain fund managers for inappropriate use of them regulationedit hedge funds must conform to the national federal and state regulatory laws in their respective locations the us regulations and restrictions that apply to hedge funds differ from its mutual funds mutual funds unlike hedge funds and other private funds are subject to the investment company act of  which is a highly detailed and extensive regulatory regime according to a report by the international organization of securities commissions the most common form of regulation pertains to restrictions on financial advisers and hedge fund managers in an effort to minimize client fraud on the other hand us hedge funds are exempt from many of the standard registration and reporting requirements because they only accept accredited investors in  regulations were enacted in the us and european union which introduced additional hedge fund reporting requirements these included the uss doddfrank wall street reform act and european alternative investment fund managers directive in  in an attempt for selfregulation  leading hedge fund managers developed a voluntary set of international standards in best practice and known as the hedge fund standards they were designed to create a … framework of transparency integrity and good governance in the hedge fund industry the hedge fund standards board was set up to prompt and maintain these standards going forward and by  it had approximately  hedge fund managers and institutional investors with a value of us tn investment endorsing the standards united statesedit hedge funds within the us are subject to regulatory reporting and record keeping requirements many hedge funds also fall under the jurisdiction of the commodity futures trading commission and are subject to rules and provisions of the  commodity exchange act which prohibits fraud and manipulation the securities act of  required companies to file a registration statement with the sec to comply with its private placement rules before offering their securities to the public the securities exchange act of  required a fund with more than  investors to register with the sec the investment advisers act of  contained antifraud provisions that regulated hedge fund managers and advisers created limits for the number and types of investors and prohibited public offerings the act also exempted hedge funds from mandatory registration with the us securities and exchange commission sec when selling to accredited investors with a minimum of us million in investment assets companies and institutional investors with at least us million in investment assets also qualified in december  the sec began requiring hedge fund advisers managing more than us million and with more than  investors to register with the sec under the investment advisers act the sec stated that it was adopting a riskbased approach to monitoring hedge funds as part of its evolving regulatory regimen for the burgeoning industry the new rule was controversial with two commissioners dissenting and was later challenged in court by a hedge fund manager in june  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia overturned the rule and sent it back to the agency to be reviewed in response to the court decision in  the sec adopted rule  which unlike the earlier challenged rule does not impose additional filing reporting or disclosure obligations but does potentially increase the risk of enforcement action for negligent or fraudulent activity hedge fund managers with at least us million in assets under management are required to file publicly quarterly reports disclosing ownership of registered equity securities and are subject to public disclosure if they own more than  of the class of any registered equity security registered advisers must report their business practices and disciplinary history to the sec and to their investors they are required to have written compliance policies a chief compliance officer and their records and practices may be examined by the sec the uss doddfrank wall street reform act was passed in july  and requires sec registration of advisers who manage private funds with more than us million in assets registered managers must file form adv with the sec as well as information regarding their assets under management and trading positions previously advisers with fewer than  clients were exempt although many hedge fund advisers voluntarily registered with the sec to satisfy institutional investors under doddfrank investment advisers with less than us million in assets under management became subject to state regulation this increased the number of hedge funds under state supervision overseas advisers who managed more than us million were also required to register with the sec the act requires hedge funds to provide information about their trades and portfolios to regulators including the newly created financial stability oversight council in this regard most hedge funds and other private funds including private equity funds must file form pf with the sec which is an extensive reporting form with substantial data on the funds activities and positions under the volcker rule regulators are also required to implement regulations for banks their affiliates and holding companies to limit their relationships with hedge funds and to prohibit these organizations from proprietary trading and to limit their investment in and sponsorship of hedge funds europeedit within the european union eu hedge funds are primarily regulated through their managers in the united kingdom where  of europes hedge funds are based hedge fund managers are required to be authorised and regulated by the financial conduct authority fca each country has their own specific restrictions on hedge fund activities including controls on use of derivatives in portugal and limits on leverage in france in the eu managers are subject to the eus directive on alternative investment fund managers aifmd according to the eu the aim of the directive is to provide greater monitoring and control of alternative investment funds aifmd requires all eu hedge fund managers to register with national regulatory authorities and to disclose more information on a more frequent basis it also directs hedge fund managers to hold larger amounts of capital aifmd also introduced a passport for hedge funds authorised in one eu country to operate throughout the eu the scope of aifmd is broad and encompasses managers located within the eu as well as noneu managers that market their funds to european investors an aspect of aifmd which challenges established practices in the hedge funds sector is the potential restriction of remuneration through bonus deferrals and clawback provisions otheredit some hedge funds are established in offshore centres such as the cayman islands dublin luxembourg the british virgin islands and bermuda which have different regulations concerning nonaccredited investors client confidentiality and fund manager independence in south africa investment fund managers must be approved by and register with the financial services board fsb performanceedit measurementedit performance statistics for individual hedge funds are difficult to obtain as the funds have historically not been required to report their performance to a central repository and restrictions against public offerings and advertisement have led many managers to refuse to provide performance information publicly however summaries of individual hedge fund performance are occasionally available in industry journals and databases and investment consultancy hennessee group one estimate is that the average hedge fund returned  per year representing a  return above overall market performance before fees based on performance data from  hedge funds another is that between january  and december  the hedge funds outperformed other investments were significantly less volatile with stocks falling  per year over the decade and hedge funds rising  more recent data show that hedge fund performance has declined and underperformed the market hedge funds performance is measured by comparing their returns to an estimate of their risk common measures are the sharpe ratio treynor measure and jensens alpha these measures work best when returns follow normal distributions without autocorrelation and these assumptions are often not met in practice new performance measures have been introduced that attempt to address some of theoretical concerns with traditional indicators including modified sharpe ratios the omega ratio introduced by keating and shadwick in  alternative investments risk adjusted performance airap published by sharma in  and kappa developed by kaplan and knowles in  sectorsize effectedit there is a debate over whether alpha the managers skill element in performance has been diluted by the expansion of the hedge fund industry two reasons are given first the increase in traded volume may have been reducing the market anomalies that are a source of hedge fund performance second the remuneration model is attracting more managers which may dilute the talent available in the industry hedge fund indicesedit indices that track hedge fund returns are in order of development called noninvestable investable and clone they play a central and unambiguous role in traditional asset markets where they are widely accepted as representative of their underlying portfolios equity and debt index fund products provide investable access to most developed markets in these asset classes hedge funds however are actively managed so that tracking is impossible noninvestable hedge fund indices on the other hand may be more or less representative but returns data on many of the reference group of funds is nonpublic this may result in biased estimates of their returns in an attempt to address this problem clone indices have been created in an attempt to replicate the statistical properties of hedge funds without being directly based on their returns data none of these approaches achieves the accuracy of indices in other asset classes for which there is more complete published data concerning the underlying returns noninvestable indicesedit noninvestable indices are indicative in nature and aim to represent the performance of some database of hedge funds using some measure such as mean median or weighted mean from a hedge fund database the databases have diverse selection criteria and methods of construction and no single database captures all funds this leads to significant differences in reported performance between different indices although they aim to be representative noninvestable indices suffer from a lengthy and largely unavoidable list of biases funds participation in a database is voluntary leading to selfselection bias because those funds that choose to report may not be typical of funds as a whole for example some do not report because of poor results or because they have already reached their target size and do not wish to raise further money the short lifetimes of many hedge funds means that there are many new entrants and many departures each year which raises the problem of survivorship bias if we examine only funds that have survived to the present we will overestimate past returns because many of the worstperforming funds have not survived and the observed association between fund youth and fund performance suggests that this bias may be substantial when a fund is added to a database for the first time all or part of its historical data is recorded expost in the database it is likely that funds only publish their results when they are favorable so that the average performances displayed by the funds during their incubation period are inflated this is known as instant history bias or backfill bias investable indicesedit investable indices are an attempt to reduce these problems by ensuring that the return of the index is available to shareholders to create an investable index the index provider selects funds and develops structured products or derivative instruments that deliver the performance of the index when investors buy these products the index provider makes the investments in the underlying funds making an investable index similar in some ways to a fund of hedge funds portfolio to make the index investable hedge funds must agree to accept investments on the terms given by the constructor to make the index liquid these terms must include provisions for redemptions that some managers may consider too onerous to be acceptable this means that investable indices do not represent the total universe of hedge funds most seriously they underrepresent more successful managers who typically refuse to accept such investment protocols hedge fund replicationedit the most recent addition to the field approach the problem in a different manner instead of reflecting the performance of actual hedge funds they take a statistical approach to the analysis of historic hedge fund returns and use this to construct a model of how hedge fund returns respond to the movements of various investable financial assets this model is then used to construct an investable portfolio of those assets this makes the index investable and in principle they can be as representative as the hedge fund database from which they were constructed however these clone indices rely on a statistical modelling process such indices have too short a history to state whether this approach will be considered successful closuresedit in march  hfr – a hedge fund research data and service provider – reported that there were more hedgefund closures in  than during the  recession according to the report several large public pension funds pulled their investments in hedge funds because the funds’ subpar performance as a group did not merit the high fees they charged despite the hedge fund industry topping  trillion for the first time ever in  the number of new hedge funds launched fell short of crisisera figures there were  hedge fund launches in  fewer than the  opened in  and dramatically less than the  launches in  debates and controversiesedit systemic riskedit systemic risk refers to the risk of instability across the entire financial system as opposed to within a single company such risk may arise following a destabilizing event or events affecting a group of financial institutions linked through investment activity organizations such as the national bureau of economic research and the european central bank have charged that hedge funds pose systemic risks to the financial sector and following the failure of hedge fund longterm capital management ltcm in  there was widespread concern about the potential for systemic risk if a hedge fund failure led to the failure of its counterparties as it happens no financial assistance was provided to ltcm by the us federal reserve so there was no direct cost to us taxpayers but a large bailout had to be mounted by a number of financial institutions however these claims are widely disputed by the financial industry who typically regard hedge funds as small enough to fail since most are relatively small in terms of the assets they manage and operate with low leverage thereby limiting the potential harm to the economic system should one of them fail formal analysis of hedge fund leverage before and during the  financial crisis suggests that hedge fund leverage is both fairly modest and countercyclical to the market leverage of investment banks and the larger financial sector hedge fund leverage decreased prior to the financial crisis even while the leverage of other financial intermediaries continued to increase hedge funds fail regularly and numerous hedge funds failed during the financial crisis in testimony to the house financial services committee in  ben bernanke the federal reserve board chairman said he would not think that any hedge fund or private equity fund would become a systemically critical firm individually nevertheless although hedge funds go to great lengths to reduce the ratio of risk to reward inevitably a number of risks remain systemic risk is increased in a crisis if there is herd behaviour which causes a number of similar hedge funds to make losses in similar trades in addition while most hedge funds make only modest use of leverage hedge funds differ from many other market participants such as banks and mutual funds in that there are no regulatory constraints on their use of leverage and some hedge funds seek large amounts of leverage as part of their market strategy the extensive use of leverage can lead to forced liquidations in a crisis particularly for hedge funds that invest at least in part in illiquid investments the close interconnectedness of the hedge funds with their prime brokers typically investment banks can lead to domino effects in a crisis and indeed failing counterparty banks can freeze hedge funds these systemic risk concerns are exacerbated by the prominent role of hedge funds in the financial markets the global hedge fund industry has over  trillion in assets and this does not take into account the full effect of leverage which by definition is market exposure in excess of the amount invested an august  survey by the financial services authority concluded that risks were limited and had reduced as a result inter alia of larger margins being required by counterparty banks but might change rapidly according to market conditions in stressed market conditions investors might suddenly withdraw large sums resulting in forced asset sales this might cause liquidity and pricing problems if it occurred across a number of funds or in one large highly leveraged fund transparencyedit hedge funds are structured to avoid most direct regulation although their managers may be regulated and are not required to publicly disclose their investment activities except to the extent that investors generally are subject to disclosure requirements this is in contrast to a regulated mutual fund or exchangetraded fund which will typically have to meet regulatory requirements for disclosure an investor in a hedge fund usually has direct access to the investment adviser of the fund and may enjoy more personalized reporting than investors in retail investment funds this may include detailed discussions of risks assumed and significant positions however this high level of disclosure is not available to noninvestors contributing to hedge funds reputation for secrecy while some hedge funds have very limited transparency even to investors funds may choose to report some information in the interest of recruiting additional investors much of the data available in consolidated databases is selfreported and unverified a study was done on two major databases containing hedge fund data the study noted that  common funds had significant differences in reported information eg returns inception date net assets value incentive fee management fee investment styles etc and that  of return numbers and  of nav numbers were dramatically different with these limitations investors have to do their own research which may cost on the scale of us for a fund that is not wellestablished a lack of verification of financial documents by investors or by independent auditors has in some cases assisted in fraud in the mids kirk wright of international management associates was accused of mail fraud and other securities violations which allegedly defrauded clients of close to us million in december  bernard madoff was arrested for running a us billion ponzi scheme that closely resembled a hedge fund and was incorrectly described as one several feeder hedge funds of which the largest was fairfield sentry channeled money to it following the madoff case the sec adopted reforms in december  that required hedge funds managed by registered investment advisers to have their assets in the custody of a qualified custodian and subjected them to an audit requirement the process of matching hedge funds to investors has traditionally been fairly opaque with investments often driven by personal connections or recommendations of portfolio managers many funds disclose their holdings strategy and historic performance relative to market indices giving investors some idea of how their money is being allocated although individual holdings are often not disclosed investors are often drawn to hedge funds by the possibility of realizing significant returns or hedging against volatility in the market the complexity and fees associated with hedge funds are causing some to exit the market – calpers the largest pension fund in the us announced plans to completely divest from hedge funds in  some services are attempting to improve matching between hedge funds and investors hedgez is designed to allow investors to easily search and sort through funds imatchative aims to match investors to funds through algorithms that factor in an investors goals and behavioral profile in hopes of helping funds and investors understand the how their perceptions and motivations drive investment decisions links with analystsedit in june  prompted by a letter from gary j aguirre the senate judiciary committee began an investigation into the links between hedge funds and independent analysts aguirre was fired from his job with the sec when as lead investigator of insider trading allegations against pequot capital management he tried to interview john mack then being considered for chief executive officer at morgan stanley the judiciary committee and the us senate finance committee issued a scathing report in  which found that aguirre had been illegally fired in reprisal for his pursuit of mack and in  the sec was forced to reopen its case against pequot pequot settled with the sec for us million and arthur j samberg chief investment officer of pequot was barred from working as an investment advisor pequot closed its doors under the pressure of investigations the systemic practice of hedge funds submitting periodic electronic questionnaires to stock analysts as a part of market research was reported in by the new york times in july  according to the report one motivation for the questionnaires was to obtain subjective information not available to the public and possible early notice of trading recommendations that could produce short term market movements value in meanvariance efficient portfoliosedit according to modern portfolio theory rational investors will seek to hold portfolios that are meanvariance efficient that is portfolios that offer the highest level of return per unit of risk one of the attractive features of hedge funds in particular market neutral and similar funds is that they sometimes have a modest correlation with traditional assets such as equities this means that hedge funds have a potentially quite valuable role in investment portfolios as diversifiers reducing overall portfolio risk however there are three reasons why one might not wish to allocate a high proportion of assets into hedge funds these reasons are hedge funds are highly individual and it is hard to estimate the likely returns or risks hedge funds low correlation with other assets tends to dissipate during stressful market events making them much less useful for diversification than they may appear hedge fund returns are reduced considerably by the high fee structures that are typically charged several studies have suggested that hedge funds are sufficiently diversifying to merit inclusion in investor portfolios but this is disputed for example by mark kritzman who performed a meanvariance optimization calculation on an opportunity set that consisted of a stock index fund a bond index fund and ten hypothetical hedge funds the optimizer found that a meanvariance efficient portfolio did not contain any allocation to hedge funds largely because of the impact of performance fees to demonstrate this kritzman repeated the optimization using an assumption that the hedge funds incurred no performance fees the result from this second optimization was an allocation of  to hedge funds the other factor reducing the attractiveness of hedge funds in a diversified portfolio is that they tend to perform poorly during equity bear markets just when an investor needs part of their portfolio to add value for example in january–september  the credit suissetremont hedge fund index was down  according to the same index series even dedicated short bias funds had a return of − during september  in other words even though low average correlations may appear to make hedge funds attractive this may not work in turbulent period for example around the collapse of lehman brothers in september  see alsoedit activist shareholder alternative asset board of directors corporate governance fund governance investment banking list of

corporate finance personal finance public finance banks and banking financial regulation fund governance v t e a hedge fund is an investment fund that pools capital from accredited individuals or institutional investors and invests in a variety of assets often with complex portfolioconstruction and riskmanagement techniques it is administered by a professional investment management firm and often structured as a limited partnership limited liability company or similar vehicle hedge funds are generally distinct from mutual funds as their use of leverage is not capped by regulators and distinct from private equity funds as the majority of hedge funds invest in relatively liquid assets the term hedge fund originated from the paired long and short positions that the first of these funds used to hedge market risk over time the types and nature of the hedging concepts expanded as did the different types of investment vehicles today hedge funds engage in a diverse range of markets and strategies and employ a wide variety of financial instruments and risk management techniques hedge funds are made available only to certain sophisticated or accredited investors and cannot be offered or sold to the general public as such they generally avoid direct regulatory oversight bypass licensing requirements applicable to investment companies and operate with greater flexibility than mutual funds and other investment funds however following the financial crisis of – regulations were passed in the united states and europe with intentions to increase government oversight of hedge funds and eliminate certain regulatory gaps hedge funds have existed for many decades and have become increasingly popular they have now grown to be a substantial fraction of asset management with assets now totaling around  trillion hedge funds are almost always openended and allow additions or withdrawals by their investors generally on a monthly or quarterly basis the value of an investors holding is directly related to the fund net asset value many hedge fund investment strategies aim to achieve a positive return on investment regardless of whether markets are rising or falling absolute return hedge fund managers often invest money of their own in the fund they manage a hedge fund typically pays its investment manager an annual management fee for example  of the assets of the fund and a performance fee for example  of the increase in the funds net asset value during the year both coinvestment and performance fees serve to align the interests of managers with those of the investors in the fund some hedge funds have several billion dollars of assets under management aum contents  introduction  history  notable hedge fund managers  strategies  global macro

meaning a line of bushes around a field has long been used as a metaphor for the placing of limits on risk early hedge funds sought to hedge specific investments against general market fluctuations by shorting the market hence the name nowadays however many different investment strategies are used many of which do not hedge risk– historyedit during the us bull market of the s there were numerous private investment vehicles available to wealthy investors of that period the best known today is the grahamnewman partnership founded by benjamin graham and jerry newman this was cited by warren buffett in a  letter to the museum of american finance as an early hedge fund the sociologist alfred w jones is credited with coining the phrase hedged fund and is credited with creating the first hedge fund structure in  although this has been disputed jones referred to his fund as being hedged a term then commonly used on wall street to describe the management of investment risk due to changes in the financial markets in the s hedge funds specialized in a single strategy with most fund managers following the longshort equity model many hedge funds closed during the recession of – and the – stock market crash due to heavy losses they received renewed attention in the late s during the s the number of hedge funds increased significantly with the s stock market rise the

global macro directional eventdriven and relative value arbitrage strategies within these categories each entail characteristic risk and return profiles a fund may employ a single strategy or multiple strategies for flexibility risk management or diversification the hedge funds prospectus also known as an offering memorandum offers potential investors information about key aspects of the fund including the funds investment strategy investment type and leverage limit the elements contributing to a hedge fund strategy include the hedge funds approach to the market the particular instrument used the market sector the fund specializes in eg healthcare the method used to select investments and the amount of diversification within the fund there are a variety of market approaches to different asset classes including equity fixed income commodity and currency instruments used include equities fixed income futures options and swaps strategies can be divided into those in which investments can be selected by managers known as discretionaryqualitative or those in which investments are selected using a computerized system known as systematicquantitative the amount of diversification within the fund can vary funds may be multistrategy multifund multimarket multimanager or a combination sometimes hedge fund strategies are described as absolute return and are classified as either market neutral or directional market neutral funds have less correlation to overall market performance by neutralizing the effect of market swings whereas directional funds utilize trends and inconsistencies in the market and have greater exposure to the markets fluctuations global macroedit main article global macro hedge funds using a global macro investing strategy take sizable positions in share bond or currency markets in anticipation of global macroeconomic events in order to generate a riskadjusted return global macro fund managers use macroeconomic big picture analysis based on global market events and trends to identify opportunities for investment that would profit from anticipated price movements while global macro strategies have a large amount of flexibility due to their ability to use leverage to take large positions in diverse investments in multiple markets the timing of the implementation of the strategies is important in order to generate attractive riskadjusted returns global macro is often categorized as a directional investment strategy global macro strategies can be divided into discretionary and systematic approaches discretionary trading is carried out by investment managers who identify and select investments whereas systematic trading is based on mathematical models and executed by software with limited human involvement beyond the programming and updating of the software these strategies can also be divided into trend or countertrend approaches depending on whether the fund attempts to profit from following trends long or shortterm or attempts to anticipate and profit from reversals in trends within global macro strategies there are further substrategies including systematic diversified in which the fund trades in diversified markets or systematic currency in which the fund trades in currency markets other substrategies include those employed by commodity trading advisors ctas where the fund trades in futures or options in commodity markets or in swaps this is also known as a managed future fund ctas trade in commodities such as gold and financial instruments including stock indices they also take both long and short positions allowing them to make profit in both market upswings and downswings directionaledit directional investment strategies use market movements trends or inconsistencies when picking stocks across a variety of markets computer models can be used or fund managers will identify and select investments these types of strategies have a greater exposure to the fluctuations of the overall market than do market neutral strategies directional hedge fund strategies include us and international longshort equity hedge funds where long equity positions are hedged with short sales of equities or equity index options within directional strategies there are a number of substrategies emerging markets funds focus on emerging markets such as china and india whereas sector funds specialize in specific areas including technology healthcare biotechnology pharmaceuticals energy and basic materials funds using a fundamental growth strategy invest in companies with more earnings growth than the overall stock market or relevant sector while funds using a fundamental value strategy invest in undervalued companies funds that use quantitative and financial signal processing techniques for equity trading are described as using a quantitative directional strategy funds using a short bias strategy take advantage of declining equity prices using short positions eventdrivenedit main article eventdriven investing eventdriven strategies concern situations in which the underlying investment opportunity and risk are associated with an event an eventdriven investment strategy finds investment opportunities in corporate transactional events such as consolidations acquisitions recapitalizations bankruptcies and liquidations managers employing such a strategy capitalize on valuation inconsistencies in the market before or after such events and take a position based on the predicted movement of the security or securities in question large institutional investors such as hedge funds are more likely to pursue eventdriven investing strategies than traditional equity investors because they have the expertise and resources to analyze corporate transactional events for investment opportunities corporate transactional events generally fit into three categories distressed securities risk arbitrage and special situations distressed securities include such events as restructurings recapitalizations and bankruptcies a distressed securities investment strategy involves investing in the bonds or loans of companies facing bankruptcy or severe financial distress when these bonds or loans are being traded at a discount to their value hedge fund managers pursuing the distressed debt investment strategy aim to capitalize on depressed bond prices hedge funds purchasing distressed debt may prevent those companies from going bankrupt as such an acquisition deters foreclosure by banks while eventdriven investing in general tends to thrive during a bull market distressed investing works best during a bear market risk arbitrage or merger arbitrage includes such events as mergers acquisitions liquidations and hostile takeovers risk arbitrage typically involves buying and selling the stocks of two or more merging companies to take advantage of market discrepancies between acquisition price and stock price the risk element arises from the possibility that the merger or acquisition will not go ahead as planned hedge fund managers will use research and analysis to determine if the event will take place special situations are events that impact the value of a companys stock including the restructuring of a company or corporate transactions including spinoffs sharebuybacks security issuancerepurchase asset sales or other catalystoriented situations to take advantage of special situations the hedge fund manager must identify an upcoming event that will increase or decrease the value of the companys equity and equityrelated instruments other eventdriven strategies include credit arbitrage strategies which focus on corporate fixed income securities an activist strategy where the fund takes large positions in companies and uses the ownership to participate in the management a strategy based on predicting the final approval of new pharmaceutical drugs and legal catalyst strategy which specializes in companies involved in major lawsuits relative valueedit main article relative value economics relative value arbitrage strategies take advantage of relative discrepancies in price between securities the price discrepancy can occur due to mispricing of securities compared to related securities the underlying security or the market overall hedge fund managers can use various types of analysis to identify price discrepancies in securities including mathematical technical or fundamental techniques relative value is often used as a synonym for market neutral as strategies in this category typically have very little or no directional market exposure to the market as a whole other relative value substrategies include fixed income arbitrage exploit pricing inefficiencies between related fixed income securities equity market neutral exploits differences in stock prices by being long and short in stocks within the same sector industry market capitalization country which also creates a hedge against broader market factors convertible arbitrage exploit pricing inefficiencies between convertible securities and the corresponding stocks assetbacked securities fixedincome assetbacked fixed income arbitrage strategy using assetbacked securities credit long  short the same as long  short equity but in credit markets instead of equity markets statistical arbitrage identifying pricing inefficiencies between securities through mathematical modeling techniques volatility arbitrage exploit the change in implied volatility instead of the change in price yield alternatives nonfixed income arbitrage strategies based on the yield instead of the price regulatory arbitrage the practice of taking advantage of regulatory differences between two or more markets risk arbitrage exploiting market discrepancies between acquisition price and stock price miscellaneousedit in addition to those strategies within the four main categories there are several strategies that do not fit into these categorizations or can apply across several of them fund of hedge funds multimanager a hedge fund with a diversified portfolio of numerous underlying singlemanager hedge funds multistrategy a hedge fund using a combination of different strategies to reduce market risk minimum account fund the minimum amount to open a hedge fund account is say  million dollars with  nonholding or  million dollars with holding multimanager a hedge fund wherein the investment is spread along separate submanagers investing in their own strategy withdraw holding a hold is placed on all major withdrawals for  days prior and after hedge fund is created and established  funds equity funds with  long and  short positions leaving a net long position of  risk parity equalizing risk by allocating funds to a wide range of categories while maximizing gains through financial leveraging riskedit for an investor who already holds large quantities of equities and bonds investment in hedge funds may provide diversification and reduce the overall portfolio risk managers of hedge funds use particular trading strategies and instruments with the specific aim of reducing market risks to produce riskadjusted returns that are consistent with investors desired level of risk hedge funds ideally produce returns relatively uncorrelated with market indices while hedging can be a way of reducing the risk of an investment hedge funds like all other investment types are not immune to risk according to a report by the hennessee group hedge funds were approximately onethird less volatile than the sp  between  and  risk managementedit investors in hedge funds are in most countries required to be qualified investors who are assumed to be aware of the investment risks and accept these risks because of the potential returns relative to those risks fund managers may employ extensive risk management strategies in order to protect the fund and investors according to the financial times big hedge funds have some of the most sophisticated and exacting risk management practices anywhere in asset management hedge fund managers that hold a large number of investment positions for short durations are likely to have a particularly comprehensive risk management system in place and it has become usual for funds to have independent risk officers who assess and manage risks but are not otherwise involved in trading a variety of different measurement techniques and models are used to estimate risk according to the funds leverage liquidity and investment strategy nonnormality of returns volatility clustering and trends are not always accounted for by conventional risk measurement methodologies and so in addition to value at risk and similar measurements funds may use integrated measures such as drawdowns  in addition to assessing the marketrelated risks that may arise from an investment investors commonly employ operational due diligence to assess the risk that error or fraud at a hedge fund might result in loss to the investor considerations will include the organization and management of operations at the hedge fund manager whether the investment strategy is likely to be sustainable and the funds ability to develop as a company transparency and regulatory considerationsedit since hedge funds are private entities and have few public disclosure requirements this is sometimes perceived as a lack of transparency another common perception of hedge funds is that their managers are not subject to as much regulatory oversight andor registration requirements as other financial investment managers and more prone to managerspecific idiosyncratic risks such as style drifts faulty operations or fraud new regulations introduced in the us and the eu as of  require hedge fund managers to report more information leading to greater transparency in addition investors particularly institutional investors are encouraging further developments in hedge fund risk management both through internal practices and external regulatory requirements the increasing influence of institutional investors has led to greater transparency hedge funds increasingly provide information to investors including valuation methodology positions and leverage exposure risks shared with other investment typesedit hedge funds share many of the same types of risk as other investment classes including liquidity risk and manager risk liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset can be bought and sold or converted to cash similar to private equity funds hedge funds employ a lockup period during which an investor cannot remove money manager risk refers to those risks which arise from the management of funds as well as specific risks such as style drift which refers to a fund manager drifting away from an area of specific expertise manager risk factors include valuation risk capacity risk concentration risk and leverage risk valuation risk refers to the concern that the net asset value of investments may be inaccurate capacity risk can arise from placing too much money into one particular strategy which may lead to fund performance deterioration and concentration risk may arise if a fund has too much exposure to a particular investment sector trading strategy or group of correlated funds these risks may be managed through defined controls over conflict of interest restrictions on allocation of funds and set exposure limits for strategies many investment funds use leverage the practice of borrowing money trading on margin or using derivatives to obtain market exposure in excess of that provided by investors capital although leverage can increase potential returns the opportunity for larger gains is weighed against the possibility of greater losses hedge funds employing leverage are likely to engage in extensive risk management practices in comparison with investment banks hedge fund leverage is relatively low according to a national bureau of economic research working paper the average leverage for investment banks is  compared to between  and  for hedge funds some types of funds including hedge funds are perceived as having a greater appetite for risk with the intention of maximizing returns subject to the risk tolerance of investors and the fund manager managers will have an additional incentive to increase risk oversight when their own capital is invested in the fund notable failuresedit longterm capital management founded in  by john meriwether following backtoback financial crises in asia in  and russia in  the fund ended up losing  billion in less than four months the primary catalyst for the failure was russias default and a model that advised the fund to hold its position even as losses mounted tiger management run by julian robertson robertson founded the fund in  with  million and grew it to  billion by  making it the secondlargest hedge fund in the world at the time one year later assets under management reached  billion a series of bad investments greatly harmed tigers returns causing investors to redeem out of the fund atticus global founded by activist investor tim barakett in  with less than  million in hand and by  was one of the largest hedge funds in the world with  billion of assets under management barakett earned marketbeating returns over a long time period until the financial crisis in  after two years of losses barakett closed the fund in  atticus globals reported a compounded annual return of  compared to just  for the sp  fees and remunerationedit fees paid to hedge fundsedit hedge fund management firms typically charge their funds both a management fee and a performance fee management fees are calculated as a percentage of the funds net asset value and typically range from  to  per annum with  being standard they are usually expressed as an annual percentage but calculated and paid monthly or quarterly management fees for hedge funds are designed to cover the operating costs of the manager whereas the performance fee provides the managers profits however due to economies of scale the management fee from larger funds can generate a significant part of a managers profits and as a result some fees have been criticized by some public pension funds such as calpers for being too high the performance fee is typically  of the funds profits during any year though they range between  and  performance fees are intended to provide an incentive for a manager to generate profits performance fees have been criticized by warren buffett who believes that because hedge funds share only the profits and not the losses such fees create an incentive for highrisk investment management performance fee rates have fallen since the start of the credit crunch almost all hedge fund performance fees include a high water mark or loss carryforward provision which means that the performance fee only applies to net profits ie profits after losses in previous years have been recovered this prevents managers from receiving fees for volatile performance though a manager will sometimes close a fund that has suffered serious losses and start a new fund rather than attempting to recover the losses over a number of years without performance fee some performance fees include a hurdle so that a fee is only paid on the funds performance in excess of a benchmark rate eg libor or a fixed percentage a soft hurdle means the performance fee is calculated on all the funds returns if the hurdle rate is cleared a hard hurdle is calculated only on returns above the hurdle rate a hurdle is intended to ensure that a manager is only rewarded if the fund generates returns in excess of the returns that the investor would have received if they had invested their money elsewhere some hedge funds charge a redemption fee or withdrawal fee for early withdrawals during a specified period of time typically a year or when withdrawals exceed a predetermined percentage of the original investment the purpose of the fee is to discourage shortterm investing reduce turnover and deter withdrawals after periods of poor performance unlike management fees and performance fees redemption fees are usually kept by the fund remuneration of portfolio managersedit hedge fund management firms are usually owned by their portfolio managers who are therefore entitled to any profits that the business makes as management fees are intended to cover the firms operating costs performance fees and any excess management fees are generally distributed to the firms owners as profits funds do not tend to report compensation and so published lists of the amounts earned by top managers tend to be estimates based on factors such as the fees charged by their funds and the capital they are thought to have invested in them many managers have accumulated large stakes in their own funds and so top hedge fund managers can earn extraordinary amounts of money perhaps up to  billion in a good year earnings at the very top are higher than in any other sector of the financial industry  and collectively the top  hedge fund managers regularly earn more than all  of the chief executives in the sp  most hedge fund managers are remunerated much less however and if performance fees are not earned then small managers at least are unlikely to be paid significant amounts in  the top manager earned m

according to the sunday times rich list for  structureedit a hedge fund is an investment vehicle that is most often structured as an offshore corporation limited partnership or limited liability company the fund is managed by an investment manager in the form of an organization or company that is legally and financially distinct from the hedge fund and its portfolio of assets many investment managers utilize service providers for operational support service providers include prime brokers banks administrators distributors and accounting firms prime brokers clear trades and provide leverage and shortterm financing they are usually divisions of large investment banks the prime broker acts as a counterparty to derivative contracts and lends securities for particular investment strategies such as longshort equities and convertible bond arbitrage it can provide custodial services for the funds assets and execution and clearing services for the hedge fund manager hedge fund administrators are responsible for operations accounting and valuation services this back office support allows fund managers to concentrate on trades administrators also process subscriptions and redemptions and perform various shareholder services hedge funds in the united states are not required to appoint an administrator and all of these functions can be performed by an investment manager a number of conflict of interest situations may arise in this arrangement particularly in the calculation of a funds net asset value nav some funds voluntarily employ external auditors thereby offering a greater degree of transparency a distributor is an underwriter broker dealer or other person who participates in the distribution of securities the distributor is also responsible for marketing the fund to potential investors many hedge funds do not have distributors and in such cases the investment manager will be responsible for distribution of securities and marketing though many funds also use placement agents and brokerdealers for distribution most funds use an independent accounting firm to audit the assets of the fund provide tax services and perform a complete audit of the funds financial statements the yearend audit is often performed in accordance with the standard accounting practices enforced within the country the fund it established or the international financial reporting standards ifrs the auditor may verify the funds nav and assets under management aum some auditors only provide nav lite services meaning that the valuation is based on prices received from the manager rather than independent assessment domicile and taxationedit the legal structure of a specific hedge fund in particular its domicile and the type of legal entity in use is usually determined by the tax expectations of the funds investors regulatory considerations will also play a role many hedge funds are established in offshore financial centers to avoid adverse tax consequences for its foreign and taxexempt investors offshore funds that invest in the us typically pay withholding taxes on certain types of investment income but not us capital gains tax however the funds investors are subject to tax in their own jurisdictions on any increase in the value of their investments this tax treatment promotes crossborder investments by limiting the potential for multiple jurisdictions to layer taxes on investors us taxexempt investors such as pension plans and endowments invest primarily in offshore hedge funds to preserve their tax exempt status and avoid unrelated business taxable income the investment manager usually based in a major financial center pays tax on its management fees per the tax laws of the state and country where it is located in  half of the existing hedge funds were registered offshore and half onshore the cayman islands was the leading location for offshore funds accounting for  of the total number of global hedge funds the us had  luxembourg  ireland  the british virgin islands  and bermuda had  basket optionsedit deutsche bank and barclays created special options accounts for hedge fund clients in the banks’ names and claimed to own the assets when in fact the hedge fund clients had full control of the assets and reaped the profits the hedge funds would then execute trades — many of them a few seconds in duration — but wait until just after a year had passed to exercise the options allowing them to report the profits at a lower longterm capital gains tax rate — alexandra stevenson july   new york times the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations chaired by carl levin resulted in a  report that found that from  and  hedge funds avoided billions of dollars in taxes by using basket options the internal revenue service began investigating renaissance technologies in  and levin criticized the irs for taking six years to investigate the company using basket options renaissance avoided more than  billion in taxes over more than a decade these banks and hedge funds involved in this case used dubious structured financial products in a giant game of let’s pretend costing the treasury billions and bypassing safeguards that protect the economy from excessive bank lending for stock speculation — carl levin  senate permanent subcommittee on investigations a dozen other hedge funds along with renaissance technologies used deutsche banks and barclays basket options renaissance argued that basket options were extremely important because they gave the hedge fund the ability to increase its returns by borrowing more and to protect against model and programming failures in july  the united states internal revenue claimed hedge funds used basket options to bypass taxes on shortterm trades these basket options will now be labeled as listed transactions that must be declared on tax returns and a failure to do would result in a penalty investment manager locationsedit in contrast to the funds themselves investment managers are primarily located onshore the united states remains the largest center of investment with usbased funds managing around  of global assets at the end of  as of april  there were approximately  investment advisers managing one or more private hedge funds registered with the securities and exchange commission new york city and the gold coast area of connecticut are the leading locations for us hedge fund managers london is europes leading center for hedge fund managers according to eurohedge data around  funds located in the uk managed some  of europeanbased hedge fund assets in  interest in hedge funds in asia has increased significantly since  especially in japan hong kong and singapore however the uk and the us remain the leading locations for management of asian hedge fund assets the legal entityedit hedge fund legal structures vary depending on location and the investors us hedge funds aimed at usbased taxable investors are generally structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies limited partnerships and other flowthrough taxation structures assure that investors in hedge funds are not subject to both entitylevel and personallevel taxation a hedge fund structured as a limited partnership must have a general partner the general partner may be an individual or a corporation the general partner serves as the manager of the limited partnership and has unlimited liability the limited partners serve as the funds investors and have no responsibility for management or investment decisions their liability is limited to the amount of money they invest for partnership interests as an alternative to a limited partnership arrangement us domestic hedge funds may be structured as limited liability companies with members acting as corporate shareholders and enjoying protection from individual liability by contrast offshore corporate funds are usually used for nonus investors and when they are domiciled in an applicable offshore tax haven no entitylevel tax is imposed many managers of offshore funds permit the participation of taxexempt us investors such as pensions funds institutional endowments and charitable trusts as an alternative legal structure offshore funds may be formed as an openended unit trust using an unincorporated mutual fund structure japanese investors prefer to invest in unit trusts such as those available in the cayman islands the investment manager who organizes the hedge fund may retain an interest in the fund either as the general partner of a limited partnership or as the holder of founder shares in a corporate fund for offshore funds structured as corporate entities the fund may appoint a board of directors the boards primary role is to provide a layer of oversight while representing the interests of the shareholders however in practice board members may lack sufficient expertise to be effective in performing those duties the board may include both affiliated directors who are employees of the fund and independent directors whose relationship to the fund is limited types of fundsedit openended hedge funds continue to issue shares to new investors and allow periodic withdrawals at the net asset value nav for each share closedended hedge funds issue a limited number of tradeable shares at inception shares of listed hedges funds are traded on stock exchanges such as the irish stock exchange and may be purchased by nonaccredited investors side pocketsedit a side pocket is a mechanism whereby a fund compartmentalizes assets that are relatively illiquid or difficult to value reliably when an investment is sidepocketed its value is calculated separately from the value of the fund’s main portfolio because side pockets are used to hold illiquid investments investors do not have the standard redemption rights with respect to the side pocket investment that they do with respect to the fund’s main portfolio profits or losses from the investment are allocated on a pro rata basis only to those who are investors at the time the investment is placed into the side pocket and are not shared with new investors funds typically carry side pocket assets at cost for purposes of calculating management fees and reporting net asset values this allows fund managers to avoid attempting a valuation of the underlying investments which may not always have a readily available market value side pockets were widely used by hedge funds during the  financial crisis amidst a flood of withdrawal requests side pockets allowed fund managers to lay away illiquid securities until market liquidity improved a move that could reduce losses however as the practice restricts investors ability to redeem their investments it is often unpopular and many have alleged that it has been abused or applied unfairly the sec also has expressed concern about aggressive use of side pockets and has sanctioned certain fund managers for inappropriate use of them regulationedit hedge funds must conform to the national federal and state regulatory laws in their respective locations the us regulations and restrictions that apply to hedge funds differ from its mutual funds mutual funds unlike hedge funds and other private funds are subject to the investment company act of  which is a highly detailed and extensive regulatory regime according to a report by the international organization of securities commissions the most common form of regulation pertains to restrictions on financial advisers and hedge fund managers in an effort to minimize client fraud on the other hand us hedge funds are exempt from many of the standard registration and reporting requirements because they only accept accredited investors in  regulations were enacted in the us and european union which introduced additional hedge fund reporting requirements these included the uss doddfrank wall street reform act and european alternative investment fund managers directive in  in an attempt for selfregulation  leading hedge fund managers developed a voluntary set of international standards in best practice and known as the hedge fund standards they were designed to create a … framework of transparency integrity and good governance in the hedge fund industry the hedge fund standards board was set up to prompt and maintain these standards going forward and by  it had approximately  hedge fund managers and institutional investors with a value of us tn investment endorsing the standards united statesedit hedge funds within the us are subject to regulatory reporting and record keeping requirements many hedge funds also fall under the jurisdiction of the commodity futures trading commission and are subject to rules and provisions of the  commodity exchange act which prohibits fraud and manipulation the securities act of  required companies to file a registration statement with the sec to comply with its private placement rules before offering their securities to the public the securities exchange act of  required a fund with more than  investors to register with the sec the investment advisers act of  contained antifraud provisions that regulated hedge fund managers and advisers created limits for the number and types of investors and prohibited public offerings the act also exempted hedge funds from mandatory registration with the us securities and exchange commission sec when selling to accredited investors with a minimum of us million in investment assets companies and institutional investors with at least us million in investment assets also qualified in december  the sec began requiring hedge fund advisers managing more than us million and with more than  investors to register with the sec under the investment advisers act the sec stated that it was adopting a riskbased approach to monitoring hedge funds as part of its evolving regulatory regimen for the burgeoning industry the new rule was controversial with two commissioners dissenting and was later challenged in court by a hedge fund manager in june  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia overturned the rule and sent it back to the agency to be reviewed in response to the court decision in  the sec adopted rule  which unlike the earlier challenged rule does not impose additional filing reporting or disclosure obligations but does potentially increase the risk of enforcement action for negligent or fraudulent activity hedge fund managers with at least us million in assets under management are required to file publicly quarterly reports disclosing ownership of registered equity securities and are subject to public disclosure if they own more than  of the class of any registered equity security registered advisers must report their business practices and disciplinary history to the sec and to their investors they are required to have written compliance policies a chief compliance officer and their records and practices may be examined by the sec the uss doddfrank wall street reform act was passed in july  and requires sec registration of advisers who manage private funds with more than us million in assets registered managers must file form adv with the sec as well as information regarding their assets under management and trading positions previously advisers with fewer than  clients were exempt although many hedge fund advisers voluntarily registered with the sec to satisfy institutional investors under doddfrank investment advisers with less than us million in assets under management became subject to state regulation this increased the number of hedge funds under state supervision overseas advisers who managed more than us million were also required to register with the sec the act requires hedge funds to provide information about their trades and portfolios to regulators including the newly created financial stability oversight council in this regard most hedge funds and other private funds including private equity funds must file form pf with the sec which is an extensive reporting form with substantial data on the funds activities and positions under the volcker rule regulators are also required to implement regulations for banks their affiliates and holding companies to limit their relationships with hedge funds and to prohibit these organizations from proprietary trading and to limit their investment in and sponsorship of hedge funds europeedit within the european union eu hedge funds are primarily regulated through their managers in the united kingdom where  of europes hedge funds are based hedge fund managers are required to be authorised and regulated by the financial conduct authority fca each country has their own specific restrictions on hedge fund activities including controls on use of derivatives in portugal and limits on leverage in france in the eu managers are subject to the eus directive on alternative investment fund managers aifmd according to the eu the aim of the directive is to provide greater monitoring and control of alternative investment funds aifmd requires all eu hedge fund managers to register with national regulatory authorities and to disclose more information on a more frequent basis it also directs hedge fund managers to hold larger amounts of capital aifmd also introduced a passport for hedge funds authorised in one eu country to operate throughout the eu the scope of aifmd is broad and encompasses managers located within the eu as well as noneu managers that market their funds to european investors an aspect of aifmd which challenges established practices in the hedge funds sector is the potential restriction of remuneration through bonus deferrals and clawback provisions otheredit some hedge funds are established in offshore centres such as the cayman islands dublin luxembourg the british virgin islands and bermuda which have different regulations concerning nonaccredited investors client confidentiality and fund manager independence in south africa investment fund managers must be approved by and register with the financial services board fsb performanceedit measurementedit performance statistics for individual hedge funds are difficult to obtain as the funds have historically not been required to report their performance to a central repository and restrictions against public offerings and advertisement have led many managers to refuse to provide performance information publicly however summaries of individual hedge fund performance are occasionally available in industry journals and databases and investment consultancy hennessee group one estimate is that the average hedge fund returned  per year representing a  return above overall market performance before fees based on performance data from  hedge funds another is that between january  and december  the hedge funds outperformed other investments were significantly less volatile with stocks falling  per year over the decade and hedge funds rising  more recent data show that hedge fund performance has declined and underperformed the market hedge funds performance is measured by comparing their returns to an estimate of their risk common measures are the sharpe ratio treynor measure and jensens alpha these measures work best when returns follow normal distributions without autocorrelation and these assumptions are often not met in practice new performance measures have been introduced that attempt to address some of theoretical concerns with traditional indicators including modified sharpe ratios the omega ratio introduced by keating and shadwick in  alternative investments risk adjusted performance airap published by sharma in  and kappa developed by kaplan and knowles in  sectorsize effectedit there is a debate over whether alpha the managers skill element in performance has been diluted by the expansion of the hedge fund industry two reasons are given first the increase in traded volume may have been reducing the market anomalies that are a source of hedge fund performance second the remuneration model is attracting more managers which may dilute the talent available in the industry hedge fund indicesedit indices that track hedge fund returns are in order of development called noninvestable investable and clone they play a central and unambiguous role in traditional asset markets where they are widely accepted as representative of their underlying portfolios equity and debt index fund products provide investable access to most developed markets in these asset classes hedge funds however are actively managed so that tracking is impossible noninvestable hedge fund indices on the other hand may be more or less representative but returns data on many of the reference group of funds is nonpublic this may result in biased estimates of their returns in an attempt to address this problem clone indices have been created in an attempt to replicate the statistical properties of hedge funds without being directly based on their returns data none of these approaches achieves the accuracy of indices in other asset classes for which there is more complete published data concerning the underlying returns noninvestable indicesedit noninvestable indices are indicative in nature and aim to represent the performance of some database of hedge funds using some measure such as mean median or weighted mean from a hedge fund database the databases have diverse selection criteria and methods of construction and no single database captures all funds this leads to significant differences in reported performance between different indices although they aim to be representative noninvestable indices suffer from a lengthy and largely unavoidable list of biases funds participation in a database is voluntary leading to selfselection bias because those funds that choose to report may not be typical of funds as a whole for example some do not report because of poor results or because they have already reached their target size and do not wish to raise further money the short lifetimes of many hedge funds means that there are many new entrants and many departures each year which raises the problem of survivorship bias if we examine only funds that have survived to the present we will overestimate past returns because many of the worstperforming funds have not survived and the observed association between fund youth and fund performance suggests that this bias may be substantial when a fund is added to a database for the first time all or part of its historical data is recorded expost in the database it is likely that funds only publish their results when they are favorable so that the average performances displayed by the funds during their incubation period are inflated this is known as instant history bias or backfill bias investable indicesedit investable indices are an attempt to reduce these problems by ensuring that the return of the index is available to shareholders to create an investable index the index provider selects funds and develops structured products or derivative instruments that deliver the performance of the index when investors buy these products the index provider makes the investments in the underlying funds making an investable index similar in some ways to a fund of hedge funds portfolio to make the index investable hedge funds must agree to accept investments on the terms given by the constructor to make the index liquid these terms must include provisions for redemptions that some managers may consider too onerous to be acceptable this means that investable indices do not represent the total universe of hedge funds most seriously they underrepresent more successful managers who typically refuse to accept such investment protocols hedge fund replicationedit the most recent addition to the field approach the problem in a different manner instead of reflecting the performance of actual hedge funds they take a statistical approach to the analysis of historic hedge fund returns and use this to construct a model of how hedge fund returns respond to the movements of various investable financial assets this model is then used to construct an investable portfolio of those assets this makes the index investable and in principle they can be as representative as the hedge fund database from which they were constructed however these clone indices rely on a statistical modelling process such indices have too short a history to state whether this approach will be considered successful closuresedit in march  hfr – a hedge fund research data and service provider – reported that there were more hedgefund closures in  than during the  recession according to the report several large public pension funds pulled their investments in hedge funds because the funds’ subpar performance as a group did not merit the high fees they charged despite the hedge fund industry topping  trillion for the first time ever in  the number of new hedge funds launched fell short of crisisera figures there were  hedge fund launches in  fewer than the  opened in  and dramatically less than the  launches in  debates and controversiesedit systemic riskedit systemic risk refers to the risk of instability across the entire financial system as opposed to within a single company such risk may arise following a destabilizing event or events affecting a group of financial institutions linked through investment activity organizations such as the national bureau of economic research and the european central bank have charged that hedge funds pose systemic risks to the financial sector and following the failure of hedge fund longterm capital management ltcm in  there was widespread concern about the potential for systemic risk if a hedge fund failure led to the failure of its counterparties as it happens no financial assistance was provided to ltcm by the us federal reserve so there was no direct cost to us taxpayers but a large bailout had to be mounted by a number of financial institutions however these claims are widely disputed by the financial industry who typically regard hedge funds as small enough to fail since most are relatively small in terms of the assets they manage and operate with low leverage thereby limiting the potential harm to the economic system should one of them fail formal analysis of hedge fund leverage before and during the  financial crisis suggests that hedge fund leverage is both fairly modest and countercyclical to the market leverage of investment banks and the larger financial sector hedge fund leverage decreased prior to the financial crisis even while the leverage of other financial intermediaries continued to increase hedge funds fail regularly and numerous hedge funds failed during the financial crisis in testimony to the house financial services committee in  ben bernanke the federal reserve board chairman said he would not think that any hedge fund or private equity fund would become a systemically critical firm individually nevertheless although hedge funds go to great lengths to reduce the ratio of risk to reward inevitably a number of risks remain systemic risk is increased in a crisis if there is herd behaviour which causes a number of similar hedge funds to make losses in similar trades in addition while most hedge funds make only modest use of leverage hedge funds differ from many other market participants such as banks and mutual funds in that there are no regulatory constraints on their use of leverage and some hedge funds seek large amounts of leverage as part of their market strategy the extensive use of leverage can lead to forced liquidations in a crisis particularly for hedge funds that invest at least in part in illiquid investments the close interconnectedness of the hedge funds with their prime brokers typically investment banks can lead to domino effects in a crisis and indeed failing counterparty banks can freeze hedge funds these systemic risk concerns are exacerbated by the prominent role of hedge funds in the financial markets the global hedge fund industry has over  trillion in assets and this does not take into account the full effect of leverage which by definition is market exposure in excess of the amount invested an august  survey by the financial services authority concluded that risks were limited and had reduced as a result inter alia of larger margins being required by counterparty banks but might change rapidly according to market conditions in stressed market conditions investors might suddenly withdraw large sums resulting in forced asset sales this might cause liquidity and pricing problems if it occurred across a number of funds or in one large highly leveraged fund transparencyedit hedge funds are structured to avoid most direct regulation although their managers may be regulated and are not required to publicly disclose their investment activities except to the extent that investors generally are subject to disclosure requirements this is in contrast to a regulated mutual fund or exchangetraded fund which will typically have to meet regulatory requirements for disclosure an investor in a hedge fund usually has direct access to the investment adviser of the fund and may enjoy more personalized reporting than investors in retail investment funds this may include detailed discussions of risks assumed and significant positions however this high level of disclosure is not available to noninvestors contributing to hedge funds reputation for secrecy while some hedge funds have very limited transparency even to investors funds may choose to report some information in the interest of recruiting additional investors much of the data available in consolidated databases is selfreported and unverified a study was done on two major databases containing hedge fund data the study noted that  common funds had significant differences in reported information eg returns inception date net assets value incentive fee management fee investment styles etc and that  of return numbers and  of nav numbers were dramatically different with these limitations investors have to do their own research which may cost on the scale of us for a fund that is not wellestablished a lack of verification of financial documents by investors or by independent auditors has in some cases assisted in fraud in the mids kirk wright of international management associates was accused of mail fraud and other securities violations which allegedly defrauded clients of close to us million in december  bernard madoff was arrested for running a us billion ponzi scheme that closely resembled a hedge fund and was incorrectly described as one several feeder hedge funds of which the largest was fairfield sentry channeled money to it following the madoff case the sec adopted reforms in december  that required hedge funds managed by registered investment advisers to have their assets in the custody of a qualified custodian and subjected them to an audit requirement the process of matching hedge funds to investors has traditionally been fairly opaque with investments often driven by personal connections or recommendations of portfolio managers many funds disclose their holdings strategy and historic performance relative to market indices giving investors some idea of how their money is being allocated although individual holdings are often not disclosed investors are often drawn to hedge funds by the possibility of realizing significant returns or hedging against volatility in the market the complexity and fees associated with hedge funds are causing some to exit the market – calpers the largest pension fund in the us announced plans to completely divest from hedge funds in  some services are attempting to improve matching between hedge funds and investors hedgez is designed to allow investors to easily search and sort through funds imatchative aims to match investors to funds through algorithms that factor in an investors goals and behavioral profile in hopes of helping funds and investors understand the how their perceptions and motivations drive investment decisions links with analystsedit in june  prompted by a letter from gary j aguirre the senate judiciary committee began an investigation into the links between hedge funds and independent analysts aguirre was fired from his job with the sec when as lead investigator of insider trading allegations against pequot capital management he tried to interview john mack then being considered for chief executive officer at morgan stanley the judiciary committee and the us senate finance committee issued a scathing report in  which found that aguirre had been illegally fired in reprisal for his pursuit of mack and in  the sec was forced to reopen its case against pequot pequot settled with the sec for us million and arthur j samberg chief investment officer of pequot was barred from working as an investment advisor pequot closed its doors under the pressure of investigations the systemic practice of hedge funds submitting periodic electronic questionnaires to stock analysts as a part of market research was reported in by the new york times in july  according to the report one motivation for the questionnaires was to obtain subjective information not available to the public and possible early notice of trading recommendations that could produce short term market movements value in meanvariance efficient portfoliosedit according to modern portfolio theory rational investors will seek to hold portfolios that are meanvariance efficient that is portfolios that offer the highest level of return per unit of risk one of the attractive features of hedge funds in particular market neutral and similar funds is that they sometimes have a modest correlation with traditional assets such as equities this means that hedge funds have a potentially quite valuable role in investment portfolios as diversifiers reducing overall portfolio risk however there are three reasons why one might not wish to allocate a high proportion of assets into hedge funds these reasons are hedge funds are highly individual and it is hard to estimate the likely returns or risks hedge funds low correlation with other assets tends to dissipate during stressful market events making them much less useful for diversification than they may appear hedge fund returns are reduced considerably by the high fee structures that are typically charged several studies have suggested that hedge funds are sufficiently diversifying to merit inclusion in investor portfolios but this is disputed for example by mark kritzman who performed a meanvariance optimization calculation on an opportunity set that consisted of a stock index fund a bond index fund and ten hypothetical hedge funds the optimizer found that a meanvariance efficient portfolio did not contain any allocation to hedge funds largely because of the impact of performance fees to demonstrate this kritzman repeated the optimization using an assumption that the hedge funds incurred no performance fees the result from this second optimization was an allocation of  to hedge funds the other factor reducing the attractiveness of hedge funds in a diversified portfolio is that they tend to perform poorly during equity bear markets just when an investor needs part of their portfolio to add value for example in january–september  the credit suissetremont hedge fund index was down  according to the same index series even dedicated short bias funds had a return of − during september  in other words even though low average correlations may appear to make hedge funds attractive this may not work in turbulent period for example around the collapse of lehman brothers in september  see alsoedit activist shareholder alternative asset board of directors corporate governance fund governance investment banking list of

corporate finance personal finance public finance banks and banking financial regulation fund governance v t e a hedge fund is an investment fund that pools capital from accredited individuals or institutional investors and invests in a variety of assets often with complex portfolioconstruction and riskmanagement techniques it is administered by a professional investment management firm and often structured as a limited partnership limited liability company or similar vehicle hedge funds are generally distinct from mutual funds as their use of leverage is not capped by regulators and distinct from private equity funds as the majority of hedge funds invest in relatively liquid assets the term hedge fund originated from the paired long and short positions that the first of these funds used to hedge market risk over time the types and nature of the hedging concepts expanded as did the different types of investment vehicles today hedge funds engage in a diverse range of markets and strategies and employ a wide variety of financial instruments and risk management techniques hedge funds are made available only to certain sophisticated or accredited investors and cannot be offered or sold to the general public as such they generally avoid direct regulatory oversight bypass licensing requirements applicable to investment companies and operate with greater flexibility than mutual funds and other investment funds however following the financial crisis of – regulations were passed in the united states and europe with intentions to increase government oversight of hedge funds and eliminate certain regulatory gaps hedge funds have existed for many decades and have become increasingly popular they have now grown to be a substantial fraction of asset management with assets now totaling around  trillion hedge funds are almost always openended and allow additions or withdrawals by their investors generally on a monthly or quarterly basis the value of an investors holding is directly related to the fund net asset value many hedge fund investment strategies aim to achieve a positive return on investment regardless of whether markets are rising or falling absolute return hedge fund managers often invest money of their own in the fund they manage a hedge fund typically pays its investment manager an annual management fee for example  of the assets of the fund and a performance fee for example  of the increase in the funds net asset value during the year both coinvestment and performance fees serve to align the interests of managers with those of the investors in the fund some hedge funds have several billion dollars of assets under management aum contents  introduction  history  notable hedge fund managers  strategies  global macro

meaning a line of bushes around a field has long been used as a metaphor for the placing of limits on risk early hedge funds sought to hedge specific investments against general market fluctuations by shorting the market hence the name nowadays however many different investment strategies are used many of which do not hedge risk– historyedit during the us bull market of the s there were numerous private investment vehicles available to wealthy investors of that period the best known today is the grahamnewman partnership founded by benjamin graham and jerry newman this was cited by warren buffett in a  letter to the museum of american finance as an early hedge fund the sociologist alfred w jones is credited with coining the phrase hedged fund and is credited with creating the first hedge fund structure in  although this has been disputed jones referred to his fund as being hedged a term then commonly used on wall street to describe the management of investment risk due to changes in the financial markets in the s hedge funds specialized in a single strategy with most fund managers following the longshort equity model many hedge funds closed during the recession of – and the – stock market crash due to heavy losses they received renewed attention in the late s during the s the number of hedge funds increased significantly with the s stock market rise the

global macro directional eventdriven and relative value arbitrage strategies within these categories each entail characteristic risk and return profiles a fund may employ a single strategy or multiple strategies for flexibility risk management or diversification the hedge funds prospectus also known as an offering memorandum offers potential investors information about key aspects of the fund including the funds investment strategy investment type and leverage limit the elements contributing to a hedge fund strategy include the hedge funds approach to the market the particular instrument used the market sector the fund specializes in eg healthcare the method used to select investments and the amount of diversification within the fund there are a variety of market approaches to different asset classes including equity fixed income commodity and currency instruments used include equities fixed income futures options and swaps strategies can be divided into those in which investments can be selected by managers known as discretionaryqualitative or those in which investments are selected using a computerized system known as systematicquantitative the amount of diversification within the fund can vary funds may be multistrategy multifund multimarket multimanager or a combination sometimes hedge fund strategies are described as absolute return and are classified as either market neutral or directional market neutral funds have less correlation to overall market performance by neutralizing the effect of market swings whereas directional funds utilize trends and inconsistencies in the market and have greater exposure to the markets fluctuations global macroedit main article global macro hedge funds using a global macro investing strategy take sizable positions in share bond or currency markets in anticipation of global macroeconomic events in order to generate a riskadjusted return global macro fund managers use macroeconomic big picture analysis based on global market events and trends to identify opportunities for investment that would profit from anticipated price movements while global macro strategies have a large amount of flexibility due to their ability to use leverage to take large positions in diverse investments in multiple markets the timing of the implementation of the strategies is important in order to generate attractive riskadjusted returns global macro is often categorized as a directional investment strategy global macro strategies can be divided into discretionary and systematic approaches discretionary trading is carried out by investment managers who identify and select investments whereas systematic trading is based on mathematical models and executed by software with limited human involvement beyond the programming and updating of the software these strategies can also be divided into trend or countertrend approaches depending on whether the fund attempts to profit from following trends long or shortterm or attempts to anticipate and profit from reversals in trends within global macro strategies there are further substrategies including systematic diversified in which the fund trades in diversified markets or systematic currency in which the fund trades in currency markets other substrategies include those employed by commodity trading advisors ctas where the fund trades in futures or options in commodity markets or in swaps this is also known as a managed future fund ctas trade in commodities such as gold and financial instruments including stock indices

signal processing techniques for equity trading are described as using a quantitative directional strategy funds using a short bias strategy take advantage of declining equity prices using short positions eventdrivenedit main article eventdriven investing eventdriven strategies concern situations in which the underlying investment opportunity and risk are associated with an event an eventdriven investment strategy finds investment opportunities in corporate transactional events such as consolidations acquisitions recapitalizations bankruptcies and liquidations managers employing such a strategy capitalize on valuation inconsistencies in the market before or after such events and take a position based on the predicted movement of the security or securities in question large institutional investors such as hedge funds are more likely to pursue eventdriven investing strategies than traditional equity investors because they have the expertise and resources to analyze corporate transactional events for investment opportunities corporate transactional events generally fit into three categories distressed securities risk arbitrage and special situations distressed securities include such events as restructurings recapitalizations and bankruptcies a distressed securities investment strategy involves investing in the bonds or loans of companies facing bankruptcy or severe financial distress when these bonds or loans are being traded at a discount to their value hedge fund managers pursuing the distressed debt investment strategy aim to capitalize on depressed bond prices hedge funds purchasing distressed debt may prevent those companies from going bankrupt as such an acquisition deters foreclosure by banks while eventdriven investing in general tends to thrive during a bull market distressed investing works best during a bear market risk arbitrage or merger arbitrage includes such events as mergers acquisitions liquidations and hostile takeovers risk arbitrage typically involves buying and selling the stocks of two or more merging companies to take advantage of market discrepancies between acquisition price and stock price the risk element arises from the possibility that the merger or acquisition will not go ahead as planned hedge fund managers will use research and analysis to determine if the event will take place special situations are events that impact the value of a companys stock including the restructuring of a company or corporate transactions including spinoffs sharebuybacks security issuancerepurchase asset sales or other catalystoriented situations to take advantage of special situations the hedge fund manager must identify an upcoming event that will increase or decrease the value of the companys equity and equityrelated instruments other eventdriven strategies include credit arbitrage strategies which focus on corporate fixed income securities an activist strategy where the fund takes large positions in companies and uses the ownership to participate in the management a strategy based on predicting the final approval of new pharmaceutical drugs and legal catalyst strategy which specializes in companies involved in major lawsuits relative valueedit main article relative value economics relative value arbitrage strategies take advantage of relative discrepancies in price between securities the price discrepancy can occur due to mispricing of securities compared to related securities the underlying security or the market overall hedge fund managers can use various types of analysis to identify price discrepancies in securities including mathematical technical or fundamental techniques relative value is often used as a synonym for market neutral as strategies in this category typically have very little or no directional market exposure to the market as a whole other relative value substrategies include fixed income arbitrage exploit pricing inefficiencies between related fixed income securities equity market neutral exploits differences in stock prices by being long and short in stocks within the same sector industry market capitalization country which also creates a hedge against broader market factors convertible arbitrage exploit pricing inefficiencies between convertible securities and the corresponding stocks assetbacked securities fixedincome assetbacked fixed income arbitrage strategy using assetbacked securities credit long  short the same as long  short equity but in credit markets instead of equity markets statistical arbitrage identifying pricing inefficiencies between securities through mathematical modeling techniques volatility arbitrage exploit the change in implied volatility instead of the change in price yield alternatives nonfixed income arbitrage strategies based on the yield instead of the price regulatory arbitrage the practice of taking advantage of regulatory differences between two or more markets risk arbitrage exploiting market discrepancies between acquisition price and stock price miscellaneousedit in addition to those strategies within the four main categories there are several strategies that do not fit into these categorizations or can apply across several of them fund of hedge funds multimanager a hedge fund with a diversified portfolio of numerous underlying singlemanager hedge funds multistrategy a hedge fund using a combination of different strategies to reduce market risk minimum account fund the minimum amount to open a hedge fund account is say  million dollars with  nonholding or  million

wide range of categories while maximizing gains through financial leveraging riskedit for an investor who already holds large quantities of equities and bonds investment in hedge funds may provide diversification and reduce the overall portfolio risk managers of hedge funds use particular trading strategies and instruments with the specific aim of reducing market risks to produce riskadjusted returns that are consistent with investors desired level of risk hedge funds ideally produce returns relatively uncorrelated with market indices while hedging can be a way of reducing the risk of an investment hedge funds like all other investment types are not immune to risk according to a report by the hennessee group hedge funds were approximately onethird less volatile than the sp  between  and  risk managementedit investors in hedge funds are in most countries required to be qualified investors who are assumed to be aware of the investment risks and accept these risks because of the potential returns relative to those risks fund managers may employ extensive risk management strategies in order to protect the fund and investors according to the financial times big hedge funds have some of the most sophisticated and exacting risk management practices anywhere in asset management hedge fund managers that hold a large number of investment positions for short durations are likely to have a particularly comprehensive risk management system in place and it has become usual for funds to have independent risk officers who assess and manage risks but are not otherwise involved in trading a variety of different measurement techniques and models are used to estimate risk according to the funds leverage liquidity and investment strategy nonnormality of returns volatility clustering and trends are not always accounted for by conventional risk measurement methodologies and so in addition to value at risk and similar measurements funds may use integrated measures such as drawdowns  in addition to assessing the marketrelated risks that may arise from an investment investors commonly employ operational due diligence to assess the risk that error or fraud at a hedge fund might result in loss to the investor considerations will include the organization and management of operations at the hedge fund manager whether the investment strategy is likely to be sustainable and the funds ability to develop as a company transparency and regulatory considerationsedit since hedge funds are private entities and have few public disclosure requirements this is sometimes perceived as a lack of transparency another common perception of hedge funds is that their managers are not subject to as much regulatory oversight andor registration requirements as other financial investment managers and more prone to managerspecific idiosyncratic risks such as style drifts faulty operations or fraud new regulations introduced in the us and the eu as of  require hedge fund managers to report more information leading to greater transparency in addition investors particularly institutional investors are encouraging further developments in hedge fund risk management both through internal practices and external regulatory requirements the increasing influence of institutional investors has led to greater transparency hedge funds increasingly provide information to investors including valuation methodology positions and leverage exposure risks shared with other investment typesedit hedge funds share many of the same types of risk as other investment classes including liquidity risk and manager risk liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset can be bought and sold or converted to cash similar to private equity funds hedge funds employ a lockup period during which an investor cannot remove money manager risk refers to those risks which arise from the management of funds as well as specific risks such as style drift which refers to a fund manager drifting away from an area of specific expertise manager risk factors include valuation risk capacity risk concentration risk and leverage risk valuation risk refers to the concern that the net asset value of investments may be inaccurate capacity risk can arise from placing too much money into one particular strategy which may lead to fund performance deterioration and concentration risk may arise if a fund has too much exposure to a particular investment sector trading strategy or group of correlated funds these risks may be managed through defined controls over conflict of interest restrictions on allocation of funds and set exposure limits for strategies many investment funds use leverage the practice of borrowing money trading on margin or using derivatives to obtain market exposure in excess of that provided by investors capital although leverage can increase potential returns the opportunity for larger gains is weighed against the possibility of greater losses hedge funds employing leverage are likely to engage in extensive risk management practices in comparison with investment banks hedge fund leverage is relatively low according to a national bureau of economic research working paper the average leverage for investment banks is  compared to between  and  for hedge funds some types of funds including hedge funds are perceived as having a greater appetite for risk with the intention of maximizing returns subject to the risk tolerance of investors and the fund manager managers will have an additional incentive to increase risk oversight when their own capital is invested in the fund notable failuresedit longterm capital management founded in  by john meriwether following backtoback financial crises in asia in  and russia in  the fund ended up losing  billion

losses barakett closed the fund in  atticus globals reported a compounded annual return of  compared to just  for the sp  fees and remunerationedit fees paid to hedge fundsedit hedge fund management firms typically charge their funds both a management fee and a performance fee management fees are calculated as a percentage of the funds net asset value and typically range from  to  per annum with  being standard they are usually expressed as an annual percentage but calculated and paid monthly or quarterly management fees for hedge funds are designed to cover the operating costs of the manager whereas the performance fee provides the managers profits however due to economies of scale the management fee from larger funds can generate a significant part of a managers profits and as a result some fees have been criticized by some public pension funds such as calpers for being too high the performance fee is typically  of the funds profits during any year though they range between  and  performance fees are intended to provide an incentive for a manager to generate profits performance fees have been criticized by warren buffett who believes that because hedge funds share only the profits and not the losses such fees create an incentive for highrisk investment management performance fee rates have fallen since the start of the credit crunch almost all hedge fund performance fees include a high water mark or loss carryforward provision which means that the performance fee only applies to net profits ie profits after losses in previous years have been recovered this prevents managers from receiving fees for volatile performance though a manager will sometimes close a fund that has suffered serious losses and start a new fund rather than attempting to recover the losses over a number of years without performance fee some performance fees include a hurdle so that a fee is only paid on the funds performance in excess of a benchmark rate eg libor or a fixed percentage a soft hurdle means the performance fee is calculated on all the funds returns if the hurdle rate is cleared a hard hurdle is calculated only on returns above the hurdle rate a hurdle is intended to ensure that a manager is only rewarded if the fund generates returns in excess of the returns that the investor would have received if they had invested their money elsewhere some hedge funds charge a redemption fee or withdrawal fee for early withdrawals during a specified period of time typically a year or when withdrawals exceed a predetermined percentage of the original investment the purpose of the fee is to discourage shortterm investing reduce turnover and deter withdrawals after periods of poor performance unlike management fees and performance fees redemption fees are usually kept by the fund remuneration of portfolio managersedit hedge fund management firms are usually owned by their portfolio managers who are therefore entitled to any profits that the business makes as management fees are intended to cover the firms operating costs performance fees and any excess management fees are generally distributed to the firms owners as profits funds do not tend to report compensation and so published lists of the amounts earned by top managers tend to be estimates based on factors such as the fees charged by their funds and the capital they are thought to have invested in them many managers have accumulated large stakes in their own funds and so top hedge fund managers can earn extraordinary amounts of money perhaps up to  billion in a good year earnings at the very top are higher than in any other sector of the financial industry  and collectively the top  hedge fund managers regularly earn more than all  of the chief executives in the sp  most hedge fund managers are remunerated much less however and if performance fees are not earned then small managers at least are unlikely to be paid significant amounts in  the top manager earned m the tenth earned m and the th earned m in  the average earnings for the  highest compensated hedge fund managers in the united states was  million while the mean total compensation for all hedge fund

according to the sunday times rich list for  structureedit a hedge fund is an investment vehicle that is most often structured as an offshore corporation limited partnership or limited liability company the fund is managed by an investment manager in the form of an organization or company that is legally and financially distinct from the hedge fund and its portfolio of assets many investment managers utilize service providers for operational support service providers include prime brokers banks administrators distributors and accounting firms prime brokers clear trades and provide leverage and shortterm financing they are usually divisions of large investment banks the prime broker acts as a counterparty to derivative contracts and lends securities for particular investment strategies such as longshort equities and convertible bond arbitrage it can provide custodial services for the funds assets and execution and clearing services for the hedge fund manager hedge fund administrators are responsible for operations accounting and valuation services this back office support allows fund managers to concentrate on trades administrators also process subscriptions and redemptions and perform various shareholder services hedge funds in the united states are not required to appoint an administrator and all of these functions can be performed by an investment manager a number of conflict of interest situations may arise in this arrangement particularly in the calculation of a funds net asset value nav some funds voluntarily employ external auditors thereby offering a greater degree of transparency a distributor is an underwriter broker dealer or other person who participates in the distribution of securities the distributor is also responsible for marketing the fund to potential investors many hedge funds do not have distributors and in such cases the investment manager will be responsible for distribution of securities and marketing though many funds also use placement agents and brokerdealers for distribution most funds use an independent accounting firm to audit the assets of the fund provide tax services and perform a complete audit of the funds financial statements the yearend audit is often performed in accordance with the standard accounting practices enforced within the country the fund it established or the international financial reporting standards ifrs the auditor may verify the funds nav and assets under management aum some auditors only provide nav lite services meaning that the valuation is based on prices received from the manager rather than independent assessment domicile and taxationedit the legal structure of a specific hedge fund in particular its domicile and the type of legal entity in use is usually determined by the tax expectations of the funds investors regulatory considerations will also play a role many hedge funds are established in offshore financial centers to avoid adverse tax consequences for its foreign and taxexempt investors offshore funds that invest in the us typically pay withholding taxes on certain types of investment income but not us capital gains tax however the funds investors are subject to tax in their own jurisdictions on any increase in the value of their investments this tax treatment promotes crossborder investments by limiting the potential for multiple jurisdictions to layer taxes on investors us taxexempt investors such as pension plans and endowments invest primarily in offshore hedge funds to preserve their tax exempt status and avoid unrelated business taxable income the investment manager usually based in a major financial center pays tax on its management fees per the tax laws of the state and country where it is located in  half of the existing hedge funds were registered offshore and half onshore the cayman islands was the leading location for offshore funds accounting for  of the total number of global hedge funds the

claimed to own the assets when in fact the hedge fund clients had full control of the assets and reaped the profits the hedge funds would then execute trades — many of them a few seconds in duration —

shortterm trades these basket options will now be labeled as listed transactions that must be declared on tax returns and a failure to do would result in a penalty investment manager locationsedit in contrast to the funds themselves investment managers are primarily located onshore the united states remains the largest center of investment with usbased funds managing around  of global assets at

some  of europeanbased hedge fund assets in  interest in hedge funds in asia has increased significantly since  especially in japan hong kong and singapore however the uk and the us remain the leading locations for management of asian hedge fund assets the legal entityedit hedge fund legal structures vary depending on location and the investors us hedge funds aimed at usbased taxable investors are generally structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies limited partnerships and other flowthrough taxation structures assure that investors in hedge funds are not subject to both entitylevel and personallevel taxation a hedge fund structured as a limited partnership must have a general partner the general partner may be an individual or a corporation the general partner serves as the manager of the limited partnership and has unlimited liability the limited partners serve as the funds investors and have no responsibility for management or investment decisions their liability is limited to the amount of money they invest for partnership interests as an alternative to a limited partnership arrangement us domestic hedge funds may be structured as limited liability companies with members acting as corporate shareholders and enjoying protection from individual liability by contrast offshore corporate funds are usually used for nonus investors and when they are domiciled in an applicable offshore tax haven no entitylevel tax is imposed many managers of offshore funds permit the participation of taxexempt us investors such as pensions funds institutional endowments and charitable trusts as an alternative legal structure offshore funds may be formed as an openended unit trust using an unincorporated mutual fund structure japanese investors prefer to invest in unit trusts such as those available in the cayman islands the investment manager who organizes the hedge fund may retain an interest in the fund either as the general partner of a limited partnership or as the holder of founder shares in a corporate fund for offshore funds structured as corporate entities the fund may appoint a board of directors the boards primary role is to provide a layer of oversight while representing the interests of the shareholders however in practice board members may lack sufficient expertise to be effective in performing those duties the board may include both affiliated directors who are employees of the fund and independent directors whose relationship to the fund is limited types of fundsedit openended hedge funds continue to issue shares to new investors and allow periodic withdrawals at the net asset value nav for each share closedended hedge funds issue a limited number of tradeable shares at inception shares of listed hedges funds are traded on stock exchanges such as the irish stock exchange and may be purchased by nonaccredited investors side pocketsedit a side pocket is a mechanism whereby a fund compartmentalizes assets that are relatively illiquid or difficult to value reliably when an investment is sidepocketed its value is calculated separately from the value of the fund’s main portfolio because side pockets are used to hold illiquid investments investors do not have the standard redemption rights with respect to the side pocket investment that they do with respect to the fund’s main portfolio profits or losses from the investment are allocated on a pro rata basis only to those who are investors at the time the investment is placed into the side pocket and are not shared with new investors funds typically carry side pocket assets at cost for purposes of calculating management fees and reporting net asset values this allows fund managers to avoid attempting a valuation of the underlying investments which may not always have a readily available market value side pockets were widely used by hedge funds during the  financial crisis amidst a flood of withdrawal requests side pockets allowed fund managers to lay away illiquid securities until market liquidity improved a move that could reduce losses however as the practice restricts investors ability to redeem their investments it is often unpopular and many have alleged that it has been abused or applied unfairly the sec also has expressed concern about aggressive use of side pockets and has sanctioned certain fund managers for inappropriate use of them regulationedit hedge funds must conform to the national federal and state regulatory laws in their respective locations the us regulations and restrictions that apply to hedge funds differ from its mutual funds mutual funds unlike hedge funds and other private funds are subject to the investment company act of  which is a highly detailed and extensive regulatory regime according to a report by the international organization of securities commissions the most common form of regulation pertains to restrictions on financial advisers and hedge fund managers in an effort to minimize client fraud on the other hand us hedge funds are exempt from many of the standard registration and reporting requirements because they only accept accredited investors in  regulations were enacted in the us and european union which introduced additional hedge fund reporting requirements these included the uss doddfrank wall street reform act and european alternative investment fund managers directive in  in an attempt for selfregulation  leading hedge fund managers developed a voluntary set of international standards in best practice and known as the hedge fund standards they were designed to create a … framework of transparency integrity and good governance in the hedge fund industry the hedge fund standards board was set up to prompt and maintain these standards going forward and by  it had approximately  hedge fund managers and institutional investors with a value of us tn investment endorsing the standards united statesedit hedge funds within the us are subject to regulatory reporting and record keeping requirements many hedge funds also fall under the jurisdiction of the commodity futures trading commission and are subject to rules and provisions of the  commodity exchange act which prohibits fraud and manipulation the securities act of  required companies to file a registration statement with the sec to comply with its private placement rules before offering their securities to the public the securities exchange act of  required a fund with more than  investors to register with the sec the investment advisers act of  contained antifraud provisions that regulated hedge fund managers and advisers created limits for the number and types of investors and prohibited public offerings the act also exempted hedge funds from mandatory registration with the us securities and exchange commission sec when selling to accredited investors with a minimum of us million in investment assets companies and institutional investors with at least us million in investment assets also qualified in december  the sec began requiring hedge fund advisers managing more than us million and with more than  investors to register with the sec under the investment advisers act the sec stated that it was adopting a riskbased approach to monitoring hedge funds as part of its evolving regulatory regimen for the burgeoning industry the new rule was controversial with two commissioners dissenting and was later challenged in court by a hedge fund manager in june  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia overturned the rule and sent it back to the agency to be reviewed in response to the court decision in  the sec adopted rule  which unlike the earlier challenged rule does not impose additional filing reporting or disclosure obligations but does potentially increase the risk of enforcement action for negligent or fraudulent activity hedge fund managers with at least us million in assets under management are required to file publicly quarterly reports disclosing ownership of registered equity securities and are subject to public disclosure if they own more than  of the class of any registered equity security registered advisers must report their business practices and disciplinary history to the sec and to their investors they are required to have written compliance policies a chief compliance officer and their records and practices may be examined by the sec the uss doddfrank wall street reform act was passed in july  and requires sec registration of advisers who manage private funds with more than us million in assets registered managers must file form adv with the sec as well as information regarding their assets under management and trading positions previously advisers with fewer than  clients were exempt although many hedge fund advisers voluntarily registered with the sec to satisfy institutional investors under doddfrank investment advisers with less than us million in assets under management became subject to state regulation this increased the number of hedge funds under state supervision overseas advisers who managed more than us million were also required to register with the sec the act requires hedge funds to provide information about their trades and portfolios to regulators including the newly created financial stability oversight council in this regard most hedge funds and other private funds including private equity funds must file form pf with the sec which is an extensive reporting form with substantial data on the funds activities and positions under the volcker rule regulators are also required to implement regulations for banks their affiliates and holding companies to limit their relationships with hedge funds and to prohibit these organizations from proprietary trading and to limit their investment in and sponsorship of hedge funds europeedit within the european union eu hedge funds are primarily regulated through their managers in the united kingdom where  of europes hedge funds are based hedge fund managers are required to be authorised and regulated by the financial conduct authority fca each country has their own specific restrictions on hedge fund activities including controls on use of derivatives in portugal and limits on leverage in france in the eu managers are subject to the eus directive on alternative investment fund managers aifmd according to the eu the aim of the directive is to provide greater monitoring and control of alternative investment funds aifmd requires all eu hedge fund managers to register with national regulatory authorities and to disclose more information on a more frequent basis it also directs hedge fund managers to hold larger amounts of capital aifmd also introduced a passport for hedge funds authorised in one eu country to operate throughout the eu the scope of aifmd is broad and encompasses managers located within the eu as well as noneu managers that market their funds to european investors an aspect of aifmd which challenges established practices in the hedge funds sector is the potential restriction of remuneration through bonus deferrals and clawback provisions otheredit some hedge funds are established in offshore centres such as the cayman islands dublin luxembourg the british virgin islands and bermuda which have different regulations concerning nonaccredited investors client confidentiality and fund manager independence in south africa investment fund managers must be approved by and register with the financial services board fsb performanceedit measurementedit performance statistics for individual hedge funds are difficult to obtain as the funds have historically not been required to report their performance to a central repository and restrictions against public offerings and advertisement have led many managers to refuse to provide performance information publicly however summaries of individual hedge fund performance are occasionally available in industry journals and databases and investment consultancy hennessee group one estimate is that the average hedge fund returned  per year representing a  return above overall market performance before fees based on performance data from  hedge funds another is that between january  and december  the hedge funds outperformed other investments were significantly less volatile with stocks falling  per year over the decade and hedge funds rising  more recent data show that hedge fund performance has declined and underperformed the market hedge funds performance is measured by comparing their returns to an estimate of their risk common measures are the sharpe ratio treynor measure and jensens alpha these measures work best when returns follow normal distributions without autocorrelation and these assumptions are often not met in practice new performance measures have been introduced that attempt to address some of theoretical concerns with traditional indicators including modified sharpe ratios the omega ratio introduced by keating and shadwick in  alternative investments risk adjusted performance airap published by sharma in  and kappa developed by kaplan and knowles in  sectorsize effectedit there is a debate over whether alpha the managers skill element in performance has been diluted by the expansion of the hedge fund industry two reasons are given first the increase in traded volume may have been reducing the market anomalies that are a source of hedge fund performance second the remuneration model is attracting more managers which may dilute the talent available in the industry hedge fund indicesedit indices that track hedge fund returns are in order of development called noninvestable investable and clone they play a central and unambiguous role in traditional asset markets where they are widely accepted as representative of their underlying portfolios equity and debt index fund products provide investable access to most developed markets in these asset classes hedge funds however are actively managed so that tracking is impossible noninvestable hedge fund indices on the other hand may be more or less representative but returns data on many of the reference group of funds is nonpublic this may result in biased estimates of their returns in an attempt to address this problem clone indices have been created in an attempt to replicate the statistical properties of hedge funds without being directly based on their returns data none of these approaches achieves the accuracy of indices in other asset classes for which there is more complete published data concerning the underlying returns noninvestable indicesedit noninvestable indices are indicative in nature and aim to represent the performance of some database of hedge funds using some measure such as mean median or weighted mean from a hedge fund database the databases have diverse selection criteria and methods of construction and no single database captures all funds this leads to significant differences in reported performance between different indices although they aim to be representative noninvestable indices suffer from a lengthy and largely unavoidable list of biases funds participation in a database is voluntary leading to selfselection bias because those funds that choose to report may not be typical of funds as a whole for example some do not report because of poor results or because they have already reached their target size and do not wish to raise further money the short lifetimes of many hedge funds means that there are many new entrants and many departures each year which raises the problem of survivorship bias if we examine only funds that have survived to the present we will overestimate past returns because many of the worstperforming funds have not survived and the observed association between fund youth and fund performance suggests that this bias may be substantial when a fund is added to a database for the first time all or part of its historical data is recorded expost in the database it is likely that funds only publish their results when they are favorable so that the average performances displayed by the funds during their incubation period are inflated this is known as instant history bias or backfill bias investable indicesedit investable indices are an attempt to reduce these problems by ensuring that the return of the index is available to shareholders to create an investable index the index provider selects funds and develops structured products or derivative instruments that deliver the performance of the index when investors buy these products the index provider makes the investments in the underlying funds making an investable index similar in some ways to a fund of hedge funds portfolio to make the index investable hedge funds must agree to accept investments on the terms given by the constructor to make the index liquid these terms must include provisions for redemptions that some managers may consider too onerous to be acceptable this means that investable indices do not represent the total universe of hedge funds most seriously they underrepresent more successful managers who typically refuse to accept such investment protocols hedge fund replicationedit the most recent addition to the field approach the problem in a different manner instead of reflecting the performance of actual hedge funds they take a statistical approach to the analysis of historic hedge fund returns and use this to construct a model of how hedge fund returns respond to the movements of various investable financial assets this model is then used to construct an investable portfolio of those assets this makes the index investable and in principle they can be as representative as the hedge fund database from which they were constructed however these clone indices rely on a statistical modelling process such indices have too short a history to state whether this approach will be considered successful closuresedit in march  hfr – a hedge fund research data and service provider – reported that there were more hedgefund closures in  than during the  recession according to the report several large public pension funds pulled their investments in hedge funds because the funds’ subpar performance as a group did not merit the high fees they charged despite the hedge fund industry topping  trillion for the first time ever in  the number of new hedge funds launched fell short of crisisera figures there were  hedge fund launches in  fewer than the  opened in  and dramatically less than the  launches in  debates and controversiesedit systemic riskedit systemic risk refers to the risk of instability across the entire financial system as opposed to within a single company such risk may arise following a destabilizing event or events affecting a group of financial institutions linked through investment activity organizations such as the national bureau of economic research and the european central bank have charged that hedge funds pose systemic risks to the financial sector and following the failure of hedge fund longterm capital management ltcm in  there was widespread concern about the potential for systemic risk if a hedge fund failure led to the failure of its counterparties as it happens no financial assistance was provided to ltcm by the us federal reserve so there was no direct cost to us taxpayers but a large bailout had to be mounted by a number of financial institutions however these claims are widely disputed by the financial industry who typically regard hedge funds as small enough to fail since most are relatively small in terms of the assets they manage and operate with low leverage thereby limiting the potential harm to the economic system should one of them fail formal analysis of hedge fund leverage before and during the  financial crisis suggests that hedge fund leverage is both fairly modest and countercyclical to the market leverage of investment banks and the larger financial sector hedge fund leverage decreased prior to the financial crisis even while the leverage of other financial intermediaries continued to increase hedge funds fail regularly and numerous hedge funds failed during the financial crisis in testimony to the house financial services committee in  ben bernanke the federal reserve board chairman said he would not think that any hedge fund or private equity fund would become a systemically critical firm individually nevertheless although hedge funds go to great lengths to reduce the ratio of risk to reward inevitably a number of risks remain systemic risk is increased in a crisis if there is herd behaviour which causes a number of similar hedge funds to make losses in similar trades in addition while most hedge funds make only modest use of leverage hedge funds differ from many other market participants such as banks and mutual funds in that there are no regulatory constraints on their use of leverage and some hedge funds seek large amounts of leverage as part of their market strategy the extensive use of leverage can lead to forced liquidations in a crisis particularly for hedge funds that invest at least in part in illiquid investments the close interconnectedness of the hedge funds with their prime brokers typically investment banks can lead to domino effects in a crisis and indeed failing counterparty banks can freeze hedge funds these systemic risk concerns are exacerbated by the prominent role of hedge funds in the financial markets the global hedge fund industry has over  trillion in assets and this does not take into account the full effect of leverage which by definition is market exposure in excess of the amount invested an august  survey by the financial services authority concluded that risks were limited and had reduced as a result inter alia of larger margins being required by counterparty banks but might change rapidly according to market conditions in stressed market conditions investors might suddenly withdraw large sums resulting in forced asset sales this might cause liquidity and pricing problems if it occurred across a number of funds or in one large highly leveraged fund transparencyedit hedge funds are structured to avoid most direct regulation although their managers may be regulated and are not required to publicly disclose their investment activities except to the extent that investors generally are subject to disclosure requirements this is in contrast to a regulated mutual fund or exchangetraded fund which will typically have to meet regulatory requirements for disclosure an investor in a hedge fund usually has direct access to the investment adviser of the fund and may enjoy more personalized reporting than investors in retail investment funds this may include detailed discussions of risks assumed and significant positions however this high level of disclosure is not available to noninvestors contributing to hedge funds reputation for secrecy while some hedge funds have very limited transparency even to investors funds may choose to report some information in the interest of recruiting additional investors much of the data available in consolidated databases is selfreported and unverified a study was done on two major databases containing hedge fund data the study noted that  common funds had significant differences in reported information eg returns inception date net assets value incentive fee management fee investment styles etc and that  of return numbers and  of nav numbers were dramatically different with these limitations investors have to do their own research which may cost on the scale of us for a fund that is not wellestablished a lack of verification of financial documents by investors or by independent auditors has in some cases assisted in fraud in the mids kirk wright of international management associates was accused of mail fraud and other securities violations which allegedly defrauded clients of close to us million in december  bernard madoff was arrested for running a us billion ponzi scheme that closely resembled a hedge fund and was incorrectly described as one several feeder hedge funds of which the largest was fairfield sentry channeled money to it following the madoff case the sec adopted reforms in december  that required hedge funds managed by registered investment advisers to have their assets in the custody of a qualified custodian and subjected them to an audit requirement the process of matching hedge funds to investors has traditionally been fairly opaque with investments often driven by personal connections or recommendations of portfolio managers many funds disclose their holdings strategy and historic performance relative to market indices giving investors some idea of how their money is being allocated although individual holdings are often not disclosed investors are often drawn to hedge funds by the possibility of realizing significant returns or hedging against volatility in the market the complexity and fees associated with hedge funds are causing some to exit the market – calpers the largest pension fund in the us announced plans to completely divest from hedge funds in  some services are attempting to improve matching between hedge funds and investors hedgez is designed to allow investors to easily search and sort through funds imatchative aims to match investors to funds through algorithms that factor in an investors goals and behavioral profile in hopes of helping funds and investors understand the how their perceptions and motivations drive investment decisions links with analystsedit in june  prompted by a letter from gary j aguirre the senate judiciary committee began an investigation into the links between hedge funds and independent analysts aguirre was fired from his job with the sec when as lead investigator of insider trading allegations against pequot capital management he tried to interview john mack then being considered for chief executive officer at morgan stanley the judiciary committee and the us senate finance committee issued a scathing report in  which found that aguirre had been illegally fired in reprisal for his pursuit of mack and in  the sec was forced to reopen its case against pequot pequot settled with the sec for us million and arthur j samberg chief investment officer of pequot was barred from working as an investment advisor pequot closed its doors under the pressure of investigations the systemic practice of hedge funds submitting periodic electronic questionnaires to stock analysts as a part of market research was reported in by the new york times in july  according to the report one motivation for the questionnaires was to obtain subjective information not available to the public and possible early notice of trading recommendations that could produce short term market movements value in meanvariance efficient portfoliosedit according to modern portfolio theory rational investors will seek to hold portfolios that are meanvariance efficient that is portfolios that offer the highest level of return per unit of risk one of the attractive features of hedge funds in particular market neutral and similar funds is that they sometimes have a modest correlation with traditional assets such as equities this means that hedge funds have a potentially quite valuable role in investment portfolios as diversifiers reducing overall portfolio risk however there are three reasons why one might not wish to allocate a high proportion of assets into hedge funds these reasons are hedge funds are highly individual and it is hard to estimate the likely returns or risks hedge funds low correlation with other assets tends to dissipate during stressful market events making them much less useful for diversification than they may appear hedge fund returns are reduced considerably by the high fee structures that are typically charged several studies have suggested that hedge funds are sufficiently diversifying to merit inclusion in investor portfolios but this is disputed for example by mark kritzman who performed a meanvariance optimization calculation on an opportunity set that consisted of a stock index fund a bond index fund and ten hypothetical hedge funds the optimizer found that a meanvariance efficient portfolio did not contain any allocation to hedge funds largely because of the impact of performance fees to demonstrate this kritzman repeated the optimization using an assumption that the hedge funds incurred no performance fees the result from this second optimization was an allocation of  to hedge funds the other factor reducing the attractiveness of hedge funds in a diversified portfolio is that they tend to perform poorly during equity bear markets just when an investor needs part of their portfolio to add value for example in january–september  the credit suissetremont hedge fund index was down  according to the same index series even dedicated short bias funds had a return of − during september  in other words even though low average correlations may appear to make hedge funds attractive this may not work in turbulent period for example around the collapse of lehman brothers in september  see alsoedit activist shareholder alternative asset board of directors corporate governance fund governance investment banking list of

objectives vmr capital llc vm is the managing general partner of vmr life sciences fund lp the fund an investment hedge fund focusing on the medical products industry the fund makes contrarian investments in undervalued orphaned public companies developing medical breakthrough products that address large unmet medical needs the principals coined the phrase valuetomomentumr vmr to describe the funds proprietary investment strategy typically the companies are  to  years old and have historically made substantial investments in the development of their technology platforms and product pipelines since developing and commercializing medical breakthrough products is fraught with challenges and hurdles the product development process and the product adoption velocity are irregular and are frequently characterized by periods of progress followed by setbacks not surprisingly this creates share price volatility and more often than not a dramatic decrease in the value of the company this in turn creates a value investment opportunity the fund takes advantage of these events to build positions in companies at depressed valuations if the principals believe that the setback is indeed reversible as the companies begin to turnaround and achieves new significant milestones which serve as event or momentum catalysts the value of the company typically begins to appreciate this momentum driven appreciation can become dramatic for reasons unique to the medical products industry including the following a medical breakthrough products tend to be high margin products b such products often claim a monopoly position at least for a period of time c products addressing critical unmet medical needs can often experience a rapid rate of adoption and d many of these products are applicable globally for a valuetomomentumr to be successful it requires to important characteristics a long term investment horizon in this case typically two to seven years and a concentrated

capital launches next edge private debt fund lp  next edge capital  sep next edge capital launches next edge private debt fund lp posted by next edge  press release toronto september th  – next edge capital corp “next edge” is pleased to announce the launch of the next edge private debt fund lp the “fund” an openended investment product that offers investors access to investments in secured shortterm loans says toreigh stuart chief executive officer of next edge “there remains a void in the market for investors to access quality alternative yield solutions this fund will allow investors to invest in an area that is typically not available to canadian retail investors that will allow for a consistent attractive return very different from traditional fixed income investments” the fund targets a minimum distribution of  per annum paid quarterly as well a potential supplementary year end distribution to unitholders the fund intends to provide a working capital finance solution to small and medium sized businesses in canada and the united states specifically in the factoring and trade finance space the fund aims to achieve consistent riskadjusted returns with minimal volatility and low correlation to most traditional assets this will be achieved through investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of private debt securities small and medium sized enterprises are the back bone of every economy yet traditionally speaking they are the segment that have the most difficult time accessing traditional financing chartered banks are reluctant or slow to decide to lend so there exists a near constant imbalance of capital to demand for a wide array of private debt transactions for smalltomedium sized companies across all industry sectors part of this is due to structural changes for traditional lenders where changes to regulatory capital and reserve requirements have decreased the supply of capital the fund is seeking to provide ‘enabling’ capital to businesses that are typically below the radar of large chartered banks and seeking to access the private debt markets for working capital loans and advances typically these businesses expect and are willing to pay above traditional banking rates for timely access to capital as announced previously the fund’s initial credit advisor will be liquid capital corp “liquid” liquid founded in  is one of north america’s
