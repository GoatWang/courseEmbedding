office policies contact us company survey your guide to healthy skin july news   comments   happy julyquick tipstreating you skin in the summer is a little different then treating your skin in the winter  some of us are under the impression that we need to stop all treatments and home care for our skin in the summer  the good news is that we dont  it can sometimes be challenging yes but still possible  it is important to know about the medication that you are using  some medications may cause photo sensitivity meaning your skin will sunburn more easily  examples of medications that make you more sensitive to the sun include  doxycycline acticlate isotretinoin accutane retinoids tretinoin tazorac adapalene  it is important to protect your skin during the summer  wearing your sunscreen and a hat is always recommended  be conservative about your sun exposure before and after treatments and while specifically using a photosensitizing medication  you will be able to maintain results with your skin just keep caution in mind  if you have any specific questions regarding your treatments or home care during the summer please do not hesitate to call our aesthetician  she would be glad to assistfun fact  lime juice can cause you to get a severe sunburn if it gets on your skin  so be careful if you enjoy a good corona with lime while sitting on the beach this summernew at the officewith rising copays and insurance restrictions it has become very challenging to prescribe effective medication at an affordable price  in addition pharmacies will frequently disregard a doctors prescription and dispense a less effective and sometimes nonequivalent generic medication as opposed to the more effective brandname product  sometimes it feels like the doctors prescription pad is now just a suggestion pad   we at center city dermatology understand that it is patients who lose when they cant get the right medication to treat their condition  thats why we are now working with a laboratory prescribers choice that is able to tailor the highest quality topical dermatology medications for our patients at an affordable price  by creating unique combinations of pharmaceutical and natural ingredients that work together to enhance efficacy in the skin we are able to provide a better product  combining several medications into one product increases the ease of use and reduces out of pocket expenses why use  or  different creams per day to treat your condition when you can use just one that has all the necessary components  this process also allows us to customize medications that are not currently available at retail pharmacies eg spironolactone gel  minoxidil etc  and for the same cost as the typical copay for a single generic medication you get a superior product containing multiple medications that is more effective and easier to use  now you can pick up many of your topical medications right here in our office  no more trips to the pharmacy or waiting for mailorder prescriptions  center city dermatology strives to be the only stop you need to make for all of your skin care needsjuly promotion obagi summer salecenter city dermatology will be offering  off all obagi products for the month of july  this also includes the obagi radiance peel  help us keep your skin radiant this summerplease remember to discontinue all topical acne treatments eg

time doctors are seeing people in need they examine them give them medication and check on them a few weeks later sounds simple right lets see how an average dermatology visit looks like today patient a lets call her alice goes to see her dermatologist after her visit her doctor writes her  prescriptions she then travels to her pharmacy where she waits for the prescriptions to be filled after some time she is told that some of her prescriptions are not covered and one needs a prior authorization as a result of her insurance’s constraints the pharmacy now contacts the doctor’s office informing them of the situation the patient must now wait for a response from the office because of the busy office and busy pharmacy it is unlikely this will be resolved that day the patient goes home without medication and waits for the doctors office to do the prior authorization and make substitutions for the other prescriptions the physician’s office is burdened with the time consuming process of submitting for the prior authorization and calling for medication substitutions many offices have a team of employees dedicated to handling medication substitutions and prior authorizations from the pharmacy they are disgruntled with the process the cost of the copays the substitution to a substandard drug and ultimately medication non adherence once all is said and done alice gets  prescriptions paying  copays upwards of  each  and one prescription that remains uncovered that has an out of pocket expense of  that she cannot afford and does not fill we are not satisfied with the above routine we believe that healthcare delivery can be more effective and weve already proved our below concept how does a visit look like with prescribers choice™ patient c lets call her claire goes to see her dermatologist who has incorporated the prescribers choice™ model into their practice during her visit with the doctor custom medication is prepared using multiple active ingredients commonly found in separate commercially available products the medication is dispensed to claire at her point of care it is sold to the patient for  an amount less than a tier  copay at the pharmacy claire leaves the physicians office satisfied she understands the medication prescribed is more likely to be compliant with only one medication and will demonstrate good outcomes these case studies represent real patients experience at the pharmacy their names have been modified to allow for privacy please read to fully understand the value of the prescribers choice model case  patient a lets call her alice

dermatologist after her visit her doctor writes her  prescriptions she then travels to her pharmacy where she waits for the prescriptions to be filled after some time when she goes to pay for her prescriptions she is shocked to find that two of her prescriptions are nonformulary and have very high copays and the other two are not covered resulting in a bill of several hundred dollars dismayed barbara leaves the pharmacy abandoning all the prescriptions not taking any of them the physician is never informed it is not until barbaras follow up appointment that the physician is made aware barbara never started the prescribed treatment the physician is discouraged that their prescribed regimen was not followed and their patient has not improved this may result in the physician losing the patient to a competitive dermatologist case  the prescribers choice™ model patient c we can call her claire goes to see her dermatologist who has incorporated the prescribers choice™ model into

times at many pharmacies can be hours inofficephysiciandispensing is especially meaningful for your patients who are suffering acute sickness pain are elderly or have young children patients appreciate receiving medications in your office to avoid a trip to the pharmacy and waiting for their prescription to be filled how does it improve my patients care  satisfaction besides the added convenience you consult with your patient as they receive their medication you get to have an open discussion with them about taking the medications intervals completing the regimen as directed and verbally warning them of interactions that may occur with any other medications you know they are taking compliance with drug therapy is  to  better when medications are delivered at the point of care
