call   ‐ home rates  fees apply now video testimonials realtors home value home search consumer portal rates fees  our  guarantee we dont charge any lender fees because you shouldnt have to pay to get a mortgage the only fee you would ever pay to rp funding is rate discount costs and only if you decide you want to buydown to an even lower interest rate many clients will use the money they would have spent on fees with other lenders and use it to buydown to an even lower interest rate your credit manager can discuss all of these options with you and help you make the best decision how do we offer the best mortgage rates in florida we get asked this question often it really comes down to business philosophy most mortgage loan officers and brokers only close    loans per month so to make a living they need to make thousands of dollars in commissions on each loan they close these commissions are earned through a combination of charging upfront fees and higher interest rates to earn kick backs not at rp funding our loan officers are paid a base  bonus and they close    loans each month so instead of paying thousands of dollars in commissions on each loan we only pay hundreds of dollars in salaries  and we pass this savings onto you in the form of the best mortgage rates possible and no lender fees now you may be worried that you wont get as good of service from a loan officer who closes    times the industry average but this isnt true read more about why rp funding service is fast and great here we have found that    closings per month per credit manager is the optimal number to keep our costs and rates the lowest without sacrificing customer service our efficiency helps us offer the lowest rates while other companies waste time and money shipping files all over the country we do everything locally you can read more about the differences this makes here shopping for a mortgage can be hard work and confusing because of the numerous combinations of mortgage rates and fees and loan programs we set our mortgage rates low to make your decision easy when you can get floridas best mortgage rates and fees from a local direct mortgage lender why would you go anywhere else click here  get started today  guarantee while we are confident that our published rates and no lender fees are the most competitive in the industry we do find rare instances where a competitor offers a better deal our promise to you at rp funding is that we will never let rates or fees stand in the way of you being able to work with your local direct mortgage lender and take advantage of all the other benefits we offer if you receive a legitimate offer from a competitor that is lower our promise to you is that we will match it and if we cant we will give you  unfortunately we have found in most cases when a competitor does offer a lower rate it is part of a bait and switch some unscrupulous companies will quote you anything over the phone and then when it comes time to give you the real figures usually after you have spent your hard earned money on an appraisal the deal suddenly changes with rp funding you can get the best deal on a florida mortgage and avoid any bait and switch or games in most cases the client came back to us when the bait and switch occurred or in some cases they were too far into the process and were stuck with a higher rate and fees because the bait and switch happened so far in the process they could not back out so beware when dealing with some unknown voice on the phone if they do make a better offer than rp funding send us a copy and we will do our best to beat it if we cant beat it well give you  when you actually close on their mortgage as disclosed  but from our experience when we cant match it its just too good to be true come down to our office you can see that we are real people and a legitimate operation unfortunately the mortgage crises happened for a reason and some of the people involved are still in our industry there are mortgage companies out there taking advantage of borrowers working from home and ready to shut down and reopen under a new name when things start to catch up with them our  guarantee allows you to work with a local reputable company that cares about this community without missing out on the best possible deal as your local direct mortgage lender our reputation in this community is important while other discount lenders may hit you with hidden fees and other last minute surprises not at rp funding rules and restrictions for the  guarantee harp home affordable

market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style value blend or growth for fixedincome funds the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bonds effective duration morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis eg quarterly in compiling credit rating information morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros moodys standard  poors fitch and eganjones if two nrsros have rated a security fund companies are to report the lowest rating if three or more nrsros have rated the same security differently fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle for example if nrsro x rates a security aa nrsro y rates the same security an a and nrsro z rates it a bbb the fund company should use the credit rating of a in its reporting to morningstar please note morningstar inc is not itself an nrsro nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund an nrsro rating on a fixedincome security can change from timetotime for credit quality morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro bond funds are assigned a style box placement of low medium or high based on their average credit quality funds with a low credit quality are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is determined to be less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those with a weightedaverage credit quality of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of the mcbi will be classified as moderate and those that are at  or greater of the average effective duration of the mcbi will be classified as extensive for municipal bond funds morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration in these cases static breakpoints are utilized these breakpoints are as follows i limited  years or less ii moderate more than  years but less than  years and iii extensive more than  years in addition for nonus taxable and nonus domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used i limited less than or equal to  years ii moderate greater than  and less than equal to  years iii extensive greater than  yearsunsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers the adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees including but not limited to distribution and service b fees and reimburse certain expenses there is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time month trailing distribution yield at nav refers to the month historical cash flow paid over the past  months in dividends divided by the past months ending nav alpha beta rsquared standard deviation sharpe ratio and capture ratio are  year statistics alpha is a measure of a funds actual returns and expected performance given its level of risk as measured by beta beta reflects the sensitivity of the funds return to fluctuations in the market index rsquared indicates how much of a funds fluctuations were attributable to movements in the funds benchmark standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a funds returns are sharpe ratio is a measure of a funds riskadjusted performance capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return upside capture or negative return downside capturethe morningstar rating™ for funds or star rating is calculated for managed products including mutual funds variable annuity and variable life subaccounts exchangetraded funds closedend funds and separate accounts with at least a threeyear history exchangetraded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a managed products monthly excess performance placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance and does not include the effects of sales charges the top  of products in each product category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the overall morningstar rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three five and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics the weights are  threeyear rating for  months of total returns  fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  months of total returns and  year rating fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  or more months of total returns while the year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the year period the most recent threeyear period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating
