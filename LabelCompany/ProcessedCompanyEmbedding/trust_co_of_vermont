aware investing socially aware investing  also known as sustainable socially conscious “green” or ethical investing is an investment discipline that considers environmental social and corporate governance criteria to generate longterm competitive financial returns and a positive societal impact while its roots stretch as far back as the s the practice of socially aware investing did not become mainstream until the early s when public outcry over the practice of apartheid in south africa led to groups of investors boycotting those companies that continued to do business there  these actions eventually helped to bring an end to apartheid since then the practice of socially aware investing has become less about simply avoiding businesses involved in things like alcohol tobacco firearms or gambling and more about finding corporations whose sustainable business practices promote environmental stewardship consumer protection human rights and diversity at trust company of
