in search of worthy projects though we also have other models for collaborating with experienced “drug hunters” see translation and hunting tab  beyond capital in addition to capital ra capital invests considerable time and resources into helping its private and public portfolio companies succeed we leverage our techatlas platform to identify potential indications as well as partners and acquirers that our portfolio companies may not have considered pursuing as well as complementary drug candidates and technologies for inlicensing consideration members of our investment team take board andor observer seats when appropriate we also host board meetings at our offices from time to time providing access to maps to facilitate strategy discussions we help identify candidates for key executive positions at portfolio companies portfolio companies are welcome to explore our maps with us in certain cases we may license one or more maps to them when appropriate our team can create a custom map that comprehensively aggregates and organizes rd opportunities as well as competitive and complementary technologies in those indications portfolio companies have access to the techatlas team’s primary scientific and market research we interview clinicians and kols host advisory boards and attend many academic conferences our literature surveillance team flags discoveries that may be important to portfolio companies our graphics design team helps portfolio companies communicate complex concepts with high quality graphics for their slides and websites sometimes incorporating techatlas map elements our communications team can offer assistance with grant writing and preparation of scientific publications tab  translation  hunting we are interested in both the novel and the reimagined discoveries and improvements in chemistry molecular and cell biology and material science create novel capabilities that open up new possibilities for tackling previously unsolved challenges the rules by which we understand biology are also constantly being defined and revised revealing new applications for existing technologies and partiallydeveloped drug candidates programs we consider worthwhile may form the basis for a new venture ra capital’s techatlas platform is designed to systematize the translation of novel science and technology into optimal commercial applications which both helps our portfolio companies with their pipeline prioritization as well as generates ideas for new venture formation in those areas that we have mapped it typically takes us a few hours to go from a mechanisminspired idea for treating a disease to knowing the companies that might have relevant clinical and preclinical assets to license the companies from whom a candidate could be commissioned trial designs and endpoints competing and complementary agents current and future standard of care market size comparable pricing financing strategy and potential acquirers all meant to enable a thoughtful firstpass assessment of whether an idea could be worth a much deeper assessment the size and efficiency of our team allows us to parallelize the firstpass assessment of many ideas sourced from literature technology transfer offices pipelines of large pharma as well as small biotechnology companies as well as discussions with academic researchers and clinicians we welcome experienced drug hunters searching for technologiescandidates and looking to start new companies to collaborate with our team and take advantage of the breadth and depth that the techatlas platform has to offer as well as the capital we manage we believe that when a business proposition is framed correctly the capital markets have the resources and depth of understanding to fund proper experimental design and solution development without forcing companies to cut corners and we have collaborated extensively with other funds that share our philosophy to enable ambitious and capital intensive endeavors we owe a debt to the people who have mentored us and we in turn have a responsibility to turn our hard won lessons into a solid foundation for our industrys emerging innovators and

performance ra capital has a particular interest in funding innovation that contributes to the following healthcare themes which converge on a higher quality and more costeffective delivery of significant healthcare outcomes these investment themes may change in the future prevention  cures diagnostics and interventions that are demonstrated to prevent andor cure disease are of greater value than those that ameliorate symptoms and delay disease progression especially if only incrementally we are interested in ambitious objectives hard outcomes measures and proper controls costeffective diagnostics  interventions most of the new products coming to market in the next few years will have to compete in a world that increasingly values cost effectiveness we are interested in seeing data from phase  and phase  clinical trials that inform models of cost effectiveness especially with endpoints that are recognized by private and public payors genetic testing  personalized medicine we are looking for companies with lowcost technologies that have a competitive advantage in genetic testing andor other diagnostics including exclusive access to relevant wellcurated patient samples and healthcare outcomes we have particular interest in a number of current niche areas including carrier tests prenatal tests and the combination of preimplantation diagnosisivf because we believe these technologies will increase in importance and availability with the advent of lowcost sequencing patientphysician convenience there will continue to be a need for technological improvements that meaningfully transform how healthcare is delivered converting a treatment that would normally require a hospital admission into an outpatient procedure allowing a patient to take an oral pill or selfadminister a subcutaneous injection at home instead of having to see a physician to receive an iv infusion or delivering a rapid diagnostic test at the point of care instead of requiring a second appointment to discuss the results however until we see more common sense in the way in which physicians and hospitals are compensated for their services and patients are billed for their utilization companies will need to remain mindful of the myriad ways in which the healthcare system’s incentive schemes cause counterintuitive practices to remain entrenched eg in the us physicians in private practice have a financial incentive aka “asp” to prescribe expensive ivadministered drugs and therefore are disincentivized from switching to a cheaper drug or a more convenient subcutaneous form of the same drug for which there may not be the same incentive smallmolecule replacements for biologics although it is clear from the fda guidance documents on biosimilars that there will be high barriers to allowing pharmacy substitution of biologics with lower cost biosimilarsbiogenerics and therefore biologics are unlikely to ever be commoditized in the same way that smallmolecules are when patents expire it is hard to believe that the global healthcare system will be able to indefinitely tolerate biologic drug cost inflation we are interested in smallmolecule drugs that can deliver comparable efficacysafety to biologics ideally with greater convenience to patients eg oral pills vs injectables we expect that all else being equal public and private payors will favor such “genericizable” smallmolecule drugs over “ungenericizable” biologics  park plaza boston ma  t  contact us ra capital management  park plaza suite  boston ma  t wwwracapcom top contact

beginning of november peter kolchinsky‘s ra capital management has informed the us securities and exchange commission that it’s increased its positions in two of its holdings dynavax technologies corporation nasdaqdvax and achillion pharmaceuticals inc nasdaqachn the fund now owns almost  million shares from dynavax technologies up from  million previously declared this accounts for a  stake in the company ra capital has also acquired about  million achillion pharmaceuticals shares over the last month following the reported transactions ra now owns almost  million shares of the pharmaceutical company valued at approximately   million owning about  of the firm it stands as the largest bull amongst the hedge funds that we track followed by daniel gold’s qvt financial ra capital has also become dynavax’s largest hedge fund bull having surpassed arthur b cohen and joseph healey’s healthcor management lp which holds about  million shares and samuel isaly’s orbimed advisors owner of almost  million shares both of the aforementioned investments fit perfectly into ra capital’s equity portfolio composed mostly of lifesciences and drug development companies more than  of the total holdings the fund looks for companies with promising technologies andor products this strategy has helped the fund triple its initial investment  million in its initial two years its portfolio is now worth more than  million dynavax technologies for example provides appealing prospects going forward especially in terms of product development the company focuses on the treatment and prevention of allergies infectious diseases and chronic inflammatory diseases usually seeking to alter immune system responses in very specific ways recently it made the design of its next clinical study for its heplisav drug an investigational adult hepatitis b vaccine public “it will be an  subject phase  observerblinded randomized activecontrolled multicenter trial of the safety and immunogenicity of heplisav compared with engerixb in adults  to  years of age” the motivations for ra capital to invest in achillion a pharmaceutical firm focused on innovative treatments for infectious diseases are not as clear the fda recently refused to remove a “hold” on clinical trials of sovaprevir an ns protease inhibitor in the treatment of hepatitis c consequently the stock plummeted from more than  a piece in september to around  each in november opening an attractive entry point for ra capital which seized the opportunity to make a value play disclosure none related
