peppersevenupincsquirt brandhistory of the companyinternal  external environment analysisminor problemsmajor problemsdr peppersevenup owns the up brand in the usa and the dr pepper brand worldwide created in  dr pepper is the oldest nationally distributed soft drink in the us the up brand was introduced in  within the us carbonated soft drinks market dr peppersevenup is one of the fastest growing companiesthe soft drink industry in the united states is a highly profitably but competitive market in  alone consumers on average drank  gallons of soft drinks per person a year there are three major companies that hold the majority of sales in the carbonated soft drink industry in the united states they are the coca cola company with  market share followed by the pepsicola company with  market share and dr pepperseven up inc with  market share the origin of squirt can be traced back to  when a man named herb bishop began experimenting with citrus club bishop created a new carbonated soft drink that required less fruit and sugar to produce compared to other sodas that were being made at the time the new drink seemed to squirt onto the tongue so bishop named the drink squirt squirt is a caffeinefree lowsodium carbonated soft drink brand with a distinctive blend of grapefruit juices that gives it a tangy fresh citrus taste squirt is the bestselling carbonated grapefruit soft drink brand in the united states squirts direct competition comes from two cocacola brands these are fresca and citra fresca is a caffeine free diet soft drink targeted to adults over age  citra is sugared caffeine free version of fresca targeted to teens and young adults squirt outsells citra and fresca combined by case volume the numbers show that the percent of market share for squirt has slowly declined in recent yearssquirts market share is calculated by dividing case volume by total case volume for the entire market the market share for squirt for the past years is as follows    or     or     or     or     or  market shares          the total sales broken down by racialethnic groups can be seen below  of total case volume for squirt in   cases were sold to the hispanic population  of total case volume for squirt in   cases were sold to the african american population  of total case volume for squirt in   cases were sold to the caucasian populationsales by racial groupscaucasian cases were soldhispanic cases soldafrican american  cases soldsquirt has already been exposed to many hispanics primarily those of mexican decent because of the popularity of the beverage in mexico this could be a very beneficial for squirt in the us market considering that there is a very large mexican population in the united states in california alone  of the hispanic population is of mexican ancestry  of  hispanic population people are of mexican decent in california the figure above shows that it may be beneficial for squirt to focus primarily on the hispanic market segment in california over  million people who are of mexican ancestry reside in this one location a weakness that has plagued squirt in the past is its inability to appeal towards an ideal target market the target market has changed numerous times in previous years as well as its positioning strategy squirts inability to correctly place itself within an ideal market has cost it the opportunity of possible sales in the past there are opportunities however that squirt can take advantage of its immense popularity in mexico gives squirt a competitive edge in capturing a larger segment of the growing hispanic market squirt does however have many threats to consider with direct competition from brands distributed by cocacola as well as pepsicolathe threat of new entrants the market is  controlled by dpsu cocacola and pepsi co these companies also control the top  brands in the united states this means that entering into the market is not impossible but gaining a large foothold is not probable however with a  billion dollar per year industry there is also room for a new entrantthe threat of substitute products squirt has  direct competitors in the grapefruit segment and many other competitors in the citrus category there are also  registered brands of soda in the us squirt however does not have a product that is positioned and targeted to the same group with the same taste in the case of the soda market however there are plenty of other soda brands squirt also positioned itself as thirst quenching this places squirt into competition with other beverages including water and sport drinkshowever dpsu does not have the market share and resources that are enjoyed by cocacola and pepsi cos offerings this leaves them with a smaller advertising budgetthe larger advertising budgets of competitors can be a threat to maintaining market share with a brand with flat salesthe intensity of competitive rivalry squirt being a noncola soft drink places it into a different category the major competition comes from mellow yellow and mountain dew and well as citra and fresca the competitors are spending large sums of money on advertising and trying to gain market share over squirtsolution to the problems the flat sales of squirt need to be boosted before competing brands begin to erode the market share enjoyed by squirt squirt maintains a low budget compared to the direct competitors while keeping double the case volume of all competition combined they should expand the market by placing a bottler in new york  texas considering squirts current position they have to large of a target market they need to target the younger teen demographic as well as the younger ethnic markets squirts thirst quenching attribute is great for the southwestern us where the year round temperatures are high southern california also has an outdoor lifestyle that lends itself to a thirst quenching drink the growing hispanic population could be a major area of growth for the squirt brand squirt needs to advertise on the major spanish language television stations telemundo and univision they also need to revisit their distribution strategies in the emerging hispanic markets since hispanics like to shop in mom and pop markets they need to have the products available there they also need to make sure that the advertising message fits in with the hispanic preference for reality based real world messagesconclusioncase volume for major carbonated grapefruit  citrus flavored brandseach company respectively has numerous brands that it sales these top brands account for almost  of soft drink sales in the united states dr pepperseven up inc owns two of the top ten brands sold colas are the dominant flavor in the us carbonated soft drink industry however popularity for flavored soft drinks has grown in recent years the changing demographics of the us population have been an important factor in the growing popularity of these flavored soft drinksfive squirt bottlers account for  of sales these bottlers are located in los angeles chicago detroit san diego and portland a total of  bottlers account for half of the squirt case volume with these bottlers located predominantly in the western us california alone is responsible for  of the total squirt case volume dpsu current targeting approach years oldsquirt is diet squirt is squirt doesnt have any bottlers in the northern states of america the states with the largest population of hispanics are california texas  new yorktargetingnarrow the segment age from  to people choose their favorite drinks between the ages of place a bottler in new york to maximize opportunities in the northern states  a bottler in texas to lower unnecessary expenses advertise strictly to the hispanic culture instead of being multiculturalthe suggestion by fcb to target a multicultural younger segment was supported by recent information provided by the us census  according to the census the hispanic population in the united states increased by  from  million in  to  million in  this was compared to an increase of  for the total us population hispanics accounted for  of the us population while african americans accounted for  of the us population with  million people  of the hispanic population is under  years old this means that a possible  of this demographic may fall into our target segment that is above  years old   total hispanic population hispanics may possibly make up the new target segment this number is assuming that the rest of the population falls between the ages of   which is not likely  of african americans were under the age of  while   were under  from this we can conclude that   falls within the range of  year olds   total african american population african americans could possibly fall within squirts target market assuming that the makeup of each demographic is correct squirt stands to have a total possible market of hispanic segment african american segment people that are from the hispanic and african american communities in which to target targeting these markets could be very beneficial if they continue to grow in the future compared to competitors squirts advertising expenditures are typically lower combined expenditures for advertising and promotion amount to  of total dollar sales a breakdown of sales compared to dollar spent on advertising can be seen below total volume sales for  squirt regulardiet advertising squirt ruby red advertising   units per dollar spent on advertising the above figure shows that for
