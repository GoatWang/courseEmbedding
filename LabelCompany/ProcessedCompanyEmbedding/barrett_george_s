you may have thank you and now i would like to turn the call over to cardinal health chairman and ceo george barrett george george barrett thanks sally good morning and thanks for joining us this morning its an important day for all of us here at cardinal health as you saw in our press release weve announced the definitive agreement to acquire some of the assets of medtronic for clarification these product lines were part of the patient recovery business in medtronics patient monitoring and recovery division but some of you might also know these product lines as indiscernible medical supplies plus their compression businesses as we talk about the business today we refer to this as the patient recovery business this is the product line that has been in our radar for many years the business which we have always felt would be in strong and confident hands at cardinal health given our strategic focus and extremely important to our customer base the product categories embedded in this transaction fit naturally into the work that were doing across the continuum of care from acute care to service centers to longterm care into the retail setting and even to the consumer these are product areas and channels with which we have anonymous experience going all the way back to our legacy in american hospital supply what does this acquisition do for you one it broadens and deepens our reach particularly the or the er the nursing station and the prosecute facility and the products stand side by side with the products we already produce and source in many ways these are the staples of the health care delivery system two our ability to operate such a broad line of products and services allows our customers to standardize reducing redundancy and improving efficiency three the scale that some of these products bring to our manufacturing facilities and the addition of some very high quality manufacturing operations heavily weighted in the us will help us reduce cost four these products with some important household names like curity and kendall improve our connection to our customers and patients and stand for quality at a time when quality matters five this expands our reach in product lines in global markets offering us the opportunity to leverage some of the capabilities weve been building in our international quartos operations six the addition of the patient recovery portfolio improved the balance of our overall enterprise which is so important at a time of great change seven the transaction is highly accretive while noting that in the first full year we will have to absorb in the inventory step up as we did with the quartos acquisition and we expect synergies to be in excess of  million exiting fy  eight this business is highly stable and generates strong cash flows nine we will bring more than  talented associates into the cardinal health family and our leadership team with decade of experience with these products and customers we have a long standing and strong relationship with medtronic and appreciate that we are working getting us to this stage they are a valued partner and we look forward to working even more closely with their team going forward particularly in that well be providing some ongoing services to one another this acquisition of the patient recover portfolio continues a journey that we embarked on some eight years ago that journey is focused on bring efficiency quality and safety to healthcare system undergoing meaningful changes every line of business in which we compete is valuable in todays environment and perhaps even more important as our population ages these businesses will be increasingly valuable as healthcare continues to evolve toward a more patientcentered value based system this portfolio increases the relevant to these offerings and in fact adds an element of patient familiarity that will only serve to reinforce the strength of our brand with that in mind the picture of cardinal health today looks quite a bit different than you saw in  our customer base is larger the mix of our product lines is broader deeper and more balanced our geographic footprint is considerably larger and our capabilities in talent base is significantly stronger today we are one of the very few companies in the healthcare space who can address both the pharmaceutical and the medical sides of the industry with that as the overall framework i would like to make a few comments about the second press release we issued this morning in this release we provided some commentary on the balance of our fiscal  and some early thoughts on our expectations for our fiscal  which begins on july  as many of you know we haven’t yet reported our third quarter of fy  but as we absorbed the planning around this acquisition we have taken considerable time to analyze the overall environment and model our portfolio we do not have a finished budget for fy and as you know we typically provide more detailed information about the upcoming year in our august report having said that we do have some general observation which we felt were important to share with you at this stage we expect to see continued strong growth in our specialties solutions group and increasingly important line of business given what is happening in pharmaceutical innovation we are very pleased to have grown this business to more than  billion in annual revenues and are extremely excited about our capabilities here and our growths prospects going forward as you have seen over this past year we are continuing to experience very solid growth across the board in our medical segment we have virtually all lines business outperforming the market this is a strongest fundamental performance that we have seen in the medical segment at any time during my tenure our medical surgical business is growing its customer base our broad line of cardinal health products is increasing in size and gaining penetration we are expanding our ability to serve patients in the home and are working prosecutes acute and discharge management is growing fast and creating real value for our customers and the addition of the patient recovery product lines will be a major contributor to our growth plans our pharmaceutical distribution business is however going through a challenging phase and let me put this in some context we have seen in the last few years and are likely to see in the coming years breakthroughs that will change the life of patient and their families we are proud to be a part of process helping to bring this medicine to patients and in our role as pharmaceutical distributor we are indispensable in making this happen efficiently and safely and of course we will expect to be compensated fairly for this value at the same time the public discourse around access and price is important i know that many of my collogues around the pharmaceutical industry wrestle with the tension between funding the innovation necessary to create these breakthrough and making sure these products are accessible to the patients who need them meet them each company has its own view as to how best reconcile this at the same time the generic segment of the industry is going through its own dynamics generic manufactures are working hard to bring more affordable medicines into the market while competing at a stage of the lifecycle where reimbursement pressures are significant and at a time where there is low in the number of branded products losing patent expiration  patent protection excuse me and while the opportunities is to launch biosimilar and even generic biologics offers exciting future promise this part of the industry is still at an early stage of evolution so how does this translate practically to us based on the market conditions we see today particularly around pricing we expect to finish our fiscal  at the bottom of the guidance we provided in february acknowledging that this is still very early in our annual budgeting process we are modelling cautiously for  given the overall pricing environment and at least  per share of cardinal health specific headwinds approximately half of which flow through to the pharmaceutical segment given this our early model to suggests that our pharmaceutical segment could be down high single digits nest year mike will cover this in more detail in his commentary mike brings a unique perspective given his history leading our pharmaceutical business let me be clear here we are seeing the vast majority of a business lines growing and our revenues are strong our pharmaceutical distribution business continues to grow its units as a strong and stable customer base as an outstanding driver of long term value in that outsourcing and is an excellent generator of working capital but the sheer size of the pharmaceutical distribution will have a disproportionate impact on the overall performance of the enterprise in the near term based on this we could see nongaap earnings per share flat to down midsingle digits in fiscal  recognizing that we will have to absorb the inventory stepup from this acquisition these are not the kind of numbers youve come to expect in cardinal health nor are the number we expect of ourselves we have been and are taking the actions necessary to bring efficiencies for business at the same time however we are committed to investing in critical initiatives that will help drive and sustain our growth over the long term we are still refining our numbers but we felt that it was important to give you additional clarity and transparency around our current expectations let me brighten the picture somewhat looking beyond  and into  we expect cardinal healths nongaap earnings per share to grow at least in the high single digits on a business which has a better margin profile is even more balanced has a broader geographic footprint and its driven by an organization not only possessing worldclass supply chain capabilities but also an organization with deep clinical expertise and strong analytical tools this is what we are were saying right now and has been are approach with you we want it to be as plain speaking as we could make no mistake we continue to be extremely positive about overall portfolio and our prospect for growth our enterprise is enhanced with the acquisition of the patient recovery business our lines of business are on the right side of healthcare we are extremely  we are executive extremely well we are very efficient at generating cash and we are well positioned in the market there is a lot to digest today so i’ll turn the call over to mike who will walk you through the mechanics of the acquisition and our early thoughts on fiscal  and  mike mike kaufmann thanks george and good morning everyone as you would expect we are excited about the transaction we announced this morning as george noted weve had our eye on this product portfolio for many years and know we can create meaningful value with it ill come back to the acquisition in a few minutes but let me first discuss our other press release from this morning which addresses the balance of our year and some early thoughts on our fiscal  and  i know this is top of mind for all of you and so i want to address it upfront let me begin by reminding you that it is very unusual for us to try to give any kind of guidance this early we haven’t yet reported our third quarter of fiscal  but in light of todays acquisition announcement and given our current insights into the pharmaceutical distribution market we felt it was important to provide you with some early thoughts during my second quarter prepared remarks i noted the most significant moving parts for the second half would be generic market pricing taxes and brand inflation taxes are expected to be better than anticipated and brand inflation slightly lower generic market pricing while less deflationary than what we saw in the first half is still lower than we modeled based on this dynamic we are revising our generic drug pricing assumption from high single digit deflation to low double digit deflation for the full fiscal year as a consequence of that we now expect a fullyear  nongaap earnings per share from continuing operations to be at the bottom of our previously communicated guidance range of  to  with the eps update attributable to expected fourth quarter results we will provide you with more details on our third quarter earnings call scheduled for may st moving on id like to share our preliminary thoughts on our expectations for the year ahead using the bottom of our fiscal  nongaap earnings per share guidance range as a base we are currently modeling fiscal  nongaap earnings per share to be flat to down midsingle digits let me provide some color we continue to expect excellent growth across most of our businesses including doubledigit growth in specialty solutions and nuclear the medical segment profit even before factoring in the impact of todays proposed acquisition is expected to grow at least in the high single digits however the impact of several discreet items in addition to ongoing dynamics in generic market pricing will create significant headwinds let me take a minute to talk about these discreet items which can be bucketed in the four areas first in fiscal  we have had a number of positive discreet tax items in addition we recorded a number of favorable reserve adjustments none of which individually were significant we do not expect these items to repeat next year second as it is normally our practice our models for fiscal  will include assumptions that we fund employee incentive compensation at targets which creates a headwind versus our assumed actual for fiscal  third during fiscal  we expect to make incremental investments in areas that we believe will be valuable and important to our longterm strategic positioning fourth we continue to invest in our multiyear information system refresh in the pharmaceutical segment over the last several months our initial launch efforts for this project have been very successful in several key areas thus depreciation expense begin this quarter as the system became operational this expense combined with next years investments in indiscernible will create a headwind for fiscal  this it system refresh is critical to our pharmaceutical distribution customers it will enable us to maintain the excellent service they have come to expect from cardinal health provide us with the ability to expand in a cost efficient manner and better enable enterprise behavior in total these four areas will create a headwind of at least  per share or about  percentage points of growth note that about half of these discrete item pertain specifically to the pharmaceutical segment while the remainder apply to taxes with the medical segments on top of these discreet items we expect generic inflation to moderate from low double digit this year to midsingle digits in fiscal  which still creates a headwind for the pharmaceutical segment while there are a lot of moving parts and there is still work to be done when we take into account all of these items we are currently modeling the pharmaceutical segment to be down high single digits and medical to be up significantly resolving in total company earnings per share of flat to down midsingle digit again i would remind you that it is very early in our planning processes and we would not normally provide our preliminary thoughts on next year at this time our fourth quarter fiscal  call later this year when we have complete our budget process we will share more specific details about our fiscal  guidance and segment assumption looking towards fiscal  and beyond let me give you some thought on why we believe the growth trajectory of the companys nongaap eps will be at least in the high single digits first we expect the pharmaceutical segment profit to grow in the low to midsingle digits this will be accomplished through a combination of continued strong growth in specialty solution and nuclear as well as work in our pharmaceutical distribution business to better balance a generic deflation area environment with customer reprising brand and generic sourcing and improved mix this is an incredibly resilient business and im confident we can make the needed changes next on the medical side when you combine the strong growth in the distribution postacute and service business with the accretion synergies and scale from the planned acquisition we expect significant growth both segments as well as corporate will stay disciplined on expenses but not be afraid to invest for the future and we will continue to have a balanced approached to capital deployment we plan to continue to invest in our businesses maintain a  to  dividend payout ratio and balance as appropriate ma and stock repurchases note that our outlook for high single digits growth assumes share repurchases roughly equal to dilution from options hopefully this helps paint a picture for fiscal  and beyond now lets turn back to the planned acquisition as i mentioned before we have evaluated this opportunity for some time and like the rest of our team im excited for it to become part of our world class portfolio since george has provided the strategic rational ill cover the deal valuation and financing plans as you know we are acquiring the patient recovery business of medtronic for  billion in cash and expect cash tax benefits of at least  million thus we anticipate the net price to be slightly less than  billion we intend to finance the acquisition with the combination of  billion in new senior unsecured noted and existing cash on hand we have secured bridge financing but plan to issue public debt to fund the transaction prior to closing we do not intend to draw on the bridge facility we will be monitoring the debt markets and well be ready to execute the best possible financing to secure attractive financing cost for the company given our current ratings the margin accretion is strong cash flows of the new business our commitment to repay  billion of this debt over the next three years and our long history of prudent capital deployment we fully expect to delever to an adjusted debt to nongaap ebitda ratio of slightly greater than two times by the end of fiscal  the planned acquisition of the patient recovery business will add a robust earnings contributor to cardinal health we expect this transaction to provide at least  of accretion to our nongaap eps in fiscal  this assumes a first quarter fiscal  closing and inventory step up of approximately  million and interest expense from the incremental financing of up to  per share subject to change based on our ultimate bond pricing and tax rate remember due to the requirements of purchase accounting we will need to revalue inventory to its fair value which will result in an unfavorable impact to cost of sales we expect this step up to occur during the first couple of quarters post close we will be sure to provide update to these assumptions as actuals become available in fiscal  nongaap eps accretion should rise to more than  per share and continue to grow from there one driver of its earnings contribution will be synergies by the end of fiscal  we assume operational synergies will exceed  million annually from the gaap perspective its too early in the process to provide any specific guidance on the intangible asset amortization once the transaction closes and the fair value estimates are complete we will provide additional details any amortization will of course be included in our future gaap results but excluded from the nongaap financial consistent with our past practice now ill walk you through the closing process at a high level the support of successful integration our experienced team will work with the highly knowledgeable patient recovery business team to operate this business both in the us and globally outside the us there will be back office transition support from medtronic that will help us to stand up these businesses without interruption in addition medtronic will provide extended manufacturing facility support in some locations furthermore as part of our agreement we will be providing two medtronic some manufacturing and service support while we will ensure optimal business cautionary and efficiency our general objective is to transition the various function to our complete control as quickly as possible thus the timelines for transition and the length of the agreements governing this support functions will vary the patient recovery business will be reported in our medical segment and based on the margin profile of the planned acquisition and assuming there are no other changes in mix we are confident we will meet or exceed our medical segment target margin rate of  in summary this acquisition is a good strategic cultural and financial fit it creates scale and is one we feel confident we can execute on as it is at the core of what we do well today we expect our entire company along with our customers partners and shareholders to see sustainable benefits from this transaction let me close with two thoughts first we always want to be as transparent and clear as we can be i hope you found this information helpful second i am convinced we are doing the right things at the right pace and are positioned well for the future i want to thank you for your time and participation today and we will now turn the call over to sally for qa sally curley kyle lets open the call for qa as you could just make couple of remarks questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and we will take our first question from charles rhyee with cowen  co charles rhyee george when we think about the business that you are taking on and when we think about couple of years i know you guys were  had your eye on it is everything in this business today what you had been looking for or is there anything that medtronic is keeping that was in the convenient business that you might have thought you could have guide back then which you are not getting today thanks george barrett actually this turns out to be the portfolio we really hoped we would have access to as you know its been part of a couple of different companies and so we are really thrilled that these lines are the lines that fit cardinal health they are sort of down the middle for us so we are pretty excited about that mix sally curley next question operator we will take our next question from lisa gill from jp morgan lisa gill first congratulation i think this is good deal but i just really wanted to ask as specific around the guidance and the thoughts around generic pricing going into  can you talk about what visibility you have at this point and mike i think you talked about repricing in the market place is this still highly competitive especially in the independents and with the gpos is that what you were talking about or taking about pricing especially on the generic side going into next year mike kaufmann yes thanks lisa for the question i’ll step back as you know we have mentioned earlier the year that what we saw early in the year was a lot more deflation area than we expected and then when we started to see was some improvement into december january timeframe and so what we mentioned last time we spoke we said it was a little early to tell you what that meant as far as a trend but that it was not quite as same as what we saw in the fall and so that is what we were seeing its still competitive it will always be a competitive marketplace but what were seeing as far as on the sellside to the customers and i think you are about right and mainly in that independent resell space its still a little bit more aggressive than we had modeled which is again better than what we saw and thats what causing our discussions around both fy and why we want to give you some thoughts around fy operator and we will take our next question from eric percher with barclays eric percher again congrats on the acquisition but i think i want to focus on the pharma side last quarter you came out with what was a fairly unique definition of generic deflations i know they includes both the manufacturer side and your sellside could you talk a little bit about how much that steps down from the prior guidance is what you are seeing with the manufacturers versus you’re the comment you just gave us on the sellside and also i think youve talked about your secondary business given your insight into the market place how much of this is impact from secondary versus kind of primary george barrett yes thanks for the question yes i would say this is more on the customer sellside than on the manufacturer side we still continue to see the type of launches and deflation that we were expecting from manufacturers and we still continue to see excellent performance from red oak to be able to go out and work with our manufacturing partners to make sure that were having an excellent cost position so i still feel very good about what they are doing so this is where really the sellside downstream to the customers is still a little bit more than weve modeled again it’s getting better than what we saw and i think hopefully the market is beginning to understand this dynamic and as i also mentioned in my script there is a lot of different levers that we have to think that are coordinated which is more than just red oak which would be also making sure that we drive our mix making sure that we execute our launches really well make sure that our pricing is exactly where we need it to be but again overall it is a deflationary environment and we expect this year to be down low double digits and next year our early look is that we would be in the midsingle digits in a total deflationary environment operator we will take our next question from ross muken with evercore isi ross muken i want to stick on the pharma business because it seems like thats where all the questions already i know obviously a great transaction helps us understand  again im not asking for longterm guidance but obviously we talked about the trajectory in the  help us understand the cadence or the assumptions that go into your view of how pharma will trend throughout  and then the jumpoff into  and what is some of the key points they are looking for to kind of get confidence that that business which has been under pressure now for  to  and  months depending on how long the declines last your assumptions for that returning to even flattish growth or a flattish results or maybe even modest growth what sort of needs that happen in the end market environment how many of those sort of discreet items truly are discreet for this year and then maybe the growth next year were just trying to compartmentalize again i had realize giving my growth percent numbers im not looking for but more directionally and qualitatively help us think about that cadence the ramp and then the confidence in sort of the components in  and beyond george barrett ross its george why don’t you let mike start and then i can jump in mike kaufmann thanks george its little again early to give you tones of detail because that something for sure well do on our fourth quarter call is well give you a lot more clarity around that but let me see if i can help first of all i think its important to note about the  one timers or i call discrete items probably is actually a better word and what i mean by those is that let me just walk you through them some of them were as i mentioned in my script was the tax and reserve adjustments and what these are is we had some favorable onetime tax items that again we could have favorable items next year or unfavorable items next year or this year but so far through this year weve been in a net favorable tax position which generally means our tax rates is a little lower this year than we would expect it to be all the things being equal for next year because of these individual discreet tax items and then we always have  every single quarter we have a lot of individual adjustments to various reserves that we would have some will go favorable some will go unfavorable and this year what weve seen is the netting of all those reserve adjustments again none of them individually significant which is why you haven’t heard us talk about any of them on the individual quarters but when we take a look at then as we were trying to put some work together for everyone the net of all those net is to be a positive item that we felt was important to combine with the tax and call that out that would be the largest item of that  those combine and then after that it’s the other thing i mentioned which would be concentration related adjustments based on what we’re performing this year where we go back to our normal practice accruing at  investment that we plan to make next year in the business because we were very disciplined this year around managing our invests and we see some areas next year that we think will be important and that well invest in the business and then our team modernization it project which weve been talking about for about over a year that would have five or so year plan on the scheduled investments that were making that and the cost that were associated with that were part of it so those are first of all the elimination those is an important thing then let me talk about the positive things that when you don’t have the yearoveryear from those discrete items we continue to feel excellent about specialty in nuclear were in both of those business in the p segment are going to continue to grow significantly the acquisition alone in  will add a least  if you assume that it added at least  than it would growth of  so that’s going to grow at least  than the medical core growth has been excellent so even if you take out the acquisition what medical has been doing with services distribution the postacute space add home weve got a lot of good initiatives that business is going to continue to grow well and then finally the former distribution team im confident theyre going to do the thing they need to do so an excellent group as you know ive worked with many of those over the years and theyve got a lot of work on around models brand and generic sourcing and mix management that i think are going to be driver so george just let me kick it back to you for comments george barrett yes ross let me just add little bit to this we sort of got to get through this reset is sort of the way we see it in terms of the price and as mike said some onetimers revenues are strong our customer base is strong and weve got limited big renewal exposure our enterprise selling is creating value across both segments red oaks sourcing is a really powerful engine so i think we feel very good about that really what happened is as we came to this announcement and we got our early role outs we just wanted to be transparent about what we were seeing and i think it was important for us to do that but i think our longterm view about the pharma distribution business is quite optimistic we think its an important business for the market for our customers and for us so that’s sort of the general perspective id give on this operator we will take our next question from michael cherny with ubs michael cherny good morning guys and thank you for all the details so far i know its a lot about the pharma questions so ill ask a question on the medical side as you think about integrating the business and you think about the synergy captured you have the strategic rational you have how do you think about the continued evolution of the medical segments in terms of positioning whats a growing private label selfbranded products and how you sell that both within your own channel as well as through other channel partners and how you position that appropriately so you are not offending some of your other supplier relationships while also positioning it appropriately within some of the other channel partners given that obviously these are not product that you want to keep simply within the cardinal medical customer base mike kaufmann so michael let me start and don is here and id really love don to sort of kick in so let me just do it real quickly first of all just as a reminder we do report in two segments but increasingly the way that we  the value proposition that we offer to customers is about the overall portfolio and that is incredibly important at a time where there is a lot of change in conversions the second thing i would say to you and ive said this in a number of public settings is that we often find throughout our business we have business partner with whom we compete on one aspect of business but where we partner on other or were a supplier to one our customer of another so we are sort of used to dealing at this point with an environment in which our business partners and cardinal health know each other well and we help navigate those things but let me let don just sort of give you a little bit more framework on the overall medical side i just wanted to make sure i highlighted that we really work together at pharma and med go ahead don don casey i think it’s a great question first look we believe these brands as well as cardinal health brand can be pushed out internationally as well as to other channels here within the specific acute channel today where we start as on the foundation of an outstanding distribution company we have to make that distribution process relevant our national brand partners and we believe dayin and dayout we offer an outstanding distribution service that gives them cost efficiency it makes them more affective with their customers and as long as we are doing that as we will be providing novel solution and providing them value we expect to be able to work with them in a number of different ways as we look out over the next couple of years and we integrate this business i think we view yourselves as a solutions company not as a product company not as a distribution company and that service that we provide to national brands is relevant most importantly to our acute care customers so when we go to an acute care customer we can say look we have a broad portfolio of products and services that we provide and we are also helping bring efficiency in the system through some of our national brand partners so we look at that model as sustainable and providing excellent growth because it delivers value to all parts of the chain  all parts of the value creation chain mike kaufmann mike ill just add to that those acute care partners are often a highlyintegrated system now and so our ability to work across their whole system as don said it just turbo charges the value proposition operator and we will take our next question from steven valiquette with bank of america merrill lynch steven valiquette just curious on the revised guidance on pharma distribution and generic deflation does this assume that you are maintaining your market share within the independent retail pharmacy customer base and just the profitability is being lowered again or are you assuming maybe some customer attrition within that independent retail category george barrett no we are assuming that we will maintain our share and its just that as you said our profitability would be squeezed a little bit as we work through the transition to begin to drive other opportunities like mix and more share of wallet and those types of things steven valiquette okay i mean there are some independent retailer gpo mergers that seem to be happen in the market place i am wondering if that was playing a role in your revision as well but it sounds like that’s not really a factor george barrett no we don’t really see that at least so far with the ones that have happen is any factor for us specifically thank you operator we will take our next question form john kreger with william blair john kreger question for don don can you give us a sense about how many of your big idm customers have sort of embraced your cardinal branded product strategy and where you would hope to take that penetration over the next few years don casey so to be specific in that question if you look at within our channel and we define it within our channels is where we are the prime distributor the penetrates has been excellent and as weve rolled out expanded  our expanded product portfolio i would say that its almost every one of them that were a prime distribution partner with them has embraced either some point of product or service as in an expanded way now that we offer them more importantly overtime we look to expand our channel and with wins that we have that win talked about like kaiser permanente you can begin to see that we are looking to expand our channel and once we build that distribution relationship than you can have the different kind of conversation with those idm  this integrated idm partners about what services whether theyre pharmaceutically based whether they are about postacute space or other areas we can have those conversation expanded not everyone takes every single thing that we offer but what we are finding is that the broader portfolio certainly gives us a number of different touch points within this integrated idms that we like to thing make this more relevant to them and really a partner in how they are going to approach this huge transition of them going from feeforservice to a feepervalue george barrett and jon i would add i think the opportunity expands that share of wallet is really there particularly as we add more product lines and todays announcement helps us operator we will take our next question from ricky goldwasser with morgan stanley ricky goldwasser so one question and one follow up first mike going back to your prepared remarks i think you said high single digit eps growth would apply to fiscal  and beyond is this in your long terms guidance for high single digit eps growth is it sustainable long term guide for the combined business that’s question one and question two when we think about the pharma distribution margins the guide that you give today implies distribution margins with contract back to about where you were in  back in the envelop we get to around   so is that the right context for us to think about where distribution margin should go to a stable should we go back to that kind of period prior to generic inflation environment and prior to the relation with red oak it seems that now we might have to give some of that upside back to your clients thank you george barrett thanks ricky for the question there are just so many moving parts and the business is so different today than it was in  i think its really hard to talk about at oneforone type of trade when you look at mix on schedules pricing the way that feeforservice model has changed and so at this point i really cant make any comments on where we would expect the pharma distribution margin rates to settle out thats something well take a look at and consider when we give more color around our  guidance and our  information when we get to our fourth quarter call but as far as the longterm guidance and whether saying that  will be at least high single digits and whether you should interpret that as our new longterm guidance its still just the little bit too early also for that thats something that again were going to evaluate over the longterm and take a look at and will come out with some more clarity at our fourth quarter call we were just trying to give you some color here so knowing what we talked about it in  we felt it important to give you at least some insight into  for now mike kaufmann and again just todays call wasn’t really meant to update longterm guidance were trying to provide some clarity on  and we have some visibility on  at this stage and will go to our budget process and then normal course will continue to provide information as we look at our longterm perspective operator thank you will take our next question from robert willoughby with credit suisse robert willoughby capex you to envisioned the medtronic assets will add to your business and can you speak to any synergys outside of the  that you mentioned from reducing inventory stock or bricks and mortar investments here george barrett yes thanks for the question bob yes couple of comments about the new acquisition first of all it is a very nice cash generating business as i mentioned in my prepared remarks the margin rates are obviously very accretive to us and this will help us meet or exceed our  goal from medical the synergies are for the most basis theyre cost based synergies we do feel there are some revenue synergies obviously as you heard don talked earlier we tend to have accounts when we have a distribution business we penetrate our cardinal brand and very well this will now be part of the cardinal brand portfolios so we would expect some revenue synergies but the  i talked about was the vast majority there was cost synergies which we would be looking at all the various avenues and that you can get at whether it would be a supply chain sourcing cost and all those types of things we feel really good about being able to execute on those based on where we are at today robert willoughby whats your annual capex mike kaufmann yes on capex obviously when we inhered a series of manufacturing assets weve got to evaluate where they fit but our modeling of this does include a significant chunk of capex in two areas both from the manufacturing as well as some of the business are a little bit different in terms of the pump business as a rental business so thats kind of how we are looking at it george barrett yes well definitely gets you a little bit more color on that as we move forward because we haven’t yet had a chance to really as you can imagine getting to the weaves of on each one of the facilities and meet with the team to understand their needs i don’t have any concerns that there will still be a net cash generating business for sure after capex but we still have a little bit of work there to do to give you a little bit of color on that operator we will take our next question from matt dellelo with leerink partners matt dellelo mike can you give us a little bit more color around the sellside pressure for example it was my understanding that they were really like five large gpos on independent side that reprised maybe six months to a year ago do they reprise again or where there terms in those contracts that caused the selling rates to come in sort of below expectation and then is there risk that seeing sort of the same thing happened in six months and did this potentially reprising challenge spread to other segments of the market like some of the large chains or position groups or hospitals something like that thanks a lot mike kaufmann let me see if i can help out a little bit there first of all i would say that as weve mentioned for the spreading as you say to the other if that really happened earlier in the year but the rest of it it was pretty quick i don’t think thats really what’s causing this year as far as the overall reprising of those agreements again a lot of that happened earlier in the year so i think that’s would flow through but as weve said before generics are spot market and so you don’t fix a price and have the same price for    years the length of the contract you will set your rebates in a base price but then every day you got to be competitive in the market place and so what were really seeing now is just the normal day to day competitiveness in that generic market place that you have to have to be able to compete and maintain your share and we again as i mentioned earlier full expect to maintain our share and well do what it takes to do that and luckily were in a great cost position to do that were just seeing a little bit more pressure on that side on that daytoday reprising than we anticipated but i don’t see any really big reprising coming or that being the cause of what im talking about here george barrett david its george the only thing i would add to that it you also probably you working of a sort of a lower base so i think part of that work is essentially we have to go through this reset in the fall and that’s part of i think whats at work operator we will take our next question from eric coldwell with robert w baird eric coldwell so thanks for the comments on the independent and not seeing major reprising comings in general i do want to add on to that do you have any customer losses that would be notable or work calling out built into your fiscal  outlook number one number two what is your brand inflation outlook given that you highlighted that maybe you slightly over modeled that again here in the fiscal  whats your brand pricing outlook for  thanks george barrett i guess first of all from a customer prospective note we don’t have any wins or loses baked into those  numbers we feel were in great position with our customers today and i really modeling that to be a factor one where the other and as far as the brand pricing its just a little bit early to give you what were modeling my guess is we probably wont model anything higher then what we see this year when we complete the year but whether we model a little bit lower we were trying to give ourselves a little bit of conservatives in our numbers to be able to model that if we wanted to a little bit lower than where we were but again even if we do model it a little bit lower as ive mentioned we plan to continue to move to even a higher percentage to the feeforservice agreement and would expect that overtime that brand impact would continue to decrease so again the real driver of  besides the one time discreet items is really the generic deflation not our thoughts on brand operator we will take our final question form garen sarafian with citi garen sarafian mike and george thank you for all the commentary on the sellside you guys have mentioned in the past that its difficult to model generic pricing and its very dynamic but is there anything more just on a broad level as to what specifics function just changed you mentioned just a slightly more pricing but was it mix in the generic was it a certain region of the country that you were expecting a pricing structure that changed or just sort of a delta between where you were at before and in broad terms versus now and then a quick follow up is with your agreement with cvs and red oak there was a step up in the payments that were being made from cardinal because you were exceeding benchmarks and targets so just curious is there a call back at all at any point where depending on whats going with the jv that you would start to pay less just curious if you could elaborate on that thanks mike kaufmann good questions on the red oaks ill cover it first just because its easy you know there is no call back that is now mix which is a positive thing because there actually are metric around that is around our ability to sustain savings and stuff and we still feel great about that the folks at red oaks continue to just do fabulous work the relationship with cvs couldn’t be stronger and i wouldnt any of this on red oaks indiscernible knowing everything that we ask i would say you know the one thing i probably haven’t mentioned and might be a little bit helpful on the generics is there are a discreet set of some item within the generics that were probably not probably that we saw some greater deflation this year so they were items that had limited competition at the beginning of the year they were more expensive type of generic items we saw some additional competition on those items this year from generic manufacturers which i think than created some deflation in the market a lot of those items we think of settle out to areas where we don’t expect to deflation on those few key items to be the same as next year and so that’s one of the reasons why we believe next year we wont see the same level of deflation that we saw particularly early this year because those few key items wont be out there having that same impact george barrett so before we finish up let me just add real quickly its an important question and i think we are being completely transparent here we actually feel really good about that business pricing has been lower than we expected as we looked in our core models and that in the onetimers as mike said primary as the dynamic customer retention is good strength the back base strength of red oak we feel very good about that so we are really trying to be as transparent as we can on this so i hopefully that’s clear i think we are going to finish up the call so let me just do this i would like to thank everyone for joining us today we will look forward to speaking to all of you again soon actually on our may  earnings call if you have any questions on todays release please reach out to our ir team thank you all for your time

calendars about the corporation  the corporation of brown university skip navigation information for current students faculty staff families alumni friends  neighbors brown university about the corporation the authority and responsibilities of the corporation a bicameral body composed of a board of fellows with twelve members and a board of trustees with fortytwo are set forth in the charter of the university granted by the colony of rhode island and providence plantations in  it is our fixed star we can do nothing that contradicts its prohibitions or transgresses its grants of power states henry wriston in the structure of brown university the charter originally provided for a twelvemember board of fellows and a board of trustees of thirtysix it provided further that eight of the fellows should always be baptists and the rest indifferently of any or all denominations the president was always to be a fellow and always a baptist of the thirtysix trustees the charter provided that twentytwo should be baptists five quakers four congregationalists and five episcopalians in  the charter was amended to provide for six additional trustees bringing the board of trustees to its present number of fortytwo these six were to be elected without regard to denominational or religious affiliations at the same time the qualification that the president must be a baptist was removed in  a further amendment to the charter removed all denominational qualifications for service on the corporation of the  trustees  are elected by alumni pursuant to an agreement between the corporation and the alumni association  these  trustees include the current and two past brown alumni association chairs and eleven others elected to six year terms  the rest of the trustees called term trustees are nominated by the committee on trustee vacancies  careful selection of internally appointed trustees and those elected through the alumni ensures that corporation members have the professional and personal backgrounds needed to meet their fiduciary and oversight responsibilities the statutes of the corporation provide that each person elected to the board of trustees shall serve no more than two nonconsecutive six year terms except in unusual circumstances election of both groups is by the full corporation  until  members of the board of fellows were elected for life since that time by action of the fellows they have been elected for terms of eleven years in may  the fellows established a limit of one term   in addition to the president who as stated above is always a fellow the charter provides for the election of corporation officers a secretary from the fellows and a chancellor a vice chancellor and a treasurer from the trustees  these officers form the senior administration committee which serves to advise the president review her performance annually and set goals for the coming year the full corporation meets three times a year — on a friday afternoon and saturday morning in october and february and on the thursday afternoon and friday morning before commencement in late may the thursday afternoon meeting is a strategic discussion session members of the corporation hear and discuss reports from the president the treasurer committee chairs and senior university officers the morning meeting which usually lasts about two hours is a formal business session attended only by current corporation members and senior university officers it is at this meeting that votes are passed the two boards meet concurrently with the same agenda the president presiding over the fellows and the chancellor over the trustees a motion may originate with either board and is discussed by both groups however any motion must first be passed by the board that presented the matter and then must receive the concurrence of the other board before it becomes a valid action the trustees never meet without the fellows the fellows however do meet without the trustees for the charter provides that adjudging and conferring the academical degrees    shall forever belong exclusively to the fellowship as a learned faculty it provides further that the instruction and immediate government of the college shall forever be and rest in the president and fellows or fellowship the fellows therefore meet separately to discharge their responsibilities for establishing degree requirements and voting degrees in practice matters regarding degree requirements are generally taken up first by the college curriculum council of the faculty then presented to the faculty for approval and finally approved by the fellows candidates for baccalaureate and advanced degrees are recommended by the faculty to the fellows honorary degrees are voted by the fellows after consultation with a facultystudent advisory committee a quorum of the corporation is twelve trustees and five fellows the charter also provides however for a minor quorum of four trustees and three fellows which may transact any business except the placing of a building and the selection of trustees fellows and the president the actions of the minor quorum must be ratified and confirmed by the full corporation at its next meeting the functions of the minor quorum are fulfilled by the advisory and executive committee consisting of the president chairman the chancellor the vice chancellor the secretary and the treasurer all ex officio and at least nine other members this committee meets no more than twice a semester to act on items that require timely approval or cannot wait until the next regular corporation meeting   in addition to the powers of the minor quorum the committee by action of the corporation is authorized to appoint faculty members in addition to the advisory and executive committee there are twelve other standing committees of the corporation covering various facets of the life and work of the university much of the work of the corporation is done through these committees and through ad hoc committees appointed from time to time the corporation has three main committees academic affairs budget and finance and campus life  each member of the corporation must serve on one of these committees the president chancellor vice chancellor treasurer secretary and the chair of the governance and nominating committee may serve on more than one of these committees  chairs are appointed by the governance and nominating committee for one year terms which are renewable for a maximum of six years  each of the corporation’s standing committees meets at least three times annually and submits an annual report to the corporation each corporation member is expected to attend as many meetings of the corporation as possible but in any case at least half of those held during his or her term of office if the minimum standard of attendance is not maintained over a twoyear period and there are no extenuating circumstances a member may be requested to resign if a member knows that he or she will be unable to attend meetings for a period the member may request a leave of absence from the secretary of the corporation members of the corporation serve without compensation but are reimbursed for their expenses if they so request most prefer to consider their expenses as a contribution to the university in  president simmons initiated a comprehensive review of governance structures  in  the corporation approved a major restructuring of its governance which reduced the number from  to  and size of its committees to ensure greater levels of engagement and accountability among members  the meeting schedules were reorganized to allow more time for meaningful strategic discussions and a regular schedule of committee reports to the full corporation was implemented  other engagement opportunities were created for alumni friends and former corporation members such as advisory and leadership councils which advise the president while the president as chief executive officer is responsible to the corporation she also as has been stated is a member and presiding officer of the board of fellows in general the corporation concerns itself with matters of policy and does not become involved in the daily administration of the university the corporation is responsible for selecting the president siting buildings setting the budget tuition and fees establishing policy and strategic plans appointing faculty and senior administrative officers and accepting gifts and naming opportunities for further information contact the corporation
