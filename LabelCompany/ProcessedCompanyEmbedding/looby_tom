over to thomas looby tom thomas looby thank you debbie and thanks everyone for dialing in to our call this afternoon this quarter had mixed results i am very satisfied with the progress that our team has made as we move along our path to become standard of care and our healthcare program and standard of use in our eksoworks program thanks to the teams hard work over the last quarters we have a lot of green shoots starting to rise up that we are confident will enhance the market and financial picture for ekso study data is up utilization in the clinic is up demos a lead indicator of future sales or rentals are up emeas team is rebuilding and we recently moved from introductory phase to commercial phase for our eksozerog mount system having said that i am not satisfied we as a company are not satisfied with the unit shipments of our ekso gt and our first quarter for me  units shipped is not satisfactory nor its sustainable and for two quarters in a row emea was particularly soft we are well aware of these that these are not the result that any of us are striving for i will go into rehabilitation sales and our intent and focus on the bottom line in more detail shortly but first a few notes on this quarter and our achievements we shipped  ekso gt units seven of which were sales we now have  medical devices in the field of which  were sold and  are under a rental agreement at  customers in north america and emea we have built strong sales analytics to make sure our sales force can be as efficient and effective as possible this includes tracking our funnel through the various stages of the sales cycle to understand the conversion rates and timing we have provided the opportunity for individuals who cannot take a step on their own to take over  million steps at more than  patient sessions we can track this because of our real time data capture system called eksopulse we have now signed up five centers with irb ph approvals in place in our important wise study this is the first randomized multicentered clinical trial within the exoskeleton industry we were the subject of a medical innovation briefing released by the national institute for health and care excellence in the united kingdom the institute specifically called out our proprietary smartassist software the technology which intelligently adjusts to a patient session at over sessions step after step we launched our centers of excellence peer to peer advocacy program and listing initial fourth centers from the us and another first in the industry to help us educate existing and potential customers on the clinical benefit and value proposition of the ekso gt now to what is happening on the sales front for the ekso gt a very important piece of our sales analytics process is understanding the indicators of uptake in this market and it is in how we are developing our pipeline we believe that the number of demos we perform at potential customers is one of the best and most reliable indicators of future sales with our particular focus over the last nine months and better understanding the customer we have seen our quarterly demos in the us grow from an average of approximately  demos per quarter prior to our fda clearance to  demos this past quarter in the us alone europe held  demos in the same quarter our target remains on track to reach  demos per quarter  in the us and  in emea by the end of  ultimately a successful direct sales rep is expected to place a minimum of one unit per month as we hone in on an optimal sales were also seeing the first signs of a shortening in the sales cycle prior to getting our label for stroke and spinal cord injury sales cycles range from  to  months now with our clearance in hand we are successfully informing a broader number of clinics about the use of our exoskeleton and this allows our sales people to be more focused and efficient on developing the allimportant demo and closing business as a result of these efforts our average sales cycle went below  months over the past quarter including two shipments that went from demo to sale within the quarter in our efforts to further identify the best customers for the ekso gt we are beginning pilot projects in the next few weeks with two leading postacute care companies to explore how the ekso gt can help them provide better clinical outcomes more efficiently within skilled nursing facilities based upon claims data we have analyzed a large number of stroke rehabilitation happens within skilled nursing facilities this we believe represents a large untapped market for ekso bionics of course an essential tool for our sales and marketing team is educating our market on the clinical data and results of using our products i was pleased to see that our recent clinical webinar we had over  participants learn about the rapidly growing body of clinical studies and away with the ekso gt in total there are currently  independent studies on the ekso gt  of which have been completed and  are still enrolling patients together these studies will include more than  participants overall some of the specific compelling outcomes observed include a  to  increase in dosage in stroke patients compared to standard physical therapy the most notable difference in dosage came at the first sessions  three feet walked ph in ekso versus seven feet walked in standard physical therapy improved gait parameter such as increased stride length decreased step width and improved symmetry on both affected and unaffected sides walking in ekso gt compared to gait training and current physical therapy improved gait speed balance motor activity and control and finally statistically significant improved functional independent motor scores from admission to discharge ultimately we believe that the outcomes with our device will reduce the cost to the healthcare system it is part of some of the studies underway to show cost reduction outcomes a big driver of clinical outcomes we believe relate to the ekso gt with our powerful smartassist software being a great rehabilitation tool that allows for early mobilization higher per session step count and more economically viable gait sessions smartassist enables therapist to use the ekso gt to rewire a patient central nervous system a concept known as neuroplasticity we now have had a number of customers share their experience where they have had a patient that they thought would never walk independently again go through their rehabilitation using the ekso gt and see that patient walk out of the device this is incredibly exciting for us and represents the fantastic potential of the technology ultimately our goal is to demonstrate that better health at discharge can help reduce the cost burden on healthcare systems through a reduction and readmissions and other costs associated with stroke and spinal cord injury in north america alone the cost to treat stroke is projected to more than double from  billion in  to  billion in  our ekso gt is the optimal tool to mitigate this along with our clinical evidence program we recently added a peer advocacy program our centers of excellence program the charter members are villa beretta in europe and inaudible good shepherd and inaudible in north america this program is the first of its kind peer to peer advocacy program to its some of our key customers and thought leaders can share their real life experiences with fellow clinics to discuss the clinical business and financial merits of using the ekso gt as a tool in rehabilitation on the industrial side this past quarter we went from what i would describe as an introductory phase to a commercial phase with our showing at world of concrete we began with our eksozerog mount system where we had sold close to  units and the customer base has broadened from a handful to over  we now have three manufacturing rep agencies signed and in total have  sales employees trained for the north american market and weve started to look at international markets as well we maintain our target to at least double sales in  from the  million we hit in  in addition we plan to introduce our ekso vest by the third quarter of this year this momentum affords us the opportunity to also proactively pursue strategic opportunities and partnerships to ensure eksoworks taps into what we believe is a significant business opportunity while minimizing our own cash investment in this area at this point id like to hand the call the max our cfo to talk about our financial results for the first quarter max schederbieschin thanks tom total reported revenue for q  was  million compared to  million in q  as a reminder the q  revenue number includes a  million onetime noncash recognition of previously deferred medical device revenue the breakdown for q  revenue is as follows we recognize approximately  in medical device and related revenue down from  million in q  while the unit placements this quarter were comparable to last year we shipped some units as rentals this quarter impacting revenue by approximately  we recognize approximately  million in eksoworks revenue compared with a  in the same period a year ago and in engineering services we recognize the last of our revenue from our soft exoskeleton project with darpa our overall gross profit for the quarter was  for gross margin of  this compares to a gross margin for the same period last year of  operating expenses for the first quarter  were  million compared to  million for the first quarter  the increase is driven by increases in clinical and marketing investments such as our company sponsored wise study and by an increase in rd investment to support our industrial and next generation whole mobility products net loss from operations for the quarter was  million as compared to  million net loss from operations in q  cash used in operating activities for the quarter was  million as compared to  million for q  as of march   we had a cash balance of  million not including the  million financing we announced april rd a few final observations for you before i hand the call to tom again one as tom mentioned were more actively tracking a number of sales metrics to better understand and develop our pipeline one such metric what we call qualified sales demos we will share going forward our  target is to average  demos per quarter split  between north america and emea this will be up significantly from the experience prior to our q  fda clearance two as you saw on our shipments we are seeing an increasing interest in ekso gt rentals to be clear these are short term rentals varying from  to  months with customers having the right to purchase the unit after the rental period this will represent a challenge for us to guide on revenue targets on the other hand this program might enable us to shorten the time line from first meeting to a close to accelerate unit placements todate we have placed  such rentals and in the last year we have seen all but one of these convert to a sale we currently have  rentals in the field and three as we focus our sales and marketing and our rd efforts over the coming quarters we are targeting a reduction in our cash burn to under  million per month by year end please see our accompanying earnings release and q for further details regarding the quarter and with that i will turn the call back to tom thomas looby thanks max the playbook for developing a medical market is quite clear build great products prove efficacy and safety for them win clearance and establish a growing utilization of the product while building up a body of clinical and economic evidence on the path to expanding uptake and winning coding coverage and then payment by the way i think its very much the same path for uptake in industrial markets where you also need great products you need to prove a value proposition and you need to win orders winning clearance from the fda for our targeted patient populations last year was a major breakthrough for us and for the industry its a strong starting point for the missionary work we are doing as a company to further develop the market in accordance with this playbook along the way there are bumps to endure and as we navigate those bumps we also continue to test our strategy we continually ask ourselves is the market real and does ekso bionics have a right to win what we are finding continues to validate our and others assertion for a large market opportunity consider a january  article in the economist which projects that physical therapist and physical therapist assistants as well as other rehabilitative healthcare professionals are projected to be among the fastest growing jobs in the us and for good reason society is getting older and will require more resources to rehabilitate and provide mobility solutions we assert that our technology will be used to leverage these scarce resources societies are getting older all over the globe in some places like china the craft of physical therapy is relatively new to this profession of physical therapy will grow but we believe that technologies like the ekso gt will be in demand driven by the scarcity of healthcare service providers in the coming years and in the industrial space we are experiencing not just the receptiveness to exoskeleton solutions for construction and assembly but an actual hunger to seek out solutions for jobs that have a higher safety risk as well as the need for productivity gains as we chart the course in this evolving industry in order to prove not only that the opportunity is real but that we offer the best solution we continue to emphasize clinical data that supports adoption and reimbursement powerful case study that demonstrate roi for the value proposition of this technology for the hospital and for the clinical team an effective and efficient sales team company operations intent on maximizing shareholders value and the right amount of technology to augment our customers drive for new standards and rehabilitation and on the workplace despite our q revenues in our rehabilitation business we remain abundantly confident in our platform product portfolio and strategy to continue building the best product for our markets we are looking forward to better predictability in accelerating unit placement growth throughout the remainder of  with that i will end our prepared remarks and look forward to your questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions first question is from imron zafar suntrust robinson humphrey please go ahead sir imron zafar i wanted to go a little bit into the performance in medical obviously the sequential trend was a little bit disappointing in terms of unit placement so i just wonder if you can talk a little bit more about that dynamics in that end market in terms of factors that may have impacted the performance whether it was executional or whether there was any impact from healthcare reform uncertainty competitive dynamics or just tom if you could just talk a little bit more about the performance in that business please thomas looby last week i spoke at an nih hosted meeting where several med tech companies were talking about the time from fda clearance to the time of significant market traction and i think that what ekso bionics is dealing with right now is sort of a traditional uptake so we won our clearance in the middle of  we knew very much what where all the patients were going the  clinics in the us etcetera and we were starting to do the broad education that stroke is important and its not just about spinal cord we thought that maybe wed be a little bit further along in that uptick in q because we had a very good q where we did see that uptick so i think its still there i think its still there i think its just some of that lumpiness what we started in q is really a deep dive on all the sales operational metrics what is the real pipeline look like it etcetera and we then are starting to focus on some ways to streamline that pipeline making it easier for people to procure or using that technology with rentals and leases and as max and i mentioned driving the allimportant demo we are seeing i think a pretty good yield when we do a demo it’s a matter of time and these are the programs that were going to really highlight moving forward in  imron zafar okay and then last quarter you had talked about expectations for ending the year with the placement runrate of about  units per month or  per quarter i wonder if that is still intact about that expectation or if you tampered that outlook thomas looby yes through this deep dive on our sales again in the yield that were seeing in demos we really like the building of that quality demo metric in q and certainly were focused on that in q and beyond so i think that we see that thats very much in focus for the us group i will say that in emea where we saw soft sales in q and q and we really had to rebuild that team over the past two quarters that theyre going to get to that rate to be sure but i think that we feel more confident about doing that the united states imron zafar okay and then the sales versus rentals unit mix that we saw on the quarter do you see that as more or less representative of what we should see for you know on a go forward basis and max if you can just talk about what the gross margin implications are for a potentially higher mix of rental units versus sales max schederbieschin we started the rental program not all that long ago and with our balance sheet maybe testing it versus full deployment but i think were very interested in a full deployment of that rental program and one of the things that we need to do is to really take a look at the contracts and how we go about that process with these hospitals because we want to make it easy for them and if a capital equipment purchase and a rental purchase more or less go at the same speed then the rental program is not performing for us so i think that what we will do is really focus on streamlining both processes but seeing if that can actually be a program that can get a lot of traction the rental program get a lot of traction here in the next couple quarters thomas looby on the gross margin side imron there are a little bit less than  on the rental side versus the device side and one of the things we neglected to mention are just asps in general and for direct sales we continue to see a slight uptick in those asps so even though we didnt have all ten as sales the seven that went out and those that were that direct had a slight uptick in the asps imron zafar okay and then just one housekeeping question did the  units what was the us versus europe gait tone thomas looby there are seven were in united states three of which were rentals and three were in europe and imron you asked before just so people know about it today there are  units that we mentioned  customers that are out there  of which are north america so north america is overtaken emea and emea has some  customers operator the next question is from greg chodaczek b riley financial please go ahead sir greg chodaczek the question is you received clearance in april of  so now were about a year end into it we talked about the sales cycle and it does take time i guess my question tom is what was going on in the last nine months and what is going to change is it the people is it the type of marketing i just last quarter was great this quarter it seems be a little hiccup and im just trying to figure out why thomas looby maybe you did make miss some  its hard to know when you got on the call but first and foremost we had to start broad marketing for the stroke indication not sales you know sales visit the sales visit but really educating the market were doing that through the trade shows were doing that through social media which is an important channel today some other advertising and were doing that through these webinars to educate people on the body of evidence so weve gotten past this era i think of hey exoskeletons are interesting and now were in this era of theyre important but why and why should i start to buy now so that i think takes a little bit of time to get in i think we still knock on doors that think that these devices are about spinal cord injury alone and has not been so compelling for them the other thing is that we need to mature a little bit on our sales ops side about how to take a order and develop it all the way to a sale and we are now i think pretty clean on that funnel so weve got very good visibility of when a sales cycle starts and how to mature that to in order greg chodaczek ive asked this question in the past ill ask it again whats good shephard indiscernible know that nobody else knows in terms of ekso thomas looby yes there are others out there besides those like mary and joy ph for example that are doing the same thing and just for the rest of the audience these people these clinics that greg mentioned are really great proof points they buy one they are not ones that have deep scientific budgets that do a lot of clinical trials at least initially and they really have to evaluate tools for the physical therapist on the merits of outcomes and also the economics and when they deploy these systems theyre seeing those outcomes theyre seeing those economic proof points at  irr for example in the case of good shepherd and then they buy their second and third and they start getting multiple devices and so its our job to really provide those case studies in advance but say population based metrics which we all eventually will have but these case studies i think can win the day and what were seeing is in our business still more multiunit placements you know its easier to sell to an existing customer that is to a naïve customer and so were seeing some of that i think that maybe greg what youre suggesting is it also taking a little bit of time for that traction to get there with other clinics and we would agree with you were fairly  our eyes are open that its taking longer than we wanted it to lets two quarters ago but our sales cycle is down the utilization of our devices are up quarter over quarter by  and i think that that is a bellwether for whether that clinic or those series of clinics will buy a second unit and as i said our demos are up from  to  per quarter in the us in the last nine quarters so theres real missionary work being done to develop this mark and thats why were still encouraged about our future business here greg chodaczek okay and this maybe another rehash but the zero mount while moving to  the zero mount is moving from introductory to commercial phase you may have talked about that exactly what does that mean and does that also include the vest or we are going to have a introductory phase for the vest when that comes out hopefully in the second half of this year thomas looby this is an example of that ekso bionics really maturing as a business few years ago we announced to the world that were starting industrial and then we really learned whats getting into the industrial business meant but over the last year we were sort of cautious to say that we were in full scale commercialization because we wanted to test our products out with a small group of customers and potential partners really learn the use cases maybe even learn their business model so that if they are ere rental what are they getting per month for the rental of our unit to their customers how many repeat users are they getting for their customers united rental has been fantastic partner in the early days but theres been others besides united rental really giving us that feedback but now what were seeing is a broadening of  so we pressure tested the device we feel very confident about the zerog arm and now were seeing a growing receptiveness for other customers and i think that gives us the confidence to say were going to be in regular commercialization not pilot or introductory phase and on the vest side we have already gone through one i think significant cycle in the development of that product we were asked to help to innovate an area that was a big safety risk in productivity risk for an automotive manufacturer we developed a first vest that way and since then weve reduced the weight by a third weve made it more comfortable for the user to wear for long periods without sacrificing the support that it provides the arms for these tools underneath when they work underneath the car in the assembly plant weve done that and weve also reduced the cost in the next generation so weve actually started to pilot it in our beta phase its just underway and we think that in q this is really where were going to start to take some significant orders for that device operator operator instructions we have reached the end of the question and answer session id like to turn the call back to tom looby for closing remarks thomas looby i think i just simply like to thank you for taking

this afternoon we are pleased to report the results of one of our best years ever at ekso bionics  was a pivotal year for our company during which ekso bionics initiated a transformation from a development stage organization to a commercial entity driven by the goals that our team set to ourselves we succeeded in achieving the followings in april we received fda clearance allowing us to market our devices for patients with spinal cord injuries as well as for patients who have suffered a stroke this gave us the widest label of any exoskeleton on the market in the us upon our clearance we kicked off our gotomarket efforts with the goal of first driving awareness that our device can help the hundreds and thousands of stroke suffers and then targeting the clinics with the greatest need recall that before  no company was allowed to market a class  device for use to stroke patients it is our single responsibility to do that now during the second half of the year we initiated and began enrollment in our first company sponsored study the wise study to help support the adoption of our technology as standardofcare in august we concurrently finance the company and uplifted our stock from the otc to the nasdaq capital market providing us with cash to commercialize our products as well as giving us access to a broader range of investors and increased liquidity with our approval in hand ekso bionics is now able to promote our products at medical conferences around the world participating in over  events in the us and emea since our clearance and our users have taken over  million steps on the way to better recoveries with this rehab tool all of these accomplishments which have now set the groundwork for the growth we expect in  and beyond culminated in the strong results in the fourth quarter of  a few financial performance headlines our medical device business had one of its best quarter ever with  million in sales we are seeing particular strength in north america markets and im optimistic that the changes we have put in place in our emea organization in  will set europe on the path to catch up to north america during  our industrial business continues to gain traction with its fourth quarter of growth and now over  units in the field we recognized the sale of  ekso gt units including the conversion of two units from rentals expanding the installed base to over  medical devices at over  customers in january we announced a longterm loan agreement for up to  million which provides capital on attractive terms to help support our continued growth as a company with the transition from development staged commercial entity for me the next step is converting the large market opportunities into shareholder value driven by topline growth as our products become standard within their industries we are focused on proving that our business is sustainable by helping our customers cost effectively achieve great results in both the medical and industrial markets our strong value proposition and customer services will further strengthen our brand in this early market during  we made significant progress with our clinical program which we believe will provide us with that data and experience we need to move towards standardofcare as mentioned earlier in the fall we kicked of our first companies sponsored study the wise study which stands for walking improvement for spinal cord injury with exoskeleton wise is being lead by burke rehabilitation institute and is evaluating improvement and independent gait speeds of incomplete spinal cord injury patients undergoing rehabilitation with the ekso gt the us based study is being conducted and at least eight centers and seeks to enroll approximately  communities dwelling people with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury our wise study is complemented by  ongoing and completed external studies which together cover over  patients and a us based exoskeleton registry in which we plan to participate thus far these studies have concluded some great findings for ekso gt first the ekso gt is safe and feasible for use for gait training in stroke and spinal cord injury participants have demonstrated the possibility of walking longer distances without fatigue while obtaining the physiological benefits and improved circulation training in ekso gt has been shown to improve gait speed and parameters like endurance balance midline alignment and motor control during walking both inside the device but also and may be even more importantly outside of the device training in ekso gt may lessen affect of secondary complications and may improve lower extremity strength body composition bowel and bladder function and psychological well being our researchers continue to work with our team and their patients to further personalize rehabilitation with our ekso gt as we drive towards standardofcare in addition to this growing body of clinical evidence we continue to hear from customers regarding the compelling financial returns they are realizing from our products as many of heard during our investor day in december one of our customer shared how they have achieved an internal rate of return of over  from their ekso devices we are hearing this moreandmore as evidence by the fact that almost  of our customers are buying multiple units to support our transition to full commercialization our team spent significant time and energy building our operational infrastructure as a reminder before we received our fda clearance in april which impacted our ability to communicate through such avenues as industry conferences or even written and printed marketing materials with fda clearance in hand our team is able to fully promote and market our ekso gt to now hone in on the  hospitals that are best served by our products as such we have raised money to fund the next phase of growth for the company and have appropriately added resources to our team to target these customers for awareness as well as product education and demos the awareness campaign for ekso is now incredibly wide spread through such outlets as industry conferences media outreach customer marketing campaigns and social media we are excited about our newly initiated centers of excellence peertopeer program through this program existing high utilization customers sign on to assist with clinical evidence generation product development and to help educate new and potential customers on the benefits of using our devices as additional validation many of our customers have released videos documenting their own use of our products and are actively promoting their experiences with the ekso gt to the public consistent with broader healthcare industry trends we are really excited to be moving our technology platform in the direction of personalized care and believe the ekso brand will offer helpful tools for the global move to value based healthcare we announced the first shipment of our ekso gt with smartassist technology in europe in september and launched this technology in the us this past month smartassist allows physical therapist to vary the support of the device for each leg independently from full power to free walking and thereby meet the specific needs of these patients already  devices or more than  customers have upgraded to this important software enhancement we also recently announced the relaunch of our significantly upgraded eksopulse to technology platform eksopulse allows physical therapist to not only capture patient progress during sessions but to safely store the therapeutic data in a cloudbased system to synchronize that data with cellular technology in order to track changes in patients performance and to then make real time adjustments to the care plans turning to the eksoworks industrial business our business is really beginning to gain meaningful attraction with strategic customers we shipped  industrial units in the fourth quarter of  an increase of  from just the quarter before in the second quarter launched the ekso g product and also partnered with the major rental company that gives us further access to the industrial and construction markets for product placement eksoworks  has turned a corner from a development into a viable commercial business and a strong contributor to the overall ekso bionics story in order to support and promote the growth of eksoworks we ramped up our investment into infrastructure that is dedicated to the industrial business during the second half of  in addition to focus rd efforts refining our mounted rm systems and precommercialization of our soon to be launched best systems we refine our positioning and execution with key customers including distributors picked up from our equipois acquisitions and initiated a launch with the network of manufactures representatives to expand our rentals and sales distribution network a very exciting milestone for us this january was our attendance at first industrial trade show the world of concrete which was a sort of coming out parties for eksoworks within the industry the trade show as a huge success in the number of leads from the conference far surpassed our expectations there are four main benefits of our products for the industrial workplace increased productivity with less fatigue improved safety better quality of workmanship and the ability to attract a wider range of employees for these jobs a case in point some of our customers are reporting a two to five times increasing productivity improving the bottom line for these customers i’m excited that our value proposition is taking hold among customers and users and finally in the fall of  we started to realign our emea organization in september matthias stief who i worked with at given imaging joined eksos management team to run our european operations with the emea markets being as large as the us market we needed to make sure we have the infrastructure in place to serve patients in emea as well under matthias leadership the ekso gt was recently subject to a medtech innovation briefing released by the national institute for health and care excellence known by its acronym nice the mib highlights the innovative aspect of ekso bionics proprietary smartassist software which differentiates the ekso gt from other available wearable exoskeletons mibs compliment existing nice guidance by providing objective information on new and novel medical technologies and are used as an aid to local decision making by clinicians we are honored to have been the subject of this mib during the first as the ceo of ekso bionics i have been truly humbled by the team all of the accomplishments outlined above continue to reinforce my confidence that we are building something great here and im excited to lead us into the future at this time i will hand the call to max our cfo to talk about our detailed financial results for the fourth quarter and the fullyear  max schederbieschin thanks tom now to some financial highlights please see our accompanying earnings release and k for further details regarding the quarter and fullyear  total reported revenue for q  was  million up from  million in q  the breakdown for q  revenues is as follows approximately  million in medical device and related revenue this is up  over q  during the fourth quarter we again experienced strong second unit buyers we continue to be excited to see this validation by early users of the value proposition of the ekso gt approximately  in eksoworks revenue up from nothing the same period a year ago approximately  in eksolabs down from  in q of  remember at the beginning of  we made the strategic decision to shift the focus of our labs’ engineering team to our industrial business a next generation home mobility device overall for the year  revenues were  million please note that this includes  million of previously differed revenue recognized in q our overall gross profit for the quarter was  for gross margin of  this compares to a gross loss of  in q of  the gross margin for our medical business in q was  a continued improvement over prior quarters as we scale among other areas our after sales service gross margin for industrial business in q was  and for engineering services unit  note that the lateral reflects an annual royalty payment in q from our strategic license with ottobock operating expenses for the fourth quarter of  were  million as compared to  million for the fourth quarter  the increase was driven by the increased sales clinical and marketing investments we are making since our april clearance and the increased rd investment to support our industrial and next generation home mobility products net loss for the quarter was  million as compared to a  million net loss in q net loss applicable to common shareholders for the year was  million note that this includes a  million in noncash preferred deemed dividend expense associated with our december  financing given that all the preferred shareholders have converted the preferred shares we do not foresee any further noncash preferred deemed dividend expenses for  cash used in operating activities for the quarter was  million as of december   we have cash balance of  million some additional notes of important for the fourth quarter for our rehab business we hit our target for demos which is for us a key indicator for sales traction later this year and into  in eksoworks at year end we had reached over  units in the field  of which were sold in the fourth quarter and the pipeline is strong with the leads from our first two trade shows this year we saw continued improvement in our gross margins across the business with  margins up  over  gross margins and we decreased inventory levels by close to  from  million at the end of september as we gain better visibility into our pipeline for both eksohealth and eksoworks we are more confident than ever that the market opportunity for our devices in rehabilitation is compelling and sizable there are an estimated  centers in united states and  worldwide based on the execution of our marketing strategy combined with the success with early customers we are targeting a run rate of  ekso gt units per quarter by year end  this would be up from the  units we have recognized in q  before we had an fda label on the industrial side we see a similarly compelling and sizable opportunity given our q run rate and order in place we are optimistic that we will at least double sales in  from the  million we hit in  while there will be changes quarteroverquarter due to mix we expect overall gross margins to remain stable for the year in  that is in the  to  range we achieved over the last two quarters our ultimate goal as we get to standardofcare is to achieve gross margins in north of  subject to our hitting our internal sales goals we see our investment in sales and marketing increasing  in this current q over q  and then holding relatively flat for the rest of  we expect rd expenses to increase  in q over q with another increase in the second half as we get closer to some new products introductions with that i will turn the call back to tom thomas looby thanks max as we have discussed in the past a broader theme to our strategy at ekso is to be very deliberate moving into our markets we are pleased with the results we are seeing thus far which confirm to us that our strategy is to right one we believe that this approach will lead to great success across all of the businesses and markets at ekso bionics looking ahead to our future we are making great progress on the development of our revolutionary home mobility platform which leverages the exceptional safety sophistication and efficacy of our flagship ekso gt the team is hitting their product development goals and is ontrack for a gotomarket date for an novel home mobility product in europe in  and the us in  on the industrial side we are building this business with the strategy similar to how we have approached the medical business by laying down the fundamental cornerstones in the thoughtful methodical way as we build the infrastructure around eksoworks we are continuously learning more about the market for these products uncovering many drivers of adoption as well as unmet customer needs that we hope to address we are currently hard at work on our next product offering our eksobest a wearable exoskeleton help with overhead work the first grade team here at ekso bionics is focused on accelerating market adoption of our products with the goal of ultimately establishing ekso bionics as standardofcare as we look back and review the year i’m pleased with what we have accomplished and i’m confident that we are set up to achieve our longerterm goals some of our strategic objectives for the upcoming year include the following drive market development globally for our medical devices through clinical evidence and a strong marketing program continue to move forward on the development of the home used product continue to collect data that supports the financial benefits of using our products and promote business development and the industrial segment i’m incredibly energized by our business and excited for the year ahead we are proving that we can execute and continually move our company to the next level and we are more confident than ever that we have the best strategy and the right team to achieve our goals of being the premiere exoskeleton company in the world with that i will end our prepared remarks and look forward to your questions questionandanswer session operator at this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of imron zafar of suntrust please proceed with your question imron zafar hi good afternoon thank you very much for taking my question i wanted to first ask a couple of questions on your outlook for  could you just sort of talk about how we should we think about the cadence i know you talked about the run rate at the end of the year but just looking at your year backlog and the sales cycle you probably have some pretty good visibility on the next couple of quarters if you could just sort of describe how you are thinking about the cadence for the year that would be helpful thanks max schederbieschin thanks imron this is max so for the beginning of last year  as we averaged between q and q and average the cash burn about  million a quarter and then for the fourth quarter last year we averaged about  million i think going forward for the year thats very much how we will be managing our business in that bandwidth i think from a gross margin standpoint we expect to be holding the margins we have recognized or realized in the last two quarters so between those two items i think that’s how we will be managing our operating expenses as well imron zafar okay why would the gross margin not trend higher as you increase your unit volumes over the course of the year max schederbieschin primarily because of the mix in  we had unfortunately we had a fewer sales coming out of europe that’s why tom made the shift he did typically it’s the   between europe and united states and a lot of our sales in europe are distributor sales they have a lower asp and so the asps that we have had sort of in the fourth quarter we don’t expect those to remain the same because we expect more business out of europe and with that more distributor sales so you are right we expect to improve on the service side of the business we have gone from a very deep loss to less of a loss enhance the improvement in the margins and that we expect to continue but with average sales price is dropping a little bit that’s why we sort of come out at the same levels for at least the next couple of quarters imron zafar got you in terms of the your sort of the comparative landscape and sort of customer interest has there any change in the comparative landscape in terms of rehab center purchases and also have you noticed any nearterm change in patterns just in light of the uncertainty around the aca and what administration might be with healthcare thomas looby first and for most competitively we don’t see many changes we are still the only one with stroke on our label we are still very good tractions in the clinics that have now become aware of exoskeletons and then become aware of exoskeleton with stroke i would say that biggest trend that i see is that the utilization is up quarteroverquarter yearoveryear the utilization that we our smart devices that send that of the cloud is that we are not just selling units but the units are being used and being used in the accelerator rate but we think that this is another indicator that we will have more traction in the future its up by the way  quarteroverquarter q over q  that’s the nice trend i think imron zafar sure thank you and then my last question is about the military construction in va appropriations budget for fiscal  obviously the language in there was very strong into our spend of medical exoskeletons can you just talk about what the implications are for the company i mean have you seen any impacts thus far in terms of potential grants from the va or also sort of the longer term implications for the company in terms of support from va max schederbieschin sure first of all the va remains our biggest customer overall and we get  units at  sites around the us the build that you refer to is it takes some time to cook in dc and so i think they are due for a plan for the center of excellence by midyear  but as of yet we are the only robotic exoskeleton company who is value proposition comes into focus as contemplated by that build so we are actually optimistic of what it will mean once they publish that plan imron zafar okay thank you very much max schederbieschin thank you imron operator our next question comes from the line of greg chodaczek b riley please proceed with your question greg chodaczek thanks just a couple of here tom out of the  center in the us how many of those do you think can justify an excellent skeleton right now thomas looby you know greg we have a very rich data about these  centers not just who they are and where they are but also how many patients go through them at relatively small organization we have to be focused on them what we did is we organically does filed these put them groups of ten from the very busiest to the least busy and as a business we are focusing on the top four that’s the way that we are prospecting doing the inside sales calls then refining them for quality demonstrations and then bringing them to close but when we also look at the data we see that we have sales to each one of those ten deciles from the very busiest to they are not so busy and some of the ones in a lower deciles have made a second order so we know that our value preposition resonates to every single one of those levels its just that as a business we want to be smart by taking it from the top down greg chodaczek and with the changing label that you have for a while has that changed the sales cycle in terms of time from first looking at one to signing a purchase order thomas looby i think it has accelerate a little we have some data that suggest that but keep in mind exoskeleton is not something that everybody knows about yet either and then when you would think about exoskeletons most times people think about spinal cord injury and so we have to educate them about stroke and then you facture in that it has been a relatively long sales cycles all of those things we are very focused on accelerating each step in that phase of the sales cycle from general awareness to the demo to convincing the leaders or the decision makers at the clinics to make him that close so we use sales automation and we are tracking sort of those gaits in between in each step and making sure that we know where to accelerate and i think that over the next few quarters we will see a shortening of that lead time of that sales cycle greg chodaczek okay and the smartassist software the update what percentage of the systems is out there have smartassist max schederbieschin i think its  units is what we just said out of the  plus so call it about  to  and its growing some of those units the recent ones the smartassist software is encompassed in the purchase price that asps for the units that have been for the technology that has been purchased separately is about i believe its  a unit greg chodaczek okay and do all the units out there are they capable of smartassist max schederbieschin all the unit are capable of smartassist i cant tell you we don’t know how many will convert to smartassist that will be a approx but it gives the sales team another touch point to go and talk to customers and understand them better as well greg chodaczek okay and last but not least regarding the home use products can you talk about what you are trying to do with that what it could be what it may not be or is this more skunk works and we will talk about it later thomas looby great question greg first of all just to elaborate a little bit on what max said and i know you didn’t ask the question but anecdotally the centers where we have installed smartassist have been thrilled by what it does so when you dream of something then design it then get it cleared and then release it you always have a hope that its going to have a good reception to marketplace and we are seeing that right now so with home mobility we have said for a while that we are going to build this brand by winning the hearts and minds of the rehab clinics establishing the brand of exoskeleton and ekso bionics but we lookout and for home mobility and its a big price right but in order to do this we need to have the devices be capable and capable for different disease states and injuries have it be really safe we have got a very safe product in the ekso gt and we want to make sure that we bring this reputation into the home and making it cost effective so what our teams are doing is we are looking at many technology vectors so think about allday wear ability and battery life and how to package the device so that it is less intrusive than what the rehab devices are and so on and then making that applicable for the different disease states so but this is not just skunk works we have really constrained the design question to how do we do this as rapidly as possible by achieving cost affectivity and safety so thats why we are very optimistic that  will release something in europe and  we will do so in the united states for the first product greg chodaczek perfect and i just have one more question i apologize everybody else is also on the line when it comes to useful life of an ekso gt out there right now how long is it max schederbieschin they have been designed for  million steps and so our estimate is somewhere in the three to four year range greg chodaczek all right thank you max max schederbieschin okay thanks thomas looby greg thank you operator operator instructions at this time we have no questions over the audio portion of the conference
