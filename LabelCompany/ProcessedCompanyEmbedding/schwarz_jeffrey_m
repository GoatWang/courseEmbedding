been brain imaging and cognitivebehavioral therapy with a focus on the brain mechanisms and psychological treatment of obsessivecompulsive disorder ocd dr schwartzs most recent academic writing has been in the field of philosophy of mind specifically on the role of volition in human neurobiology he has also applied his approach of mind over brain to the fields of business leadership and organizational behavior as featured in two articles in strategybusiness magazine in  and after receiving an honors degree in philosophy from the university of rochester dr schwartz began to devote a substantial amount of time to buddhist philosophy  in particular to the philosophy of mindfulness or conscious awareness which revolves around the central idea that the mind is an active participant in the world and that its actions have a physical effect on the workings of the brain he thus set out to find a scientific underpinning for the belief that mindfulness affects how the brain functions and in the s finally made his key discovery at ucla as shown on pet scans a fourstep cognitive behavioral therapy that he has pioneered is capable of actually changing the activity in a specific brain circuit of patients with obsessivecompulsive disorder dr schwartzs current passions include the philosophy of soren kierkegaard and dietrich bonhoeffer classic jazz and the role of christian meditation in enhancing mindful awareness and its effects on mindbrain relationsweb siteswwwjeffreymschwartzcomwwwyouarenotyourbraincom see more customers also bought items by jon hershfield sally
