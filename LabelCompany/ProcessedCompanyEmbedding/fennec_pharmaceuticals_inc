what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients including kidney and lung cancer in fact research from the american association for cancer research shows that for advancedmelanoma patients survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options it used to be science fiction harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer tweet biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types with  medicines and vaccines in development for cancer  percent of which

outcomes and creating health system efficiencies in a new video dr bernie zeiher president of development of astellas discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient “i am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen” dr zeiher says in the video “now with more personalizedtype therapies you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond” dr zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of america’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments although there were only  fdaapproved personalized medicines in  today there are more than  additionally personalized medicines accounted for more than  percent of fda approvals last year marking a record year for these innovative therapies cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers like nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc in fact research has shown nearly twothirds of nslcs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers like dr zeiher  percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized while the

condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease this can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry for more information download the phrma
