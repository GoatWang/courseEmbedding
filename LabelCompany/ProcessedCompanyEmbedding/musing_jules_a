actually even if you are familiar go reread that post its good context ill wait if youre the kind of person who moves into a house and never changes the paint colors this post wont resonate with you  but for the rest of you you know how it feels to put a little bit of your style into a house maybe youve stripped wallpaper or pulled back the carpet to find hardwood floors hidden underneath a few hours worth of work and youve fixed cleaned or replaced something youve made it better i bought my last house when i was a young optimistic single woman over the next four years i would repair or replace every single wall ceiling floor door light fixture electrical outlet and piece of trim thats no exaggeration  i gutted all  bathrooms and rebuilt them from the floor up  i gutted and rebuilt the kitchen i put in all new lighting floors and major systems hvac roof electrical panel i took down walls fixed beams and sistered joists i had help from friends family and a few contractors all told i spent  weekends working on that house i saved the place   and then not long after i finished i decided to sell it i think a decaying house is like a bad marriage it takes years of neglect to create the problems but with hard work you can almost always fix it and i believe in fixing what can be fixed saving what other people deem a lost cause  but imagine spending  years in couples counseling  after  years of hard work you wake up one morning look at your partner and realize you have the exact marriage youve always wanted its perfect and youre content  and then you ask for a divorce thats exactly what i did  i sold my house in january of  i just went back for the first time a few weeks ago driving up to the house i felt so many emotions  the new owners painted the exterior replacing the sunny yellow with a shade of grayish blue id like to tell you the color is all wrong but in fact it looks lovely  other than that its exactly the same as the day i left  but what was once the love of my life was now just a house thats the lesson i think  a house is just a house its  walls and a roof  it keeps you warm and safe and dry i realize now that after  years of restoring that house i loved it but it still wasnt a home  a house becomes a home when its filled with love family memories laughter tears fights makeups dreams and hopes a home holds all the beauty and love and heart that you bring to it after i sold my house i traveled europe for  months read about my european meltdown here and then moved back to michigan  i fell madly in love and my life changed forever   we moved to chicago and weve created a home filled with laughter the pitterpatter of little feet with squeals of joy family dinners fights makeups forts bedtime stories and long discussions about our future rich and i will buy a house soon enough a place for our family to put down roots but now i knowanywhere i go with these boys im home mused by jules at  pm  comments email

of oh ive gotta rant i was enjoying my coffee this morning and came across this article on huffpo women mine may not be a popular opinion but as i read this article i was really annoyed for a variety of reasons totally blogworthy the short story is that these  photos were hung up a florida high school the three most revealing dresses indicate that they wont be acceptable for prom the fourth less revealing dress indicated theyre welcome at prom and says good girl after reading the article it sounds like a staff member put up the photos but it was not approved by the administration nor was it an official school poster first and foremost let me say that the good girl line related to a young womans clothing choice is condescending and abhorrent girls and women arent good or bad based on what they wear and the phrasing of good girl is just gross and sexist and pejorative nevertheless i dont think that a poster encouraging modesty and decency for prom should cause this huge uproar and certainly not an uproar in the name of standing up against sexism and womensgirls rights its great to see young people getting involved standing up for something and making their voices heard but this is not an atrocity against women women all around the world are still subjected to genuine horrors like female genital mutilation forced marriages bride burning marital rape date rape sex trafficking and more dont get me started on rampant gender inequality and sexism please stand up against sexism and atrocities against women but the high school poster is not that this is a suggestion of decency in a time when young women are all too eager to bare everything being told to cover up isnt a war on women its part of life parents should be teaching their kids whats appropriate including how to dress not to get off on another tangent but the reason things like this are being posted is because parents dont parent my mom would have died before shed let me wear something like this  source rue the day luulla and xdressescom can you wear whatever dress you want yes does a revealing dress make you a bad girl no does it mean that boysmen can take advantage of you call you names or touch you no does it mean that youre a slut no should men judge you by your outfit maybe not do people male and female make assumptions about you based on your clothing yes of course sorry girls but thems the facts in modern culture our image is carefully cultivated every style choice you make says something about who you are celebrities and actors carefully choose every element of every outfit in order to cultivate a very specific image and brand for themselves well they have stylists who do that obvs why do they do that because the clothing you wear says a lot about you young women cannot be naive to this fact jackie kennedy carefully cultivated her image and so has nikki minaj women cant continue to behave and dress in a sexually precocious manner while simultaneously saying dont treat me as a sex object you cant have it both ways ladies again ill reiterate that im not victim blaming no girl or woman should ever be victimized harassed or attacked as a result of her clothing choices no matter how risque nothing you do say or wear justifies indecent or criminal behavior by a boy or man but your clothing choice does say something about you if you want to be shown respect demonstrate selfrespect if you want to be treated like a lady youll need to act like one back to the article i understand the students didnt like that poster i understand that they dont want to be shamed and i completely agree the tone and the language used was outrageous but this isnt sexism it isnt an assult on your rights as a woman its a message of modesty and its a decent message  “unfortunately what happened here is a symptom of what is still happening to girls in this country – this oversexualization of our bodies and emphasis on it” she said “girls are made to feel responsible for what a boy ‘might do or feel’ in response to how we dress dress codes are grossly outdated for ”  lily willimgton student at stanton college prep im sorry but no lily from stanton college prep  you have it all wrong the person telling yall to dress more modestly isnt the one oversexualizing your bodies you girls are doing that to yourselves   mused by jules at  pm no comments email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest labels huffpo huffpo women prom stantoncollegeprep saturday march   princess castles waterfalls and magic after spending a few days in munich i drove  miles south to a tiny bavarian town called schwangau germany this is where i found a little bit of magic whimsy and fantasy on my trip the famous neuschwanstein castle king ludwig ii of bavaria built the massive neuschwanstein castle in honor of his favorite composer and source of his secret romantic crush richard wagner he was reportedly infatuated with wagner and wanted the castle to be a shrine to his works as well as place for the performance of his operas the castle is the real life depiction of every gorgeous opulent princess castle id ever seen or dreamed of as a little girl  in fact walt disney and his wife lillian had taken a european tour before he built disneyland and they visited the neuschwanstein castle mr disney was so awestruck by the castle it became the inspiration for sleeping beauty and cinderellas castles see for yourself i can certainly see similarities  to tour the castle i parked at the bottom of the mountain paid for admittance and boarded a shuttle bus that took me to the top of the mountain after dozen of hairpin turns and twists the shuttle dropped me and my fellow visitors off at the top a short walk away from the castle itself part of the magical experience of visiting neuschwanstein is the incredible walk up to the castle there is a long path and the castle ispartially hidden  tucked away behind trees so as you walk slowly turrets and spires come into sight one by one when i rounded the last corner the entire castle came into view and nearly took my breath away gorgeous doesnt begin to describe it its magical grandiose and stunning  i spent about  minutes slowly wandering around the outside taking it all in  as i strolled i walked through crowds of visitors from all over the world  there were dozens of little girls wearing princess dresses they walked around waiting to go in the castle wearing tiny ball gown and princess dresses of white and pink tulle it was so sweet i remembered what it felt like to be  years old again twirling around the living room like a princess i secretly wished i had a princess dress on too instead of jeans what can i say the place is magical only one side of neuschwanstein is approachable by foot on all other sides of the bavarian castle the ground drops off in sheer bluffs  its absolutely jaw dropping after a short wait my group was ushered inside for the tour originally king ludwig designed the castle to have more than  rooms dedicated to the performance and appreciation of wagners works  rooms  in contrast the white house has just  rooms  although the massive buckingham palace has  rooms with  of them bathrooms imagine cleaning  toilets  ugh but i digress  despite the plan for  rooms in  neuschwanstein castle only  were ever finished construction began in  and went on for more than  years sadly richard wagner died in  having never visited neuschwanstein and king ludwig was devastated  just three years later  he was declared insane and died mysteriously  days after his diagnosis after his death because of the massive debt king ludwig amassed his family opened neuschwanstein to visitors today visitors can only tour the  completed rooms nothing can prepare a visitor for the dripping gilded opulent interior his eccentric style is distinct and in my opinion overwhelming to the senses every inch of every wall floor ceiling surface was embellished in some way my favorite room was the throne room the massive focal point is a chandelier designed to look like the byzantine crown  it weighs over  lbs the castle is full of tapestries murals of wagners works gilded walls mirrors and picture frames and more incredible chandeliers my senses were overloaded during the entire tour but in a great way  it was gorgeous opulent and over the top   its hard not to get a little caught up in the love story as well  imagine love so strong that a person would devote their life to honoring another or building something so massive in their honor men built the taj mahal and neuschwanstein so perhaps men are the romantic gender  certainly not in my personal experience as i left the castle i veered off the path to stop on the marienbrucke bridge  the long narrow bridge stretches over a stream and several waterfalls and has an unbeatable view of the castle  it feels as if this must be the very spot king ludwig stood when he was designing the castle  and for all i know maybe it was im not a big fan of bridges especially ancient ones that are just wooden planks with gaps between the planks seriously gaps i prefer my bridges to be steel and secure  but despite my fear i did walk out to the middle and allowed the tranquility of the place to wash over me there is no denying that king ludwig ii of bavaria was a strange man his unrequited romantic obsession with richard wagner took over his life bankrupted him and broke his heart  but that passion also gave his life purpose his passion led him to build this gorgeous castle which has brought millions of people joy and happiness it inspired walt disney who in turn shaped the imaginations of millions of little girls about what a princess castle looks like it inspired disneyland and surely inspires the millions of visitors that flock there every year its magical and romantic i stood on the bridge for so long that i missed the last shuttle down the mountain  the sky was turning gorgeous shades of orange and the castle was transformed in front of my eyes  as the sun set over neuschwanstein i felt optimistic maybe someday id have someone in my life who wants to build me a castle as i started the long slow walk down the mountain i looked around a few times to make sure i was alone   and then i did a few little twirls in my imaginary princess dress mused by jules at  pm no comments email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest labels bavaria europe germany king ludwig neuschwanstein princess richard wagner romance walt disney friday march   munich march th and th i’m in munich germany for some reason i cannot explain germany was never high on my travel list  i have always been drawn to destinations like ireland paris or italy and not as interested in places like germany or poland  then my parents lived in germany last year for  months and raved about it  i visited austria in february and loved it i learned there are obviously a lot of similarities between austria and germany and my interest started to grow  i began suspecting that my germandisinterest was allwrong so when i started to plan my route coming back from prague to italy i realized i could come back through munich i decided to check it out i’m so glad that i did  i found that germany was much different than my expectations it’s a wonderful country with a fascinating history distinct regions amazing architecture delicious food and warm friendly people  i’m about half german and it was comforting to walk around a country where everyone looked like me…blonde hair blue eyes and fairly tall i felt right at home…which certainly is not the case in italy where my pale skin and blonde tresses stands out i only had  days in munich so i tried to move fast and experience as much as possible the first morning i took the subway to marienplatz the heart of munich  the first thing you see as you come out of the subway at marienplatz is the impressive neuen rathaus or new city hall  its awesome the building houses the famous glockenspiel and i timed my visit to catch the  o’clock chiming now i’m not a clock buff or anything but the glockenspiel was so charming  at the top of the clock tower you can see a little alcove where the automated little men are dancing then they joust with one another and one is victorious there is a a short video showing you the glockenspiel here  next i toured the munich residenz a massive complex of buildings that was the former house of the bavarian monarchs  i swear i love touring castles residences palaces and mansions it is so much fun to see how the other half livesand it makes me feel so poor how can you not feel poor as you stroll through rooms like this i particularly liked strolling through the rooms that contained the treasures of the monarchy my absolute favorite piece was the traveling set of empress marie louise of austria the second wife of napoleon it was made in  by the most famous goldsmith of that time martin guillaume biennais i love secret things secret rooms passageways hidden things secret boxes etc  and this set has tons of hidden areas and items that fold into it it actually contains  items including dinner service for  a toiletry set writing implements sewing tools a measuring rod screwdriver even dental instruments its made of silvergilt motherofpearl tortoise shell ivory and ebony  the photo does not do it justice  my favorite room in the massive residenz was the antiquarium which was the biggest room ive ever seen  i took photo and video but i still feel that nothing quite captures how big the space was after i left the residenz i strolled the streets of munich talking with people window shopping and finally finding my way to der pschorr bier garten to try to drink a beer these videos say it all  its true im not a beer drinker ive never had more than a few sips before pouring myself a whiskey or wine instead  but i really wanted the bragging rights of saying i drank my first full beer in germany   i think it helped that i paired my hacker pschorr heifevisen with some delicious weinerschnitzel and roasted potatoes   and before long  the bartender had told each of the servers that i was drinking my first beer in german so i didnt realize i had wondered why they were all so friendly  well when i finished they clapped for me  i love germany the next day i had only a few more hours in munich i decided to head to hofbrauhaus for my second beer that was a huge mistake  hofbrauhaus only has  beers  dark and regular  i tried the regular which was bitter and awful i choked down  sips and left the rest  i know beer crime i did love the charm of the hofbrauhaus though and strolled around looking at the stein cages and girls in traditional dress selling pretzels   i spent a few hours strolling and shopping admiring cuckoo clocks buying gifts and a few beer steins  and then far too soon it was time to leave munich and head to the neuschwanstein castle   germany was an awesome surprise i cant wait to return to munich and explore the rest of the country  but next on my itinerary is the neuschwanstein castle about  kilometers south of munich auf weidersehen goodnight mused by jules at  am no comments email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest labels adventure beer bier garten der pschorr euro adventure germany hofbrauhaus munich weinerschnitzel wednesday march   prague art deco the golden lane and tiny homes march  and  the drive vienna austria north to prague czech republic is quite pretty the drive took me through small towns villages and vineyards that dotted the otherwise quiet landscape  there were long stretches where i saw no other cars  i loved that as i crossed into czech republic the afternoon was turning to evening i watched as the sky turned from blue to gorgeous orange and red and just as the sun melted down into the horizon i passed by a gorgeous still mirrorsurface lake  i snapped photos as i drove i arrived into prague around  pm exhausted my hotel is the spectacular art deco hotel paris  its located next to the municipal house which was the former site of the royal court palace the home of the great king wenceslas iv from the song from  to   at that time the habsburgs took power and werent interested in using the palace it fell into disrepair and was later torn down in its place the municipal house was built in   it is the best example of prague art nouveau architecture standing today  its simply gorgeous i was super excited to find id been given a suite for no extra cost simply because id asked for a room with a view  i was on the top floor corner room with views on two sides my room was pretty greatand fairly inexpensive  the benefits of traveling during the off season the entrance door was french doors always a good sign it had a big comfortable bed  and a massive bathroom the next morning i could truly appreciate the views from the bathroom i had stunning views of the top of the prague municipal house directly next door and from the other windows i had a view out over old town prague and the astronomical clock tower the next morning i headed to prague castle the castle is across the charles bridge and up in the hills overlooking the vitava river its the highest building in the below photo the prague castle complex is very large and full of museums i focused my tour on st vitus cathedral the old royal palace st george basilica the golden lane and the powder bridge at the entrance to the castle are armed guards and much like in london there is a hourly changing of the guards it must be so hard to stand perfectly still while tourists like me take selfies with you  ha inside the prague castle complex the st vitus cathedral was absolutely stunning  the below photo is one of my favorites but the cathedrals massive size makes it difficult to get it all in one shot the second shot gives great perspective for the scale of the cathedral just look how big those doors areabout  feet tall my favorite part of the castle was the golden lane a row of tiny miniature houses are literally glued to one of the walls of the castle legend says that the row of houses was originally inhabited by the castle goldsmiths hence the name golden lane  throughout the years the tiny houses were inhabited by merchants goldsmiths alchemists and marksmen who worked at the castle the tiny homes are only about  feet deep so as not to intrude out into the street  the entire street feels as though it was built for hobbits instead of real people you have to stoop to get through the small doorways i stopped at each house and loved how cozy and charming they were some of the houses had just a single bed a small dresser a chair and a wood burning oven for both heat and cooking  originally the homes didnt have running water in fact the last house to get indoor plumbing was in the s  i just loved how charming the houses here were after touring the castle i went back to the hotel to rest and get gussied up  that evening i went to a chamber orchestra performance at the municipal state house next to my hotel  i absolutely loved listening to the violins violas cellos and basses play vivaldi handle mozart bach and more  they were truly exceptional i had dinner at a steakhouse in prague called casa de argentina because what do you want to eat in the czech republic but argentinian food amiright   i had an amazing steak there and plenty of red wine  i was the only woman in the restaurant and that made for great people menwatching the men at a nearby table bought me dessert which was delicious my server was gorgeous and we flirted wildly for the  hours i was there there are certainly many benefits to solo travelflirty waiters is one of them i blogged while i ate finished my halfbottle of wine and strolled back to my hotel enjoying the warm evening breeze  all in all a great day in prague on wednesday i spent the day walking around the old town square of prague i went to the top of the clock tower and even tried to make sense of the astronomical clock which is impossible next i strolled along the charles bridge and did some great shopping for friends and family the bridge is beautifulsecond only to the chain bridge i saw in budapest i kept wandering the streets and found an old used bookstore with english books my tradition continued when i bought a book by a czech writer recommended to me by the owner cant wait to read it in the afternoon i toured the jewish museum and cemetery im always drawn to the jewish history museums but leave crying depressed and disgusted by how evil human beings can be but in my opinion travel throughout europe just isnt complete without trying to understand and learn about the history of each country and the events leading up to the world wars the history scenery architecture art and people of prague were wonderful i loved the city and would visit again
