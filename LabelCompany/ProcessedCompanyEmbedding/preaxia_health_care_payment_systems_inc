three  broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs the three  levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph  are described below       level    quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date       level    pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date       level    pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data     f        the carrying amount of the company’s financial assets and liabilities such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments the company’s notes payable approximate the fair value of such instruments based upon management’s best estimate of interest rates that would be available to the company for similar financial arrangements at november     the company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or a nonrecurring basis   gain loss per share   gain loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during

recoverable   the company assesses the recoverability of its longlived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related longlived asset or group of longlived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts impairment if any is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets  fair value is generally determined using the asset’s expected future discounted cash flows or market value if readily determinable  if longlived assets are determined to be recoverable but the newly

 deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized  deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of income and comprehensive income in the period that includes the enactment date   the company adopted section  of the fasb

december   the nevada secretary of state effected a name change which had been previously approved by the majority of the stockholders on october   our company undertakes all of its operations through its whollyowned subsidiary preaxia health care payment systems inc “preaxia canada” formerly h pay card inc preaxia canada prior to being acquired by preaxia was a private corporation incorporated pursuant to the laws of the province of alberta on january   general overview preaxia canada is a company which intends to deliver a comprehensive suite of solutions and services directed at the emerging health payment market specifically the opportunities tied to the growth of health spending accounts “hsa” there is a rapid shift in healthcare traditional payment models to consumerdirected healthcare that is creating significant opportunities for financial services and insurance industries to deliver new dynamic products to this emerging market spawned by the need to address escalating health care costs changes in the regulatory environment and the growing consumer desire for greater participation in the management of their health benefits the boundaries between health care and the financial services industries are becoming increasingly blurred with the trend towards selfdirected health payment solutions and the growing demand for faster easier and more convenient benefit services the insurance and benefits industries are banking on hsa medical payments being their next big growth conduit studies suggest that hsas in the us will grow to over  billion in assets and  million consumers by  this coupled with the continued growth of the canadian group insurance industry illustrates the emerging opportunity for innovative health payment services we intend to initially launch our products in canada we believe that canadian businesses are embracing a new healthcare financing vehicle to control costs increase profitability and get more return from their investment we intend to provide them with services to capture this market opportunity description of health spending account “hsa” an hsa can operate like a bank account plan members start each plan year with a certain number of dollar credits in their hsa throughout the year those credits may be used to pay for certain medical vision and dental expenses the credits can be used to top up existing group coverage by covering residual amounts on prescription drugs eyeglasses and hearing aids or to pay for medical vision and dental expenses that otherwise may not be covered under the group benefit plan traditional health plan users pay premiums into a plan but do not see a return on money unless there is an issue with their health in addition most plans are established so that monies deposited into a plan by an employee are nontransferable upon the employee’s change of employment services and infrastructure provided by preaxia will enable insurance companies governments and corporations to replace cash and cheque payments our company’s plans are to provide instant issuing services that enable corporations to issue and fund prepaid interac or credit card services to beneficiaries in real time the beneficiary will select a personal identification number “pin” using a pin and card activation terminal thus gaining instant access to funds that can be reloaded preaxia is in the process of developing a platform for processing and managing accounts and payment cards including cardholder and customer account management reconciliation and financial settlement and customer reporting        preaxia is in the process of developing software systems for the issuing of health payment cards and financial transaction processing services that will be fully managed by a data center products and services are anticipated to include payment card issuance on behalf of issuing bank partners for customerbranded credit cards and interac payment cards the cards are anticipated to be issued with canadian and united states access through interac canada and star united states atm as well as interbank networks payment processing and funds allocation on payment accounts through financial electronic data interchange wire transfers and the automatic clearing house “ach” with a preaxia connection to a financial institution payment gateway and the united states ach network through a united states financial institution enabling cardholders to select a personal pin using a preaxia pin selection and card activation terminal these functions enable the end user to be issued a preaxia generated payment card at a customer’s office which is ready for immediate use authorizing transactions based upon the business requirements of preaxia customers monitoring for unusual transaction activities fraud and compliance violations providing management reports to customers and payment beneficiaries customer support center for reporting lost or stolen cards and for answering cardholder inquiries distribution methods and marketing strategy preaxia’s overall strategy is to finalize development of and market its health care payment cards and system our company will target enterprisesized public and private sector customers at the provincial and national levels we will seek opportunities with lead customers and alliance partners to establish referenceable highprofile implementations and marketleading earlyadopter firms for further developing innovative products and services our company intends to design solutions targeted towards corporate financial management financial risk audit management and cash management and target productservice management as a support to financial management we anticipate that prime targets will be organizations that make a significant number of payments to individuals by way of cheques or serve individuals with limited or no access to bank accounts we anticipate that preaxia’s products will replace the usage of cheques for people who prefer electronic delivery of funds through a multifunctional interac or major credit card and generate cost savings benefits and increased efficiencies for its clients preaxia intends to achieve service volume and the associated economies of scale through marketing directly to select target customers that provide the necessary transaction volumes and through market specific channel partners the channel strategy is supported in the solution design as multiple channel partners will require branding and our company’s fee chargingcollection capabilities it is our company’s intention to sell through multitiered valueadded resellers for example the health card solution may be provided by a subcontract to a leading vendor that rebrands and adds value to the solution the leading vendor in turn may form part of a larger professional services systems integration engagement with the customer one example of this approach is that a major bank may lead on selling our company’s solution to medical insurance companies and the health care industry under our product brand preaxia has identified the following “channels” through which it will target prime end market customers benefits managersadjudicators including insurance health or outsources government benefits processors that manage benefits disbursement issuer banks including partner banks that enable the issuance of health cards application providers including software manufacturers selling into the target vertical markets professional services including consulting development and implementation companies serving the target vertical markets preaxia intends to establish several key customer reference accounts channel marketing partners and technology alliances these corporate relationships are key to advance our company’s goals in  for achieving a prime position in the canadian public sector and establishing a solid service foundation        competitive business conditions and our company’s competitive position in the industry and methods of competition preaxia intends to offer a combination of products and services in its solution however there are other providers of components or versions of the health card value proposition in the marketplace our company is taking a different approach by providing a high value added and robust capability within specific target markets rather than the “one size fits all” and mass volume approach of the larger companies in the canadian and international market the following are some of the leading providers of products and services that are or may be potential competitors in preaxia’s target markets canadian market pay linx financial corporation is presently inactive but was a company offering prepaid debit card payment solutions that integrated

intends to ensure that all rights to and ownership of its intellectual property remains with the company we anticipate that source codes or other proprietary knowledge will be protected through agreements entered into between preaxia and its employees and contractors and additional high standards of confidentiality and protection of data are set by clients and regulatory authorities within the industry   intellectual property and patent protection   at present preaxia has two trademarks pending one is for the company name preaxia and another is for the company logo design   plan of operation   over the next twelve months we plan to     a  raise additional capital to execute our business plans         b  penetrate the health care processing market in canada and worldwide by continuing to develop innovative health care processing products and services         c build up a network of strategic alliances with several types of health insurance companies governments and other alliances in various vertical markets and         d  fill the positions of senior management sales administrative and engineering positions   cash requirements   after a further review of business opportunities with industry consultants for the next twelve months and given that we meet our forecasted expenses we plan to spend a total of approximately  in implementing our business plan of development and marketing of health care processing products and services  we do not expect to generate any revenues this year therefore we will be required to raise a total of  to complete our business plan and pay our outstanding debts of approximately    our working capital requirements for preaxia canada for the next twelve months are estimated at  distributed as follows   estimated expenses     general and administrative       research and development        marketing and education        professional services        total                   our estimated expenses over the next twelve months are broken down as follows      general and administrative  we anticipate spending approximately  on general and administration costs in the next twelve months which will include staff fees office rent office supplies transfer agents filing fees bank service charges salaries for our administration interest expense and travel which includes airfare meals car rentals and accommodations          research and development   we anticipate that we may spend approximately  in the next twelve months in the development and acquisition of software for our processing services and products                   marketing and education    we anticipate spending approximately  as the costs of staff and personnel marketing and promoting our company our products and services and educating the public to attract new accounts          professional services   we anticipate that we may spend up to  in the next twelve months for professional services which includes accounting auditing legal fees and investor relations         liquidity and capital resources   as of november   preaxia’s cash balance was  compared to  as at may    our company will be required to raise capital to fund our operations  preaxia’s cash on hand is currently its only source of liquidity  preaxia had a working capital deficit of  as of november   compared with a working capital deficit of  as of may       our ability to meet our financial liabilities and commitments is primarily dependent upon the continued issuance of equity to new stockholders and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations  preaxias cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for the next twelve month period   we will not initially have any cash flow from operating activities as we are in the development stage   we project that we will require an estimated additional  over the next twelve month period to fund our operating cash shortfall and to complete our business plan  our company plans to raise the capital required to satisfy our immediate shortterm needs and additional capital required to meet our estimated funding requirements for the next twelve months primarily through the private placement of our equity securities or by way of loans or such other means as preaxia may determine     there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain funds required for our continued operations  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or if available that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms  if we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease the operation of our business   there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further longterm financing successful and sufficient market acceptance of our products and achieving a profitable level of operations  the issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders  obtaining commercial loans assuming those loans would be available will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments

the development of our health card software and obtained new customers   expenses   our operating loss for the three month period ended november   was  compared to  for the three month period ended

operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the year ended may              critical accounting policies   we have identified certain accounting policies described below that are the most important to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations   revenue recognition   preaxia recognizes revenue in accordance with the provision of the securities and exchange commission which establishes guidance in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements  this provision requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured   research and development   software development costs the company accounts for software development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements including fasb asc  research and development fasb asc  internaluse software fasb  costs of computer software to be sold leased or marketed and fasb asc  website development costs  costs incurred during the period of planning and design prior to the period determining technological feasibility for all software developed for use internal and external has been charged to operations in the period incurred as research and development costs  additionally costs incurred after determination of readiness for market have been expensed as research and development the company has capitalized certain costs in the development of our proprietary software computer software to be sold leased or licensed for the period after technological feasibility was determined and prior to our marketing and initial sales website development costs have been capitalized under the same criteria as our marketed software   capitalized software costs are stated at cost  the estimated useful life of costs capitalized is evaluated for each specific project the software is being amortized over three years starting june  item   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   not applicable   item  controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   as required by rules a or d under the securities exchange act of  we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report being november   this evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer   our management does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the objectives of a control system are met further any control system reflects limitations on resources and the benefits of a control system must be considered relative to its costs these limitations also include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of a control the design of a control system is also based upon certain assumptions about potential future conditions over time currently implemented controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate due to the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected            based upon their evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as at the end of the period covered by this quarterly report our company determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of november   due to the following two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we indentified in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended may   i we do not have accounting staff with sufficient technical accounting knowledge relating to accounting for us income taxes and complex us gaap matters and ii we failed to file our corporate tax returns for        or  as we disclosed in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended may   we intend to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make the necessary improvements to remediate these material weaknesses in particular we intend to hire staff with us gaap expertise if we can obtain additional financing and hire professionals to prepare and complete the filing of our corporate tax returns   changes in internal control over financial reporting   there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended november   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting   part ii – other information   item  legal proceedings   we know of no material pending legal proceedings to which our company or subsidiary is a party or of which any of our property is the subject in addition we do not know of any such proceedings contemplated by any governmental authorities   we know of no material proceedings in which any director officer or affiliate of our company or any registered or beneficial stockholder of our company or any associate of any such director officer affiliate or stockholder is a party adverse to our company or subsidiary or has a material interest adverse to our company or subsidiary   item a risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face any of the following risks could harm our business financial condition or results of operations in such case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment   risks associated with our financial condition   our independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern   we incurred a net loss of  for the period from april   date of inception to november   we are yet to attain profitable operations in their report on our financial statements for the fiscal year ended may   our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern            our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations andor to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due we have not generated significant revenues since our inception on january   we will in all likelihood continue to incur operating expenses without significant revenues for the foreseeable future we cannot assure that we will be able to generate enough interest in our health payment market products if we cannot attract a significant customer base we will not be able to generate any significant revenues or income in addition if we are unable to establish and generate significant revenues or obtain adequate future financing our business will fail and you may lose some or all of your investment in our common stock   we have additional financing requirements   in order to accelerate preaxias growth objectives we will need to raise additional funds from lenders and equity markets in the future there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms to finance our growth objectives the ability of preaxia to arrange such financing in the future will depend in part upon the prevailing capital market conditions as well as the business performance of preaxia there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to us if additional financing is raised by the issuance of shares of common stock of preaxia control of preaxia may change and stockholders may suffer additional dilution of their ownership interest in preaxia   we have negative cash flow and absence of profits   preaxia has not earned any profits to date and there is no assurance that it will earn any profits in the future or that profitability if achieved will be sustained a significant portion of our financial resources will continue to be directed to the development of our products and to marketing activities our success will ultimately depend on our ability to generate revenues from our product sales such that the business development and marketing activities may be financed by revenues from operations instead of external financing   there is no assurance that future revenues will be sufficient to generate the required funds to continue such business development and marketing activities   risks associated with our business   we have a limited operating history   we are in the early stages of development and face risks associated with a new company in a growth industry we may not successfully address these risks and uncertainties or successfully implement our operating strategies if we fail to do so it could materially harm our business to the point of having to cease operations and could impair the value of our common stock to the point investors may lose their entire investment even if we accomplish these objectives we may not generate positive cash flows or the profits we anticipate in the future   we have a limited operational history we are in the early commercialization stage of our business and therefore we will be subject to the risks associated with early stage companies including uncertainty of revenues markets and profitability and the need to raise additional funding we will be committing and for the foreseeable future will continue to commit significant financial resources to marketing product development and research our business and prospects must be considered in light of the risks expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stage of development such risks include the evolving and unpredictable nature of our business our ability to anticipate and adapt to a developing market acceptance by consumers of our products and the ability to identify attract and retain qualified personnel there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing what is necessary to address these risks   we will require key personnel   the financial services technology industry and hsa marketplace involves a high degree of risk  which even a combination of experience knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome our success is dependent on the services of our senior management the loss of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business prospects in addition our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled technical management sales and marketing personnel there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition            we may not be successful in the protection of our intellectual property   there can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted or prosecuted against us or that any such assertions or prosecutions will not materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources with respect to the defense thereof which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations our performance and ability to compete are dependent to a significant degree on our proprietary technology there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology or that agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable the laws of other countries may afford us little or no effective protection of our intellectual property we may in the future also rely on technology licenses from third parties there can be no assurance that these third party licenses will be or will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms the loss of or inability of preaxia to maintain any of these technology licenses could result in delays in completing its product enhancements and new developments until equivalent technology could be identified licensed or developed and integrated any such delays would materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   we face competition and may not be able to compete successfully   preaxia may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the competitive pressures preaxia faces could harm its business and prospects broadly speaking the market for hsas and for financial services technology is competitive there are other providers of components or versions of both hsas and the health card value proposition in the marketplace additionally the level of competition is likely to increase as current competitors improve their product offerings and as new participants enter these markets many of preaxia’s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases greater name and brand recognition and significantly greater financial sales marketing technical and other resources than preaxia   additionally these competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow them to develop new or improved products that may compete with products our company markets and distributes new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may also increase competitive pressures on preaxia increased competition may result in reduced operating margins as well as loss of market share this could result in decreased usage of our products and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   we may face implementation delays   most of our customers will be in a testing or preliminary stage of utilizing our products and may encounter delays or other problems in the introduction of our products a decision not to do so or a delay in implementation could result in a delay or loss of related revenue or could otherwise harm our business and prospects preaxia will not be able to predict when a customer that is in a testing or a preliminary use phase will adopt a broader use of our products   we may get limited customer feedback respecting products   our revenue will depend on the number of customers who use our products accordingly the satisfactory design of our product is critical to our business and any significant product design limitations or deficiencies could harm our business and market acceptance the feedback we obtain from our customers is critical to our ability to fix any limitations or deficiencies in our product if we do not obtain adequate feedback from our customers we may not be able to adequately assess our customers’ requirements the currently specified features and functionality of our product may not satisfy current or future customer demands furthermore even if we identify the feature set required by our customers and potential customers we may not be able to design and implement products incorporating features in a timely and efficient manner if at all            we may face a slow down in developing markets   the market for our products is relatively new and continues to evolve if the market for our product fails to develop and grow or if our product does not gain market acceptance our business and prospects will be harmed   our ability to keep current with technological changes can impact our ongoing business   the hsa and financial services technology industries are susceptible to technological advances and the introduction of new products utilizing new technologies further the hsa and financial services technology industries are also subject to customer preferences and to competitive pressures which can among other things necessitate revisions in pricing strategies price reductions and reduced profit margins the success of preaxia will depend on our ability to secure technological superiority in our products and maintain such superiority in the face of new products from competitors no assurances can be given that our products will be commercially viable or that further modification or additional products will not be required in order to meet demands or to make changes necessitated by developments made by competitors which might render our products less competitive less marketable or even obsolete over time the future success of preaxia will be influenced by our ability to continue to develop new competitive products there can be no assurance that research and development activities with respect to the development of new products and the improvement of our existing products will prove profitable or that products or improvements resulting therefrom if any will be successfully produced and marketed   the hsa and financial services technology industries are characterized by technological change changes in user and customer requirements new product introductions new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our technology obsolete or have a negative impact on sales margins our product may command preaxias performance will depend in part on our ability to enhance our existing product develop new proprietary technology that addresses the sophisticated and varied needs of its prospective customers and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and costeffective basis the development of technology entails significant technical and business risks there can be no assurance that we will be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our product to customer requirements or emerging industry standards   we require strategic alliances   our growth and marketing strategies are based in part on seeking out and forming strategic alliances and working relationships as well as the performance of such strategic alliances and working relationships general criteria to be used to assess potential alliances include the following industry expertise reputation and market position complementary technologies or products and nature and adequacy of resources   we may have problems with our resolution of product deficiencies   difficulties in product design performance and reliability could result in lost revenue delays in customer acceptance of preaxia’s products andor lawsuits and would be detrimental perhaps materially to our market reputation serious defects are frequently found during the period immediately following the introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products undetected errors or performance problems may be discovered in the future moreover known errors which we consider minor may be considered serious by our customers if our internal quality assurance testing or customer testing reveals performance issues andor desirable feature enhancements we may postpone the development and release of updates or enhancements to our current product or the release of new products we may not be able to successfully complete the development of planned or future products in a timely manner or to adequately address product defects which could harm our business and prospects in addition product defects may expose us to liability claims for which we may not have sufficient liability insurance a successful suit against us could harm our business and financial condition          we may not be able to effectively manage our growth   we may be subject to growthrelated risks including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and controls our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our operational and financial systems and to expand train and manage our employee base the inability of preaxia to deal with this growth could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and prospects we may experience growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operating and financial systems resulting in increased responsibilities for our personnel the hiring of additional personnel and in general higher levels of operating expenses in order to manage our current operations and any future growth effectively we will also need to continue to implement and improve our operational financial and management information systems and to hire train motivate manage and retain our employees there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage such growth effectively that our management personnel or systems will be adequate to support our operations or that we will be able to achieve the increased levels of revenue proportional with the increased levels of operating expenses associated with this growth   our directors and officers may face conflicts of interest   certain directors and officers of preaxia may become associated with other reporting issuers or other corporations which may give rise to conflicts of interest directors who have a material interest or any person who is a party to a material contract or a proposed material contract with preaxia is required subject to certain exceptions to disclose that interest and generally abstain from voting on any resolution to approve the contract in addition our directors are required to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of preaxia as the case may be certain of the directors may have other employment other business or time restrictions placed on them and accordingly these directors will only be able to devote part of their time to the affairs of preaxia   certain directors and officers may have other employment other business or time restrictions placed on them and accordingly these directors will only be able to devote part of their time to the affairs of preaxia   we do not have key personnel insurance   we do not currently have key personnel insurance in place in respect of any of our senior officers or personnel   acquisitions investments and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties dilution to our investors and other negative consequences   it is our current intention to engage in and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions including acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets as of the date of filing of this quarterly report we have not yet identified any such strategic transactions any of these strategic transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations in our search for opportunities to engage in strategic transactions we may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities we may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or investments or an acquisition or investment may not enhance our business or may decrease rather than increase our earnings in addition the process of integrating an acquired company or business or successfully exploiting acquired intellectual property or other assets could divert a significant amount of our management’s time and focus and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures   additional risks we may face include   · the need to implement or remediate controls procedures and policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired company that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls procedures and policies · cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from an acquired company or business into our organization · retaining key employees from the businesses we acquire and · the need to integrate an acquired company’s accounting management information human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management          future acquisitions and investments could involve the issuance of our equity securities potentially diluting the ownership interest in our company of our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased expenses any of which could harm our financial condition our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments   fluctuations in quarterly operating results lead to unpredictability of revenue and earnings   the timing of the release of health care payments processing products and services can cause material quarterly revenue and earnings fluctuations a significant portion of revenue in any quarter may be derived from sales of products and services introduced in that quarter or established in the immediately preceding quarter if we are unable to begin to generate sales of products and services during the scheduled quarter our revenue and earnings will be negatively affected in that period quarterly operating results also may be materially impacted by factors including the level of market acceptance or demand for health payment processing products and services and the level of development andor promotion expenses for health payment processing products and services consequently if net revenue in a period is below expectations our operating results and financial position in that period are likely to be negatively affected as has occurred in the past   our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective which may cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public   our management evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of november   and concluded that as of that date our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in addition our management evaluated our internal control over financial reporting as of may   and concluded that that there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of that date and that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of that date a material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis   we have not yet remediated this material weakness and we believe that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting continue to be ineffective until these issues are corrected our ability to report financial results or other information required to be disclosed on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected and our financial reporting may continue to be unreliable which could result in additional misinformation being disseminated to the public investors relying upon this misinformation may make an uninformed investment decision   risks associated with our common stock   our common stock is traded on the overthecounter bulletin board which may make it more difficult for investors to resell their shares due to suitability requirements   our common stock is currently quoted for trading on over the counter bulletin board “otcbb” under the symbol paxhob where we expect it to remain in the foreseeable future brokerdealers often decline to trade in otcbb stocks given the market for such securities is often limited the stocks are more volatile and the risk to investors is greater these factors may reduce the potential market for our common stock by reducing the number of potential investors this may make it more difficult for investors in our common stock to sell shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of their shares this could cause our stock price to decline   because we can issue additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock purchasers of our common stock may experience dilution in their ownership of our company in the future   we are authorized to issue up to  shares of common stock as of january   there were  shares of our common stock issued and outstanding our board of directors has the authority to cause our company to issue additional shares of common stock without the consent of any of our stockholders consequently our stockholders may experience dilution in their ownership of our company in the future          we do not intend to pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future   we do not currently anticipate declaring and paying dividends to our stockholders in the foreseeable future it is our current intention to apply net earnings if any in the foreseeable future to increasing our working capital we currently have no material revenues and a history of losses so there can be no assurance that we will ever have sufficient earnings to declare and pay dividends to the holders of shares of our common stock and in any event a decision to declare and pay dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors which currently do not intend to pay any dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future   our stock is a penny stock trading of our stock may be restricted by the securities and exchange commission’s penny stock regulations which may limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock   our stock is a penny stock the securities and exchange commission has adopted rule g which generally defines “penny stock” to be any equity security that has a market price as defined less than  per share or an exercise price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions our securities are covered by the penny stock rules which impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” the term “accredited investor” refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with a net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding  or  jointly with their spouse the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the securities and exchange commission which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account the bid and offer quotations and the brokerdealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s confirmation in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules consequently these penny stock rules may affect the ability of brokerdealers to trade our securities we believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock   the financial industry regulatory authority sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock   in addition to the “penny stock” rules described above the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” has adopted rules that require that when recommending an investment to a customer a brokerdealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their noninstitutional customers brokerdealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status tax status investment objectives and other information under interpretations of these rules finra believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers the finra requirements make it more difficult for brokerdealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock which may limit your ability to buy and sell our common stock and have an adverse effect on the market for shares of our common stock   item   unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceeds   during the

“intend” “expect” “plan” “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “predict” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology these statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks including the risks in the section entitled “risk factors” commencing on page  uncertainties and other factors which may cause our or our industry’s actual results levels of activity or performance to be materially different from any future results levels of activity or performance expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements these risks and uncertainties include a continued downturn in international economic conditions any adverse occurrence with respect to the development or marketing of our product any adverse occurrence with respect to any of our licensing agreements our ability to successfully bring products to market product development or other initiatives by our competitors fluctuations in the availability and cost of materials required to produce our products any adverse occurrence with respect to distribution of our products potential negative financial impact from claims lawsuits and other legal proceedings or challenges and other factors beyond our control although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot guarantee future results levels of activity or performance except as required by applicable law including the securities laws of the united states we do not intend to update any of the forwardlooking statements to conform these statements to actual results as used in this annual report the terms “we” “us” “our” the “corporation” and “preaxia” mean preaxia health care payment systems inc and our wholly owned subsidiary preaxia health care payment system inc formerly h pay card inc unless the context clearly requires otherwise unless otherwise stated “” refers to united states dollars item  business corporate overview preaxia was incorporated in the state of nevada on april   on december   the nevada secretary of state effected a name change which had been previously approved by the majority of the stockholders on october   our company undertakes all of its operations through its whollyowned subsidiary preaxia health care payment systems inc “preaxia canada” formerly h pay card inc preaxia canada prior to being acquired by preaxia was a private corporation incorporated pursuant to the laws of the province of alberta on january          general overview preaxia canada is a company which intends to deliver a comprehensive suite of solutions and services directed at the emerging health payment market specifically the opportunities tied to the growth of health spending accounts “hsa” there is a rapid shift in healthcare traditional payment models to consumerdirected healthcare that is creating significant opportunities for financial services and insurance industries to deliver new dynamic products to this emerging market spawned by the need to address escalating health care costs changes in the regulatory environment and the growing consumer desire for greater participation in the management of their health benefits the boundaries between health care and the financial services industries are becoming increasingly blurred with the trend towards selfdirected health payment solutions and the growing demand for faster easier and more convenient benefit services the insurance and benefits industries are banking on hsa medical payments being their next big growth conduit studies suggest that hsas in the us reached  billion in assets and  million consumers in  an increase of more than  over the prior year this coupled with the continued growth of the canadian group insurance industry illustrates the emerging opportunity for innovative health payment services we intend to initially launch our products in canada we believe that canadian businesses are embracing a new healthcare financing vehicle to control costs increase profitability and get more return from their investment we intend to provide them with services to capture this market opportunity description of health spending account “hsa” an hsa is a uniquely designed bank account established exclusively and specifically for the purpose of health care spending an employer deposits funds into a special account for the employee these funds can be used to pay for eligible medical and related health care expenses for the employee and their dependents hsas provide employers and employees with greater control in both the amount of funds invested and how these funds are used   services and infrastructure provided by preaxia enable organizations and individuals to eliminate all paper involved in the management of these accounts and benefit through savings in time and money   the preaxia platform for processing and managing accounts including cardholder and customer account management reconciliation and financial settlement and customer reporting is fully operational   over time the company will evaluate opportunities for forms of virtual banking and paypaltype services one opportunity seen as particularly relevant to the health care market is to offer instant issuing services that enable corporations to issue and fund prepaid interac or credit card services to beneficiaries in real time if implemented the beneficiary will most likely select a personal identification number “pin” using a pin and card activation terminal thus gaining instant access to funds that can be reloaded this consideration would require development of software systems for the issuing of health payment cards and financial transaction processing services that would be fully managed by a data center matching of consumers in need of health care products or services with providers is another area preaxia intends to evaluate consumers managing their health care dollars through an online system will find convenience in seeking out health care professionals and services through the same system  distribution methods and marketing strategy preaxia operates on a cloud computing platform that makes it accessible to anyone with a personal computer and internet access the preliminary market for preaxia’s hsa management solution is small and medium sized companies that are not currently well served by the current group benefits model the financial benefits of the preaxia business model however are also relevant to larger employers and we believe that these larger employers will migrate to the preaxia product over time        preaxia’s s marketing strategy is to promote its existing platform direct to consumers and businesses and to the groups that most need access to it specifically independent brokers financial advisors and small to medium sized businesses need access brokers should see preaxia as a superior method of promoting and supporting hsas that allow them to earn above average commission rates on invested funds financial advisors should see preaxia in a similar way as brokers except that there is the additional benefit of tax reduction small to medium sized businesses which are expected to drive the growth in business should see preaxia as offering financial savings to the company and to employees by offering personal health care benefits through an hsa along with the same conveniences they have come to expect from other services they currently utilize over the internet it is expected that the group benefits market will subsequently follow as they too realize the advantages of preaxia over their current hsa offerings preaxia has begun and will continue to seek opportunities with lead customers and alliance partners to establish referenceable highprofile implementations and marketleading earlyadopter firms for further developing innovative products and services the company intends to design solutions targeted towards corporate financial management financial risk audit management and cash management while targeting productservice management as a support to financial management we anticipate that the prime target for services will be small to medium sized organizations that are not adequately served by the current insurance and group benefits offerings these organizations should realize significant benefits in both cost and time savings by utilization of preaxia technology while providing their employees with an increased level of benefits preaxia intends to achieve service volume and the associated economies of scale through marketing directly to select target customers that provide the necessary transaction volumes through market specific channel partners and through an education based public relations strategy geared to the small to midsized employers including the brokers and financial advisors utilized by these businesses the channel strategy is supported in the solution design as multiple channel partners will require branding and our company’s fee chargingcollection capabilities it is our company’s intention that brokers and financial advisors will aggressively promote their preaxia supported hsa offerings due to the quality of product higher margins and because of the noncompetitive relationship with preaxia preaxia has identified the following “channels” through which it will target prime end market customers independent brokers that sell or desire to sell health spending accounts financial advisors who manage funds and advise on tax saving strategies for individuals and corporations managing general agents that provide services and education to the broker community accountants and bookkeepers who regularly advise businesses on financial and operational matters benefits managersadjudicators including insurance health or outsourced government benefits processors that manage benefits disbursement issuer banks including partner banks that enable the issuance of health cards andor sell insurance products application providers including software manufacturers selling into the target vertical markets professional services including consulting development and implementation companies serving the target vertical markets        preaxia intends to establish several key customer reference accounts channel marketing partners and technology alliances these corporate relationships are relevant to advancing our company’s goals in  and beyond for achieving a prime position in the canadian marketplace and establishing a solid service foundation competitive business conditions and our company’s competitive position in the industry and methods of competition preaxia intends to offer a combination of products and services in its solution however there are other providers of components or versions of the health card value proposition in the marketplace our company is taking a different approach by providing a high value added and robust capability within specific target markets rather than the “one size fits all” and mass volume approach of the larger companies in the canadian and international market the following are some of the leading providers of products and services that are or may be potential competitors in preaxia’s target markets canadian market pay linx financial corporation is presently inactive but

anticipate that we will hire additional key staff throughout  in areas of administrationaccounting business development operations salesmarketing and researchdevelopment item a risk factors risks related to our company we have a limited operating history        we are in the early stages of development and face risks associated with a new company in a growth industry we may not successfully address these risks and uncertainties or successfully implement our operating strategies if we fail to do so it could materially harm our business to the point of having to cease operations and could impair the value of our common stock to the point investors may lose their entire investment even if we accomplish these objectives we may not generate positive cash flows or the profits we anticipate in the future preaxia has a limited operational history our company has never paid dividends and has no present intention to pay dividends our company is in the early commercialization stage of its business and therefore will be subject to the risks associated with early stage companies including uncertainty of revenues markets and profitability and the need to raise additional funding preaxia will be committing and for the foreseeable future will continue to commit significant financial resources to marketing product development and research preaxia’s business and prospects must be considered in light of the risks expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stage of development such risks include the evolving and unpredictable nature of our company’s business preaxia’s ability to anticipate and adapt to a developing market acceptance by consumers of our products and the ability to identify attract and retain qualified personnel there can be no assurance that preaxia will be successful in doing what is necessary to address these risks we will need substantial additional financing in the future to continue operations our ability to continue our present operations will be dependent upon our ability to obtain significant external funding additional sources of funding have not been established we are exploring various financing alternatives there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing such financing at acceptable terms if at all if adequate funds are not available from the foregoing sources or if we determine it is to otherwise be in our best interests we may consider additional strategic financing options including sales of assets we will require key personnel the financial services technology industry involves a high degree of risk which even a combination of experience knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome the success of preaxia is dependent on the services of its senior management the experience of these individuals will be a factor contributing to our company’s continued success and growth the loss of one or more of its key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business prospects in addition preaxia’s future success will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled technical management sales and marketing personnel there can be no assurance that our company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our company’s business operating results and financial condition we have additional financing requirements in order to accelerate preaxia’s growth objectives it will need to raise additional funds from lenders and equity markets in the future there can be no assurance that our company will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms to finance its growth objectives the ability of our company to arrange such financing in the future will depend in part upon the prevailing capital market conditions as well as the business performance of our company there can be no assurance that preaxia will be successful in its efforts to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to our company if additional financing is raised by the issuance of shares of common stock of our company control of our company may change and stockholders may suffer additional dilution we may not be successful in the protection of intellectual property there can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted or prosecuted against preaxia or that any such assertions or prosecutions will not materially adversely affect our company’s business financial condition or results of operations irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims our company could incur significant costs and diversion of resources with respect to the defense thereof which could have a material adverse effect on our company’s business financial condition or results of operations our company’s performance and ability to compete are dependent to a significant degree on its proprietary technology there can be no assurance that the steps taken by our company will prevent misappropriation of its technology or that agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable the laws of other countries may afford our company little or no effective protection of its intellectual property our company may in the future also rely on technology licenses from third parties there can be no assurance that these third party licenses will be or will continue to be available to our company on commercially reasonable terms the loss of or inability of our company to maintain any of these technology licenses could result in delays in completing its product enhancements and new developments until equivalent technology could be identified licensed or developed and integrated any such delays would materially adversely affect preaxia’s business results of operations and financial condition        our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are not effective which may cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public our management evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of may   and concluded that as of that date our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in addition our management evaluated our internal control over financial reporting as of may   and concluded that there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of that date and that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of that date a material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis we have not yet remediated these material weaknesses and we believe that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting continue to be ineffective until these issues are corrected our ability to report financial results or other information required to be disclosed on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected and our financial reporting may continue to be unreliable which could result in additional misinformation being disseminated to the public investors relying upon this misinformation may make an uninformed investment decision risks related to our business we face competition and may not be able to compete successfully preaxia may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the competitive pressures preaxia faces could harm its business and prospects broadly speaking the market for financial services technology is competitive there are other providers of components or versions of the health card value proposition in the marketplace additionally the level of competition is likely to increase as current competitors improve their product offerings and as new participants enter the market many of preaxia’s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases greater name and brand recognition and significantly greater financial sales marketing technical and other resources than preaxia additionally these competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow them to develop new or improved products that may compete with products preaxia markets and distributes new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may also increase competitive pressures on preaxia increased competition may result in reduced operating margins as well as loss of market share this could result in decreased usage of preaxia’s products and may have a material adverse effect on preaxia’s business financial condition and results of operations we may face implementation delays        most of preaxia’s customers will be in a testing or preliminary stage of utilizing preaxia’s products and may encounter delays or other problems in the introduction of preaxia’s products a decision not to do so or a delay in implementation could result in a delay or loss of related revenue or could otherwise harm preaxia’s businesses and prospects preaxia will not be able to predict when a customer that is in a testing or a preliminary use phase will adopt a broader use of preaxia’s products we may get limited customer feedback respecting products preaxia’s revenue will depend on the number of customers who use preaxia’s products accordingly the satisfactory design of preaxia’s product is critical to preaxia’s business and any significant product design limitations or deficiencies could harm preaxia’s business and market acceptance this limited feedback may not have resulted in an adequate assessment of customer requirements therefore the currently specified features and functionality of preaxia’s product may not satisfy current or future customer demands furthermore even if preaxia identifies the feature set required by customers in preaxia’s market it may not be able to design and implement products incorporating features in a timely and efficient manner if at all we may face a slowdown in developing markets the market for preaxia’s product is relatively new and continues to evolve if the market for preaxia’s product fails to develop and grow or if preaxia’s product does not gain market acceptance preaxia’s business and prospects will be harmed our ability to keep current with technological changes will impact our ongoing business the financial services technology industry is susceptible to technological advances and the introduction of new products utilizing new technologies further the financial services technology industry is also subject to customer preferences and to competitive pressures which can among other things necessitate revisions in pricing strategies price reductions and reduced profit margins the success of preaxia will depend on its ability to secure technological superiority in its product and maintain such superiority in the face of new products no assurances can be given that the product of preaxia will be commercially viable or that further modification or additional products will not be required in order to meet demands or to make changes necessitated by developments made by competitors which might render the product of preaxia less competitive less marketable or even obsolete over time the future success of preaxia will be influenced by its ability to continue to develop new competitive products there can be no assurance that research and development activities with respect to the development of new products and the improvement of its existing product will prove profitable or that products or improvements resulting therefrom if any will be successfully produced and marketed the financial services technology industry is characterized by technological change changes in user and customer requirements new product introductions new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render preaxia’s technology obsolete or have a negative impact on sales margins preaxia’s product may command preaxia’s performance will depend in part on its ability to enhance its existing product develop new proprietary technology that addresses the sophisticated and varied needs of its prospective customers and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and costeffective basis the development of technology entails significant technical and business risks there can be no assurance that preaxia will be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting its product to customer requirements or emerging industry standards we require strategic alliances preaxia’s growth and marketing strategies are based in part on seeking out and forming strategic alliances and working relationships as well as the performance of such strategic alliances and working relationships general criteria to be used to assess potential alliances include the following industry expertise reputation and market position complementary technologies or products and nature and adequacy of resources        we may have problems with our resolution of product deficiencies difficulties in product design performance and reliability could result in lost revenue delays in customer acceptance of preaxias’s products andor lawsuits and would be detrimental perhaps materially to preaxia’s market reputation serious defects are frequently found during the period immediately following the introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products undetected errors or performance problems may be discovered in the future moreover known errors which preaxia considers minor may be considered serious by its customers if preaxia’s internal quality assurance testing or customer testing reveals performance issues andor desirable feature enhancements preaxia could postpone the development and release of updates or enhancements to its current product or the release of new products preaxia may not be able to successfully complete the development of planned or future products in a timely manner or to adequately address product defects which could harm preaxia’s business and prospects in addition product defects may expose preaxia to liability claims for which preaxia may not have sufficient liability insurance a successful lawsuit against preaxia could harm its business and financial condition we may not be able to effectively manage our growth preaxia may be subject to growthrelated risks including capacity constraints and pressure on its internal systems and controls preaxia’s ability to manage its growth effectively will require it to continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems and to expand train and manage its employee base the inability of preaxia to deal with this growth could have a material adverse impact on its business operations and prospects preaxia may experience growth in the number of its employees and the scope of its operating and financial systems resulting in increased responsibilities for preaxia’s personnel the hiring of additional personnel and in general higher levels of operating expenses in order to manage its current operations and any future growth effectively preaxia will also need to continue to implement and improve its operational financial and management information systems and to hire train motivate manage and retain its employees there can be no assurance that preaxia will be able to manage such growth effectively that its management personnel or systems will be adequate to support preaxia’s operations or that preaxia will be able to achieve the increased levels of revenue commensurate with the increased levels of operating expenses associated with this growth          we have negative cash flow and absence of profits preaxia has not earned any profits to date and there is no assurance that it will earn any profits in the future or that profitability if achieved will be sustained a significant portion of preaxia’s financial resources will continue to be directed to the development of its products and to marketing activities the success of preaxia will ultimately depend on its ability to generate revenues from its product sales such that the business development and marketing activities may be financed by revenues from operations instead of external financing there is no assurance that future revenues will be sufficient to generate the required funds to continue such business development and marketing activities our directors and officers may face conflicts of interest certain directors and officers of preaxia may become associated with other reporting issuers or other corporations which may give rise to conflicts of interest directors who have a material interest or any person who is a party to a material contract or a proposed material contract with preaxia are required subject to certain exceptions to disclose that interest and generally abstain from voting on any resolution to approve the contract in addition the directors are required to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of preaxia as the case may be certain of the directors may have other employment other business or time restrictions placed on them and accordingly these directors will only be able to devote part of their time to the affairs of preaxia preaxia does not have key man insurance preaxia does not currently have key man insurance in place in respect of any of its senior officers or personnel acquisitions investments and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties dilution to our investors and other negative consequences it is our current intention to engage in and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions including acquisitions of companies businesses intellectual properties and other assets as of the date of filing of this annual report on form k we have not yet identified any such strategic transactions any of these strategic transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations in our search for opportunities to engage in strategic transactions we may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities we may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or investments or an acquisition or investment may not enhance our business or may decrease rather than increase our earnings in addition the process of integrating an acquired company or business or successfully exploiting acquired intellectual property or other assets could divert a significant amount of our management’s time and focus and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures additional risks we may face include the need to implement or remediate controls procedures and policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired company that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls procedures and policies cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from an acquired company or business into our organization retaining key employees from the businesses we acquire and the need to integrate an acquired company’s accounting management information human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management        future acquisitions and investments could involve the issuance of our equity securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased expenses any of which could harm our financial condition our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments fluctuations in quarterly operating results lead to unpredictability of revenue and earnings the timing of the release of health care payments processing products and services can cause material quarterly revenue and earnings fluctuations a significant portion of revenue in any quarter may be derived from sales of products and services introduced in that quarter or established in the immediately preceding quarter if we are unable to begin to generate sales of products and services during the scheduled quarter our revenue and earnings will be negatively affected in that period quarterly operating results also may be materially impacted by factors including the level of market acceptance or demand for health payment processing products and services and the level of development andor promotion expenses for health payment processing products and services consequently if net revenue in a period is below expectations our operating results and financial position in that period are likely to be negatively affected as has occurred in the past risks related to our common stock there is currently no trading market for our common stock there is currently no trading market for our common stock our common stock is not quoted on any exchange or interdealer quotation system there is no trading market for our common stock and our common stock may never be included for trading on any stock exchange or through any quotation system including without limitation the nasdaq stock market and the otc bulletin board you may not be able to sell your shares due to the absence of a trading market any market that develops for our common stock likely will be illiquid and the price of our common stock could be subject to volatility related or unrelated to our operations a decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital it may adversely impact our ability to continue operations and we may go out of business a prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital because we may attempt to acquire a significant portion of the funds we need in order to conduct our planned operations through the sale of equity securities a decline in the price of our common stock could be detrimental to our liquidity and our operations because the decline may cause investors to not choose to invest in our stock if we are unable to raise the funds we require for all our planned operations we may be forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations as a result our business may suffer and not be successful and we may go out of business we also might not be able to meet our financial obligations if we cannot raise enough funds through the sale of our common stock and we may be forced to go out of business because we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the near future our shareholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them we intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the near future the declaration payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon among other things the results of operations cash flows and financial condition operating and capital requirements and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant there is no assurance that future dividends will be paid and if dividends are paid there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend unless we pay dividends our shareholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them        our stock is a penny stock trading of our stock may be restricted by the sec’s penny stock regulations which may limit a shareholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock our stock is a penny stock the securities and exchange commission has adopted rule g which generally defines “penny stock” to be any equity security that has a market price as defined less than  per share or an exercise price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions our securities are covered by the penny stock rules which impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” the term “accredited investor” refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with a net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding  or  jointly with their spouse the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the sec which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account the bid and offer quotations and the brokerdealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s confirmation in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules consequently these penny stock rules may affect the ability of brokerdealers to trade our securities we believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock finra sales practice requirements may also limit a shareholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock in addition to the “penny stock” rules promulgated by the securities and exchange commission the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer a brokerdealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their noninstitutional customers brokerdealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status tax status investment objectives and other information under interpretations of these rules finra believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers finra requirements make it more difficult for brokerdealers to recommend that their customers

financial data not applicable        item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview our company undertakes all of its operations through preaxia canada our whollyowned subsidiary preaxia canada is a company which intends to deliver a comprehensive suite of solutions and services directed at the emerging health payment market specifically the opportunities tied to the growth of hsas there is a rapid shift in healthcare traditional payment models to consumerdirected healthcare that is creating significant opportunities for financial services and insurance industries to deliver new dynamic products to this emerging market spawned by the need to address escalating health care costs changes in the regulatory environment and the growing consumer desire for greater participation in the management of their health benefits the boundaries between health care and the financial services industries are becoming increasingly blurred with the trend towards selfdirected health payment solutions and the growing demand for faster easier and more convenient growth conduct studies suggest that hsa’s in the us reached  billion in assets and  million consumers in  an increase of more than  over the prior year this coupled with the continued growth of the canadian group insurance industry illustrates the emerging opportunity for innovative health payment services we intend to initially launch our products in canada we believe that canadian businesses are embracing a new healthcare financing vehicle to control costs increase profitability and get more return from their investment we intend to provide them with services to capture this market opportunity plan of operation over the next twelve months we plan to   a raise additional capital to execute our business plans and         b to penetrate the health payment processing market in canada and worldwide by continuing to develop innovative health payment processing products and services and         c build up a network of strategic alliances with several types of health insurance companies governments and other alliances in various vertical markets and         d fill the positions of senior management sales administrative and engineering positions          cash requirements after a further review of business opportunities with industry consultants for the next twelve months and given that we meet our forecasted expenses we plan to spend a total of approximately  in implementing our business plan of developing and marketing of health care processing products and services we do not expect to generate any revenues during the year therefore we will be required to raise a total of  to complete our business plan and pay our existing outstanding debts of approximately  our working capital requirements for both our company and preaxia canada for the next twelve months are estimated at  distributed as follows estimated expenses   general and administrative  research and development  marketing and education  professional services  total  our estimated expenses over the next twelve months are broken down as follows    general and administrative we anticipate spending approximately  on general and administration costs in the next twelve months which will include office rent office supplies transfer agents filing fees bank service charges salary for our administrator interest expense and travel which includes airfare meals car rentals and accommodations          research and development we anticipate that we may spend approximately  in the next twelve months in the maintenance of our development and additional acquisition of software for our processing services and products          marketing and education we anticipate spending approximately  on the costs of staff and personnel marketing and promoting our company our products and services and educating the public to attract new accounts including staff

condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders liquidity and capital resources

working capital deficit of  as of may   our company currently has little cash on hand our ability to meet our financial liabilities and commitments is primarily dependent upon the continued issuance of equity to new stockholders and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations our company’s cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the next twelve month period we will not initially have any cash flow from operating activities as we are in the startup stage with preaxia canada we project that we will require an estimated additional  over the next twelve month period to fund our operating cash shortfall calculated as  to cover our working capital deficit plus  for our projected cash request for the year ended may   our company plans to raise the capital required to satisfy our immediate shortterm needs and additional capital required to meet our estimated funding requirements for the next twelve months primarily through the private placement of our equity securities or by way of loans or such other means as our company may determine        there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain funds required for our continued operations there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or if available that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms if we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease the operation of our business there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further longterm financing successful and sufficient market acceptance of our products and achieving a profitable level of operations the issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders obtaining commercial loans assuming those loans would be available will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments our financial condition as at may   and may   and the changes between those periods for the respective items are summarized as follows working capital       may         may     current assets             current liabilities

report the terms we us our preaxia and the company means preaxia health care payment systems inc and its whollyowned subsidiary preaxia canada inc preaxia canada formerly preaxia health care payment system inc and before that h pay card ltd unless the context clearly requires otherwise general overview preaxia and preaxia canada are both development stage companies preaxia canada is a company which offers a comprehensive suite of solutions and services directed at the emerging health payment market specifically the opportunities tied to the growth of health spending accounts hsas and generally as a payment service between health care providers and consumers put differently preaxia offers a health care payment model that incorporates certain attributes of both paypal and virtual banking there is a shift in healthcare traditional payment models to consumerdirected healthcare that is creating significant opportunities for financial services and insurance industries to deliver new dynamic products to this emerging market the canadian economy has undergone unprecedented growth over the past two decades during this same period the internet has dramatically changed our way of communicating and conducting business this has had dramatic effects on key industries such as retail banking and travel consumers have shown a preference for relying on the internet to handle many aspects of their personal and professional lives this in turn has forced businesses to adapt while the health care industry has also grown during this time the consumer has seen neither cost nor efficiency savings comparable to what has occurred in other industries preaxia health care payment systems is a market disrupting technology that takes advantage of important trends in our society government budgets are strained with health care requiring a large and growing portion of these budgets it seems inevitable that efforts to reduce government expenditures are likely to target these health care expenditures reductions in government funding of health care services mean that individuals will have to take more individual responsibility for covering at least some of these costs the growing responsibility for directly funding ones own future health care expenditures combined with a desire to manage all sorts of financial dealings through the internet presents the opportunity that preaxia has now begun to exploit preaxia has found a better way to service an existing and growing need utilizing the internet to automate and eliminate paperwork the company was developed to reflect the growing demand for health spending accounts hsas as tax free vehicle for managing and controlling health care expenditures the growing interest in hsas has fuelled the need for fund management and adjudication services hence the creation and growth of third party administrators tpas the hsatpa clients are referred by brokerage firms and independent brokers who receive a referral commission the hsa industry is primarily focused on small to mediumsize businesses which can since  offer hsas as part of their employee benefits package the incentive for a traditional insurer such as manulife to service the small to mediumsize employer under  lives with anything other than their traditional premiumdriven health insurance products is on the whole too small to warrant significant ie costly marketing efforts or the introduction of competing hsatype products using health plan innovations including the hsa these new alternative providers of employee health benefits have successfully gained an estimated  share of the  billion canadian health benefits annual market description of health spending account hsa an hsa is a uniquely designed bank account established exclusively and specifically for the purpose of health care spending an employer deposits funds into a special account for the employee these funds can be used to pay for eligible medical and related health care expenses for the employee and their dependents hsas provide employers and employees with greater control in both the amount of funds invested and how these funds are used services and infrastructure provided by preaxia enable organizations and individuals to eliminate all paper involved in the management of these accounts and benefit through savings in time and money the preaxia platform for processing and managing accounts including cardholder and customer account management reconciliation and financial settlement and customer reporting is fully operational over time the company will evaluate opportunities for forms of virtual banking and paypaltype services one opportunity seen as particularly relevant to the health care market is to offer instant issuing services that enable corporations to issue and fund prepaid interac or credit card services to beneficiaries in real time if implemented the beneficiary will most likely select a personal identification number pin using a pin and card activation terminal thus gaining instant access to funds that can be reloaded this consideration would require development of software systems for the issuing of health payment cards and financial transaction processing services that would be fully managed by a data center distribution methods and marketing strategy preaxia operates on a cloud computing platform that makes it accessible to anyone with a personal computer and internet access the preliminary market for preaxias hsa management solution is small and medium sized companies that are not currently well served by the current group benefits model the financial benefits of the preaxia business model however are also relevant to larger employers and we believe that these larger employers will migrate to the preaxia product over time preaxias s marketing strategy is to promote its existing platform to the groups that most need access to it namely independent brokers financial advisors and small to medium sized businesses brokers should see preaxia as a superior method of promoting and supporting hsas that allow them to earn above average commission rates on invested funds financial advisors should see preaxia in a similar way as brokers except that there is the additional benefit of tax reduction small to medium sized businesses which are expected to drive the growth in business should see preaxia as offering financial savings to the company and to employees by offering personal health care benefits through an hsa along with the same conveniences they have come to expect from other services they currently utilize over the internet it is expected that the group benefits market will subsequently follow as they too realize the advantages of preaxia over their current hsa offerings preaxia has begun and will continue to seek opportunities with lead customers and alliance partners to establish referenceable highprofile implementations and marketleading earlyadopter firms for further developing innovative products and services the company intends to design solutions targeted towards corporate financial management financial risk audit management and cash management while targeting productservice management as a support to financial management we anticipate that the prime target for services will be small to medium sized organizations that are not adequately served by the

received  in respect of a subscription agreement for  shares at  per share these share issuances were approved by our board of directors there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain funds required for our continued operations there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or if available that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms if we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease the operation of our business there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further longterm financing
