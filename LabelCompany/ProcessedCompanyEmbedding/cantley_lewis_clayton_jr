chemistry in  cantley obtained his phd at cornell university in ithaca new york where he worked with gordon hammes on enzyme kinetics using fret to study enzyme conformational changes in  he moved to harvard university for a postdoctoral fellowship under guido guidotti where he discovered that an impurity in commercial preparations of atp vanadate acts as a transition state analog for phosphate hydrolysis in  cantley became assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at harvard being promoted to associate professor in  in  he became a full professor in physiology at tufts university school of medicine in  cantley and colleagues malcolm whitman david kaplan tom roberts and brian schaffhausen made the seminal discovery of the existence of phosphoinositidekinase pik in  cantley moved to harvard medical school as a professor of cell biology and the director of the division of signal transduction at the former beth israel hospital now beth israel deaconess medical center in  cantley became a founding member of the newly formed department of systems biology at harvard medical school in  cantley also became the director of cancer research at the beth israel deaconess medical center he joined the faculty of weill cornell medicine and newyorkpresbyterian hospital in  dr cantley was elected the chairman of the board of the hope funds for cancer research in   cantley is married to vicki sato herself a prominent figure in the pharmaceutical industry and a professor at harvard university in both the business and medical schools researchedit discovery of pikinase and ptdinspedit in a series of studies spanning several years cantley and colleagues demonstrated that a kinase activity associated with the middle t oncoprotein is a phosphoinositide kinase that it is a novel type of phosphoinositide kinase that phosphorylates the  position on the inositol ring and that this phosphatidylinositolkinase pikinase is activated by growth factors to produce novel phosphorylated phosphoinositides in particularly ptdinsp  that had previously been identified in physiologically stimulated human neutrophils in subsequent years cantley and colleagues identified critical aspects of the regulation of pikinase by growth factor receptors specifically they discovered that the catalytic subunit p dimerizes with the regulatory subunit p and that the sh domain of p specifically recognized phosphotyrosines on growth factor receptors or adaptor proteins via the pyxxm motif the cantley lab has also made seminal contributions to understanding signaling downstream of pikinase they discovered that the pleckstrin homology domain of akt binds to ptdinsp and ptdinsp and that this binding is critical for activation of akt catalytic activity they further demonstrated that tuberintsc is a critical substrate of akt and together with the laboratory of john blenis they discovered that akt phosphorylation of tuberintsc is required for activation of mtor torc kinase activity via regulation of the small gtpase rheb the cantley lab also was one of a few labs that nearly simultaneously identified lkb as a regulator of ampk that also serves to regulate torc for the discovery of pikinase and its role in cancer metabolism cantley was one of eleven recipients of the inaugural breakthrough prize in life sciences the worlds richest academic prize for medicine and biology the prize which carries a  million cash award recognizes excellence in research aimed at curing intractable diseases and human life the fundamental and farreaching nature of the discovery of pikinase together with cantleys role in mapping the upstream regulation of pikinase and the downstream signaling pathways have led to speculation that cantley is a likely candidate for the nobel prize in medicine or physiology the growing evidence for a primary role for pikinase in cancer and its critical role in insulin signaling have served to strengthen the significance of this fundamentally important discovery the first drug targeting the pikinase pathway as a treatment for cancer  idelalisib pik delta inhibitor  was approved by the fda as a treatment for leukemia and two types of lymphoma in july  other drugs are currently in clinical development use of oriented peptide libraries to determine phosphopeptide binding specificity and protein kinase substrate specificityedit in  the cantley lab published a novel strategy to determine the sequence specificity of phosphopeptide binding domains initially sh domains subsequently the oriented peptide library approach was extended to identify the substrate specificity of protein kinases toward synthetic peptides this approach was then extended to characterize the specificity of serthr kinases and phosphoserthr binding domains this approach was used to characterize the substrate specificity of a large number of protein kinases the kinase specificity matrices generated from these experiments served as the basis for creating the website scansite allowing the de novo identification of candidate phosphorylation sites in an arbitrary protein in later research the oriented peptide library approach has also been used to characterize protease cleavage specificity modification of the original oriented peptide approach has allowed for large scale kinomewide determination of protein kinase specificity discovery of ptdinspedit in  the cantley lab discovered that the enzymes that had been referred to as type ii pipkinases instead of using ptdinsp as a substrate in fact required ptdinsp as a substrate to produce ptdinsp further research demonstrated that ptdinsp is naturally occurring in all eukaryotes it is remarkable that of the seven naturally occurring phosphoinositides the existence of four of them ptdinsp ptdinsp ptdinsp and ptdinsp was discovered by cantley and colleagues role of metabolism in canceredit the role of pikinase in anabolic signaling by insulin igf and other growth factors makes a straightforward link between metabolism and cancer especially in light of the discovery that the pikca gene encoding pikinase is an oncogene in recent years cantley and colleagues have made additional links between metabolic regulation and oncogenic transformation with their discovery that the m isoform of pyruvate kinase is associated with cancer this discovery provides a molecular basis for understanding the warburg effect cantley is now a major player in the resurgence of the importance of the warburg effect in the process of oncogenesis role of pikinase in different cancersedit cantley was part of the stand up to cancer dream team that was brought together to investigate ways to target pikinase as a way to treat womens cancers and he now leads a national effort targeting triplenegative breast cancer and ovarian cancer with novel drug combinations recent research found that high levels of vitamin c halted the growth of aggressive forms of colorectal tumors his lab also elucidated the role of nrf in serine production in nonsmall cell lung cancer with potential implications for pancreatic and other cancers as well industrial

university in ithaca new york where he worked with gordon hammes on enzyme kinetics using fret to study enzyme conformational changes in  he moved to harvard university for a postdoctoral fellowship under guido guidotti where he discovered that an impurity in commercial preparations of atp vanadate acts as a transition state analog for phosphate hydrolysis in  cantley became assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at harvard being promoted to associate professor in  in  he became a full professor in physiology at tufts university school of medicine in  cantley and colleagues malcolm whitman david kaplan tom roberts and brian schaffhausen made the seminal discovery of the existence of phosphoinositidekinase pik in  cantley moved to harvard medical school as a professor of cell biology and the director of the division of signal transduction at the former beth israel hospital now beth israel deaconess medical center in  cantley became a founding member of the newly formed department of systems biology at harvard medical school in  cantley also became the director of cancer research at the beth israel deaconess medical center he joined the faculty of weill cornell medicine and newyorkpresbyterian hospital in  dr cantley was elected the chairman of the board of the hope funds for cancer research in   cantley is married to vicki sato herself a prominent figure in the pharmaceutical industry and a professor at harvard university in both the business and medical schools researchedit discovery of pikinase and ptdinspedit in a series of studies spanning several years cantley and colleagues demonstrated that a kinase activity associated with the middle t oncoprotein is a phosphoinositide kinase that it is a novel type of phosphoinositide kinase that phosphorylates the  position on the inositol ring and that this phosphatidylinositolkinase pikinase is activated by growth factors to produce novel phosphorylated phosphoinositides in particularly ptdinsp  that had previously been identified in physiologically stimulated human neutrophils in subsequent years cantley and colleagues identified critical aspects of the regulation of pikinase by growth factor receptors specifically they discovered that the catalytic subunit p dimerizes with the regulatory subunit p and that the sh domain of p specifically recognized phosphotyrosines on growth factor receptors or adaptor proteins via the pyxxm motif the cantley lab has also made seminal contributions to understanding signaling downstream of pikinase they discovered that the pleckstrin homology domain of akt binds to ptdinsp and ptdinsp and that this binding is critical for activation of akt catalytic activity they further demonstrated that tuberintsc is a critical substrate of akt and together with the laboratory of john blenis they discovered that akt phosphorylation of tuberintsc is required for activation of mtor torc kinase activity via regulation of the small gtpase rheb the cantley lab also was one of a few labs that nearly simultaneously identified lkb as a regulator of ampk that also serves to regulate torc for the discovery of pikinase and its role in cancer metabolism cantley was one of eleven recipients of the inaugural breakthrough prize in life sciences the worlds richest academic prize for medicine and biology the prize which carries a  million cash award recognizes excellence in research aimed at curing intractable diseases and human life the fundamental and farreaching nature of the discovery of pikinase together with cantleys role in mapping the upstream regulation of pikinase and the downstream signaling pathways have led to speculation that cantley is a likely candidate for the nobel prize in medicine or physiology the growing evidence for a primary role for pikinase in cancer and its critical role in insulin signaling have served to strengthen the significance of this fundamentally important discovery the first drug targeting the pikinase pathway as a treatment for cancer  idelalisib pik delta inhibitor  was approved by the fda as a treatment for leukemia and two types of lymphoma in july  other drugs are currently in clinical development use of oriented peptide libraries to determine phosphopeptide binding specificity and protein kinase substrate specificityedit in  the cantley lab published a novel strategy to determine the sequence specificity of phosphopeptide binding domains initially sh domains subsequently the oriented peptide library approach was extended to identify the substrate specificity of protein kinases toward synthetic peptides this approach was then extended to characterize the specificity of serthr kinases and phosphoserthr binding domains this approach was used to characterize the substrate specificity of a large number of protein kinases the kinase specificity matrices generated from these experiments served as the basis for creating the website scansite allowing the de novo identification of candidate phosphorylation sites in an arbitrary protein in later research the oriented peptide library approach has also been used to characterize protease cleavage specificity modification of the original oriented peptide approach has allowed for large scale kinomewide determination of protein kinase specificity discovery of ptdinspedit in  the cantley lab discovered that the enzymes that had been referred to as type ii pipkinases instead of using ptdinsp as a substrate in fact required ptdinsp as a substrate to produce ptdinsp further research demonstrated that ptdinsp is naturally occurring in all eukaryotes it is remarkable that of the seven naturally occurring phosphoinositides the existence of four of them ptdinsp ptdinsp ptdinsp and ptdinsp was discovered by cantley and colleagues role of metabolism in canceredit the role of pikinase in anabolic signaling by insulin igf and other growth factors makes a straightforward link between metabolism and cancer especially in light of the discovery that the pikca gene encoding pikinase is an oncogene in recent years cantley and colleagues have made additional links between metabolic regulation and oncogenic transformation with their discovery that the m isoform of pyruvate kinase is associated with cancer this discovery provides a molecular basis for understanding the warburg effect cantley is now a major player in the resurgence of the importance of the warburg effect in the process of oncogenesis role of pikinase in different cancersedit cantley was part of the stand up to cancer dream team that was brought together to investigate ways to target pikinase as a way to treat womens cancers and he now leads a national effort targeting triplenegative breast cancer and ovarian cancer with novel drug combinations recent research found that high levels of vitamin c halted the growth of aggressive forms of colorectal tumors his lab also elucidated the role of nrf in serine production in nonsmall cell lung cancer with potential implications for pancreatic and other cancers as well industrial activitiesedit lewis c cantley has been

important discovery the first drug targeting the pikinase pathway as a treatment for cancer  idelalisib pik delta inhibitor  was approved by the fda as a treatment for leukemia and two types of lymphoma in july  other drugs are currently in clinical development use of oriented peptide libraries to determine phosphopeptide binding specificity and protein kinase substrate specificityedit in  the cantley lab published a novel strategy to determine the sequence specificity of phosphopeptide binding domains initially sh domains subsequently the oriented peptide library approach was extended to identify the substrate specificity of protein kinases toward synthetic peptides this approach was then extended to characterize the specificity of serthr kinases and phosphoserthr binding domains this approach was used to characterize the substrate specificity of a large number of protein kinases the kinase specificity matrices generated from these experiments served as the basis for creating the website scansite allowing the de novo identification of candidate phosphorylation sites in an arbitrary protein in later research the oriented peptide library approach has also been used to characterize protease cleavage specificity modification of the original oriented peptide approach has allowed for large scale kinomewide determination of protein kinase specificity discovery of ptdinspedit in  the cantley lab discovered that the enzymes that had been referred to as type ii pipkinases instead of using ptdinsp as a substrate in fact required ptdinsp as a substrate to produce ptdinsp further research demonstrated that ptdinsp is naturally occurring in all eukaryotes it is remarkable that of the seven naturally occurring phosphoinositides the existence of four of them ptdinsp ptdinsp ptdinsp and ptdinsp was discovered by cantley and colleagues role of metabolism in canceredit the role of pikinase in anabolic signaling by insulin igf and other growth factors makes a straightforward link between metabolism and cancer especially in light of the discovery that the pikca gene encoding pikinase is an oncogene in recent years cantley and colleagues have made additional links between metabolic regulation and oncogenic transformation with their discovery that the m isoform of pyruvate kinase is associated with cancer this discovery provides a molecular basis for understanding the warburg effect cantley is now a major player in the resurgence of the importance of the warburg effect in the process of oncogenesis role of pikinase in different cancersedit cantley was part of the stand up to cancer dream team that was brought together to investigate ways to target pikinase as a way to treat womens cancers and he now leads a national effort targeting triplenegative breast cancer and ovarian cancer with novel drug combinations recent research found that high levels of vitamin c halted the growth of aggressive forms of colorectal tumors his lab also

prominent figure in the pharmaceutical industry and a professor at harvard university in both the business and medical schools researchedit discovery of pikinase and ptdinspedit in a series of studies spanning several years cantley and colleagues demonstrated that a kinase activity associated with the middle t oncoprotein is a phosphoinositide kinase that it is a novel type of phosphoinositide kinase that phosphorylates the  position on the inositol ring and that this phosphatidylinositolkinase pikinase is activated by growth factors to produce novel phosphorylated phosphoinositides in particularly ptdinsp  that had previously been identified in physiologically stimulated human neutrophils in subsequent years cantley and colleagues identified critical aspects of the regulation of pikinase by growth factor receptors specifically they discovered that the catalytic subunit p dimerizes with the regulatory subunit p and that the sh domain of p specifically recognized phosphotyrosines on growth factor receptors or adaptor proteins via the pyxxm motif the cantley lab has also made seminal contributions to understanding signaling downstream of pikinase they discovered that the pleckstrin homology domain of akt binds to ptdinsp and ptdinsp and that this binding is critical for activation of akt catalytic activity they further demonstrated that tuberintsc is a critical substrate of akt and together with the laboratory of john blenis they discovered that akt phosphorylation of tuberintsc is required for activation of mtor torc kinase activity via regulation of the small gtpase rheb the cantley lab also was one of a few labs that nearly simultaneously identified lkb as a regulator of ampk that also serves to regulate torc for the discovery of pikinase and its role in cancer metabolism cantley was one of eleven recipients of the inaugural breakthrough prize in life sciences the worlds richest academic prize for medicine and biology the prize which carries a  million cash award recognizes excellence in research aimed at curing intractable diseases and human life the fundamental and farreaching nature of the discovery of pikinase
