york city bristolmyers squibb operates research facilities in several countries including belgium france the uk and japan according to the company’s  annual report  percent of its global sales are in the us with  percent in europe its stated mission is “to discover develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases” at the end of  the company reported it had  new compounds in clinical development bristolmyers squibb headquarters the company is known for biological and pharmaceutical research producing the antipsychotic abilify which it helps market and its blood thinners plavix and eliquis as well as cancer drug opdivo sales for opdivo alone went from  million in  to  billion in  eliquis sales rose from  billion in  to  billion the following year those numbers have a downside as bristolmyers has faced criticism that it relies too heavily on a small number of drugs which could threaten its future opdivo and eliquis were responsible for almost  percent of its revenue in the first quarter of  over a yearlong period ending may   the company’s stock shares ranged in price from  to  “the underlying assumption” says a report in forbes “is that opdivo will live up to most of its potential and eliquis will continue to be competitive and displace market leader xarelto however there is some degree of unpredictability in the lung cancer market at which the company hinted during its earnings call the competition is increasing as lung cancer is a key target for big pharma players because of the strong market potential” after a rough go for its stock in  there had been talk of possible takeover but analysts later concluded the company was not a good candidate for acquisition it has also run into some legal trouble along the way during the s the company faced accusations of deceptive advertising campaigns and fda violations bms has also had to deal with litigation related to two of its successful diabetes products byetta and bydureon as reports of people suffering adverse events related to eliquis and the type  diabetes drug farxiga grow bristolmyers may face even more litigation history the two companies that combined to form bristolmyers squibb in  share long histories of research and product development in  a young us navy doctor named edward robinson squibb became so dissatisfied with the poor quality of medicines available during the mexican war that he created his own pharmaceutical laboratory er squibb md was founded in brooklyn to produce consistently pure medicines during the civil war squibb became a major source of medicines for the union army he invented the “squibb pannier” a compact medical kit that doctors could use on the battlefield william mclaren bristol and john ripley myers founded the second half of the company in  after investing  in a failing drug manufacturing firm called clinton pharmaceutical company the friends installed themselves as president and vice president within a decade they developed a national bestseller “sal hepatica” a mineral salt laxative bristolmyers origin in  the company changed its name from clinton pharmaceuticals to bristol myers the comma was eventually replaced with a hyphen the company struggled during the great depression and refocused its efforts on more lucrative consumer products such as laxatives and deodorant er squibb and sons continued to produce medical products and drugs such as castor oil and antibiotics during world war ii both companies became leading suppliers of penicillin for the war effort by  squibb operated the largest penicillin production plant in the world in new brunswick new jersey after the war and into the s both squibb and bristolmyers expanded their production and research of antibiotics they merged in  creating a powerhouse pharmaceutical company that was the secondlargest in the world at the time since then bristolmyers squibb has continued to pursue cuttingedge clinical research while maintaining a significant philanthropic program in  bms spun off a medical devices division zimmer holdings inc in  in the culmination of a series of deals over the years to buy or partner with other drug companies bristolmyers squibb announced the acquisition of amylin pharmaceuticals a biopharmaceutical company focused on research development and commercialization of type  diabetes drugs including the troubled byetta and bydureon investigations settlements in  bms reportedly persuaded wholesale customers to purchase about  billion more of drugs than they needed so the company could meet its sales goal that year the accounting gimmick known as “channel stuffing” resulted in a sharp drop in revenue the next year and investigations by the us securities and exchange commission and the us justice department frederick schiff the former chief financial officer was indicted on securities fraud charges the company agreed to pay a total of  million in restitution in  bms agreed to pay more than  million to resolve a broad array of cases involving its drug marketing and pricing in addition to overcharging the government for drugs bms was also accused of promoting offlabel use of the antipsychotic abilify and setting inflated prices for a wide array of drugs the us food and drug administration fda in  sent a warning letter to bristolmyers squibb demanding compliance with regulations citing microbiological contamination of drug products environmental contaminations in facilities and a lack of a scientifically sound standard for sampling plans and test procedures some of these infractions were repeat violations from inspections in  and  problematic products bristol has also faced serious problems with some of its drugs two of these products — byetta and bydureon — resulted in lawsuits against amylin and bms could face liability as well the first eliquis lawsuit was filed in  and lawsuits have been filed alleging injuries from taking farxiga as well byetta and bydureon learn about byetta byetta is a twicedaily injection approved by the fda to treat type  diabetes bydureon — a longerlasting version of byetta — is injected once a week with  million in sales in  byetta was a tremendous success for its developer amylin pharmaceuticals when bms acquired amylin in august  it gained control of its blockbuster diabetes medications — and possibly liability for the drugs in a  study patients taking byetta were found to be six times more likely to contract pancreatitis a dangerous condition that causes the pancreas to become inflamed and can lead to hospitalization or death data also indicated byetta patients could be up to  times more likely to contract pancreatitis than patients taking other drugs in the same class these dangerous side effects resulted in lawsuits that could affect bristolmyers dozens of cases have been filed and more are expected as more patients and their families become aware of dangerous complications that may have resulted from their use of byetta or bydureon courts consolidated cases against byetta and bydureon as well as other type  diabetes drugs into a multidistrict litigation court in the us district court southern district of california where more than  cases are pending eliquis learn about eliquis eliquis a newer bloodthinning drug is prescribed for the prevention of dangerous blood clots and stroke in patients with a common type of abnormal heart rhythm developed in partnership with pfizer as an alternative to the blood thinner warfarin eliquis joins pradaxa and xarelto as a nextgeneration anticoagulant the fda approved eliquis in  two years after pradaxa and one year after xarelto sales of eliquis grew from  million in  to  million in  but studies linked pradaxa and xarelto to a very dangerous side effect – uncontrollable bleeding patients on warfarin can take vitamin k to counteract bleeding but there is no known antidote for nextgeneration anticoagulants the manufacturer of pradaxa settled thousands of lawsuits that claimed the drug causes uncontrollable bleeding and death for  million in  hundreds of lawsuits have been filed against the manufacturer of xarelto claiming the drug caused the same side effect those cases have already been consolidated in multidistrict litigation the first lawsuit claiming eliquis caused uncontrollable bleeding and death was filed in  and in february   federal cases from around the united states were consolidated in multidistrict litigation being heard in the southern district of new york farxiga learn about farxiga after being rejected twice by the fda because of concerns with its association with bladder cancer bms finally received approval to market its type  diabetes drug farxiga dapagliflozin in january  farxiga is a sodiumglucose cotransporter  sglt inhibitor that stops glucose from being reabsorbed less than a year after farxiga entered the market the fda warned that sglt inhibitors could cause a potentially fatal condition called ketoacidosis other studies also indicated people taking farxiga have a high risk of developing bladder cancer in  the fda warned a similar sglt inhibitor invokana could increase the risk of bone fractures and decrease bone mineral density it said it would investigate the safety of other sglt inhibitors like farxiga in june  the fda strengthened its warning about the kidney risk for people taking farxiga and invokana the agency said patients should seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs of acute kidney injury such as decreased urine or swelling of the legs or feet but should not stop taking their medication without talking to their doctors farxiga is also the subject of multidistrict litigation in the southern district of new york where  cases from various federal jurisdictions are being managed the cases allege the drug caused injuries including diabetic ketoacidosis and kidney damage plavix approved in  plavix clopidogrel is an anticoagulant prescribed for people with risk of cardiovascular problems including heart attacks and strokes the drug went on to be the top selling drug in the united states generating  billion in sales for the company in  but the patent expired in  and generic versions were approved for the market studies have questioned the effectiveness and safety of the drug in  the fda added a boxed warning for the antibloodclotting medication stating that people who didn’t effectively metabolize the drug don’t effectively convert plavix to its active form in the liver giving healthcare providers guidance poor metabolizers were estimated to be between  and  of the population fda warning using plavix at the same time as omeprazole a proton pump inhibitor can reduce plavix’s effectiveness the fda has also warned against using plavix at the same time as omeprazole a proton pump inhibitor antacid which is found in prilosec otc zegerid otc and generic drugs taking the two substances at the same time can significantly reduce the effectiveness of plavix as of early  bms was being sued in more than  cases by people who claimed they or their loved ones were injured in some cases fatally from taking plavix the cases were pending around the country including in new jersey delaware new york and california lawsuits alleged that although bms marketed plavix as “providing greater cardiovascular benefits while being safer and easier on a person’s stomach than aspirin” the drug actually created a substantial risk of “heart attack stroke internal bleeding blood disorders or death” in june  bms won a significant victory in the us supreme court which ordered the dismissal of  plavix cases brought in california by people from other states the decision left only  remaining cases brought in california by californians the ruling limited cases to either the state where the company is located – in the case of bms that would be new york – or where the plaintiffs reside the decision had immediate and ongoing effects on mass litigations across the country involving other products and companies the first impact of the ruling beyond plavix came within hours of the decision when a judge in missouri declared a mistrial in a trial involving outof–state plaintiffs suing johnson  johnson because their loved ones died from ovarian cancer after using talcum powder the future bristolmyers squibb has taken a hard hit in the last couple of years because of expirations on several of its most lucrative patents — including plavix less than a month after the fda approval of farxiga bms sold its global diabetes business that was part of its collaboration with astrazeneca astrazeneca purchased the business for  billion but bms will receive royalties and salesbased milestones for its diabetes drugs until  going forward the company plans to focus on a strong research pipeline and double down on its “string of pearls” strategy the string of pearls plan is an effort to accelerate discovery and development of new therapies by partnering with or acquiring both small and large pharmaceutical competitors today more than  percent of bms’s research pipeline and  percent of its revenue come from partnerships or alliances with other companies author elaine silvestrini elaine silvestrini is a career journalist with a strong desire to learn explain and help

devices are also lucrative the us makes up about half of the world’s share of the market at about  billion according to the us department of commerce us based big pharma companies meanwhile drug prices continue to rise consulting firm segal consulting expects drug prices for americans under age  to rise  percent in  in contrast wages are only expected to rise  percent leaving many american unable to afford their medications big pharma even contributes heavily to the annual budget of the us food and drug administration fda through application fees user fees for its new products experts say the industry contributes about two thirds of the fda’s budget five of the top  pharma and medical device companies for  are headquartered in the us johnson  johnson pfizer merck gilead and abbvie the underside of the industry reveals a history of fraud bribery product liability lawsuits and scandals that led to billions in settlements — a known cost of doing business for these companies who are “too big to jail” despite criminal charges and fines the companies continue to do business who is big pharma the majority of drugs and medical devices have ties to a small group of parent companies prescription drugs and devices manufactured by these companies bring in billions in profits the biggest drug makers may also have subsidiaries that manufacture medical devices pharmaceutical companies are typically larger and make more money than companies that focus on medical devices the most powerful drug and device companies are members of the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma — the industry’s us lobbying organization with the help of staggering profits and an army of  paid lobbyists the industry spreads its influence on capitol hill from  to  big pharma spent nearly  billion on lobbying expenses — more than any other industry in  alone it spent about  million — more than the defense industries and corporate business lobbyists combined fact only  percent of americans have a good opinion of big pharma only  percent of americans have a good opinion of big pharma in fact they are the second most hated industry in the us they are also the biggest defrauder of the federal government under the false claims act according to consumer watchdog group public citizen the reputation institute evaluated public perception of  pharmaceutical companies for products and services innovation workplace governance citizenship and financial performance the institute based its results on  ratings from the us uk canada and other countries of all the countries

devices but some drug manufacturers such as johnson  johnson also manufacture devices fact part of the total pharmaceutical industry lobbying price tag comes from the medical device manufacturers association mdma like big pharma medical device manufacturers also have a lobbying group to pursue their interests in washingtonpart of the total pharmaceutical industry lobbying price tag comes from

knee implants hospital beds boston scientific marlborough massachusetts ivc filters surgical mesh big pharma’s influence critics contend that big pharma uses manipulative tactics and expensive advertising to sway lawmakers the fda and the public to increase sales the public is exposed to pharma’s misleading promotions and advertising for example critics say abbvie and other companies who make testosterone replacement drugs such as androgel marketed their drugs as the fountain of youth to older men they created a marketing campaign around the condition “low t” that featured a quiz for men to selfdiagnose low t symptoms androgel above was marketed as the “fountain of youth” with few studies to back it up the testosterone market soared into the billions as a result but few studies back up drugcompany claims that the drug significantly enhances mood vitality and sexual performance studies also link these drugs to heart problems the fda added a warning on the label after millions of men were already exposed to the risk the american public is not the only sector of society influenced by big pharma’s techniques doctors scientists and research organizations medical journals teaching hospitals and university medical schools all exhibit disturbing conflicts of interest between their publicly stated missions and their financial and ideological subjection to big pharma doctors conduct research with funds from big pharma private charities and foundations account for a mere  percent of the estimated  billion spent on biomedical research in the us each year pharmaceutical and medical device companies contribute approximately  percent big pharma has a track record of hiring former government workers with valuable connections to gain political clout the trade group phrma has many current or former staff members who once served in the political arena including  who worked for a member of congress  who worked for a federal agency  who worked for a congressional committee two who worked for the white house one who worked in the court system using these connections to pursue industry goals big pharma has a significant competitive advantage over the public interest marketing research and development rd and drug cost americans pay more than any other country in the world for pharmaceuticals — in some cases thousands of dollars more per prescription big pharma says this occurs because of the astronomical costs of developing a new drug cost facts while companies claim each new drug costs them  billion the true cost is more like  million the truth is that us law allows drug companies to set the prices for drugs and protects them from freemarket competition other countries set a limit on what companies can charge based on the benefit of the drug the true cost of developing a drug is shrouded in mystery with many unverifiable figures reported by big pharma donald light a professor and expert on the pharma business model said that while companies claim each new drug costs them  billion the true cost is more like  million the industry also avoids talking about how much it spends on marketing which is almost double what it spends on research big pharma sways opinions the large amount of cash big pharma bestows on government representatives and regulatory bodies is small when compared with the billions it spends each year on directtoconsumer advertising the us is one of only two countries in the world whose governments allow prescription drugs to be advertised on tv the other is new zealand in  big pharma spent  billion on directtoconsumer ads and fired off about  ads an hour according to nielsen big pharma also employs doctors researchers and institutions the industry persuades doctors to allow ghostwriting paying physicians to attach their names to positive articles about a particular drug with the goal of seeing it published in a reputable medical journal paid copywriters were used in advertising paxil above often the commentary is little more than an advertisement penned by a company paid copywriter showcasing a new product big pharma used ghostwriting to promote numerous drugs including the antidepressant paxil the recalled weight loss drug fenphen the antiepilepsy drug neurontin the antidepressant zoloft and painkiller vioxx to name a few in addition even when a medical reviewer writes a comprehensive assessment of a new drug for a medical journal it is common practice for those supposedly unbiased professionals to be on big pharma’s payroll these slanted studies appear in medical journals that are widely hailed as collections of unbiased scientific evaluation and separated from the long financial arm of pharmaceutical industry influence yet richard smith former editor of the british medical journal says “all journals are bought — or at least cleverly used — by the pharmaceutical industry” big pharma tends to weaken the objectivity of even the most honest health professionals while encouraging them to overprescribe medications consider the numbers advertising instead of research for every  spent on “basic research” big pharma spends  on promotions and advertising distribution of free drug samples the us has one pharmaceutical sales representative for every five officebased physicians sponsorship of symposiums and medical conventions drug and medical device makers spend lavishly on doctors including covering meals travel seminars and conventions that sometimes look more like vacations many medical journals including the esteemed journal of the american medical association jama actively vie for the attention of big pharma advertising dollars billing themselves as the best way for drug companies to reach their professional readership how big pharma influences doctors and researchers part of big pharma’s formula for creating blockbuster drugs is promoting to physicians and providing kickbacks and incentives to prescribe their expensive brand name drugs fact in  big pharma spent  billion on physician advertising according to pew charitable trusts drug companies also buy doctors meals and pay them for “speaking engagements” in exchange for brand loyalty one  study in jama internal medicine found that when drug reps bought doctors just one meal costing less than  they were more likely to prescribe a promoted brand name drug according to propublica’s dollars for docs investigation  companies paid  billion to doctors and hospitals from august  to december  drug and device company payments to doctors from select companies august  to december  company payments depuy johnson  johnson  million stryker corporation  million astrazeneca  million pfizer  million janssen pharmaceuticals  million glaxosmithkline  million boston scientific  million big pharma and researchers then there are medical researchers who are hardly immune to big pharma’s financial power because drug companies sponsor clinical trials that researchers are paid to administer too often the academics and scientists are hired hands who supply human subjects and collect data according to the instructions of their corporate employers sponsors keep the data analyze it write the papers and decide whether and when and where to submit them for publication drug companies also stagemanage trials to produce predetermined outcomes that will put their products in the best light medical schools and big pharma big pharma has also infiltrated medical schools teachers department chairs and deans often sit on drug companies’ boards of directors this influences educational content money from big pharma supports programs within many medical schools and teaching hospitals and company reps are given access to young doctors to promote their company’s drugs the result is that doctors not only receive biased information but also learn a drugintensive style of medicine sales reps may influence these doctors to believe that newer more expensive drugs are always better than old ones in most states doctors must also take accredited education courses called continuing medical education cme the pharmaceutical industry provides a substantial proportion of the billions spent on cme annually and continues to use that support as a marketing tool in addition academic centers are able to receive royalties from big pharma on any drug or technology they help to create and patent as a result of research — sometimes underwritten with government funds columbia university for example received nearly  million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companies during the year life of its medical school’s patent on a method for synthesizing certain biological products columbia university received nearly  million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companiesbig pharma fraud settlements in a year period big pharma companies paid  settlements totaling  billion for marketing fraud according to public citizen’s  report pharmaceutical industry settlements  through  fact in a year period big pharma companies paid  settlements totaling  billion for marketing fraud the most common charge involved drugpricing scams against state medicaid programs this meant state taxpayers ended up footing the bill while big pharma made billions unlawful promotion of drugs yielded the biggest settlements but these investigations take many years to complete by then drug companies have made hundreds of millions or even several billion while the us department of justice fine is typically only a few million this makes it too profitable to stop breaking the law for many companies according to michael bobelian of forbes magazine manufacturer directory several of the biggest drug and medical device companies sell the majority of their products in the us many of these products are involved in product liability litigation some of the companies’ bestselling drugs brought in over a billion in

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
