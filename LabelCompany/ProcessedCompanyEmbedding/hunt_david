effective debugging author andrew hunt david thomas holger gast henry s warren diomidis spinellis page count     pub date     binding paperback hardcover hardcover paperback series none none none effective software development series description straight from the programming trenches the pragmatic programmer cuts through the increasing specialization and technicalities of modern software development to examine the core processtaking a requirement and producing working maintainable code that delights its users it covers topics ranging from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse while most developers today use objectoriented languages the full power of objects is available only to those with a deep understanding of the object paradigm how to use objects will help you gain that understanding so you can write code that works exceptionally well in the real world author holger gast focuses on the concepts that have repeatedly proven most valuable and shows how to render those concepts in concrete code he explores crucial intricacies clarifies easily misunderstood ideas and helps you avoid subtle errors that could have disastrous consequences  hank warren once again compiles an irresistible collection of programming hacks timesaving techniques algorithms and tricks that help programmers build more elegant and efficient software while also gaining deeper insights into their craft warren’s hacks are eminently practical but they’re also intrinsically interesting and sometimes unexpected much like the solution to a great puzzle they are in a word a delight to any programmer who is excited by the opportunity to improve diomidis spinellis helps experienced programmers accelerate their journey to mastery by systematically categorizing explaining and illustrating the most useful debugging methods strategies techniques and tools drawing on more than thirtyfive years of experience spinellis expands your arsenal of debugging techniques helping you choose the best approaches for each challenge he presents vendorneutral examplerich advice on general principles highlevel strategies concrete techniques highefficiency tools creative tricks and the behavioral traits associated with effective debugging editorial reviews amazoncom review programmers are craftspeople trained to use a certain set of tools editors object managers version trackers to generate a certain kind of product programs that will operate in some environment operating systems on hardware assemblies like any other craft computer programming has spawned a body of wisdom most of which isnt taught at universities or in certification classes most programmers arrive at the socalled tricks of the trade over time through independent experimentation in the pragmatic programmer andrew hunt and david thomas codify many of the truths theyve discovered during their respective careers as designers of software and writers of code some of the authors nuggets of pragmatism are concrete and the path to their implementation is clear they advise readers to learn one text editor for example and use it for everything they also recommend the use of versiontracking software for even the smallest projects and promote the merits of learning regular expression syntax and a textmanipulation language other perhaps more valuable advice is more lighthearted in the debugging section it is noted that if you see hoof prints think horses not zebras that is suspect everything but start looking for problems in the most obvious places there are recommendations for making estimates of time and expense and for integrating testing into the development process youll want a copy of the pragmatic programmer for two reasons it displays your own accumulated wisdom more cleanly than you ever bothered to state it and it introduces you to methods of work that you may not yet have considered working programmers will enjoy this book david wall topics covered a useful approach to software design and construction that allows for efficient profitable development of highquality products elements of the approach include specification development customer relations team management design practices development tools and testing procedures this approach is presented with the help of anecdotes and technical problems read more from the publisher as a reviewer i got an early opportunity to read the book you are holding it was great even in draft form dave thomas and andy hunt have something to say and they know how to say it i saw what they were doing and i knew it would work i asked to write this foreword so that i could explain why simply put this book tells you how to program in a way that you can follow you wouldnt think that that would be a hard thing to do but it is why for one thing not all programming books are written by programmers many are compiled by language designers or the journalists who work with them to promote their creations those books tell you how to talk in a programming languagewhich is certainly important but that is only a small part of what a programmer does what does a programmer do besides talk in programming language well that is a deeper issue most programmers would have trouble explaining what they do programming is a job filled with details and keeping track of those details requires focus hours drift by and the code appears you look up and there are all of those statements if you dont think carefully you might think that programming is just typing statements in a programming language you would be wrong of course but you wouldnt be able to tell by looking around the programming section of the bookstore in the pragmatic programmer dave and andy tell us how to program in a way that we can follow how did they get so smart arent they just as focused on details as other programmers the answer is that they paid attention to what they were doing while they were doing itand then they tried to do it better imagine that you are sitting in a meeting maybe you are thinking that the meeting could go on forever and that you would rather be programming dave and andy would be thinking about why they were having the meeting and wondering if there is something else they could do that would take the place of the meeting and deciding if that something could be automated so that the work of the meeting just happens in the future then they would do it that is just the way dave and andy think that meeting wasnt something keeping them from programming it was programming and it was programming that could be improved i know they think this way because it is tip number two think about your work so imagine that these guys are thinking this way for a few years pretty soon they would have a collection of solutions now imagine them using their solutions in their work for a few more years and discarding the ones that are too hard or dont always produce results well that approach just about defines pragmatic now imagine them taking a year or two more to write their solutions down you might think that information would be a gold mine and you would be right the authors tell us how they program and they tell us in a way that we can follow but there is more to this second statement than you might think let me explain the authors have been careful to avoid proposing a theory of software development this is fortunate because if they had they would be obliged to warp each chapter to defend their theory such warping is the tradition in say the physical sciences where theories eventually become laws or are quietly discarded programming on the other hand has few if any laws so programming advice shaped around wannabe laws may sound good in writing but it fails to satisfy in practice this is what goes wrong with so many methodology books ive studied this problem for a dozen years and found the most promise in a device called a pattern language in short a pattern is a solution and a pattern language is a system of solutions that reinforce each other a whole community has formed around the search for these systems this book is more than a collection of tips it is a pattern language in sheeps clothing i say that because each tip is drawn from experience told as concrete advice and related to others to form a system these are the characteristics that allow us to learn and follow a pattern language they work the same way here you can follow the advice in this book because it is concrete you wont find vague abstractions dave and andy write directly for you as if each tip was a vital strategy for energizing your programming career they make it simple they tell a story they use a light touch and then they follow that up with answers to questions that will come up when you try and there is more after you read ten or fifteen tips you will begin to see an extra dimension to the work we sometimes call it qwan short for the quality without a name the book has a philosophy that will ooze into your consciousness and mix with your own it doesnt preach it just tells what works but in the telling more comes through thats the beauty of the book it embodies its philosophy and it does so unpretentiously so here it is an easy to readand usebook about the whole practice of programming ive gone on and on about why it works you probably only care that it does work it does you will see ward cunningham read more see all editorial reviews product details paperback  pages

no thank you for your feedback top customer reviews out of  starsa classicbywilliam leuon september  format paperbackverified purchasei absolutely love this book i originally got it in  as a textbook for one of my college classes we didnt have to actually read it for the course though  i guess it was just something extra the school could charge us for after i graduated and a few years into the workforce as a professional programmer programming d graphics at the johnson space center i decided to read this mystery book that was dusting on my bookshelfi was surprised at how much information i could relate to the anecdotes and guidelines it outlines are things that i would have told my younger self when i started programming if i had the chance earlier this year i reread the book just to revisit the tips that were being outlined and they still make perfect sensewhat exactly is this book about its series articles containing tips that are meant for programmers who want to be effective and efficient who program as a profession who have project risks that need to be evaluated teammembers they need to work with code that needs to meet quality standards code that is maintained as legacy the moment its compiled and shipped and its about considering your value as a programmer to the company and updating and grooming your skills to advance your careerevery single tip and anecdote in the book may not apply to everybody and you may not agree with all of them but i believe its essential reading for anyone who wants a fulfilling career in software development id say the best time to read the book would be about  months to  years after youve started working professionally that gives some time to make realworld experiences relevant and understandable to what the book is preaching  but early enough in your career to leverage its knowledge for the futureread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starslearn think program perfectbypeter j hansonon june  format paperbackverified purchasethis book provides sound practical advice that makes sense on almost any development project the pragmatic programmer is not limited to a specific niche or language – any developer can take and apply these principles it employs a good familiar writing style which makes the book easy to digest and the material is quick to absorb and applythomas and hunt present content that is useful for everyone from the novice to the expert they organize their advice into approximately  topics that cover a wide range of programming best practices the tips build on each other throughout and are loosely categorized so that tips on similar themes are grouped together to get the most out of it i suggest reading the whole book or at least sizeable sections beginning to end to clearly see how they integrate however because there are so many tips integrating them all at once initially may be difficult it’s easy to bite off more than you can chew here so perhaps a good starting point is to begin with the tips that are most relevant for you and branch out from there a couple of sections resonated strongly with me a useful practice that i operate by and push my developers to operate by is refactoring chapter  – “while you are coding” p  this book provides a framework for the appropriate mindset to take on how to handle and maintain a code base in refactoring you don’t relate the software so much to a construction project but to creating and maintaining a garden – code is dynamic and its environment is ever changing you’ll need to adapt and adjust code as the project moves along and developers need to operate from the mindset that they’ll need to change things and adapt their code as they proceed another practice that i follow extensively is design by contract chapter  – “pragmatic paranoia” p  or the idea that you buildstructure elements to a defined contract this could be a contract between systems classes or even functions i use this approach with both my local developers and external developers and this book gives a good framework and guidelines on how applications and classes need to work for example i can define a contract for how a base class and its subclasses need to work and interact and then work with a developer to provide the specific implementation for that class i also use this approach for apis when coordinating with an external team to handle an exchange of datai’m a software architect and developer with over  years of industry experience across a number of languages and systems and i’ve completed hundreds of projects both individually and with technical and crossdisciplinary teams of varying sizes most of the subjects covered in this book are best practices i look for or insist on establishing on my projects to ensure work moves along smoothly during development this book covers the spectrum – it’s equally useful to me my project managers and developers and those just getting into our industry it’s a solid book to return to every once in a while to make sure you’re in alignment with best practices i highly recommend it to both new and experienced developers i hope it helps you as much as it’s helped meread more comments  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsinconsistent but some gemsbyjames leiberton october  format paperbackverified purchasethe good the advice on metaprogramming is probably the strongest part of the book i really liked the clarity of the examples the key idea is that you should program the structure and methods in code and provide the detailed implementation business rules algorithms etc as data the advice on code generators little languages and plain text interfaces is solid advice worth reiterating and the sections on these are good however i preferred the treatment offered by jon bentley in his really excellent programming pearls books the section on automation is a healthy reminder that programmers should have a do it once or automate philosophy the section on contractdriven development is worthy and echoes current practice jon bentleys version is a more theoretical conceptual approach less polluted by particular industry practices the sections on testdriven development is fine but the ideas are much better handled by kent becks booksthe not so good the chapters on pragmatism specification team work and discipline fit nicely with the general themes of the book but say very little of practical value if you are interested in operating in a team environment this isnt the book you are looking for the section on programming methodologies is so wishywashy its hard to know what advice if any to take away from it references to specific resources are somewhat out of date the book was written  years agothe pragmatic programmer is worth the price but if you are thinking of buying this book because you are a relatively new programmer and are looking for advice i would strongly suggest first reading the much better booksjon bentleys programming pearls and more programming pearlskernighan and pikes the practice of programmingkent becks extreme programming explainedanother book you might be interested in is susan lammers programmers at work although it is very old  its interesting that most of the programmers interviewed discuss exactly the same themes picked up in the pragmatic programmerin case you were also thinking about buying a copy of code complete which is also often recommended to new programmers also hold off  its far too long and a great
