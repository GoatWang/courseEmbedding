for usaa managed portfolio shareholders by usaa ‎  pm by bob landry cfa chief investment officer usaa investment management company   at the halfway mark of  the dominant market themes are the same as when the year started – the trump economic plan and the federal reserve’s decisionmaking and just like back then questions are plentiful nowadays and clear answers remain scarce an optimistic vision of economic growth under trump lifted asset prices in the months following the november election investors rushed to position themselves for major tax cuts regulatory rollbacks and an infrastructure boom over the past eight months some regulatory actions have been taken but the rest is still in the promise phase   now the big question we and others are asking is “which of the big targets is hittable and when” there’s been talk about taxes and infrastructure – if that talk starts to look like it could turn into action that lifts the economy some of that postelection optimism could return   the uncertainties have not affected the buoyancy of us large caps so far in  figure  though smallcap stocks that soared immediately after the election have come back to earth international equities have fared better while soft oil and metals prices have dragged down commodities   fed direction signs of a weakening economy – firstquarter gdp growth came in at a paltry   and inflation is ebbing – have spurred questions about the fed’s future direction   policymakers raised shortterm interest rates in june it was the fourth increase in the slow tightening cycle that began in december  the fed also announced it will gradually trim the  trillionplus now held on its balance sheet   where do we go from here on rates the fed says it will hike again before yearend to head off any inflationary pressures during a period of near full employment based on current yields however the bond market appears unconvinced the year treasury’s yield has tumbled from  to around  in the past few months as investors respond to softening economic data   the fed clearly wants to stay on pace with its slow tightening but if mediocre data persists a late  rate increase may be delayed the fed has tended to play it safe during the long grinding recovery that began in  this scenario would support asset prices and it would also fit our “lowish for longer” outlook on rates   growth  value us stocks continued their strong performance with the standard  poor’s  index further stretching already rich valuations in a lowvolatility environment sharperthanexpected earnings growth contributed to the equity exuberance   growthoriented sectors of the sp are leading the way as investors take on more risk in pursuit of decent returns in a slow economy technology health care and consumer discretionary are at the top of the leader board at the other end are energy telecom and financials – value sectors that typically fare better when gdp growth is stronger   value turned in a strong  but this year it has reverted to the weakgrowth trend that has dominated the past decade in our view the lack of clarity on economic policy issues coming out of washington is certainly contributing to value’s vast underperformance in  that said value sectors that serve as bond substitutes are mostly doing ok – these include utilities and consumer staples     moving overseas equities in nonus developed markets dm most notably the eurozone and emerging markets em are catching a tailwind generated by economic growth and improving corporate fundamentals   through the first six months of  both dm and em stocks were up by double digits well ahead of the performance of the sp  and because those asset classes have not enjoyed the same sort of multiyear returns as us equities their relative undervaluation compared to us stocks figure  enhances their appeal   risks are down but not completely gone for dm there are still open questions about bad debt at big european banks and we worry a bit that a volatility spike in us stocks could be contagious for em a revived us dollar could hurt as could changes to us trade policy    the top contributors to the ump portfolios in the second quarter were our exposure to nonus developed markets and us fixed income   as we discussed above the brightening trend for gdp growth albeit from a low base and corporate results combined with attractive relative valuations largely defines the opportunity we see in developed markets   international stock rallies have been known to last for years so once we were confident that underlying conditions could be sustainable we swapped expensive assets for cheap ones by trimming our tactical allocation to us largecap stocks and adding to developed markets our exposure to value stocks was a headwind for us large cap performance   our fixedincome tilt toward credit has been a major driver of ump returns over the past year over that time spreads to comparable treasury bonds have tightened significantly – this suggests they may not be as meaningful going forward   we believe however that corporate bond prices – particularly high yield  may be resilient   higher revenue and earnings for us companies stand to reduce default risks and rockbottom treasury yields continue to push income investors toward credit in addition lower inflation could stay the fed’s hand on a secondhalf rate bump but if the fed opts to act high yield’s low correlation to treasuries make the asset class less sensitive to interest rate changes   our allocations to us small cap stocks and alternatives were positive on an absolute basis in q but they underperformed stocks and thus detracted from our relative performance it’s worth a reminder that alternatives were added to the ump portfolios as diversifiers because of their low correlation to other asset classes – they would be expected to lag in a robust environment for equities         as always our advice to members is to remain focused on the longterm investment plan that you have put so much thought into for those ump shareholders who may be uneasy about market risk in general or have concerns about current assetclass allocations we recommend
