the inventionthis invention is directed to devices to perform apheresis of mammalian blood including the selective removal of some percentage of circulating galectin gal from the blood the device has the capability to not only remove galectin or other galectins from the blood but other potentially harmful factors and introduce to the blood additional factors that are therapeutic or beneficial on return of the blood to the mammalian patient background of the inventionthis invention is related to the subject matter disclosed and claimed in us patent application ser no  filed sep   and ser no  filed dec   the disclosure of both these cases is incorporated hereinbyreference where permitted by law applicant claims the benefit of the filing date of these two applicationsgalectin has become the focus of a variety of studies looking to explain mechanisms giving rise to inflammation fibroses and various forms of cancer in mammals by “mammals” in this application applicant intends to describe humans of course but also mammals of sufficient value worth investing in their health including companion mammals like dogs and cats and commercial mammals like cows horses goats and pigs higher order mammals such as monkeys which may serve as research models as well as companion animals are also included with this term the invention of course focuses on humansgalectins are a family of lectins sugar binding proteins that are characterized by having at least one carbohydrate recognition domain crd with an affinity for betagalactosides these proteins were recognized as a family only recently but are found throughout the animal kingdom and are found in mammals birds amphibians fish sponges nematodes and even fungigalectins mediate and modulate a wide variety of intracellular and extracellular functions and thus are both expressed within the cell and frequently targeted to a specific cytosolic site and secreted from the cell for distribution extracellularly as a component of human plasma among the many functions that are mediated by extracellular galectins are inflammation fibrosis formation cell adhesion cell proliferation metastatic formation angiogenesis cancer and immunosuppressiongalectins are a family of fifteen  carbohydratebinding proteins lectins highly conserved throughout animal species most galectins are widely distributed though galectin  and  show tissuespecific distribution while galectins are variably expressed by all immune cells they are upregulated in activated b and t cells inflammatory macrophages natural killer nk cells and foxp regulatory t cells galectins contain a variety of structural arrangements but a relatively conserved carbohydrate recognition domain crd the majority of galectins display a single crd and are biologically active as monomers galectin and  or require homodimerization for functional activity galectin and alternatively tandemrepeattype galectins galectin and  contain two crds separated by a short linker peptide while galectin chimeric type has a single crd fused to a nonlectin domain that can be complexed with other galectin monomers to form an oligomeric pentamer of note some galectins such as galectin bind to mannosecontaining glycans among the family of galectins   and  are particularly important as potential therapeutic targets and   and  also appear implicated in a variety of biological pathways associated with morbidity and mortalitythus galectin has been implicated in the development of certain forms of cancer st pierre et al front biosci    and in a variety of specific cancers including gal  and  in the context of colon and breast cancer barrow et al clin cancer res     squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue alves et al pathol res pract     has been shown to be associated with elevated levels of gal  and  while cervical squamous carcinoma has been shown linked to gal levels zhu et al int j cancer august  a number of galectins including gal gal and gal have been demonstrated to be linked to implantation and pregnancy concerns see eg than et al eur j biochem    lewis et al biol reprod    a number of galectins including gal   and others have been identified as correlating with various autoimmune disorders such as lupus salwati et al j infect dis     pal et al biochim biophys acta     and janko et al lupus   elevated levels of a number of galectins including gal are associated with inflammation and fibroses encountered in wound healing and the like gal et al acta histochem cytochem    quite obviously mediation of inflammatory and fibrotic pathways makes galectins critical elements of a wide variety of disease injury and trauma related phenomena in many cases the presence of unwanted concentrations of galectins can aggravate a disease condition or trauma situation or interfere with attempts to treat diseases such as cancer or congestive heart failure among the family of galectins recognized as active in humans galectin galectin and galectin are of particular interest as indicated above these proteins are generally referred to and referred to herein as gal gal and gal a wide variety of conditions in humans ranging from problems in conceiving to asthma to chronic heart failure to cancer to viral infection to stroke and beyond are mediated or aggravated by higher than normal concentrations of galectins thus among other galectins gal is particularly prominent in fibrosis inflammation and cell proliferation while gal also plays a role in the immunosuppression required for a successful pregnancy gal is also thought to be involved in the differentiation of nerve cells gal has been shown to be involved in the control of lesions arising from immunoinflammatory diseases and is generally implicated in inflammation—gal apparently plays a role in eosinophil recruitment in inflammatory sites it also appears to mediate apoptosis in certain activated cells while the discussion herein is applicable to circulating active gal gal and gal and galectins in general where elevated circulating galectin levels are associated with disease or injury conditions more has been elucidated about the role of gal in disease and trauma progression than any of the other galectins and so it is exemplified herein more specifically this invention focuses on the removal of active gal from mammalian particularly human plasma gal has been shown to be involved in a large number of biological processes many of which are related to disease states of various kinds binding and blocking activity of gal in the circulation or removal of large amounts of gal from circulation may therefore improve existing medical treatments suppress andor reduce inflammation and fibrosis resulting from others and make it possible to intervene in various disease states not otherwise easily treated the invention is equally applicable to the reduction in circulating levels of other active galectins to address conditions mediated by those galectins by “active” galectins what is referred to is biologically active molecules as noted for example gal can be active that is mediate mammalian responses to various traumas and conditions as a monomer and as an oligomer in any mammal at any given time significant amounts of gal and other galectins are present in an inactive state—that is they are either tissue bound or ligand bound in such fashion as to inhibit molecular interaction while such galectins molecules may become active and may be or become the target of removal by the invention disclosed herein when monitoring patient conditions and controlling responses the focus of the invention is a device suitable for the removal of active galectins from the blood stream this invention makes use of plasmapheresis sometimes referred to as apheresis andor therapeutic plasma exchange to control levels of gal and more specifically biologically active galectin in circulation whole blood is first separated into its cellular and plasma components plasma is then led through a fluid pathway and either intermixed with a gal binding agent which can be separated from the plasma or returned to the body with blocked inactivated gal or led past a solid support which binds gal the plasma being subsequently returned to the body with a reduced level of gal thus this invention can be used to remove bound gal as part of a strategy to reduce total gal content the focus in this application however is to remove active or unbound gal as a therapeutic measurerelated artthis application is related to us patent application ser no  filed jun   that application in turn claims priority benefit to us pat no  issued apr   the content of both these parent documents is expressly incorporated hereinbyreference in us patent application ser no  us patent publication us a a method of treating cell proliferation conditions inflammation and aggravated fibroses is disclosed which involves the administration of an agent that can bind circulating gal such as modified citrus pectin mcp a citrus pectin which has a reduced molecular weight of twenty thousand  daltons or less preferably ten thousand  daltons or so mcp is available commercially from econugenics of santa rosa calif and is discussed in us pat nos  and background of the biologygal is approximately  kda and like all galectins contains a carbohydraterecognitionbinding domain crd of about one hundred thirty  amino acids that enable the specific binding of βgalactosides gal is encoded by a single gene lgals located on chromosome  locus qq this protein has been shown to be involved in a large number of biological processes the list set forth herein is exemplary only as new situations and roles for gal are continually being revealed among the biological processes at the cellular level that have been shown to be mediated at least in part by gal are cell adhesion cell migration cell invasion cell activation and chemoattraction cell growth and differentiation angiogenesis and apoptosisgiven gals broad biological functionality it has been demonstrated to be involved in a large number of disease states or medical implications studies have also shown that the expression of gal is implicated in a variety of processes associated with heart failure including myofibroblast proliferation fibrogenesis tissue repair inflammation and ventricular and tissue remodeling elevated levels of gal in the blood have been found to be significantly associated with increased morbidity and mortality they have also been found to be significantly associated with higher risk of death in both acute decompensated heart failure and chronic heart failure populationsvarious investigations have shown elevated levels of gal to aggravate a wide variety of disease conditions associated with cell proliferation high levels of gal are linked to cancer growth and cancer progression to a metastatic stage in a stunning variety of cancers a number of cancers have been specifically linked to or associated with elevated gal levels including liver cancer kidney cancer breast cancer prostate cancer colon cancer thyroid cancer cancer of the gallbladder nasopharyngeal cancer lymphocytic leukemia lung cancer melanoma multiple myeloma glioblastoma multiforme uterine cancer ovarian cancer cervical cancer brain cancer and others elevated gal levels have also been shown to interfere with or suppress conventional antineoplastic regimens such as chemotherapeutic treatments like cisplatin doxorubicin and related chemotherapeuticsinflammation is a commonly encountered body condition—a natural response of the body to a variety of diseases and trauma as with the other conditions noted above gal levels above normal levels are implicated in a wide variety of situations where harmful inflammation is encountered again the list of conditions and disease states is too extensive to exhaust every possibility but inflammatory conditions associated with elevated gal levels include aggravated inflammation associated with nondegradable pathogens autoimmune reactions allergies ionizing radiation exposure diabetes heart disease and dysfunction atherosclerosis bronchial inflammation intestinal ulcers intestinal inflammation of the bowels cirrhosisassociated hepatic inflammation parasitic infection associated inflammation inflammation associated with viral infection inflammation associated with fungal infection inflammation associated with bacterial infection inflammation associated with infection by intracellular organisms and associated infections such as tuberculosis sarcoidosis cat scratch fever mycoplasma lymes disease bartonellosis ehrlichiosis rickettsial diseases babesiosis and others inflammation associated with arthritis with multiple sclerosis psoriasis alzheimers disease parkinsons disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als may also be addressed again while inflammation is a pathway frequently employed by the body in responding to any number of challenges elevated levels of gal have been found to aggravate and promote the inflammation causing damage and injury leading to morbidity or mortality in a wide variety of situations that are otherwise manageable including inflammation due to heavy metal poisoning pesticides oxidative agents xenoestrogens and similar toxins stroke and related ischemic injuries liver inflammation due to acetaminophen a number of tcell mediated responses generally involved in autoimmune diseases and the like gal is also involved with kidney injury and kidney disease hepatitis pulmonary hypertension and fibrosis diabetes and gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis crohns disease celiac disease and othersas noted elevated levels of circulating active gal are associated with and apparently promote a number of inflammatory conditions including those contributing to cardiovascular kidney lung brain and liver diseases gal is also associated with a fibrotic formation particularly in response to organ damage higher levels of circulating gal are found to induce pathogenic fibroses in cardiovascular disease gastroenterological disease cardiovascular trauma renal tissue trauma brain trauma lung trauma hepatic tissue trauma tissue damage due to radiation therapy and diseases and conditions of connective tissue and skin such as systemic sclerosisaccordingly the art is replete with observations that elevated levels of gal as well as gal and gal can complicate or exacerbate a wide variety of disease and injury conditions it would be of value to find a way to control inflammation and formation of fibroses where the inflammation and fibroses are injurious particularly in the environments described above and notably in cardiac care and other organ tissue disease and trauma by the same token it would be of value to control the cellular responses mediated by gal that accelerate cell proliferation and transformation including the formation and growth of tumors the transformation of cancer cells and metastatic spread of cancer another goal in the art is to avoid the problem posed by the interference of elevated gal levels in the treatment of cancer by conventional agents like bleomycin doxorubicin adriamycin and other anthracyclines cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine as well as targeted biological agents such as vegf and egf inhibitors examples being bevacizumab avastin and erbitux cetuximab some of the side effects caused by these agents are gal mediated and can be addressed and ameliorated by the invention while their mechanism of action can be blocked by gal enhancing angiogenesis elevated gal levels also appear to interfere with pharmaceuticals used in other applications such as the antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone cordarone and statin drugsplasmapheresis is a blood separation technology where blood is diverted from the body through a needle or catheter to a separator which removes blood cells and returns them to the body leaving plasma cells are returned to the body when plasma has been reunited with the cellular components or a replacement fluid has been added to the blood cells this type of technique has been used historically in the treatment of autoimmune diseases where the antibodies at issue are removed by contacting the plasma with the ligands to which they bind the plasma is then augmented as required with anticoagulants therapeutics and associated elements recombined with the blood cells and returned to the body in prior art methods employing plasma exchange or replacement therapies generally as illustrated in us patent publication us  the technology was used to target and remove “toxic serum components” such as ammonia uric acid and cell growth inhibitors the same reference at  warns against the use of plasma exchange in general similar warnings are sounded in kyles et al am j crit care    reviewing the use of plasmapheresis for support of immunoglobulin sepsis treatment noting that traditionally plasmapheresis has been used in treatments to remove pathogenic autoantibodies and endotoxins in autoimmune disorders and to remove harmful substances produced by the infecting organisms causing sepsisbackground of plasmapheresis devicesan early form of apparatus for plasmapheresis is set forth in us pat no  which describes measures to ensure return of treated plasma as well as the separated blood cells to the proper donor us pat no  addresses plasmapheresis by centrifugation the method used to separate out the red blood cells on a rapid and nearcontinuous basis us pat nos  and  each describe a variety of methods of separating out plasma contents and returning the treated plasma to the patient after first removing red blood cells in general to reduce blood viscosity by removal of high molecular weight protein while the invention that is the subject of this application focuses on the reduction in galectins circulating levels such as gal levels and not high molecular weight proteins or directly addressing viscosity the disclosure of these four  patents is incorporated hereinbyreference for their disclosure of available plasmapheresis techniques and apparatus which may generally be employed in this invention advances in apheresis generally including plasmapheresis have demonstrated the effectiveness of the use of hemodialysis equipment using a highly permeable membrane like the plasmaflo aph from asahi medical and a standard dialysis machine in ultrafiltration mode this is similar to hemoperfusion in applicationsummary of the inventionthe plasmapheresis device of this invention advances the art by providing for the selective removal of gal from the plasma that has been separated out of the whole blood of a mammal in need of active gal reduction as referenced in copending us patent applications ser no  filed sep   and ser no  filed dec   the removal of active gal from the blood stream of a mammal may be effected to address unwarranted inflammation to reduce the danger posed by fibrosis particularly cardiac fibroses to reduce the danger or spread of a variety of cancers to enhance treatments etc the critical requirement of this plasmapheresis device therefore is the selective removal of gal this is affected by directing separated plasma through a component that selectively binds gal this may be a column container or similar platform in which a material which positively binds gal such as an antibody thereto is physically held so that as the plasma passes through a significant fraction of the gal entrained therein is bound by the column in other embodiments the selective gal removal is effected by combining the stream of plasma in the conduit of the machine with a material which binds to the gal and then itself is easily removed either by an antibody specific to it or by secondary means such as attached magnetic particles which can be drawn out by selective application of a magnetic chargethe invention is not limited to the removal of gal however ideal machines provide this selective removal capability with the capability to remove other components from the blood which may either mediate or reinforce disease conditions as only one example of possible scenarios the machine may be provided with multiple removal or absorption columns with one removing gal and a second removing tnfα and a third removing tgfβ or the same column having multiple filters in sequential order to remove these three additional examples of compounds to be removed are creactive protein crp fibrinogen nfkβ different inflammatory cytokines etc which may be implicated in a patient with chronic inflammation in a variety of disease states including cancer not only will treating the blood in the inventive device remove reinforcing inflammation response enhancers but by doing so and possibly removing receptors for these markers which block them—the effectiveness of antineoplastic medications or treatments can be enhanced thus the device of the invention advantageously includes multiple columns or removal elements for selectively removing not only gal but other agents commonly found to be elevated in the blood of individuals with a variety of both chronic and acute conditionsas also described in the priority cases though effective treatment may depend not only on selective removal of gal from the blood and other blood agents but it may depend on the addition of therapeutic or beneficial elements before the blood is returned to the mammal often addition of the agent to the plasma is an effective and efficient means of administration of the treatment such as a medication vitamin or similar component thus while not essential to the selective removal of gal the inventive device of this invention includes multiple ports for the addition of a variety of agents to the plasma and coined whole blood examples include various homeopathic medications metabolism regulators immune reaction modifiers pharmaceuticals and various cytotoxic compounds anti microbial agents chelating agents possibly targeted ones to aid in treatmentbrief description of the drawingsthe accompanying drawings which are incorporated herein and constitute part of this specification illustrate exemplary embodiments of the invention and together with the general description given above and the detailed description given below serve to explain the features of the inventionfig  is a broad schematic illustration of the device of this invention reflecting separation of whole blood into blood and plasma treatment of the plasma return of the plasma to the blood component and restoration of the treated whole blood to the patientfig  is an illustration schematic of the portion of the device where plasma is separated out of the blood which can occur via one of several existing separation technologies treated in at least one column and returned via a conduit to the blood and donorfig  is a schematic of the inventive device deliberately echoing the structure of fig  but reflecting the ability of this device to introduce multiple columns and ports to both remove and add a variety of components to the plasma and ultimately the patientdetailed description of the preferred embodimentsdescriptionthe plasmapheresis device of this invention is depicted generally in fig  blood is withdrawn from mammalian patient  typically through insertion of a venous catheter either peripheral in a limb or central vein central veins allow higher flow rates and are more convenient for repeat procedures but are more often the site of complications especially bacterial infection the catheter is not part of the inventive device per se and is typically provided by the operator eg a clinic or hospital the catheter is connected to the conduit of the device  and positive flow assisted by pump  distributes the blood through the systemonce blood is being removed from the body of the patient per se the plasmapheresis device begins in the normal method thus as a first step in the use of the device an anticoagulant such as heparin or a nonnatural substance like acenocoumarol or phenindione is provided at portal  the addition of an anticoagulant effective to prevent clotting induced by flow through the conduit and return to the patient is essential in many individuals a portal will be provided between the addition of the anticoagulant and the bloodplasma separation device  will be of value as illustrated in fig  but is not essentialto reduce viscosity and pressure and make treatment practical and effective cellular components such as red blood cells erythrocytes white blood cells wbc and platelets are removed and separated from the plasma this is affected at separation device  the separation device may be any conventionally used centrifuge separation is an old process in the art it may include discontinuous flow centrifugation where one venous catheter is used and aliquots of blood perhaps up to about  ml are removed at a time and centrifuged to remove blood cells from the plasma continuous flow centrifugation is also known which reduces the amount of blood out of the body at any given time but requires the use of two venous lines this is the more commonly used method where blood is drawn out from one site and returned through another site usually in two different limbs the catheters used allow for reverse of the flow almost always continuous flow is used with only  ml of blood being outside the body extracorporeal at a given time this procedure usually pulls out an average of  mlminute of blood and can filter  times plasma volume in about  hours flow rate and plasma volume to be filtered can be adjusted based on the medical needsas an alternative to centrifugation membrane plasma separation using nowstandard dialyzing membranes may be gentler but may increase the time spent in treatmentas a general observation support and supervision of the patient is required throughout the use of the inventive device though the device can be largely automated this is not a device generally suitable for home or unsupervised use to that end an operator control station or interface is provided which allows for directed control as well as automation of virtually any function of the device including levels of agents such as anticoagulant added speed of transport type of column port sampling and the like it is practical and possible to continuously monitor a wide variety of mammalian indications using the device and sampling ports are provided to that end part of the operating platform may include a monitor that checks pulse rate oxygen saturation basic ecg rhythm and blood pressureat separation unit  the stream removed from mammalian patient  is split with red blood cells and other cellular components supported in fluid being directed on to return prior to return one or more ports are typically provided in this line there may be a variety of reasons for removing cells at this point this can be combined with the plasma separation device but ports are provided for removing various cells in addition to separating the blood cells including cells such as stem cells t cells b cells nk cells etc there is more opportunity for capture of various cells from the plasma and use or return but this operation can be combined with and integrated into plasma separation unit the plasma from the separator is driven by pump  through at least one column  column  contains as described above one or more elements that selectively bind or remove gal from the plasma in the most traditional format the “column” is a tube which is lined with a physically fixed binding agent such as an antibody bound to the interior wall of the tube through an agent like sepharose but a wide variety of antibodybinding proteins compatible with in vitro plasma passage are well known including protein a protein g and protein l other binders such as negatively charged compounds resins glycoproteins etc can be used as the plasma passes through the conduit it necessarily ‘bathes’ the binding moieties which selectively remove a percentage of gal from the plasma the columns may be of any variety known and as indicated above may in fact not be “traditional columns” such as spin columns but may in fact be open passages where gal is selectively bound by modified particles such as particles of pectin which are biologically compatible or the galectin binding molecule nacetyllactosamine or modified pectin such as citrus pectin these particles are typically modified to include an element which makes their fixation andor removal straightforward such as a magnetically attractable particle to be bound by a suitable magnet the nature of the column is not particularly limited save that it must selectively bind gal size and number of the columns will vary and ideally the device of the invention can accommodate a different number of columns based on the needs of the patient one column may be effective in removing for example  or more of the active gal in the patients circulation while ten percent will be effective to produce therapeutic effects in many patients in some patients depending on the nature of the selection criteria including eg selection for relief from inflammation as opposed to inhibition of the spread of metastatic cancer more removal may be required to this end the device of the invention may be provided with multiple columns  thus use of the device may be effective in removing fifteen per cent twenty percent or even more on up to perhaps forty per cent of circulating gal the amount of gal selectively removed by columns  is effectively limited by the flow dynamics of the system binding affinities of materials and the needs of the patient regeneration columns can be put in place parallel to one another so one can be regenerated or cleaned and the machine can switch between them automatically at certain plasma volume intervals associated features commonly employed in the art of plasmapheresis include pressure lines for the whole blood the plasma and for columns with each having pressure filters and pressure monitoring lines separate pumps are needed for whole blood and then for the plasma flow route and then also for certain types of columns such as double regeneration adsorption columns since they flush and clean out and alternate back and forth they need their own pump also commonly employed are air detectors blood leakage detectors conductivity detectors blood warmers waste bagslines etc and input lines for fluid for column regeneration these are collectively referred to herein as column support elementsfollowing plasma treatment including the selective removal of gal the plasma flow is recombined with the cellular components rbc wbc platelets flow and the recombined blood is returned to the patient often some level of augmentation using synthetic plasma albumin auxiliary blood cells and sometimes saline solution are used to ease flow return by addition through ports to the device conduits speeds and pressures observed are conventional accordingly treatment may include several hours where the patient is connected to the machine effective treatment depends on a wide variety of factors including those of the patient and the capacity of the machine itself oftentimes treatment occurs more than once a week and in acute cases more than once a day gal concentration as well as the concentration of other agents targeted for the patient in question is monitored both in the returned plasmablood and in the blood being withdrawn to allow monitoring and equilibration when active gal levels have been reduced to a beneficial level the withdrawal of blood is ended and on return of the last plasmablood to the patient the treatment is overfig  reflects the “plasma loop” of the device as shown the whole blood removed from the patient is entrained in conduit  after the addition of anticoagulant in fig  bloodplasma separation occurs at separation device  which is optionally a membrane separation device where passage is permissive based on size plasma is shunted in the direction of the arrows as shown while the red blood cells and other cellular components continue on through conduit  the principal feature of this loop is “column”  the column need not be a traditional column hollow glass fiber filter technology is widely available a representative product is that offered by calux of china but numerous providers are well known what is novel and different about this “column” is its selective removal of galclearly a patient whose condition could be improved by plasmapheresis would most likely obtain added therapeutic benefit from removal of other abnormally elevated or potentially harmful substances or agents found in the plasma and so more than one “column”  may be used the device of this invention may provide for multiple filters to be rotated in or out as a “cassette” in preferred embodiments among potential targets for joint removal together with the selective removal of gal may be heavy metals eg mercury antibodies such as dangerous autoantibodies pesticides and toxins ldls lppla lpa oxidized cholesterol oxidized ldl cytokines examples such as il il immunoglobulins of various types complement crp tnfα receptors for tnfα tgfβ nfkβ growth factors such as vegf other inflammatory components such as crp fibrinogen heavy metals binding proteins such as ceruloplasmin for copper other galectins in particular galectins and  and cytokine receptors such as il receptors tnfα receptors etc accordingly provided selective removal of gal is provided for at the beginning middle or end of the plasma treatment loop other elements may be removed using columns specific for their removalas noted in addition to the value of removal of gal the claimed device may advantageously provide for the addition of various agents prior to reintroduction of blood to the patient the additions described above as well as other pharmaceuticals are contemplated as one particular illustration the incorporated disclosure makes it clear that removal of a certain amount of circulating gal may enhance the effectiveness of certain antineoplastic pharmaceuticals to maximize that enhancement the pharmaceutical might be advantageously added to the plasma or the reunited bloodstream prior to return to the patient thus being added at a time when gal levels in the patient are likely to be lowest an optimized device is illustrated in fig  so that the artisan can compare the simplified device with the description set forth above blood from patient  again flows through conduit  where anticoagulant is added to prevent clotting ex vivo as well as following reintroduction to the patient anticoagulant is added at  after which the blood flows through pump  past a port  multiple ports  are included in the conduits through which blood red blood cells and plasma flow three ports are illustrated but in fact the device may include as many as are appropriate to the purpose and typically will include more six may be a more realistic value but the ports may be used to both withdraw fluid and to add the elements discussed above in preferred embodiments operation of the ports including withdrawal and addition is carried out by the automated device control system with operations having been preselected by the operator with the option for manual operation as needed advantageously ports are provided in the line where the patients blood is withdrawn the plasma line the red blood cell line after separation and in the recombined line prior to reintroduction to the patient but the placement and selection of the ports will vary from machine to machinein addition to the removal and addition of the various elements discussed above the device described permits the use of separators such as separator  to ‘harvest’ a variety of cells for treatment or use such as b cells t cells platelets stem cells and the like many of these cells and fragments are usefully banked for later treatment of the patient advantageously the cells may be withdrawn and modified and returned with the same device an example being t cells or b cell lymphocytes being treated to be able to recognize cancer cells of a specific type in a specific patient and attack them when reintroduced into this device while gal and other inflammatory mediators are reduced the antineoplastic effect can be enhanced while avoiding the dangerous and often life threatening inflammatory response various enhancement therapies such as circulating tumor cell ctc therapy are best taken advantage of through this type of device among a variety of advantages simplifying patient sampling reducing the possibility of infection and improving monitoring and control are affected by using this machine in ctc tumor cells are removed from the separated plasma at the separator these cells which are effectively metastatic tumor emboli are modified to carry antibodies andor viruses and returned to the body they effectively become targeted killing cells which the body recognizes and does not attack they can also be used to create antibodies that are then reintroduced to the body and attack any cancer present in the patient or lymphocytes harvested from the cancer patient are sensitized against certain surface membrane proteins specific to the patients cancer cells and then returned performing such procedures under reduced inflammatory burden reduces the side effects and can enhance the effectiveness of such therapieseach plasmapheresis device may be optimized in different fashion but the device illustrated in fig  includes three different columns ac these are identified separately while one of these will selectively remove gal as discussed above the remaining two in any order may selectively remove other components whose removal may provide therapeutic benefit each of these columns  will be provided with its own support elements related support elements  may be distributed throughout the conduit passage of the plasmapheresis device as noted above removal and addition of various factors as well as sampling will occur in most devices this is most easily effected through discreet support elements  which may be combined with columns  or separately as shown in fig monitoring may be effected by an operator at control interface  which as shown is in effective communication with the devices and ports described above communication may be hardwired in a fashion similar to devices for surgical manipulation like the davinci™ device or be remote and achieved via bluetooth or internet means computer control through interface  which conventionally includes a visual monitor that may display a variety of relevant data permits preprogrammed operation of much of the plasmapheresis device of this invention and the use of alarms and similar methods to alert the operator to situations arising outside of “normal” parameters advantageously  through servomotor control the operator either through preprogrammed operations or directly may effect column change flow modification port opening and closing withdrawal and addition without need for additional individuals this not only limits the cost and time of treatment but reduces complexity and limits infection riskhaving described the many embodiments of the present invention in detail it will be apparent that modifications and variations are possible without departing from
