the information in this risk factors section includes forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these

natural gas purchased to be processed in our liquids processing plant located at general cerri in the province of buenos aires  cerri complex  are us dollardenominated accordingly our  financial condition and results of operations depend to a significant extent on economic regulatory and political conditions prevailing in argentina the exchange rate between the peso and the us dollar and the reference international prices of liquids economic volatility in argentina in recent decades has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations the argentine economy has experienced significant volatility in recent decades characterized by periods of low or negative growth high and variable levels of inflation and currency devaluation as a consequence our business and operations have been and could in the future be affected from time to time to varying degrees by economic and political developments and other material events affecting the argentine economy such as inflation price controls fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates currency devaluation governmental policies regarding spending and investment and other regulatory initiatives increasing government involvement with economic activity international conflicts civil unrest and local insecurity concerns during  and  argentina went through a period of severe political economic and social crisis among other consequences the crisis resulted in argentina defaulting on its foreign debt obligations introducing emergency measures and numerous changes in economic policies that affected utilities and many other sectors of the economy and suffering a significant real devaluation of the peso which in turn caused numerous argentine private sector debtors with foreign currency exposure including us to default on their outstanding debt since that crisis argentina has substantially increased its real gross domestic product  gdp  however after the  global financial crisis the argentine economy suffered a slowdown attributable to local and external factors including an extended drought affecting agricultural activities and the effects of the global economic crisis according to data published by the instituto nacional de estadísticas y censos the indec  growth in real gdp resumed in  with the argentine gdp increasing  in   in  and  in  for the year  argentina experienced a slowdown in real gdp growth showing an increase of  during  economic activity recovered slightly as real gdp grew  during the year   argentina has confronted inflationary pressures evidenced by significantly higher fuel salaries and food prices among other indicators according to inflation data published by the indec from  to  the argentine consumer price index  cpi  increased    and  respectively and the wholesale price index  wpi  increased    and  respectively according to official publications the cpi for the period october october  latest information published by indec recorded an increase of  meanwhile the wpi experienced an increase of  for the period october october  alternative indicators are the cpi of the province of san luis and the cpi of the city of buenos aires the increases in such indexes for the year ended december   amounted to  and  respectively for the first two months of  the abovementioned indexes rose by  in the province of san luis and  in the city of buenos aires inflation in argentina has contributed to a material increase in our costs of operation in particular labor costs and negatively affected our results of operations and financial condition there can be no assurance that inflation rates will not escalate in the future and the effects of measures adopted or that may be adopted in the future by the government to control inflation are uncertain see government intervention in the argentine economy could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition we cannot provide any assurance that economic social and political events in argentina which are beyond our control will not adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations including our ability to service our debts or pay dividends in the past there have been concerns about the accuracy of argentinas official inflation statistics indec is statutorily the only institution in argentina with the power to produce official nationwide statistics in  indec modified its methodology used to calculate statistics such as cpi wpi and gdp several economists as well as the international and argentine press have suggested that this  change in methodology was related to the policy of the government intended to curb the increase of inflation in addition the international monetary fund  imf  requested several times that argentina clarify its inflation rates on november   the government began consulting with the imf for technical assistance in order to prepare a new national consumer price index with the aim of modernizing the current statistical system during the first quarter of  a team from the imf started working in conjunction with the indec to create such an index on february   the imf executive board concluded that argentinas progress in implementing remedial measures had not been sufficient issued a declaration of censure against argentina in connection with the breach of its related obligations to the imf under the articles of agreement and called on argentina to adopt remedial measures to address the inaccuracy of inflation and gdp data without further delay on february   the indec released a new inflation index the ipcnu  that measures prices on goods across the country and replaces the previous index that only measured inflation in the urban sprawl of the city of buenos aires in june  imf executive board issued a statement affirming that argentina was not yet in full compliance with article viii section  of the imf articles of agreement with respect to the accurate provision of cpi and gdp data to the imf the imf also stated that specified actions called for by endfebruary  had not yet been completely implemented for this reason the imf executive board decided to extend the ongoing process by one year to give argentina additional time to remedy the provision of inaccurate official data and to undertake an additional set of specified actions recently the government appointed new officials in the indec and expressed its intention to restore the credibility of this body for this reason the government declared the national statistics emergency as a result indec will not publish new information until at least june  the ability of argentina to access credit in the capital markets could be limited by the volatility described above under  economic volatility in argentina in recent decades has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  but also by the uncertainty relating to the inaccuracy of the economic indexes and rates in question which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions fluctuations in the value of the peso may also adversely affect the argentine economy our financial condition and results of operations since january  the peso has fluctuated significantly in value and generally depreciated against the us dollar with adverse consequences to our business a substantial increase in the value of the peso against the us dollar could also present risks for the argentine economy since it may lead to a deterioration of the countrys current account balance and the balance of payments between  and december  the government strengthened exchange controls in response to an increase of capital outflows as compared to inflows and to a drop in the commercial surplus however these controls were not able to prevent the decrease of international reserves of the bcra from us  million in  to us  in  us  million in  and us  million in  the decrease in the bcras reserves resulted in argentina being vulnerable to inflation and external shocks affecting the countrys capacity to overcome the effects of an external crisis on december   the new government administration which took office in december  implemented certain measures including the lifting of certain foreign exchange controls as a result the official exchange rate published by banco nación increased from ps  per us dollar on december   to ps  per us dollar on december   it is expected that with the new exchange regime the value of the argentine peso could freely fluctuate against the us dollar therefore we are unable to predict the future value of the peso against the us dollar and how any fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur in conducting our operations see item  additional informationd exchange controls further depreciation of the peso against the us dollar would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business as a result of our exposure to financial debt in us dollars as of march   the total amount of principal and accrued but unpaid interest under our consolidated us dollardenominated indebtedness was us million  in addition in the past the government has also adopted numerous measures to directly or indirectly control the access by private companies and individuals to foreign trade and foreign exchange markets these regulations prevented or limited us from offsetting the risk derived from our exposure to the us dollar even though these measures had the positive effect of lifting certain exchange controls in argentina we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to access foreign exchange markets or that these measures will not cause fluctuations in the value of the peso the lifting of certain exchange controls and other future economic social and political developments in argentina over which we have no control may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations including our ability to pay our debts at maturity or dividends for additional information on developments relating to exchange controls see item   additional informationd exchange controls government intervention in the argentine economy could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition in addition to the economic factors described above our business and operations have been are and could in the future be affected by actions taken by the government through the implementation of new or amended laws and regulations such as nationalizations expropriations or forced divestiture of assets restrictions on production imports and exports exchange andor transfer restrictions including those relating to dividend payments direct and indirect price controls tax increases changes in the interpretation or application of tax laws and other retroactive tax claims or challenges cancellation of contractual rights and delays or denials of governmental approvals during recent years the government has increased its direct intervention in the economy including through the implementation of expropriation and nationalization measures price controls and exchange controls in  the government absorbed and replaced the former private pension system with a public pay as you go pension system as a result all resources administered by the private pension funds including significant equity interests in a wide range of listed companies were transferred to a separate fund  fondo de garantía de sustentabilidad  or fgs  to be administered by the administración nacional de la seguridad social  anses  purchases of debt and equity instruments which previously could be placed with pension fund administrators are now entirely subject to the discretion of anses anses has been entitled to designate government representatives to the boards of directors of these companies pursuant to decree no  dated july   anses representatives must report directly to the ministerio de hacienda y finanzas públicas  mhf  and are subject to a mandatory informationsharing regime under which among other obligations they must immediately inform mhf of the agenda for each board of directors meeting and provide related documentation in may  argentine congress passed law no  which declared hydrocarbons selfsufficiency production industrialization transport and marketing to be activities of public interest and primary goals of argentina and empowered the government to take the necessary measures to achieve such goals law no  expropriated  of the shares of ypf sa  ypf  formerly known as repsol ypf sa  repsol ypf  on february   the board of repsol sa controlling entity of repsol ypf approved a compensation package offered by the government of the equivalent of us  billion in argentine bonds for the expropriation as of february   ypf market capitalization was us  billion our business and operations in argentina may also be adversely affected by measures adopted by the government to address inflation and sustainable growth for example increases in the costs of services and labor could negatively affect our results of operations if we are not permitted to pass those costs along to customers in the tariffs which we charge due to the imposition of price controls see  risks relating to our business as our license is subject to renegotiation pursuant to the public emergency law failure or delay to negotiate further improvements to our tariff structure andor to have our tariffs adjusted to reflect increases in our costs in a timely manner or at all has affected our financial condition and results of operations and could also have a material adverse effect on them   in addition in the past the government issued several measures to intervene in the foreign exchange market such as restricting its free access and imposing the obligation to repatriate and sell within the local foreign exchange market all foreign currency revenues obtained from exports in october  presidential congressional municipal and state government elections were held candidate mauricio macri won the argentina presidency beginning his presidential term on december   mr macris victory for argentinas centerright opposition ended the year rule of the peronist party a scenario of low growth and high inflation rates is highly likely going forward as a result of the accumulation of macroeconomic imbalances over recent years the actions of the government in regulatory matters and deterioration in some variables in the international context we can offer no assurance that policies  implemented by the government will not adversely affect our business results of operations and financial position argentina is an emerging market economy that is highly sensitive to local political developments which have had an adverse impact on the level of investment in argentina and the access of argentine companies to the international capital markets future developments may adversely affect argentinas economy and in turn our business results of operations and financial condition the argentine economy can be adversely affected by economic developments in other markets and by more general contagion effects which could have a material adverse effect on argentinas economic growth argentinas economy is vulnerable to external shocks that could be caused by adverse developments affecting its principal trading partners a significant decline in the economic growth of any of argentinas major trading partners could have a material adverse impact on argentinas balance of trade and adversely affect argentinas economic growth for example recent economic slowdowns especially in argentinas major trading partners led to declines in argentine exports in the last few years specifically fluctuations in the price of the commodities sold by argentina and a significant revaluation of the peso against the us dollar could harm argentinas competitiveness and affect its exports in addition financial and securities markets in argentina are influenced by economic and market conditions in other markets worldwide us monetary policy has significant effects on capital inflows and asset price movements in emerging market economies increases in us interest rates result in the appreciation of the us dollar and the decrease in prices for raw materials especially those exported by emerging economies that depend on them argentina is also affected by economic conditions of its main partners which during  have devaluated their currencies in february  the central bank of brazil started a devaluation process of its currency the real which suffered devaluation of approximately  against the us dollar additionally it is worth noting the slowdown in chinas growth and the reduction in exports to this asian country which caused an oversupply of commodities such as oil and natural gas and a consequent fall in prices of raw materials decreases in exports have a material adverse effect on argentinas public finances due to a loss of tax on exports causing an imbalance in the countrys exchange market although economic conditions vary from country to country investors perceptions of events occurring in other countries have in the past substantially affected and may continue to substantially affect capital flows into and investments in securities from issuers in other countries including argentina international investors reactions to events occurring in one market sometimes demonstrate a contagion effect in which an entire region or class of investment is disfavored by international investors argentina could be adversely affected by negative economic or financial developments in other countries which in turn may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the impact of global economies on argentina has led to a reduction in exports and foreign direct investments to a decline in national tax revenues and to the inability to access international capital markets there can be no assurance that the argentine financial system and securities markets will not be adversely affected by events in developed countries economies or events in other emerging markets a slowdown in  economic activity in argentina would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations argentinas past default and litigations with holdout bondholders may limit our ability to access international markets argentinas past default and litigation with bondholders who held out from past exchange offers may limit our ability to access international markets following the default on its external debt in  argentina sought to restructure its outstanding debt by offering holders of the defaulted bonds two opportunities to exchange them for newly issued debt securities in  and again in  holders of approximately  of argentinas defaulted debt participated in the exchanges nonetheless a number of bondholders held out from the exchange offers and pursued legal actions against argentina on august   the united states court of appeals for the second circuit upheld a district court ruling in favor of the bondholders and on june   the united states supreme court refused to address the argentine case these decisions have deepened doubts about argentinas ability to service its debt under the terms of foreign judgments and exacerbated investors uncertainties as well as increased sovereign risk subject to recent developments described further below the decision of the united states supreme court to dismiss the appeals filed by the government confirmed the decisions of the court of appeals for the second circuit affirming injunctions entered by the united states district court for the southern district of new york the injunctions prohibit argentina from making payments on its restructured debt unless it also pays pro rata amounts owed to holdout bondholders estimated at a total of approximately us  billion the injunctions issued by the district court have prevented holders of most of the restructured debt from receiving payments that have become due since june  on september   the argentina congress passed law no  which changed the paying agent for the debt securities issued in the  and  restructurings from bank of new york mellon to an argentine entity and established buenos aires as the domicile of payment for the bonds issued under each restructuring in an attempt to create a new voluntary exchange of restructured debt because of argentinas continued attempts to cast doubt on bank of new york mellons status as the trustee for the exchange bonds including its use of full page newspaper advertisements calling on exchange bondholders to replace bank of new york mellon on september   argentina was found to be in civil contempt of court by the district court in november  argentina appealed to the court of appeals for the second circuit but that appeal was dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction on april   on august   the court of appeals for the second circuit reversed the district courts order of september   with respect to the alter ego and sovereign immunity status of argentinas central bank finding that the central bank was not an alter ego of the argentine government the court of appeals also remanded the case with instructions to dismiss the complaint and the complaint was dismissed in accordance with those instructions on october   the court of appeals stated that the district court erred in denying bcras motion to dismiss it also clarified that argentinas sovereignimmunity waiver may not be considered to also waive bcras independent sovereign immunity the plaintiffs in this action have petitioned the united states supreme court for review of the second circuits decision and that petition remains pending on october   the district court entered injunctions in  actions brought by socalled me too plaintiffs  like the injunctions affirmed by the court of appeals on august   these new injunctions prohibit the government from paying exchange bondholders unless the government also pays the plaintiffs in these  actions in february  argentina negotiated and reached settlement agreements with its largest holdout creditors the agreement reached by certain of the holdout creditors permitted those creditors to terminate the agreement if they did not receive the full settlement payment from the government by april   on february   argentina published a settlement proposal to other holdout creditors on february   the district court issued an indicative ruling stating that in light of argentinas settlement proposal and upon remand of argentinas appeal of the october   order entering pari passu  injunctions in the  me too plaintiffs actions it would grant a motion to vacate the injunctions in all cases the court of appeals remanded argentinas pending appeals and the district court entered an order on march  stating that the injunctions would be lifted upon the satisfaction of two conditions first that the argentine congress repeal the socalled lock law and sovereign payment law which prohibit the government from paying bondholders that did not participate in the  or  exchanges and second that the government pay the settlement amounts owed to any holdout creditor that entered into a settlement agreement by february   the plaintiffs appealed the district courts march  decision the following day on april   the court of appeals heard oral argument and following the argument the court announced from the bench that it was affirming the district courts march  order paving the way for the injunctions to be lifted once the conditions set forth by the district court are satisfied the court of appeals issued a written decision to that effect on april   finally on march   the national congress voted to repeal laws that prevent argentina from paying the holdouts on april  the district court found that this action by the national congress satisfied the first condition for lifting the injunctions meaning that only the second conditionpayment to holdout creditors that entered into settlement agreements by february remained to be satisfied following the court of appeals decision on april  argentina announced that it would proceed with a new bond offering of up to us dollars  billion to repay the holdouts after the issuance of us dollars  billion of new bonds to international investors on april   argentina notified the district court that it had made full payment under the settlement agreements with the holdout creditors on the same day the district court vacated the injunctions in all cases however if argentina does not fully recover its ability to fluidly access to international capital markets and attract foreign direct investment there is risk that the country will not get the capital needed to restart the investment cycle and achieve sustainable rates of economic growth argentinas fiscal condition could be adversely affected which could lead to more inflation and undermine the governments ability to implement economic policies designed to promote growth the difficulty of sustaining over time economic growth with reasonable price stability could result in a renewed episode of economic instability in addition argentinas past default in  and years of litigation with holdout creditors may reappear in the future and prevent argentine companies such as us from accessing the international capital markets readily or render the financial conditions of such access significantly more onerous than for companies in other countries in the region and may therefore negatively affect our financial condition or cash flows in addition the foreign shareholders of several argentine companies including us together with public utilities and certain bondholders that did not participate in the exchange offers described above filed claims in excess of us billion with the international centre for settlement of investment disputes  icsid  alleging that the emergency measures adopted by the government in  do not meet the just and equal treatment requirements of several bilateral investment treaties to which argentina is a party while certain plaintiffs have prevailed against argentina in their icsid proceedings including british gas whose us  million award was upheld by the united states supreme court and gdf suez which was awarded us  million argentina has not yet honored such awards although in october  argentina agreed to compensate five claimants that had obtained favorable decisions from the icsid the compensation was paid in the form of sovereign bonds the developments described above the global economic crisis that started in the fourth quarter of  and the resulting international stock market crash and the insolvency of major financial institutions toward the end of  have generally limited the ability of argentine companies to access international financial markets as they had in the past or made such access significantly more costly for argentine issuers between june  and  a greater number of argentine companies gained access to the international capital markets albeit on terms much less favorable than those faced by competitors based in other countries in the region since  and until very recently argentine companies have had little access to such markets see  government intervention in the argentine economy could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition   recently approved argentine judicial commercial and civil reforms as well as challenges

of operations our regulated business is dependent on our ability to maintain our license which is subject to revocation under some circumstances we conduct our natural gas transportation business

articles  through  of the federal code of civil and commercial procedure are met foreign judgments cannot violate principles of public policy  orden público  of argentine law as determined by argentine courts it is possible that an argentine court would deem the enforcement of foreign judgments ordering us to make a payment in a foreign currency outside of argentina to be contrary to argentine public policy if at that time there are legal restrictions prohibiting argentine debtors from transferring foreign currency outside of argentina although currently there are no legal restrictions prohibiting argentine debtors from transferring foreign currency outside of argentina to satisfy principal or interest payments on outstanding debt that has been previously reported to

respect to any of our assets unless the government ordered the release of such assets such assets would not be subject to attachment execution or other legal process as long as such determination stands and the ability of any of our creditors to realize a judgment against such assets may be adversely affected in order to mitigate the energy crisis the government continued adopting new strategies measures and programs with respect to the natural gas transportation industry including the expansion of our pipeline and the interruption of natural gas firm transportation service including the diversion of natural gas supply from the cerri complex which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition since  the natural gas industry has experienced a sharp increase in demand as a consequence of i the recovery of certain industries in the argentine economy between  and  ii the  devaluation of the peso and pesification of transportation and distribution tariffs and the elimination of both tariff and wellhead gas price adjustments making this fuel relatively inexpensive for consumers as compared to other types of fuel the prices which are affected by inflation and iii the growth of gdp since  the supply of natural gas has not been sufficient to meet this increased demand and the government has adopted different strategies measures and programs to mitigate the resulting energy crisis these strategies measures and programs have severely and negatively impacted the profitability of companies providing services relating to the production transportation and distribution of natural gas specifically natural gas distribution companies have been prohibited from passing through price increases to consumers since  producers of natural gas therefore have had difficulty implementing wellhead natural gas price adjustments that would increase the costs of distribution companies which has caused such producers to suffer a sharp decline in their rate of return on investment activities as a result natural gas production has not been high enough to meet the increasing demand likewise the elimination until very recently of tariff adjustments for natural gas transportation companies has caused transportation companies to suffer a decrease in their profitability in light of these events the government has decided to implement a number of strategies measures and programs aimed at mitigating the energy crisis and supporting the recovery of the argentine  economy generally with respect to the natural gas industry these strategies measures and programs include among others the expansion of our pipeline through the creation of financial trust funds used as vehicles to facilitate financing of those investments  gas trusts  for more information on the pipeline expansions please see item  our informationb business overviewnatural gas transportationpipeline operationspipeline expansion although the expansion projects described above have not adversely affected our results of operations or financial condition we cannot assure you that future or even present expansion projects will not have such adverse effects governmentmandated interruption of contracted firm transportation services in  the executive branch issued presidential decree no  directing the federal energy bureau to establish a system of priority pursuant to which power stations and natural gas distribution companies for their residential clients could receive natural gas in priority to other users even those with firm transportation and firm natural gas supply contracts pursuant to enargas resolution no  due to the lack of sufficient natural gas provision natural gas transportation service including those with firm transportation contracts may be interrupted and  or relocated in order to service power stations and natural gas distribution companies and enargas will set the priority of transportation in such cases since february  natural gas delivery has been managed by a committee formed by government officials from the domestic commerce bureau the  domestic commerce bureau  mpfipys and enargas which makes adjustments to the daily natural gas deliveries considering the availability of natural gas and the demand of residential consumers and power plants the latter provided by compañía administradora del mercado mayorista eléctrico sa which administers the electricity market if there is not sufficient natural gas availability this committee decides how to allocate the available volumes among the different types of consumers by interrupting the natural gas exports and the supply to certain big industries mainly petrochemicals companies including our liquids processing facility the cerri complex without considering if they have firm or interruptible contracts of natural gas supply andor transportation during the winter of  when demand for natural gas was unusually high and natural gas production did not meet demand the government expressly instructed us to redirect natural gas deliveries to supply power plants residential users and vehicles without considering whether other users had firm or interruptible natural gas supply andor transportation contracts in   and  residential natural gas demand was lower due to warmer weather but a higher demand was observed from the industrial and electric power plants sectors since  natural gas demand has increased for all users residential power plants and industrial this increased demand has resulted in a supply shortage although there has been sufficient transportation capacity to meet the total demand from the system since  the government has continued to impose restrictions on the consumption of natural gas by certain customers that hold firm transportation contracts with us in an effort to redirect and target the supply to the demand regarded as top priority mainly residential users compressed natural gas stations and industries connected to the distribution network although neither our results of operations nor our financial condition have been materially adversely affected by transportation service interruptions since  as described above we cannot assure you that similar interruptions will not materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition in the future as of the date of this annual report one of our clients profertil sa has brought a legal action against us in respect of service interruptions in  in that action enargas ruled in our favor finding that there was a shortage in the supply of natural gas however we cannot assure you that future interruptions of supply to our firm natural gas transportation clients will not lead to further legal action which could have a significant adverse economic and financial effect on us    despite having increased in recent years natural gas arriving from the neuquina basin has declined in volume since  our liquids production depends on the natural gas that arrives at the cerri complex through three main pipelines from the neuquina and austral natural gas basins the flow and caloric power of this natural gas are subject to risks that could materially adversely affect our liquids and midstream business segment argentina relies heavily on natural gas however its natural gas reserves are declining there is some risk that natural gas production will continue to decrease in the future and that new exploration will not compensate for such decline which would adversely affect our liquids business segment by reducing the amount of natural gas flowing to the cerri complex and therefore the amount of liquids we produce in addition the reduction in the production of natural gas could affect the flow of natural gas provided for our midstream clients for its compression and treatment in   of the natural gas transported by our system originated in the neuquina basin with the remainder coming primarily from the austral basin since  the quality and the volume of natural gas injected from the neuquina basin has been lower as a consequence of the reduction of natural gas production in this basin and not appropriate for processing in the cerri complex negatively impacting our level of output from this facility as a consequence of this lower output of natural gas from the neuquina basin we have had to buy natural gas at higher prices causing an increase in the cost of liquids production and commercialization activities for our own account that reduces our profit from these activities since the construction of a natural gas processing plant upstream of the cerri complex by compañía mega sa  mega  a sociedad anónima owned by ypf petrobras international braspetro bv and dow investment argentina sa the volumes of natural gas arrived to the cerri complex have been reduced there can be no assurance that there will not be further reductions in the future any reduction of natural gas volumes arriving at the the cerri complex for liquids could adversely affect our revenues from liquids production and commercialization services and consequently our net revenues in  nonconventional natural gas was discovered in the neuquina basin by ypf which at that time was a subsidiary of repsol sa exploration and exploitation of this natural gas reserve is still in the beginning stages and will require several years and involve high extraction costs since the expropriation of ypf in  the government has played an important role signing agreements with foreign and local oil companies in order to develop an investment plan which allows for the increase of the reserves of this basin as a consequence of the measures taken by the government to ensure production levels during  natural gas production has increased approximately  compared with  production we cannot assure you however that this new natural gas reserve at the neuquina basin or any other measures taken by the government to increase natural gas production and supplies will be successful in increasing argentine natural gas reserves or the extent to which our midstream or liquids production and commercialization businesses could be adversely affected by a sustained decrease in the production of natural gas measures taken by the government may have an adverse effect on the supply of natural gas to and the costs to produce liquids from the cerri complex which may adversely affect revenues or costs in our liquids production and commercialization segment our business and results of operations as described above actions taken by the government during the winter periods of recent years resulted in natural gas being redirected away from certain users including the cerri complex towards priority users including residential customers see  in order to mitigate the energy crisis the government has initiated new strategies measures and programs with respect to the natural gas transportation industry including the expansion of our pipeline and the interruption of natural gas firm transportation service which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition  above  during the winter of  processing at the cerri complex was interrupted for an equivalent of  days as a result liquids production in  was the lowest recorded since  since  the cerri complex has suffered fewer interruptions mainly due to the use of regasified natural gas from a liquefied natural gas regasification tanker during the winter of  processing at the cerri complex was interrupted because of continued governmental actions to ensure natural gas supply to the domestic market any diversion of the supply of natural gas from the cerri complex may require us to purchase natural gas from third parties to supply our liquids business which may result in increased costs  if we are unable to purchase natural gas from other sources the volume of our liquids productions may decrease additionally in  enargas issued note no  which regulated peak natural gas prices for industrial users and increased the price at which we purchase natural gas to be processed in the cerri complex for further information see item   our information  business overview  liquids production and commercialization any additional increase in the costs of our liquids production and commercialization segment or decrease in the volume of liquids processed may adversely affect our revenues business and results of operations although our liquids production and commercialization activities are not subject to regulation by enargas the government has taken certain regulatory actions in recent years that have affected our liquids business for example in april  the government enacted law no  which set the framework by which the federal energy bureau establishes regulations over lpg suppliers to guarantee supply and price stability of lpg products in the domestic market through decree no  the executive branch created a charge to be paid by i the users of regulated services of transportation and  or distribution ii natural gas consumers receiving natural gas directly from producers without making use of transportation systems or natural gas distribution iii the natural gas processing companies in order to finance the import of natural gas the natural gas processing charge  the payment of the natural gas processing charge was selectively subsidized from  according to the destination of the natural gas benefitting low income residential users in november  however enargas issued resolution no  and  the gas charge resolutions  which modified the list of the subsidy beneficiaries and thus resulted in a cost increase for many of our clients and for us specifically for the consumption of natural gas for our own account the natural gas processing charge increased from ps  to ps  per cubic meter of natural gas effective from december   representing a significant increase in our variable costs of natural gas processing in order to avoid an adverse effect on our liquids business we initiated legal proceedings against decree no  and the gas charge resolutions including the government enargas and mpfipys as defendants for additional information see item  financial informationa consolidated statements and other financial informationlegal and regulatory proceedingstax claims on march   the ministry of energy issued resolution no  which instructs the enargas to take all the necessary measures to reduce to zero the natural gas processing charge since april   we cannot provide any assurance that our liquids production and commercialization business will not be subject to any further actions from the government to increase the cost of the natural gas consumed in the cerri complex which may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations fluctuations in market prices and the enactment of new taxes or regulations limiting the sales price of lpg and natural gasoline may affect our liquids business we extract lpg and natural gasoline from natural gas delivered to the cerri complex and sell lpg and natural gasoline on behalf of customers and for our own account as a result of the deterioration of our natural gas transportation segment operations relating to our liquids production and commercialization have represented more than  of our total net revenues since  since  the international market for liquids has been favorable driven by strong international prices for lpg and natural gasoline however since the second half of  as a consequences of weaker demand of emerging markets as wells as higher production levels and export capacity due to the development of shale gas fields in the united states of america our average liquids sales prices were lower than the ones recorded previously high volatility and a downward trend in oil and liquids prices continued during  in recent years the government issued a series of measures which significantly affected our liquids production and commercialization segment since  lpg and natural gasoline exports have been subject to a withholding tax on exports after several modifications in march  the government introduced a slidingscale regime for lpg and natural gasoline where the withholding rate as a percentage would increase to the same extent as the international reference prices  at the end of  and the beginning of  to reduce the impact of the sharp decrease in the international reference prices for lpg and natural gasoline the government reduced to  the applicable rate of withholding tax for exports maintaining the slidingscale regime in case international prices were higher than a certain level set by the federal energy bureau during the whole year ended  the applicable tax rate remained at its minimum furthermore in the domestic market since september  the federal energy bureau and lpg producers among others signed an agreement on the price stabilization of butane bottles whereby the industry players committed to a substantial reduction in the price of butane bottles the stabilization agreement  because the stabilization agreement requires us to produce and market lpg volumes required by the federal energy bureau at prices significantly below the market we are unable to cover lpg production costs leading to a negative operating margin on march   the executive branch modified the framework applicable to the sale of lpg bottles pursuant decree no  for further information see item  our informationb business overviewliquids production and commercialization in addition any new regulations regarding the cost and availability of the natural gas used in the production of liquids and the effect of the continuing decline in international prices of lpg or natural gasoline could cause our operating margins to drop significantly and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our ethane sales depend on the capacity of pbb polisur sa pbb as the sole purchaser of our ethane production during the past  years we sold all our ethane to pbb under a longterm agreement that expired on december   pursuant to this agreement the ethane price was calculated in us dollars and was subject to an annual adjustment at the beginning of each year based on various factors including the ppi  up to an increase of  per year the natural gas price the quality of the ethane shipped by us and transportation tariffs and charges since the expiration of this agreement we have continued selling ethane to pbb under shortterm extensions the last of which will terminate on april   as of the date of this annual report we are in negotiations to renew the agreement with pbb ethane sales volumes decreased in summer of  because pbb gave priority to the product provided from another supplier for commercial reasons in addition in recent years pbb has suffered several adverse operational conditions that affected its capacity to purchase our ethane production however our previous agreement with pbb and the shortterm extensions include among other conditions take or pay  top  and delivery or pay  dop  commitments for minimum annual quantities under these conditions if either of the parties does not comply with the top or dop conditions that party will be required to compensate the other party for breach of the minimum annual quantities commitment we cannot assure you that these adverse conditions affecting pbb will not occur again in the future if we are not able to renew our agreement with pbb on similar terms as the agreement that expired on december   or any future unwillingness or inability to purchase our ethane production may materially affect our results of operations and financial condition certain customers of our natural gas transportation segment have defaulted on their obligations to us and could extend the terms of cancellation of their obligations in the future defaults on or deferrals of payments by our customers or our inability to renew natural gas firm transportation contracts maturing in the shortterm may adversely affect our natural gas transportation segment revenues the lack of progress by natural gas distribution companies including our main natural gas transportation customers metrogas sa  metrogas  gas natural ban sa  ban  and camuzzi gas pampeana sa  camuzzi pampeana  and camuzzi gas del sur sa  camuzzi sur  in renegotiating their licenses with the government according to the terms of public emergency law may in the future cause metrogas or other customers to not fulfill their payment obligations under the natural gas firm transportation contracts with us we may in the future be subject to similar extensions in collection terms and payment obligations we cannot assure you that our natural gas distribution customers in argentina will not default in the future and therefore negatively impact our financial position    we cannot assure you that our natural gas firm transportation contracts will be renewed in whole or in part in the existing routes or by the current customers we may not to renew some natural gas transportation contracts in light of the diminishing supply of natural gas from the neuquina basin in addition after the issuance of resolution no  of the federal energy bureau our power plant customers may be unable to recognize the cost of purchasing gas from us as a cost to producing energy and therefore may choose not to renew their natural gas firm transportation contracts if we are unable to renew the majority of our natural gas firm transportation contracts as they mature our revenues business and results of operation could be adversely affected the affirmative and restrictive covenants in our currently outstanding indebtedness could adversely restrict our financial and operating flexibility and subject us to other risks the terms of our currently outstanding indebtedness provide for numerous affirmative and restrictive covenants that limit our ability to among other things create liens incur additional debt pay dividends acquire shares of stock and make payments on subordinated debt enter into transactions with affiliates sell assets or consolidate merge or sell substantially all of our assets these restrictions may limit our ability to operate our businesses and may prohibit or limit our ability to enhance our operations or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise the breach of any of these covenants by us or the failure by us to meet any of these conditions could result in a default under any or all of such indebtedness our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions and the renegotiation of public works and licenses process in addition if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations we may be required to refinance outstanding debt or to obtain additional financing we cannot assure you that a refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing would be available or obtained on acceptable terms our insurance policies may not fully cover damage or we may not be able to obtain insurance against certain risks as of december   our physical assets are insured for up to us  million subject to certain deductibles we maintain insurance policies intended to mitigate our losses due to customary risks these policies cover our assets against loss for physical damage loss of revenue and also third party liability however we cannot assure you that the scope of damages suffered in the event of a natural disaster or catastrophic event would not exceed the policy limits of our insurance coverage we maintain allrisk physical damage coverage for losses resulting from but not limited to earthquakes fire explosions floods windstorms strikes riots mechanical breakdowns and business interruption our level of insurance may not be sufficient to fully cover all losses that may arise in the course of our business or insurance covering our various risks may not continue to be available in the future in addition we may not be able to obtain insurance on comparable terms in the future we may be materially and adversely affected if we incur losses that are not fully covered by our insurance policies or if we are required to disburse significant amounts from our own funds to cover such losses changes in the interpretation by the courts of labor laws that tend to favor employees could adversely affect our results of operations in addition to our employees we rely on a number of third party service providers to outsource certain services we follow very strict policies to control the compliance by such third party service providers with their labor and social security obligations however due to changes in the interpretation by the courts of labor laws that tend to favor employees in argentina companies labor and social security obligations towards their own employees and employees of third party service providers have significantly increased as a result of the foregoing potential severance payment liabilities have significantly increased and in the event any third party service provider fails to duly comply with its labor and social security obligations towards its employees we may be faced with litigation by employees of such third party service provider to hold us liable for the payment of any labor and social security obligations defaulted by any such third party services provider therefore our labor costs may increase as our indemnification responsibilities and costs expand adversely affecting the result of our operations  we may be exposed to risks related to litigation and administrative proceedings that could materially and adversely affect our business and financial performance in the event of an unfavorable ruling our business may expose us to litigation relating to labor environmental health and safety matters regulatory tax and administrative proceedings governmental investigations tort claims and contract disputes and criminal prosecution among other matters in the context of these proceedings we may not only be required to pay fines or money damages but also may be subject to complementary sanctions or injunctions affecting our ability to continue our operations while we may contest these matters vigorously and make insurance claims when appropriate litigation and other proceedings are inherently costly and unpredictable making it difficult to accurately estimate the outcome of actual or potential litigation or proceedings although we may establish provisions as we deem necessary the amounts that we reserve could vary significantly from any amounts we actually pay due to the inherent uncertainties in the estimation process risks relating to our shares and adrs shareholders outside argentina may face additional investment risk from currency exchange rate fluctuations in connection with their holding of our shares or american depositary receipts adrs exchange controls imposed by the government may limit our ability to make payments to the depositary in us dollars and thereby limit adr holders ability to receive cash dividends in us dollars we are an argentine company and any future payments of dividends on our shares will be denominated in pesos the peso has historically fluctuated significantly against many major world currencies including the us dollar a depreciation of the peso would likely adversely affect the us dollar or other currency equivalent of any dividends paid on our shares and could result in a decline in the value of our shares and adss as measured in us dollars since  argentine companies are required to obtain prior approval from bcra and argentine tax authorities in order to engage in certain foreign exchange transactions thus our shareholders ability to receive cash dividends in us dollars may be limited by the ability of the depositary for our adr program to convert cash dividends paid in pesos into us dollars under the terms of our deposit agreement for the adrs to the extent that the depositary can in its judgment and in accordance with local exchange regulations convert pesos or any other foreign currency into us dollars on a reasonable basis and transfer the resulting us dollars abroad the depositary will as promptly as practicable convert or cause to be converted all cash dividends received by it in pesos on the deposited securities into us dollars if in the judgment of the depositary this conversion is not possible on a reasonable basis or is not permitted by applicable argentine laws regulations and approval requirements the depositary may distribute the pesos received or in its discretion hold such currency uninvested without liability for interest thereon for the respective accounts of the owners entitled to receive the same as a result if the exchange rate fluctuates significantly during a time when the depositary cannot convert the foreign currency you may lose some of the value of the dividend distribution our principal shareholders exercise significant control over matters affecting us and may have interests that

natural gas distributor at one or more intake points on our pipeline system for transportation and delivery to the shipper at specified delivery points along the pipeline system under applicable law and our license we are not permitted to buy or sell natural gas except for our own consumption and to operate the pipeline system see regulatory framework below for more information our pipeline system connects major natural gas fields in southern and western argentina with distributors and other users of gas in those areas and the greater buenos aires area transportadora de gas del norte sa

enargas during  the amount of net revenues derived from natural gas firm transportation contracts was approximately ps  million representing  of the total net revenues for the natural gas transportation segment substantially all of our remaining natural gas deliveries were made under natural gas interruptible transportation contracts entered into predominantly with four natural gas distribution companies and industrial customers interruptible contracts provide for the transportation of natural gas subject to available pipeline capacity the government has at times directed us to interrupt supply to certain customers and make deliveries to others without regard to whether they have natural gas firm or interruptible contracts see regulatory frameworkindustry structure below

to demand requirements but the federal energy bureau continued to intervene by redirecting the supply of natural gas from the industrial market to residential commercial and compressed natural gas station users however these industrial restrictions were lower than previous years due to a decrease in residential consumption caused by higher ambient temperatures it is worth highlighting that our pipeline system adequately met natural gas transportation demand in  presenting zero service interruptions and complying with the highrequired operational standards we were able to achieve this level of service due in part to several maintenance prevention and inspection measures among them we have conducted inline inspections throughout  miles of pipeline using several technologies to identify assess and control threats to the integrity of pipelines such as external corrosion material and geometrical defects among others for additional information regarding the conduction of our operations and safety see natural gas transportation system improvements below pipeline expansions in light of the lack of expansion of the natural gas transportation system in  and  as a consequence of the pesification of tariffs and the fact that the renegotiation of the license was still pending and of growing natural gas demand in all segments of the argentine economy the government established in april  through decree no  and resolution no  issued by mpfipys the framework for the creation of various gas trusts aimed at financing the expansion of the natural gas transportation system in a different manner from that established in the license in  the first gas trust was constituted to carry out the first expansion the first expansion completed in august  was achieved through the construction of approximately  miles of pipeline and a compression capacity increase of  hp through the construction of a new compressor plant and the revamping of some existing units the gas trust invested approximately us million which was repaid by applying  of the revenues generated by the additional firm contracted capacity plus a surcharge which is ultimately paid by industries power plants and compressed natural gas  cng  suppliers for whom gas transportation supply is made under firm contracts to cover part of the project cost we invested approximately us million in the first expansion including value added tax  vat  in the amount of us million which was recovered through our right to collect  of the revenues obtained from the additional transportation capacity based on our current tariff rate but not to the extent of  certain increased rate that may apply in the future these amounts represented annual revenues of approximately ps  million in addition in april  the mpfipys the federal energy bureau and natural gas transporters among others signed a letter of intent to carry out the second expansion the second expansion  which is significantly larger than the first expansion the second expansion will increase the aggregate transportation capacity of our system by  mmcfd it involves the installation of over  miles of pipeline loops and  hp of additional power and the construction of a new pipeline in the magellan strait the new magellan strait pipeline  which permits the transportation of additional natural gas from the austral basin as of december   the aggregate transportation capacity has increased by  mmcfd and is operational  the remaining increase of  mmcfd in capacity is expected to be completed in different stages the new magellan strait pipeline was completed in march  and is  miles long and has a natural gas transportation capacity of  mmcfd the completion of this new pipeline required the technical support of petrobras argentina group under the scope of the technical assistance service agreement as defined in item  our informationb business overviewnatural gas transportationpipeline operationstechnical assistance service agreement below which brought to the project its knowhow and experience in offshore activities the dredging in the seabed and the later laying of the pipeline was carried out by the dutch consortium of royal boskalis westminster nv and the allseas group sa ownership of the works of the second expansion is vested in a second gas trust and the investment is financed by other gas trust funds whose trustors are the natural gas producers and the shippers that have or will subscribe to the additional capacity the works will be repaid with a new tariff charge that will ultimately be paid by the business and industrial users with firm transportation contracts and not by the residential users in addition as the assets related to the second expansion are operational we are in charge of their operation maintenance together with the assets related to the first expansion through an operation and maintenance agreement  om agreement  and the rendering of natural gas firm transportation services in order to compensate us for the operation and maintenance services provided with respect to the incremental transportation capacity associated with the expansions carried out by the gas trusts and us since  we are paid a monthly access and use charge  cau  which currently is lower than the transportation tariff the cau has resulted in increased fees and revenues in our natural gas transportation segment as the expansion works have become operational     in may  we received valores representativos de deuda  debt securities  from the gas trust issued february  which cancelled the account receivable of ps  million related to services rendered for the  mmcfd expansion works of the second expansion these debt securities were issued in an aggregate principal amount of ps  million amortize principal in  consecutive and equal monthly installments and bear interest at the coeficiente de estabilización de referencia  cer  or reference stabilization ratio as published by the bcra plus a fixed spread of  from their date of issue in october  we the federal energy bureau and the trustee of the second gas trust agreed on the terms and conditions under which we will manage the operation of the assets associated with the second expansion as compensation for these additional services we will receive a total of ps  million for the  mmcfd expansion works remaining to complete the second expansion in addition to the debt securities received in may  the amendment agreement provided for an advance payment equal to the  of the total remuneration which was paid  in cash and  in the form of additional debt securities from the gas trust the principal of said debt securities amounted to ps  million including accrued interest as of december   which are amortized in  monthly consecutive and equal installments and bear interest at cer plus a fixed spread of  from their date of issue in march  we the federal energy bureau and the trustee of the second gas trust agreed on the terms and conditions under which we will render the management of the works for the assets associated with the construction of two new pipelines as of the date of issuance of this annual report the final schedule for the construction of these two pipelines has not yet been set natural gas transportation system improvements in   and  we made capital expenditures for natural gas transportation system improvements in the aggregate amount of approximately ps   million to continue the enhancement of the natural gas transportation systems safety and reliability we operate our pipelines and the pipeline constructed pursuant to the gas trust in accordance with argentine natural gas transmission safety regulations which are substantially similar to us federal regulations we believe that based on the pipeline inspection reports we have received to date and the pipeline repairs andor replacements being made to the general san martín and neuba i and ii pipelines the current operation of the pipeline system poses no significant safety risks however in order to identify changes in the safety regulations that our system pipeline has to comply with we conduct inspections for the purpose of detecting increases in the population density in the areas through which our pipeline system extends changes in population densities would imply that we may need to increase safety measures in certain sections of the system the greater buenos aires is the surrounding area of the city of buenos aires including the city of buenos aires the last part of our natural gas transportation system the  buenos aires ring  is located in the greater buenos aires where we transfer natural gas to deliver natural gas to major natural gas distribution companies at the buenos aires ring in the section ranging from general rodríguez to general pacheco we are conducting a thorough quantitative risk assessments and implementing measures designed to minimize the risk in this segment which runs through the most densely populated part of argentina since the commencement of our operations in late  we have implemented measures to ensure that the service would not be interrupted in any relevant consumption center and in the previous five years we have not had significant ruptures in our natural gas transportation systems pipeline in november  we started recoating works in the proximities of cipolleti río negro a kilometer work in the neuba i pipeline successfully finished in january  within the stress corrosion cracking assessment and mitigation plan we applied the susceptibility model to the neuba i recoating section implementing  cracking verification wells additionally to assess this threat we completed fluency tests along  miles of the gaviotas  general cerri pipeline section in which no rupture occurred during the testing process finally to continue our research and to feed our susceptibility model we conducted a  miles inline inspection with magnetic technology to identify hard spots in the pipe material technology used for the first time in our country additionally based on the analysis and planning carried out by the pipeline integrity team we conducted a campaign for the survey and repair of  external corrosion andor geometrical failures regarding cathodic protection to hinder the advance of corrosion we continued strengthening the system with the installation of  new units and  anode reinforcements also regarding the remotelyoperated gauging of cathodic protection units  units have been updated and linked to the scada system  supervisory control and data acquisition  this optimizes the monitoring process saving time and resources allocated to this critical task in our operations in addition regarding integrity inspections we conducted a diagnosis plan to verify the state of insulation coating in  miles of pipeline and have not detected critical failures with the purpose of minimizing risks on the buenos aires ring section extending from general rodríguez to general pacheco the area with greatest demographic concentration along the system we conducted quantitative risk assessments to assess and define the implementation of adequate mitigation measures we also implemented several preventive measures such as   · the installation of a subbase at the pacheco plant which allows exclusive attention to this pipeline section and more intensive patrolling tasks in the area · filling of  casing pipes in special crossings along the pipeline system to mitigate  the corrosion phenomenon and · increase in the quantity of signage and implementation of a program for visits to our facilities and broadcasting of our activities in several municipalities crossed by the pipeline  moreover we have started two significant risk mitigation works in this area the first is the installation of an odoriferous unit at the rodríguez plant which will odorize gas from that point up to the pacheco plant second we have installed  meters of prestressed material tiles in a sensitive segment of the pipeline to reinforce the protection of both the facilities and their surroundings finally we are completing implementation of a quantitative risk analysis system which will allow us to conduct a thorough and complex analysis of the pipe system detecting and optimizing activities for the assessment and analysis of threats to integrity which will support the creation of integrity programs technical assistance service agreement as part of its bid to purchase a  interest in us from the government ciesa was required to have an investorcompany with experience in natural gas transmission that would serve as our technical operator in late  we entered into a technical assistance agreement with pepca the  technical assistance agreement  an indirect majorityowned subsidiary of enron the term of the technical assistance agreement was for eight years from december   renewable automatically upon expiration for an additional eightyear term and was assigned to petrobras argentina group as part of the master settlement agreement since july  petrobras argentina group has been our technical operator and is in charge of providing assistance related to among others the operation and maintenance of the natural gas transportation system and related facilities and equipment in order to ensure that the performance of the system is in conformity with international natural gas transportation industry standards and in compliance with certain argentine environmental standards with the prior approval of enargas and our board of directors in october   we and petrobras argentina group agreed to a technical assistance service agreement the technical assistance service agreement  for a threeyear term expiring on december   which substantially contains the same terms as the technical assistance agreement as amended any amendment renewal or even termination of the technical assistance service agreement has to be authorized by enargas pursuant to the technical assistance service agreement the currency for the technical assistance fee paid to petrobras argentina group was changed from us dollars to argentine pesos our audit committee has analyzed the technical assistance service agreement and concluded that it is on market terms the technical assistance service agreement sets out the services to be provided by petrobras argentina group to us at the request of our chief executive officer in return for payment of a technical assistance fee paid on a monthly basis equal to the greater of i a fixed annual sum of ps  million or ii  of the amount obtained after subtracting ps  million from net income before interests and income taxes of the year for the year ended december   we paid petrobras argentina group ps  million for services rendered pursuant to the technical assistance service agreement the services to be provided by petrobras argentina group to us under the technical assistance service agreement include assisting us in the following matters to the extent that they arise in the ordinary course of business i replacement repair and renovation of facilities and equipment to ensure that the performance of the system is in accordance with international gas transportation industry standards ii preparation of performance evaluations operating cost analyses construction assessments and advice related to budget control iii advice regarding safety reliability and efficiency of system operation and gas industry services iv advice regarding compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to safety and health pollution and environmental protection of the system v routine and preventive maintenance of the system vi staff training vii design and implementation of the procedures necessary to accomplish the aforesaid services and viii design and implementation of a management information and inspection system for all major aspects of natural gas transportation and liquids production the argentine natural gas industry historical background  prior to the privatization of gde the argentine natural gas industry was effectively controlled by the government in addition prior to its privatization ypf at that time a whollyowned government company held exclusive rights over the development and production of all new hydrocarbon reserves in argentina in  natural gas law the  natural gas law  was passed providing for the privatization of gde the natural gas law and the related decrees provided for among other things the transfer of substantially all of the assets of gde to two natural gas transportation companies and eight distribution companies the transportation assets were divided into two systems on a broadly geographical basis the northern and southern trunk pipeline systems designed to give both systems access to natural gas sources  and to main centers of demand including the greater buenos aires area as a result of the division our natural gas transportation system is connected to the two natural gas distribution systems serving the greater buenos aires area one serving buenos aires province excluding the greater buenos aires area and the northeast of this province and one serving southern argentina tgn is connected to five distribution systems serving northern argentina tgn is also connected to the natural gas distribution systems serving the greater buenos aires area and to a limited extent the natural gas distribution system serving buenos aires province excluding the greater buenos aires area in the two instances where we are directly connected to a natural gas distribution system with tgn we are the principal supplier of natural gas transportation services the natural gas law and the related decrees granted each privatized natural gas transportation company a license to operate the transferred assets established a regulatory framework for the privatized industry based on open nondiscriminatory access and created enargas to regulate the transportation distribution marketing and storage of natural gas the natural gas law also provided for the regulation of wellhead gas prices in argentina for an interim period prior to deregulation the regulated price was set at us per million british thermal units  mmbtu  at the wellhead which had been the regulated price since  pursuant to presidential decree no  gas prices at the wellhead were deregulated as of january   and from that date until the year  the average price of gas increased in spite of the devaluation of the peso in  increases in wellhead natural gas prices were limited until  from may  until august  wellhead gas prices increased in a range from  to  depending on the gas basins for power plants industries and large businesses these adjustments were complemented by lower increases in the price of natural gas for cng vehicles in october  the federal energy bureau through resolution no  increased natural gas at the wellhead for residential cng and power station users according to this resolution natural gas producers agreed to transfer all of the increase in prices actually received less certain deductible amounts to a trust fund established by law no  to allow lowincome consumers with no access to natural gas to buy lpg at a subsidized price with resolution no  the federal energy bureau under decree no  ordered the termination of the trust approved by resolution no  with effect from april   through the stabilization agreement regarding the price of lpg lpg producers agreed to supply lpg fractionation companies a price that is economically viable for such companies that sell lpg at subsidized prices currently the natural gas wellhead prices remain regulated in most cases for residential power plants and cng users the argentine natural gas industry in recent years has experienced rising demand decreased supply and lower investment in exploration production transportation and distribution of natural gas as a result of economic factors including the economic recovery of many industries and gdp growth since  resulting in increased demand and government restrictions on increases in the wellhead price of natural gas and increases in the transportation and distribution tariffs which has constrained supply in order to address these factors the government played a decisive role in the natural gas industry through a set of measures designed to address the combination of rising demand and lower investment in exploration production transportation and distribution of natural gas including · creation of enarsa in  for the purposes of restoring levels of reserves production and supply of natural gas and meeting the infrastructure needs of the natural gas transportation and electricity industries · construction of a new pipeline which connects the bolivian natural gas basins with the northeastern region of argentina · creation of the gas plus program the  gas plus program  in  which aims to encourage producers to make further investments in natural gas infrastructure by allowing them to sell the resulting production of natural gas from new fields and fields that require more expensive extraction techniques at higher prices than the current authorized prices in  the government increased the price paid to natural gas producers who invest in new fields shale and tight natural gas under the gas plus program · hiring of two regasifying lng tankers through enarsa in bahía blanca  and escobar  to inject natural gas into the pipeline the tanker located at bahía blanca is connected to our pipeline and the tanker at escobar is connected to tgns pipeline  · approval of graded price increases of natural gas at the wellhead · establishment of a framework for the constitution of gas trusts to finance natural gas pipeline expansions · the passage of law no  which declares that hydrocarbons selfsufficiency as well as their production industrialization transport and marketing are activities of public interest and primary goals of argentina empowering the government to take the necessary measures to achieve such goals · through the enactment of decree no  creating a regimen to promote investment in the exploitation of hydrocarbons · the expropriation of ypf and the entry into agreements with important natural gas producers in order to increase the investment in exploration of shale and tight natural gas in neuquén province as described under gas supply below · importation of natural gas from bolivia which has increased significantly over the past two years · completion of the expansion work at the yacyretá hydroelectric plant and atucha ii nuclear power plant the construction of two thermal power plants financed by the government and the construction of power plants which provide alternate energy sources to natural gas and · creation of tariff charges to be paid by all consumers other than residential consumers in order to finance natural gas and electricity expansions and the import of natural gas in january  in order to encourage the production of natural gas the commission of planning and strategic coordination of the national hydrocarbon investments plan the commission  created by decree no  issued resolution no  which makes available preferential payment terms to all natural gas producers that submit new projects to increase existing natural gas availability allowing a price on additional injection of us mmbtu this new price constitutes an increase of over  compared to the price permitted to be charged by natural gas producers under the gas plus program the new price for the additional natural gas injected into the pipelines will be funded with funds from the argentine national treasury on a monthly basis the proposed production increase must be approved by the commission for planning and strategic coordination of the national hydrocarbon investment plan created by executive branch decree no  by decree no  of the executive branch dated december   the commission was dissolved and the functions and powers of federal jurisdiction were transferred to the ministry of energy meanwhile the provincial authorities preserve the powers that correspond to their jurisdictions on march   the ministry of energy enacted resolution no  which delegates to the secretariat of hydrocarbons resources the following functions among others · resolve the appeals filed against enargas resolutions · act as the enforcement authority of laws no  and  · manage the investment projects included in the framework of the programs created under decree no  modified by decree no  · act as the enforcement authority regarding import and export of fuels on march   the federal energy bureau issued resolution no  to implement a program for the rational use of natural gas  this resolution provides a new tariff scheme according to cubic meter consumption and the basin or region of the country the program encourages a reduction in consumption by providing different prices for those commercial and residential users that effectively reduce consumption by more than  from the amount consumed during the same period of the previous year or by applying a partial increase  with respect to the increase applied to users who do not reduce consumption at all if users reduce between  and  in the case of residential users who do not reduce their consumption the increases vary between approximately  and  in addition in response to climatic implications that arise in the south of argentina a different price for clients of camuzzi gas del sur or any subdistribution company in the south of argentina was introduced during  because their distribution area is subject to colder temperatures yearround  on march   the ministry of energy enacted resolution no  which increased natural gas prices for certain customers such as residential commercial and cng vehicles the new prices have been in force since april   resolution no  also established a social tariff regime to subsidize tariffs for the povertystricken sectors of the community the beneficiaries under this regime must register with the argentine government and meet certain criteria established by the ministry of energy  in addition on april   the ministry of energy enacted resolution no  which increased the price of the natural gas consumed by power plants starting on april   natural gas demand natural gas consumption in argentina has played a significant role in the energy industry in recent years reaching more than  of total national energy consumption which is greater than the comparable percentage for worldwide energy consumption the graphics below illustrate the increase and breakdown of natural gas consumption in argentina in  and  by type of consumer click to enlarge source  enargas beginning in  a sharp increase in natural gas demand occurred as a consequence of i the recovery of certain industries in the argentine economy since  ii the  devaluation of the peso and pesification of transportation and distribution tariffs and the elimination of both tariff and wellhead gas price adjustments making this fuel relatively inexpensive for consumers as compared to other types of fuel the prices of which are affected by inflation and iii the growth of gdp between  and  as a result natural gas became by far the cheapest fuel in argentina and high rates of substitution of natural gas for other fuels in industry power plants and vehicles have been observed likewise the rising demand for gas has also been based on the recovery of many industrial segments of the argentine economy and the lack of availability of natural gas to meet current demand represents a challenge for continued industrial growth at the rates achieved in recent years the following table sets forth local natural gas consumption by type of consumer since   click to enlarge references   includes distribution users commercial bypass bypass physical and off system users  includes subdistributors  includes shrinkage natural gas  trp  from the cerri complex which is included in others  includes governmental bodies source  enargas based on data from the licensees and off system users the demand for natural gas in argentina is highly seasonal with natural gas consumption peaks in winter the source of seasonal changes in demand is primarily residential consumers in order to bridge the gap between supply and demand especially with respect to peakday winter demand the government has entered into several gas import agreements the most important agreement was signed with the bolivian government in june  and amended in may  and july  the agreement provides for the import of natural gas from bolivia to argentina to be managed by enarsa to deal with the drop in domestic natural gas production and in an effort to maintain supplies at similar levels to the previous years the government slightly decreased imports from bolivia from  mmcfd in  to  mmcfd in   with a maximum volume of around  mmcfd in  this action achieved a substantial saving in natural gas imports costs as the average price of natural gas imported from bolivia was approximately us per million btu significantly lower than the over us per million of btu that must be paid for lng imported from tankers for the fiscal year  additionally expansion works are currently being conducted on the northern pipeline managed by tgn under the gas trust fund program which will allow for the transportation of an additional  mmcfd from bolivia the juana azurduy pipeline crosses the border between argentina and bolivia and is connected to a compressor plant in campo durán argentina this new pipeline will supply natural gas to the provinces in argentina that are not currently reached by natural gas pipeline systems in addition in recent years injections of natural gas from lng tankers have played an important role in satisfying the growing natural gas demand during the coldest months of the year natural gas injection from the lng regasification tankers located in bahía blanca and escobar decreased in  to  mmcfd from an average of  mmcfd in  enargas has assigned to us the responsibility of controlling the operation and maintenance of certain new facilities constructed to connect the regasification ship at bahía blanca to our existing transportation pipeline decree no  created the investment promotion regime for the exploitation of hydrocarbons with the goal of promoting investments in the exploitation of hydrocarbons in argentina the scheme will benefit holders of exploration permits and exploitation concessions granted by both the government and the provinces the promotion schemes will also benefit holders of concessions or others who present an investment in exploration of hydrocarbons in an amount not less than one billion dollars of foreign currency if such an investment were made within a five year period at the end of such period the beneficiary will have the right to freely export  of the production of oil and gas produced in the project free of export tax in addition beneficiaries will have the free availability of  of the revenues from the export of such hydrocarbons on october   the official gazette of the argentine republic published the text of law no  the hydrocarbons law  that amends law no  the hydrocarbons law introduces substantial modifications in the regulatory framework for the oil  gas industry in argentina among others it extends to all investment projects the investment promotion regime for the exploitation of hydrocarbons which previously had applied only to projects that represent a direct investment in currency of not less than  million dollars gas supply for the most part argentinas natural gas reserves were discovered as a result of exploration for oil reserves there are  known sedimentary basins in the country  of which are located entirely onshore six of which are combined onshoreoffshore and three of which are entirely offshore production is concentrated in five basins noroeste in northern argentina neuquén and cuyo in central argentina and golfo san jorge and austral in southern argentina in   of the natural gas transported by our system originated in the neuquina basin with the remainder coming primarily from the austral basin and the regasifying lng tanker located in bahía blanca our pipeline system is connected to the neuquina austral and golfo san jorge basins we are not connected to the cuyo or noroeste basins set forth in the table below is the location of the principal natural gas producing basins by province their proved natural gas reserves

and  respectively there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved natural gas reserves the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment results of drilling testing and production after the date of the estimate may require substantial upward or downward revisions accordingly the reserve estimates could be materially different from the quantity of natural gas that ultimately will be recovered  reserve figures do not include significant reserves located in certain bolivian basins to which tgn is connected  weighted average reserve life for all basins at the  or  production levels respectively source  federal energy bureau  according to data recently published by the ministry of energy argentine natural gas output increased  in  as compared to  to  billion cubic feet representing the first increase the last five years during  the annual volume of natural gas injected in our pipeline system was approximately  bcfd while the total firm contracted capacity was  bcfd in april  the executive branch issued decrees no  and  which called for the day legal intervention of ypf and ypf gas sa giving the executive branch temporary management of ypf and ypf gas sa then in may  the national congress enacted a proposed law which expropriated the  of ypf and ypf gas sa capital share owned by repsol ypf causing ypf to become  owned by the government since the expropriation of ypf the government has played an important role signing agreements with foreign and local oil companies in order to develop an investment plan which allows the increase of the reserves of the neuquina basin and the domestic argentine natural gas supply on february   the repsol ypf board approved a compensation package of us billion from argentina for the nationalization in order to increase the existing natural gas reserves from the neuquina basin in july  ypf announced the execution of an agreement with chevron to develop oil and gas shale deposits in this province during  ypf continued negotiating with oil companies to reach new partnership agreements that will provide technology and capital resources for the exploitation of new reserves in december  ypf signed agreements with petronas to invest us  million and in january  ypf and sinopec signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at eventually collaborating to develop oilandgas projects recently in december  ypf and dow argentina sa a subsidiary of dow chemical co announced an investment of us  million in  for shale gas exploration in argentina both companies which have already invested  million in a joint shale gas venture said in a statement that total investment could reach us  billion in coming years the joint venture is the leading shale gas project of its kind in argentina with daily production of about  cubic meters the aim is to triple daily production  in  to approximately  million cubic meters neuquina basin the largest natural gas basin and the major source of natural gas supply for our system is the neuquina basin located in west central argentina however in recent years its proved natural gas reserves have been decreasing sharply as a result of exploration and exploitation and new gas reserves have not been found in order to replace the natural gas produced in december  new nonconventional natural gas was discovered in the neuquina basin by ypf this new natural gas reserve is at the beginning stages of its exploitation which will require several years and involve high extraction costs in recent years as mentioned above in order to increase the existing natural gas reserves from the neuquina basin ypf announced the signing of certain agreements to develop oil and natural gas shale deposits in the province of neuquén in addition ypf continues negotiating with oil companies to reach new partnership agreements that will provide technology and capital resources for the exploitation of new reserves if brought online this newly discovered reserve could potentially help offset the continued decline of the existing production of the neuquina basin the tgn system also accesses the neuquina basin of the transported natural gas coming from the neuquina basin approximately  was transported by us and approximately  by tgn for the year ended december   austral and golfo san jorge basins  natural gas provided by these basins located in the southern region of argentina was transported mainly by us camuzzi sur also transports natural gas through regional pipelines in the austral basin exploration has centered in and around the basins existing natural gas fields and on other fields located offshore the golfo san jorge basin is primarily an oilproducing basin under the framework enacted by the government to promote investments after the issuance of decree no  in  a joint venture was formed by wintershall total and pae for the investment of approximately us  million in offshore gas fields this new project is expected to inject into the transportation system approximately  mmcfd of natural gas with a maximum injection of approximately  mmcfd in october  construction to install the drilling platform was concluded according to the companies the drilling works are expected to begin in the first quarter of  in addition enap sipetrol ypf and enarsa signed an agreement to explore and develop offshore fields in the continental shelf of argentina the map below illustrates the distribution of the gas basins in argentina  click to enlarge   regulatory framework industry structure  the legal framework for the transportation and distribution of natural gas in argentina comprised of the natural gas law decree no  other regulatory decrees the pliego de bases y condiciones para la privatización de gas del estado se the  pliego  the transfer agreements and the licenses of the newly privatized companies the hydrocarbons law regulates the midstream natural gas industry under a competitive and partially deregulated system the public emergency law and related laws and regulations have had the practical effect of significantly altering the regulatory regime under which we have operated since  see item  key informationd risk factorsrisks relating to our business natural gas transportation and distribution companies operate in an open access nondiscriminatory environment under which producers and certain third parties including distributors are entitled to equal and open access to the transportation pipelines and distribution system in accordance with the natural gas law applicable regulations and the licenses of the privatized companies in addition a regime of concessions under the hydrocarbons law is available to holders of exploitation concessions to transport their own natural gas production the natural gas law prohibits natural gas transportation companies from also being merchants in natural gas also i natural gas producers storage companies distributors and consumers who contract directly with producers may not own a controlling interest as defined in the natural gas law in a transportation company ii natural gas producers storage companies and transporters may not own a controlling interest in a distribution company and iii merchants in natural gas may not own a controlling interest in a transportation or distribution company contracts between affiliated companies engaged in different stages in the natural gas industry must be approved by enargas which may reject these contracts if it determines that they were not entered into on an armslength basis enargas which was established by the natural gas law is an autonomous entity responsible for enforcing the provisions of the natural gas law the applicable regulations and the licenses of the privatized companies under the provisions of the natural gas law enargas is required to be governed by a board of directors composed of five fulltime directors appointed by the executive branch subject to confirmation by the national congress however from  to  enargas was governed by three directors who were not confirmed by the national congress and since  enargas has been administered by an intervention inspector appointed by the executive branch for consecutive day terms after several renewals the executive branch extended its intervention of enargas and appointed a subinspector who continues to function in this position the last of which was ruled through decree no  on january   f transportadora de gas del sur sa notes to the consolidated financial statements as of december   and comparative information stated in thousands of pesos as described in note  unless otherwise stated enargas has broad authority to regulate the operations of the transportation and distribution companies including the ability to set rates pursuant to the public emergency law enargas has its own budget which must be included in the argentine national budget and submitted to the federal congress for approval enargas is funded principally by annual control and inspection fees that are levied on regulated entities in an amount equal to the approved budget net of collected penalties allocated proportionately to each regulated entity based on its respective gross regulated revenues excluding natural gas purchase and transportation costs in the case of distribution companies enargas also collects the fines imposed for violations of the natural gas law since  the government adopted a series of measures to redistribute the effects of the crisis in the energy sector caused by the natural gas shortage most of the electrical power stations do not have firm gas supply agreements and have increasingly used imported natural gas or alternative fuels that are more expensive than natural gas produced in argentina for this reason enargas and the federal energy bureau have issued a series of regulations aimed at averting a crisis in the internal system of natural gas supply the executive branch issued decree no  directing the federal energy bureau to establish a system of priority pursuant to which power stations and natural gas distribution companies for their residential clients could receive natural gas in priority to other users even those with firm transportation and firm gas supply contracts on april   mpfipys issued resolution no  that ratified an agreement between the federal energy bureau and natural gas producers to give effect to this new system on march   we received a notice from the federal energy bureau providing that in the event there is insufficient natural gas available in the market to supply power stations we may be required to interrupt transportation services including those with firm transportation contracts to our customers in order to give priority to natural gas distribution companies and power plants that have not entered into natural gas firm transportation contracts in any such case enargas will set the priority of transportation under these circumstances and our license when enargas asks us to restrict the provision of natural gas to clients who hold firm transportation contracts we are exposed to potential claims from among others our customers therefore we have requested that in connection with these new procedures enargas submit to us written instructions for any such natural gas firm transportation service interruption request however if enargas does not accept our petition and we do not comply with enargass instructions if any in order to avoid future claims from our customers resolution no  will require us to pay the price difference between natural gas and the alternative fuel used by power stations in order to offset the loss resulting from our failure to comply with the instructions at the end of may  due to the rising demand for natural gas resulting from unusually low temperatures throughout the country enargas and the federal energy bureau utilized their authority under resolution  for the first time enargas honored our petition and submitted written instructions to us we complied with these instructions and do not believe that our compliance will result in legal action by any of our firm transportation clients which legal action if brought could have a significant adverse economic and financial effect on us as of the date of this annual report only one client profertil sa has brought legal actions against us in respect of service interruptions that occurred in   and  in this action enargas ruled in our favor alleging that the interruptions were due to the shortage of natural gas in october  enargas issued resolution no  which set new rules for natural gas dispatch applicable to all participants in the natural gas industry and imposed new and more severe priority demand gas restrictions on producers through this resolution enargas has the ability to redirect natural gas transportation in order to give priority to residential consumption the government also expressly instructed us to redirect natural gas deliveries to supply power plants residential users and vehicles in the winter of  since then higher demand from industrial and power plant customers from  to  and from all customers since  have been observed although the natural gas supply shortage did not create a bottleneck in the transportation capacity for meeting the total demand from the system during these periods the government through the committee referred to above continues to impose restrictions on the consumption of natural gas by certain customers that hold firm transportation contracts with us from time to time in an effort to redirect and target the supply  transportadora de gas del sur sa notes to the consolidated financial statements as of december   and comparative information stated in thousands of pesos as described in note  unless otherwise stated to the demand regarded as top priority mainly residential users cng stations and industries connected to the distribution network the imports of natural gas by the government from bolivia within the framework of the agreement entered by both countries reached an average volume in  of  mmcfd slightly lower than the volume of  mmcfd recorded in  likewise lng imports through the tankers located at the ports of bahía blanca and escobar recorded an average volume of  mmcfd in  somewhat lower than the  mmcfd recorded in  in addition the drop in prices of oil and byproducts has represented a significant decrease in the amounts paid by the government for these products with the purpose of redirecting and allocating the supply to higher priority consumers mainly residential commercial and cng stations restrictions to gas supply to the industrial sector continued to occur in the recent winters although to a lesser extent than has been observed in the past the restrictions set forth by the intervening authority affected direct shippers who have firm transportation contracts with us as well as industries in different distribution areas of the country we do not believe that our compliance will result in legal action by any of our natural gas firm transportation clients however any legal action if brought could have a significant adverse economic and financial effect on us  see item  key informationd risk factors   our license our license authorizes us to provide the public service of natural gas transportation through the exclusive utilization of the southern natural gas transportation system our license does not grant us an exclusive right to transport natural gas in a specified geographical area and licenses may be granted to others for the provision of gas transportation services in the same geographical area tgns natural gas transportation system is comprised of two transmission pipes the north pipeline and central western pipeline and is operated under a license containing substantially similar terms to those described below and elsewhere herein our license was granted for an original term of  years beginning on december   however the natural gas law provides that we may apply to enargas for a renewal of our license for an additional year term enargas is required at that time to evaluate our performance and make a recommendation to the executive branch if enargas determines that we are in substantial compliance with all our obligations arising under the natural gas law related regulations and our license the renewal should be granted by the executive branch enargas would bear the burden of proving that we had not complied with the obligations described above and therefore should not be granted a renewal at the end of the year or year term as the case may be the natural gas law requires that a new competitive auction be held for the license allowing us the option if we have complied substantially with our obligations described above to match the best bid offered to the government by any third party to the extent that we were found not to have complied with the obligations described above or chose not to seek renewal of our license we would be entitled to certain specified compensation see certain restrictions with respect to essential assets below our license also places certain other rights and

revocation of our license may only be declared by the executive branch upon the recommendation of enargas our license specifies several grounds for revocation including the following · repeated failure to comply with the obligations of our license and failure to remedy a significant breach of an obligation in accordance with specified procedures · total or partial interruption of the service for reasons attributable to us affecting completely or partially transportation capacity during the periods stipulated in our license · sale assignment or transfer of our essential assets or otherwise encumbering such assets without enargass prior authorization unless such encumbrances serve to finance expansions and improvements to the gas pipeline system · bankruptcy dissolution or liquidation

may be changed or our license may be revoked in addition enargas may alter the terms of service annexed to our license if any such alteration were to have an economic effect on us enargas should modify our rates to compensate for such effect or we could request a change in the applicable rates regulation of transportation ratesactual rates the natural gas transportation rates established under each transportation company must be calculated in us dollars and converted into pesos at the time of billing pursuant to the terms of such license however the public emergency law eliminated tariff indexing covenants based on us dollar exchange rate fluctuations and established a conversion rate of one peso equal to one us dollar for tariffs the rate for natural gas firm transportation

no regulatory limitations on entry into the business of providing natural gas transportation services in argentina the construction of a competing pipeline system would require substantial capital investment and the approval of enargas moreover as a practical matter a direct competitor would have to enter into agreements with natural gas distribution companies or endusers to transport a sufficient quantity of gas to justify the capital investment in view of our current firm transportation contracts with our distribution company customers and the other characteristics of the markets in which we operate management believes that it would be very difficult for a new entrant to the natural gas transportation market to pose a significant competitive threat to us at least in the short to intermediate term in the longer term the ability of new entrants to successfully penetrate our market would depend on a favorable regulatory environment an increasing and unsatisfied demand for gas by endusers sufficient investment in downstream facilities to accommodate increased delivery capacity from the natural gas transportation systems and the finding of significant natural gas reserves to a limited extent we compete with tgn on a daytoday basis for natural gas interruptible transportation services and from timetotime for new natural gas firm transportation services made available as a result of expansion projects to the natural gas distribution companies to whom both we and tgn are either directly or indirectly connected camuzzi pampeana metrogas and ban we compete directly with tgn for the transportation of natural gas from the neuquén basin to the greater buenos aires area the cost of natural gas relative to competing fuels may also affect the demand for transportation services in the long term the delivered cost of gas to endusers in argentina based on energy content is currently significantly lower than other alternative fuels except for hydroelectric power   in addition the government has implemented a number of projects to encourage the exploration and development of new natural gas reserves or secure alternative supplies of natural gas in recent years  see item  our informationb business overviewnatural gas transportationthe argentine natural gas industry for example the northeast pipeline is a project led by the government which will connect the

large new natural gas projects could reduce future investments in the exploration of fields from which we transport natural gas and consequently could decrease the volumes transported by us as these

our liquids production and commercialization activities are conducted at our cerri complex which is located near the city of bahía blanca in the province of buenos aires in the cerri complex ethane

to make inkind deliveries of additional natural gas to replace their attributable share of natural gas shrinkage fuel and losses associated with the extraction of liquids from natural gas the results of our liquids production and commercialization segment are subject to risks associated with commodity price changes we do not currently hedge against commodity price risk we operate our liquids business under two different types of contractual arrangements · liquids production and commercialization for our own account under this type of arrangement we own the liquids products obtained at our cerri complex we purchase natural gas in order to replace thermal units consumed in the liquids production process these natural gas purchases are negotiated with certain natural gas distributors traders and producers we include the assignment of rights in our favor to withdraw the liquids contained in the natural gas purchased or injected in the pipeline system this category of our liquids business is most important in terms of revenue percentage of transactions and profit · liquids production and commercialization on behalf of third parties  we also process natural gas and market the liquids products in exchange for a commission based on a percentage of the sale price in some cases we process the natural gas and deliver the liquids products to the natural gas producers who pay us a percentage of the average monthly sale price obtained from our sales in the domestic andor international markets depending on the contract our sales of liquids in the domestic market were regulated

is the sole outlet for ethane from the cerri complex any ethane extracted at the cerri complex that cannot be sold to pbb is reinjected into the pipeline our liquids production and commercialization segment has increased as a percentage of our total revenues from  in  to  in  as a consequence of the adverse change in the regulated natural gas transportation segment and the increases in the international prices of lpg and natural gasoline which generated higher revenues principally from exports since the last quarter of  international prices of lpg have declined significantly in tandem with the decline in oil prices however as mentioned below in december  and february  the export tax regime was modified to mitigate such decline in international prices nonetheless if prices continue decreasing in the future this decrease could have a significant adverse effect on our future earnings from this segment in  our export revenues from the liquids production and commercialization segment were ps  million and represented  of our total net revenues and  of our liquids production and commercialization revenues additionally the total volume of sales from liquids was  short tons and the volume of sales from liquids exports was  short tons representing  of our total liquids sales volumes these export volumes also include sales made on behalf of third parties export revenues from our liquids production and commercialization segment command a price premium which has declined after the decrease in international prices as compared to our domestic market sales primarily as a result of government regulation of domestic prices and high prices and demand for liquids on the international markets the annual sales of the cerri complex for   and  in short tons were as follows          ethane         lpg         natural gasoline         total         our management anticipates that new oil and natural gas developments in argentina will provide new opportunities in the liquids production and commercialization business and lead to related increases in revenues from our natural gas transportation and liquids production and commercialization businesses  transportadora de gas

production and commercialization activities are not subject to regulation by enargas however in recent years the government has enacted regulations that significantly affect our liquids production activities domestic market we are not able to freely select the markets to which we will allocate lpg production as we are effectively required to meet the minimum domestic demand before exporting significant amounts of lpg we forego sales to foreign markets which benefit from higher prices than those established for local consumers as noted above our sales of lpg in the domestic market were regulated until april   by the stabilization agreement and related regulations under this framework the federal energy bureau caused lpg suppliers to guarantee sufficient supply of lpg in the domestic market at low prices law no  creates a price regime pursuant to which the federal energy bureau periodically published reference prices for lpg sold in the domestic market it also sets forth lpg volumes to be sold in the domestic market the stabilization agreement was initially intended to expire on december   since that date however there have been several annual amendments to the agreement t he most recent amendment signed on april   and ratified through resolution no  of the federal energy bureau provided that the stabilization agreement would remain in force until march   under the stabilization agreement butane bottles were sold at a fixed price below the market price with a quota assigned to each producer the lower price is partially offset by a subsidy paid to producers by a trust fund created for this purpose by law no  the trust fund is funded by i penalties established by law no  ii assignments from the general state budget and iii funds that may be assessed by the federal energy bureau on march   the executive branch issued decree no  regulated by resolution no  issued by the federal energy bureau both replaced stabilization agreement creating the new program as was the case under the stabilization agreement under the new program the federal energy bureau regulates the price and the quantity of lpg sold in the domestic market by each lpg producer on april   the federal energy bureau issued resolution no  which sets the new reference prices and the compensation received by us to sell lpg under the new program participation in the new program requires us to produce and market the lpg volumes required by the federal energy bureau at prices significantly below the market this requirement prevents us from covering production costs even after giving effect to the subsidy payments that we receive under the agreement creating a negative operating margin we have initiated several actions with the government in order to prevent the current situation of selling products with negative operating margins from continuing for an extended period in this sense on june   we filed a motion for reconsideration against the provisions of federal energy bureau regarding volumes of lpg that must be provided in  under the new program  in addition on august   we filed a lawsuit to impugn resolutions no  and  in march  we demanded a quick sentence on this issue as of the issuance of this annual report the federal energy bureau has not paid the compensations accrued for february and march  owed pursuant to the stabilization agreement for this reason on september   and february   we requested that the federal energy bureau make these payments finally since the supply agreement for propane gas distribution networks propane networks agreement  was signed between the government and producers of lpg including us in  we have complied with our commitments under this agreement pursuant to the propane networks agreement which has undergone several extensions the federal energy bureau fixed prices and procedures by which it compensates participating companies the latest extension of this agreement was signed between the parties in  and covered the period from april  to april  at the date of issuance of this annual report the corresponding extension to the period from april  to april  has not been signed  transportadora de gas del sur sa

provide this product in similar conditions as those included in the last extension signed according to the written instructions received from the federal energy bureau on march   the federal energy bureau replaced the method for calculating the propane and butane export parity price applicable to propane and butane sales not included in the new program through resolution no  the previous method had been in place since june   pursuant to resolution no  the new calculation method came into effect on april   the unpaid amount of compensation related to the new program and the propane networks agreement totaled ps  million as of march   in august and november  and in february  we have requested that the ministry of energy previously the federal energy bureau make these payments but have not received any formal response as of the date of this annual report furthermore on december   through decree no  the executive branch created a trust to finance natural gas imports to be injected into the natural gas pipeline system the trust is funded among other means through the creation of a charge to be paid by i the users of the transportation andor distribution regulated services ii natural gas consumers receiving gas directly from producers without using natural gas transportation or distribution systems and iii the natural gas processing companies certain entities including us were selected to receive a subsidy for the payment of the charge starting in december  however in november  enargas issued the gas charge resolutions that modified the list of the subsidy beneficiaries and thus involved a charge increase for many of our clients and specifically for our consumption for our own account the charge increased from ps  to ps  per cubic meter of natural gas effective from december   representing a significant rise of the variable costs of natural gas processing see item  operating and financial review and prospectsa operating resultsdiscussion of results of

the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations often requires management to make judgments regarding the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from those estimated as a result of these different assumptions we have described each of the following critical accounting policies and estimates in order to provide an understanding about how our management forms judgments and views with respect to such policies and estimates as well as the sensitivity of such policies and estimates · impairment of property plant and equipment · allowances

evaluate the carrying value of our property plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the calculation of the value in use is based on the definition of discounted future cash flows the projected cash flows are prepared taking into account i projections of the price of liquids and purchase costs of natural gas associated with our liquids production and commercialization segment including the impact of the gas charge resolutions and other services segment ii estimates relating to the timing type and amount of the tariff increase and the recognition of cost adjustments for the natural gas transportation segment iii projections of future costs to be incurred and iv the use of

rate is our weighted average cost of capital  wacc  we recorded no impairment losses of components of property plant and equipment as of december   and  due to the uncertainties surrounding the tariff renegotiation process as described in note a to our financial statements estimates of future tariff adjustments are highly uncertain and there is a substantial risk that these estimates could prove to be materially different from actual future tariffs for this reason we performed probabilityweighted analysis as to the cash flow assumptions considered in performing an impairment test of our natural gas transportation business segment as of the end of each year we considered two different scenarios · scenario  we are able to reach an agreement with the government regarding a tariff increase scenario  and · scenario  we are unable to reach an agreement with the government resulting in no tariff increase during the remaining term of our license including the entire extension period scenario  as of december   we assigned a probability of occurrence of  to scenario  and a probability of occurrence of  to scenario   transportadora de gas del sur sa notes to the consolidated financial statements as of december   and comparative information stated in thousands of pesos as described in note  unless otherwise stated in performing the analysis for scenario  because the terms of an agreement with the government are also uncertain we developed three different projected cash flow streams based on the timing type and amount of our tariff increase based on the renegotiation process with the government namely a the base case b the optimistic case and c the pessimistic case and assigned a portion of the probability of occurrence of  to each projected cash flow  and  respectively specific details of each cash flow streams as of december   were based on a the status of the negotiations with the government and the impact of the two tariff increases included in the  transitional agreement b our current regulatory framework c experiences and renegotiation agreements signed by other natural gas and electricity utility peers and d managements expectations regarding other measures that management believes are likely to be taken by the government to deal with the present economic situation of natural gas and electricity utilities each of these cash flow scenarios included assumptions related to i the implementation of an initial tariff increase as contemplated by decree no  ii the enactment of the license renegotiation agreement with uniren which was accepted by us but has not been executed and which contemplates different magnitudes and timings of the tariff review and iii the magnitude and timing of the semiannual tariff review

effect on them  and item  b business overviewnatural gas transportationregulatory frameworkthe public emergency law and renegotiation agreement we have prepared our projections under the assumption that the natural gas transportation tariff will be improved according to the current framework however we are not in the position to ensure that future changes in our tariff schedule will be in line with our estimates therefore significant differences may arise in relation to the estimates and assumptions used as of the date of this annual report based on those estimations as the estimated discounted cash flows were higher than the carrying amount of such assets we determined that the property plant and equipment were not impaired under ifrs as of december   in addition we have performed a sensitivity analysis of the probability of occurrence of each scenario and we concluded that an increase of up to  percentage points in the weighted probability of the pessimistic case from  to  and a  reduction in the probability of occurrence of the optimistic case from  to  and an  reduction in the probability of occurrence of the base case  to  would not generate adjustment for impairment allowances for doubtful accounts we provide for doubtful accounts relating to accounts receivables the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the evaluation of various factors including the credit risk of customers historical trends and other information while we use the information available to make evaluations future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if future economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations  we have considered all events andor transactions that are subject to reasonable and normal methods of estimation and our financial statements reflect that consideration provisions for legal claims and others we have certain contingent liabilities with respect to legal and regulatory proceedings we

financial statements as of december   and comparative information stated in thousands of pesos as described in note  unless otherwise stated the liabilities becomes better defined there may be changes in estimates of future costs which could have a material effect on our future results of operations and financial condition or liquidity we believe that our accounting policy relating to the allowances for doubtful accounts and provision for legal claims and others is a critical accounting policy because · it requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that are highly susceptible to change from period to period · the impact that recognizing or reversing allowances for doubtful accounts and provisions for legal claims and others would have on our consolidated

for the year ended december   increased by ps  million from ps  million to ps  million  as compared to the year ended december   this increase was mainly due to i a ps  million increase in variable production costs of liquids resulting from the rise in the price of natural gas that we are required to purchase in replacement of the energy content we extract from the gas stream or rtp as part of the liquids processing business ii a ps  million increase in export and turnover tax from sales and iii a ps  million increase in labor costs   in light of the uncertainty in the international market our sales of lpg and natural gasoline to petróleo brasileiro are currently made on a spot basis but on pricing terms as prevailed under the agreement with petróleo brasileiro that expired in september

b liquidity and capital resources in response to the limited availability of financing for argentine companies we closely monitor our liquidity levels in order to ensure compliance with our financial obligations and to achieve our objectives our cash flows from operations have been affected in recent years due to the lack of adjustment to our natural gas transportation tariffs to cover increases in our operating costs along these lines and as a guiding principle financial solvency is our main objective to preserve cash surpluses we invest in low risk and highly liquid financial assets offered by high quality financial institutions that are located in argentina and the united states of america our policy is designed to diversify credit risk we also prioritize investing our cash surpluses in us dollar denominated financial assets as our debt is almost  us dollar denominated in the short term the most significant factors generally affecting our cash flow from operating activities are i fluctuations in international prices for lpg products ii fluctuations in production levels and demand for our products and services iii changes in regulations such as taxes taxes on exports tariff for our regulated business segment and price controls and iv fluctuations in exchange rates  transportadora de gas del sur sa notes to the consolidated financial statements as of december   and comparative information stated in thousands of pesos as described in note  unless otherwise stated within the framework of the  transitional agreement in the fiscal years  and  we received two tariff increases these increases were not enough to offset the significant increases in costs recorded over the last years in spite of our continuous efforts to reduce them although this situation has resulted in an annual operating loss in the last two years the tariff increases were important to achieve the aim of partially improving the economic situation of this business segment until we arrive at an understanding with the government with respect to the integral renegotiation agreement both tariff increases were authorized by resolutions no i and no i issued by enargas and include the following increases respectively · a stepped increase of  as from april    accumulated since june   and  accumulated since august   · as from may   a transitional increase of  in the price of the natural gas transportation service and  in the cau in march  the enargas granted us a transitional increase of  in natural gas transportation tariffs and the cau effective april   the purpose of the increase is to cover costs and investments associated with the regular provision of the public service of natural gas transportation until the integral renegotiation agreements is finalized  pursuant to resolution no  we must also execute the investment plan which will amount to ps  million the investment plan must be concluded by march  we expect to fund the capital expenditures under the investment plan with funds generated by our operations   starting in the fourth quarter of  the liquids production and commercialization business segment as it is mentioned in item a operating results liquids production and commercialization began to be affected by the sharp decline in the reference international prices of the liquids which kept at very low levels during  and the first quarter of  in  we also continued participating in the stabilization agreement program through which butane is commercialized at subsidized sales prices despite significantly higher production costs thus generating a loss of approximately of ps  million in  for further information see item a our informationliquids production and commercialization the aspects described above have changed our operating cash flow especially the operating cash flow corresponding to the liquids business segment that in prior years had mitigated the natural gas transportation segment difficulties and the profitability decrease as a consequence of the sustained cost increase not reflected in the tariff increase nonetheless during  our operating cash generation has been sufficient to meet our operating costs and capital expenditures in previous years increased prices and volumes in our liquids production and commercialization segment have compensated for the decrease in the operating income of our natural gas transportation business segment which has been negatively affected by the continuous increase in its operational cost and the lack of tariff adjustment since  on december   the new administration of the executive branch issued certain measures that involved the opening of foreign exchange controls in force over the last four years as a result the official exchange rate published by banco de la nación argentina increased from ps  per us dollar on december   to ps  per us dollar on december   the new regulation modifies the existing regimes related to among others i the

waiting period prepayment and iv imports of goods and services for additional information see item   additional information  d exchange controls a potential new devaluation of the peso additional capital expenditures required by the government or lower liquids prices could harm our cashgenerating ability and materially adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to service our debt  transportadora de gas del sur sa notes to the consolidated financial statements as of december   and comparative information stated in thousands of pesos as described in note  unless otherwise stated the decline in international reference prices could be regarded as circumstantial but has structural effects that could adversely affect the operating margins of our liquids production and commercialization business segment which up to this year had allowed us to balance our cash flows offsetting the negative effect of the lack of natural gas transportation tariffs adjustment we cannot predict the level and the time when the decline in oil prices will stop thus these negative factors further emphasize the need to continue to strengthen all our efforts aimed at obtaining the expected adjustment of our tariffs in the natural gas transportation segment our primary sources and uses of cash during the years ended december    and  are shown in the table below   years ended december

generated by the liquids productions and commercialization segment cash flows used in investing activities cash flows used for investing activities increased by ps  million in  compared with  this increase is mainly due to higher capital expenditures of ps  million due to higher costs incurred for carrying out repair and maintenance of pipeline system operated by us cash flows used for investing activities decreased by ps  million in  compared with  this decrease is mainly due to the increase in cash flows generated by the sale of financial assets other than cash equivalents of ps

resolutions enargas and the government appealed the decision to the court of appeals in administrative federal matters on december   we expanded the grounds of our demand and requested that the case to be referred to the defendants since march   the legal proceedings related to proof of evidence are ongoing the basis for our claims is that the resolutions violate the constitutional principles that govern the matter and annulment of administrative acts because no tax burden may be enforceable without the prior existence of a law framed within the constitutional precepts and created by the legislative branch by a special law in addition we stated that the value of the charge for natural gas consumption is confiscatory the injunction was only granted for a sixmonth period renewable at its end since obtaining the injunction we have been successful in obtaining extensions after the end of every sixmonth period the current injunction granted to us expires in september  or if prior the sentence resolving the case will be issued the government appeals filed against the injunction were first denied by the court of appeals and finally by the supreme court in december  given the limited duration of the injunction we filed an appeal before the supreme court additionally enargas and the ministry of federal planning and public investment lodged appeals with respect to the granting of the injunction on december   the supreme court rejected the appeals filed by the parties and therefore the injunction was granted to us furthermore to broaden the basis for our demand after the enactment of law no  which amended law no  so as to include the natural gas processing tariff charge under the taxes the creation of which was delegated to the executive branch by the national congress we have referred to the presiding judge the confiscatory character that the tariff charge would have on our economic and financial condition as of the date of issuance of this annual report such proceedings are open in addition on september   the court rejected the request by enargas to declare the prosecution abstract and the injunction without effect decision which was confirmed by the court of appeal on march   our management believes it has sufficient valid arguments to defend our position and thus we have not recorded the increase of the charge for natural gas consumptions from the date of obtaining the injunction until the date of the issuance of this annual report in the event this injunction had not been obtained the impact of the resolutions for the years ended december   taking into account the possibility of carryforward of the charge to the sales price of the product would have implied a net loss of ps  million meanwhile the accumulated impact on the retained earnings since obtaining the injunction would have involved a reduction effect of ps  million d repetition action of vat and income tax on october   we signed the  transitional agreement with uniren that contemplated a tariff increase of  which would be retroactively applicable to september   on december   the executive branch ratified this transitional agreement through the presidential decree no  by means of this decree we will be able to bill the tariff increase to our clients as soon as enargas publishes the new tariffs schedule and sets the methodology to bill the retroactive effect finally this administrative act did not become effective and therefore in september  we filed an acción de amparo a summary proceeding to guarantee constitutional rights due to the passing of time since the enactment of decree no  on december   our board of directors resolved to discontinue the recognition of the tariff increase revenue and to reverse the credit provision of the tariff increase revenue already accrued in the year ended december   the reversal of the tariff increase does not imply any resignation to the company´s right resulting from decree no  on may   we filed a tax recovery appeal with respect to the income tax and vat credits generated by the reversal of the tariff increase credit mentioned above our claim was not heard after three months so on october   we filed an appeal before the federal tax bureau as of the date of the issuance of this annual report the case is in evidence stage the total amount claimed by us amounted to ps  million plus compensatory interests the outstanding balance of this credit has been valued at its amortized cost and it has been included in other noncurrent receivables other litigation a others in addition to the matters discussed above we are a party to certain lawsuits and administrative proceedings which involve taxation labor claims social security administrative and others arising in the ordinary course of business our management and our legal advisors estimate that the outcome of these differences will not have significant adverse effects on our financial position or results of operations as of december   and  the total amount of these provisions amounted to ps  million and ps  million respectively b environmental matters we are subject to extensive environmental regulations in argentina our management believes that our current operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental requirements as currently interpreted and enforced we have not incurred in any material environmental liabilities as a result of our operations to date as of december   and  the total amount of these provision amounted ps  million respectively c arbitral claim on may   the secretariat of the international court of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce notified us regarding the request for arbitration initiated by pae and pan american sur sa the applicants related to the execution of three natural gas processing contracts between the applicants and us the agreements on april   we were notified of the beginning of the corresponding demand to which we must respond on or before august   according to the demand the applicants allege breach of contracts during the period between february  and february  that would have resulted in a lower allocation of the products obtained the products which shortfall at march   is claimed to be equal to us  million plus interest the claim we consider that the claim contains inconsistencies resulting from misinterpretations of the contractual provisions and an incorrect application of the mechanisms for calculating the allocation of the products and therefore we believe that the amount claimed is not supportable we jointly with technical experts and our legal counsel continue to review the claim as it prepares to respond to the demand for arbitration  management believes that we have meritorious defenses to the claim and intends to assert such defenses vigorously given the present stage of the arbitration process as of the date of issuance of this annual report we cannot predict the outcome of this

new government which took office on december   announced important changes to the existing foreign exchange regulations its main objective was to relax several restrictions imposed on the foreign exchange market in recent years new measures were taken after the issuance of communication a  by the bcra the following new measures have been enacted through published rules · payments abroad for imports of goods and services can now be made without any limit through the foreign exchange market this provision applies to new imports for outstanding debts as of december   for imports of goods and services the government established a payment schedule with certain restrictions until june  · the purchase of foreign currency by individuals and companies for treasury purposes including investments abroad which had been significantly limited in recent years was reinstated with a cap of us million per month · the mandatory oneyear deposit  on the incoming currency into argentina applicable to loans granted by foreign parties as well as other transactions was eliminated · financial loans are not required to be settled in argentina the requirement to provide evidence showing the inflow of funds however remains in effect for the subsequent payment of principal and interest through the foreign exchange market the minimum term for repayment was reduced from  to days and advance payment will also be allowed as long as the day term is respected · the regulations establishing controls on export prepayments and prefinancing transactions such as providing evidence for outright purchases shipment terms and indebtedness caps among others were eliminated in addition the argentine authorities enacted a local withholding tax system applicable to dollar future agreements arranged during the previous months in which restrictions on the foreign exchange market were in force in this sense a withholding of  creditable against income tax will apply on those earnings obtained by the buyers of us dollar future contracts this new withholding tax is applicable to the currency forward agreements hold by us in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency as it has been explained previously recently on february   the bcra issued communication a  relaxing certain rules related to the inflow and outflow of foreign currency including the possibility of receiving

appear as if obtained through legitimate means provided that the aggregate value of the assets involved exceed in the aggregate through one or more related transactions ps  in addition law no  created

federal income tax matters that may be relevant to the ownership and disposition of adss or class b shares the summary describes the principal tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of adss or class b shares but it does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a holder of adss or class b shares the summary is based upon tax laws of argentina and the united states and regulations thereunder as in effect on the date of this annual report which are subject to change possibly on a retroactive basis in addition the summary is based in part on representations of the depositary and assumes that each obligation provided for in or otherwise contemplated by the deposit agreement or any other related document will be performed in accordance with its terms holders of adss or class b shares should consult their own tax advisors as to the united states argentine or other tax consequences of the acquisition ownership and disposition of the adss or class b shares in their particular circumstances argentine taxes income tax law no  enacted on september   and published in the official gazette on september   introduced several changes to income tax law no  including the derogation of section  of decree no  which provided that foreign holders with no permanent establishment in argentina were exempt from paying income tax on the capital gains arising from the sale or other disposition of class b shares or adss the scope of the law was clarified by means of decree no  the changes introduced by law no  are effective from the date of publication of such law in the official gazette and are applicable to taxable events consummated from september   onwards taxation of dividends until law no  became effective dividends of our cash property or capital stock paid or distributed to holders of class b shares or adss were generally not subject to income tax withholding however according to law no  published on december   the portion of cash or other type of dividend distribution exceeding our accumulated net income at year end if any is subject to a  withholding tax as a sole and definite payment in addition as of the effective date of law no  the gross amount of dividends we distribute other than stock dividends in respect of class b shares or adss are subject to tax at a rate of  this tax is

exchanges or markets andor authorized to be offered to the public is exempt from such tax resident individuals capital gains obtained by resident individuals from the sale of class b shares or ads not listed on securities exchanges or markets or not authorized to be offered to the public are subject to tax at a rate of  losses arising from the sale exchange or other disposition of class b shares or adss can be applied only to offset such capital gains arising from the sale exchange or other disposition of these securities foreign holders as of the effective date of law no  on september   a nonresident holder who sells exchanges or otherwise disposes of class b shares or adss is subject to a capital gains tax at a rate of  this tax is assessed at the option of the seller on either i  of the gross proceeds of such sale exchange or disposition or ii the net gain from such sale exchange or disposition as calculated under the relevant income tax law however when both the purchaser and the seller of class b shares or adss are nonresidents the purchaser of the shares or adss is liable for payment of this tax accordingly when both the purchaser and the seller of class b shares or adss are nonresidents the purchaser is required to pay the capital gains tax in addition to the purchase price of the class b shares or adss there is currently no guidance under argentine law with respect to how a seller of class b shares or adss may determine the residence of the purchaser holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the applicability of law no  to the sale or acquisition of class b shares or adss argentine entities capital gains obtained by argentine entities generally entities organized or incorporated under argentine law certain traders and intermediaries local branches of nonargentine entities sole proprietorships and individuals carrying on certain commercial activities in argentina derived from the sale exchange or other disposition of class b shares or adss are subject to income tax at the rate of  losses arising from the sale exchange or other disposition of class b shares or adss can be applied only to offset such capital gains arising from the sale exchange or other disposition of these securities tax on personal property individuals the argentine tax authority has introduced some amendments to the personal property tax law in accordance with law no  the personal tax corresponding to the ownership of securities issued by entities domiciled in argentina whose direct owners are individuals domiciled in argentina or abroad and entities domiciled abroad will be liquidated and deposited by the entity that has issued such securities the applicable rate is  on the equity value according to the last financial statements as of each respective fiscal year law no  presumes that securities whose holders are entities domiciled or located abroad indirectly belong to individuals domiciled abroad we are responsible for depositing such tax and have the right to recover such amount from holders even withholding andor liquidating the securities which caused such tax payment this amendment was effective starting fiscal year  vat  the

disposition of adss or class b shares there are no argentine stamp issue registration or similar taxes or duties payable by holders of adss or class b shares tax treaties argentina has entered into tax treaties with several countries there is currently no tax treaty or convention in effect between argentina and the united states united states taxes general  this discussion relating to certain us federal income tax consequences applies only to a us holder as defined below who holds our class b shares or adss it applies to holders only if he or she holds our class b shares or adss as capital assets for tax purposes and is not a member of a special class of holders subject to special rules including a dealer in securities a trader in securities that elects to use a marktomarket method of accounting for his or her securities holdings a taxexempt organization a life insurance company a person liable for alternative minimum tax a person that actually or constructively owns  or more of our voting stock a person that holds class b shares or adss as part of a hedging or straddle or conversion transaction a person that purchases or sells class b shares or adss as part of a wash sale for tax purposes or a person whose functional currency is not the us dollar this discussion is based on the us internal revenue code of  as amended its legislative history existing and proposed regulations published rulings and court decisions and the laws of argentina all as currently in effect these laws are subject to change possibly on a retroactive basis in addition this section is based in part upon the assumption that each obligation in the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms if a partnership holds class b shares or adss the united states federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership a partner in a partnership holding class b shares or adss should consult its tax advisor with regard to the united states federal income tax treatment of an investment in class b shares or adss a holder is a us holder if such holder is a beneficial owner of class b shares or adss and such holder is a citizen or resident of the united states a domestic corporation or other entity taxable as such an estate whose income is subject to us federal income tax regardless of its source or a trust if a us court can exercise primary supervision over the trusts administration and one or more us persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust in general and taking into account the earlier assumptions for us federal income tax purposes a holder of adrs evidencing adss will be treated as the owner of the underlying class b shares represented by those adss and exchanges of class b shares for adrs and adrs for class b shares will not be subject to us federal income tax this discussion does not generally address any aspects of us taxation other than federal income taxation holders of class b shares or adss are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the us federal state and local tax consequences of owning and disposing of the class b shares or adss in their particular circumstances taxation of dividends  under the united states federal income tax laws and subject to the passive foreign investment company  pfic  rules discussed below a us holder must include in his or her gross income the gross amount of any dividend that we pay out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for us federal income tax purposes if the holder is a noncorporate us holder dividends that constitute qualified dividend income will be taxable at the preferential rates applicable to longterm capital gains provided that the class b shares or adss are held for more than  days during the day period beginning  days before the exdividend date and certain other holding period requirements are met dividends that are paid with respect to the adss that are readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states are qualified dividend income under this rule we expect that the dividends we pay with respect to the adss will be qualified dividend income because the class b shares are not readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states it is unclear whether dividends paid with respect to the class b shares will also be qualified dividend income the holder must include any argentine tax withheld from the dividend payment in this gross amount even though the holder does not in fact receive it the holder must include the gross amount of dividends in income when the holder in the case of class b shares or the depositary in the case of adss receives the dividend actually or constructively the dividend will not be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction generally allowed to us corporations in respect of dividends received from other us corporations distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined for us federal income tax purposes will be treated as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of a holders basis in the class b shares or adss and thereafter as capital gain the amount of the dividend distribution that a holder must include in his or her income will be the us dollar value of the argentine peso payments made determined at the spot argentine pesous dollar rate on the date such dividend distribution is includible in such holders income regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into us dollars generally any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the date a holder includes the dividend payment in income to the date such payment is converted into us dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the special tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income such gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the united states for foreign tax credit limitation purposes for foreign tax credit purposes the dividend will generally be income from sources outside the united states dividends will depending on the holders circumstances generally be either passive or general income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to the holder except as set forth in the following paragraph and subject to certain limitations the argentine tax withheld and paid over to argentina will be creditable or deductible against your us federal income tax liability special rules apply in determining the foreign tax credit limitation with respect to dividends that are subject to the preferential tax rates no us foreign tax credit will be allowed to us holders of class b shares or adss in respect of any personal property or similar tax imposed by argentina or any taxing authority thereof or therein taxation of capital gains  subject to the pfic rules discussed below a us holder that sells or otherwise disposes of class b shares or adss will recognize gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the us dollar value of the amount realized and his or her tax basis determined in us dollars in such class b shares or adss capital gain of a noncorporate us holder is generally taxed at preferential rates where the holder has a holding period greater than one year the gain or loss generally will be income or loss from sources within the us for foreign tax credit limitation purposes   as discussed above under argentine taxestaxation of capital gains it is possible that a us holder who sells or purchases the class b shares or adss may be subject to argentine tax upon such sale or acquisition if the seller is legally liable for the tax and the seller pays this tax then the seller should be able to claim a foreign tax credit for us federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the amount of the tax subject to generally applicable limitations however because the gain from a sale or other disposition of class b shares or adss will be us source income such seller would need a sufficient amount of other foreign source income that is untaxed or that is taxed at a tax rate that is sufficiently lower than the us tax rate applicable to such seller in order to be able to claim this foreign tax credit additionally if an argentine tax is withheld on the sale or other disposition of class b shares or adss then the seller must include the amount of such tax withheld in the amount realized upon the sale or disposition even though the seller does not in fact receive it if the purchaser is legally liable for the tax then the purchaser will likely not be entitled to receive any tax credit in the united states in respect of the payment of any such taxes pfic rules  we believe the class b shares or adss should not be treated as stock of a pfic for united states federal income tax purposes but this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus may be subject to change if we were to be treated as a pfic unless a us holder makes a valid election to be taxed annually on a marktomarket basis with respect to the class b shares or adss gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the shares or adss would in general not be treated as capital gain instead the us holder would be treated as if he had realized such gain and certain excess distributions ratably over the holding period for the shares or adss and would be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for each such year to which the gain was allocated together with an interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to each such year with certain exceptions class b shares or adss will be treated as stock in a pfic if we were a pfic at any time during the holding period of a us holder in addition dividends received from us will not be eligible for the special tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income if we are treated as a pfic or are treated as a pfic with respect to a us holder either in the taxable year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year but instead will be taxable at rates applicable to ordinary income f dividends and paying agents not applicable g statement by experts not applicable h

market prices and interest rates we are exposed to market risk in the areas of interest rates and foreign currency exchange this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable such as political economic tax other regulatory or credit risks are not included in the following assessment of our market risks interest rate risk our interest rate risk arises from longterm borrowings borrowings issued at floating rates expose us to cash flow interest rate risk borrowings issued at fixed rates expose us to fair value interest rate risk   currently our exposure to cash flow interest rate risk is limited due to the fact that  of our outstanding financial indebtedness bears fixed interest rates therefore our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates is limited to our financial assets which bear variable interest rate most of our financial assets bear fixed rate interests we place our cash and current investments in high quality financial institutions in argentina the united states of america and

foreign exchange exposure our primary market risk exposure is associated with changes in the foreign currency exchange rates since most of our debt is denominated in us dollars as of december   our net monetary liability position that is subject to exchange rate fluctuations amounted to us  million as discussed herein the government has adopted various economic measures including the repeal of the convertibility law and the pesification of our gas transportation revenues that have significantly increased our foreign exposure as a result our results of operations are very susceptible to changes in the pesous dollar exchange rate because a significant portion of our annual revenues ps  million for  are denominated in pesos while substantially all our liabilities are denominated in us dollars to mitigate the foreign exchange risk during recent years we entered into agreements for the forward purchase of us dollars as well as investments in mutual funds linked to the us dollar in

weighted average exchange rate of   which due in may  the fair value of these contracts as of december   amounted to a net asset position of ps  million sensitivity analysis disclosure to interest rates and exchange rates in view of the nature of our financial assets which bear variable interest an immediate  basis points decrease in the interest rate curve would not have a significant impact on their total value the potential financial expense loss before income tax in our net monetary liability position held as of december   that would have resulted from a hypothetical instantaneous and unfavorable  change in the pesous dollar exchange rates would have been ps  million this sensitivity analysis provides only a limited view of the market risk sensitivity of certain of our financial instruments the actual impact of market foreign exchange rate changes on our financial instruments may differ significantly from the impact shown in the sensitivity analysis our indebtedness accrues

legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously e derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are recognized at their fair value at inception and subsequently measured at their fair value and disclosed as assets or liabilities depending if it is gain or loss the results of derivative financial instruments are classified under financial expenses in the statement of comprehensive income derivative financial instruments have been measured in accordance with ifrs  the company manages exposures to foreign exchange risks using hedging instruments that provide the appropriate economic outcome the hedging instruments used include currency forward contracts the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes as of december   and  the company entered into currency forward agreements with major financial institutions for the purchase of us dollars which are disclosed under derivative financial instruments in the statement of financial position a decrease  increase of financial expenses for the fiscal year  is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income within derivative financial instruments result the method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument or not and according to the nature of the item being hedged as of the date of the issuance of these financial statements the company has not applied hedge accounting in any of its outstanding derivative financial instruments f inventories inventories consist of natural gas in excess of the line pack classified as property plant and equipment in the companys pipeline system and the liquids obtained from natural gas processing at the cerri complex inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is determined using the weighted average price method the cost of inventories includes expenditure incurred in purchasing and production and other necessary costs to bring them to their existing location and condition   the net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated cost of completion and the estimated costs to make the sale the assessment of the recoverable value of these assets is made at each reporting date and the resulting loss is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income when the inventories are overstated g trade receivables other receivables and trade payables trade receivables and other receivables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less allowance for trade receivables an allowance for trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables significant financial difficulties of the debtor probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganization and default or delinquency in payments including the customers credit risk historical trends and other relevant information are considered indicators that such receivables are impaired such evaluation may require future adjustments if economic conditions substantially differ from the assumptions made the amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate the carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income within selling expenses when a trade receivable is uncollectible it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against selling expenses in the statement of comprehensive income tax credits income tax and value added tax vat recorded as a result of the reversion of the tariff increase note a have been valued at the discounted value of the amounts expected to be collected using a market interest rate trade payables have been initially valued at their fair values and

shortterm highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less i other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss the other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss consist of public and private bonds and mutual funds not considered as cash equivalents initially they were recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss results from other financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income as financial income j property plant and equipment the company elected to measure items of ppe at priceadjusted values in accordance with previous gaap as deemed cost as of the transition date to ifrss property plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses if any historical cost comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to the acquisition subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset as appropriate only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized all other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of comprehensive income when they are incurred property plant and equipment ppe are comprised as follows  assets transferred from the privatization of gde the value of these assets was determined based on the price paid for the acquisition of  of the companys common stock which amounted to us  million this price was the basis to determine a total value of common stock of us  million which when added to the debt assumed under the companys privatization agreement the transfer agreement of us  million resulted in a total value for property plant and equipment of us  million such value converted at the exchange rate in effect as of the date of the transfer agreement has been restated for the effects of inflation  line pack it represents the natural gas in the transportation system that is necessary to keep the system at operating capacity valued at acquisition cost and restated for the effects of inflation  additions they have been valued at acquisition cost restated for the effects of inflation the company has capitalized all the investments stipulated as mandatory in the license during the first fiveyear period in order to achieve system integrity and public safety equal to those required by international standards such investments included among others the costs of survey programs related to internal and external pipeline inspection cathodic protection and pipeline replacement and recoating additionally resolutions no  and no  issued by enargas include definitions prescribing which costs should be considered improvements and which costs should be considered maintenance expenses repair and maintenance costs have been expensed as incurred  capitalization of foreign exchange loss resolutions no  and no  issued by the consejo profesional de ciencias económicas cpcecaba established that exchange losses arising from the devaluation of the peso from january   to july   to the extent that they were related to foreign currency liabilities existing at the first date may be added to the cost basis of assets acquired or constructed with direct financing by such foreign currency liabilities after its first application ifrs allows to choose the accounting policy to be used for the measurement of ppe the alternatives allowed by ias no   property plant and equipment  ias  are the cost model or the revaluation model the company chose to continue to apply the cost model for all kinds of elements ppe using the deemed cost determined at the date of transition as mentioned above accumulated depreciation related to natural gas transportation assets is computed under the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the specific assets which are lower than the maximum useful lives established by enargas through resolutions no  and no  for depreciation of all other property plant and equipment the company uses the straightline method of depreciation and applies the annual depreciation rates disclosed in note  where individual components of an item of property plant and equipment have different useful lives they are accounted for as separate items which are depreciated separately the assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each statement of financial position date when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the statement of comprehensive income capitalized foreign exchange loss is depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the assets that led to such capitalization in accordance with ias  the company capitalizes financial expense on long term construction projects financial expense capitalized was ps  ps  and ps  for the year ended december    and  impairment of nonfinancial assets at each statement of financial position date the company reviews the carrying amounts of its property plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss eg significant decreases in the market value of assets in the prices of the main products sold by the company as well as changes in the regulatory framework for the companys activities significant increases in operating expenses or evidence of obsolescence or physical damage if any such indication exists the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent if any of the impairment loss where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets the company estimates the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs if the recoverable amount of an asset or cashgenerating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount the carrying amount of the asset or cashgenerating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognized immediately in the statement of income where an impairment loss subsequently reverses the carrying amount of the asset or cashgenerating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount not to exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or cashgenerating unit in prior years a reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in the statement of comprehensive income recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted to such end the company makes estimates and assumptions of the economic conditions that will prevail throughout the useful life of the assets as a result of the factors mentioned above actual cash flows and values could vary significantly from projected cash flows and the values derived from the discounting techniques used as of december   and  the carrying value of ppe does not exceed their recoverable value k loans granted to related companies as of december   loans granted to related companies corresponded to the loan granted to pampa energía for further information see note  it was initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured

current tax and deferred income tax the current income tax is calculated on the basis of tax regulations in force at each yearend management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions if applicable as of december   and  there are no provisions for this concept the company has calculated their respective income tax charges using the deferred tax method which considers the effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases to estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities the tax rate expected to be in effect at the time of utilization was applied to identify temporary differences based on the legal requirements effective at the date of preparation of these consolidated financial statements a deferred tax is recognized on the temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates except for deferred tax liabilities where the company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if the company has a legally enforceable right to offset recognized amounts and when deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income tax levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or different taxable entities that intend to settle tax assets and liabilities on a net basis

companys financial condition results of operations and cash flows and require management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain management bases its estimates on various factors including past trends expectation of future events regarding the outcome of events and results and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable actual results could differ from estimates used in employing the critical accounting policies and these could have a material impact on the companys results of operations the companys critical accounting policies are discussed below a impairment of property plant and equipment the company considers each of its business segments to be a single cash generating unit accordingly the company evaluates the carrying value of its property plant and equipment on a segmentbysegment basis at the end of each fiscal year in addition the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its property plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the calculation of the value in use is based on the definition of discounted future cash flows the projected cash flows are prepared taking into account i projections of the price of liquids and purchase cost of natural gas used as raw material associated with the liquids and commercialization segment ii estimates relating to the timing type and amount of the tariff increase and the recognition of cost adjustments for the natural gas transportation segment iii projections of the future costs to be incurred by the company iv the use of certain macroeconomic variables such as interest rates inflation foreign exchange rates the discount rate is the weighted average cost of capital wacc the company recorded no impairment losses of components of property plant and equipment at december   and  due to the uncertainties surrounding the tariff renegotiation process as describes in note a estimates of future tariff adjustments are highly uncertain and there is a substantial risk that these estimates could prove to be materially different from actual future tariffs for this reason the company performed probabilityweighted analysis as to the cash flow assumptions considered in performing an impairment test of its natural gas transportation business segment at the end of each year tgs considered two different scenarios a scenario   the company is able to reach an agreement with the argentine government regarding a tariff increase scenario  and b scenario   the company is unable to reach an agreement with the argentine government resulting in no tariff increase during the remaining term of our license including the entire extension period scenario  as of december   tgs assigned a probability of occurrence of  to scenario  and a probability of occurrence of  to scenario  in performing the analysis for scenario  because the terms of an agreement with the argentine government are also uncertain tgs developed three different projected cash flow streams based on the timing type and amount of the tariff increase based on the renegotiation process with the argentine government namely a the base case b the optimistic case and c the pessimistic case and assigned a portion of the overall probability of occurrence of  to each projected cash flow   and  respectively  specific details of each cash flow streams as of december   were based on a the status of the negotiations with the argentine government and the impact of the tariff increase included in the  transitional agreement and upheld by decree no  b the current regulatory framework c recent experiences and renegotiation agreements signed by other gas and electricity utility peers and d managements expectations regarding other measures that management believes are likely to be taken by the argentine government to deal with the present economic situation of gas and electricity utilities each of these cash flow scenarios included assumptions related to the enactment of the license renegotiation agreement with the uniren which was accepted by tgs but has not been executed and which contemplates different magnitudes and timings of the tariff review and the magnitude and timing of the semiannual tariff review mechanism that would permit adjustment in the tariff to reflect movements in general cost indices based on those estimations the estimated discounted cash flows were higher than the carrying amount of such assets as of december   up to  increase in the weighted probability of the pessimistic case from  to  and a reduction from  to  in the probability of occurrence of the optimistic case and a reduction from  to  in the base case would not generate adjustment for impairment as of december   there are no impairment balances subject to reversal b allowances for doubtful accounts the company provides for doubtful accounts relating to its accounts receivables the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on managements evaluation of various factors including the credit risk of customers historical trends and other information while management uses the information available to make evaluations future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if future economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations management has considered all events andor transactions that are subject to reasonable and normal methods of estimation and the consolidated financial statements reflect that consideration c provisions for legal claims and others the company has certain liabilities with respect to existing court or outofcourt claims lawsuits and other proceedings including those involving legal and regulatory matters the company records liabilities when it is probable that future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated such provisions are based on developments known at the date of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements estimates of the outcome of these matters and the experience of its legal counsel in contesting litigating and settling other matters as the scope of the liabilities become better defined there will be changes in the estimates of future costs which could have a material effect on the companys future results of operations and financial condition or liquidity d income tax deferred tax assets are recognized for all tax losses to the extent that it is probable that there will be a tax benefit against which these losses can be utilized determining the amount of deferred tax assets that can be registered requires a considerable judgment by the management based on the probable term and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies and macroeconomic variables affecting the business as of december   the company recorded a deferred tax asset for the tax loss carryforward in this fiscal year amounting to ps  f transportadora de gas del sur sa notes to the consolidated financial statements as of december   and comparative

among other things to set the basis for the calculation monitoring and approval of tariffs  on january   resolution no  of the ministry of energy and mining of argentina repealed the resolution  of the ministry of federal planning public investment and services mpfipys which provided that all tariff increases should have the prior intervention of the undersecretary of coordination and management control tgs license has been granted for an original period of  years beginning on december   however the natural gas act provides that tgs may apply to enargas for a renewal of its license for an additional period of ten years enargas should evaluate at that time the performance of tgs and raise a recommendation to the executive branch at the end of the period of validity of the license  or  as appropriate the natural gas act requires a call for a new tender for the granting of a new license in which tgs provided the company fulfilled substantially with the obligations resulting from the license would have the option of matching the best offer that the government received in this bidding process general tariff situation prior the enactment of the public emergency law and according to the regulatory framework transportation tariffs were to be calculated in us dollars and converted into argentine pesos at the time the customer was billed using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the billing the basic natural gas transportation tariffs charged by tgs had been established at the time of the privatization of gde and were to be adjusted subject to prior authorization in the following cases i semiannually to reflect changes in the us producer price index ppi and ii every five years according to efficiency and investment factors determined by enargas the efficiency factor is a reduction to the base tariff resulting from future efficiency programs while the investment factor increases the tariffs to compensate the licensees for future investments which are not repaid through tariffs also subject to enargas approval tariffs were to be adjusted to reflect nonrecurrent circumstances or tax changes other than income tax the terms and conditions as described in the precedent paragraph in connection with tariff adjustments contemplated within the regulatory framework are no longer effective since the enactment of the public emergency law in early  which among other provisions eliminated tariff increases based on us dollar exchange rate fluctuations foreign price indexes or any other indexing procedure and established a conversion rate of one peso to one us dollar for tariffs the public emergency law also granted the executive branch power to renegotiate contracts entered into with private utility companies pursuant to the framework included in the said law as long as it is in force which will expire in december   after several extensions in july  the unit for renegotiation and assessment of utilities contracts uniren was created under the joint

commercialization of lpg among other things law no  creates the framework through which the federal energy bureau establishes regulations meant to cause lpg suppliers to guarantee sufficient supply of lpg in the domestic market at low prices law no  creates a price regime pursuant to which the federal energy bureau periodically publish reference prices for lpg sold in the local market it also sets forth lpg volumes to be sold in the local market on march   the executive branch issued decree no  regulated by resolution no  issued by the federal energy bureau both replaced stabilization agreement signed in september  between the federal energy bureau and the lpg producers stabilization agreement which after several extensions remained in force until march   creating a new framework for the selling of lpg bottles to residential users the new program in line with the stabilization agreement the federal energy bureau regulates the price and the quantity of lpg sold in the domestic market by each lpg producer in order to guarantee sufficient supply of lpg to lowincome residential users by committing the lpg producers to supply at a fixed price below the market price with a quota assigned to each producer this price reduction is partially offset by a subsidy paid to producers by a trust fund created for that purpose through the new program the argentine government subsidizes lowincome residential users on april   the federal energy bureau issued resolution no  which sets the new reference prices and the compensation to be paid to domestic lpg producers intended for ten twelve and fifteen kilos lpg bottles under the new program notes  and  of the federal energy bureau notified the volumes to be sold by tgs during  participation in the new program requires producing and selling lpg volumes required by the federal energy bureau at prices significantly below the market because of this requirement it is difficult to cover production costs and therefore obtaining a negative operating margin it is impossible to sustain this situation in the future and tgs is conducting talks with the national government to find an immediate solution regarding the stabilization agreement the payment of the amounts associated with the supply of the months of february and march  are still owed to tgs and thus on september   a claim was formally presented before the federal energy bureau intimating the cancellation on june   the company filed a motion for reconsideration against the provisions of federal energy bureau regarding volumes of lpg provided during  under the new program additionally on august   tgs lodged a claim which disputed resolutions  and  in addition on march   resolution no  has been replaced by the federal energy bureau issuing resolution no

extension corresponding to the period may  april  has not been signed by the parties yet notwithstanding the aforementioned tgs continued supplying the product at the request of the national government   due to a delay in the collection of the compensation mentioned above which as of december   amounted to ps  million in august and november  tgs filed payment default notices to the federal energy bureau as of the date of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements no formal response has been given to the mentioned payment default notices through presidential decree no  the executive branch created a tariff charge to be paid by i the users of regulated services of transportation and  or distribution ii natural gas consumers receiving natural gas directly from producers without making use of transportation systems or natural gas distribution iii the natural gas processing companies in order to finance the import of natural gas the tariff charge sets forth in decree finance the higher price of the natural gas imports required to compensate the injection of natural gas necessary to meet national requirements the  natural gas processing tariff charge  the payment of the natural gas processing tariff charge was selectively subsidized from  according to the destination of the natural gas in november  however enargas issued resolution no  and  the gas tariff resolutions which modified the list of the subsidy beneficiaries and thus involved a cost increase for many of our clients and for us for certain of our consumption for our own account the natural gas processing tariff charge increased from ps  to ps  per cubic meter of natural gas effective from december   representing a significant increase in our variable costs of natural gas processing in order to avoid this damage tgs appealed against the presidential decree and the resolutions including national government enargas and mpfipys as defendants on july   tgs obtained from the court of appeals in administrative federal matters based in the autonomous city of buenos aires the issue of a preliminary injunction which provides that tgs is exempt from the billing and the payment of the tariff charge increase according to the resolutions pending the resolution of the claim should this situation disclosed in note d was not resolved favorably tgs could have in the future a significant impact on the results of operations notwithstanding this the management believes it has sufficient grounds to defend its position international market exports of natural gasoline and lpg have been subject to a withholding regime consistent in the application of a percentage tax on exported amounts varying depending on the fob price of them in this context resolution no  and no  of the ministry of economy and production disposed this determination under the current framework in which the activities of this business segment are developed the national government introduced amendments to the rates in force on december   the mef issued resolution no  which modified the nominal rates applicable for the export of oil and oil byproducts including the natural gasoline sold by tgs the new withholding tax on exports regime considers the price of brent crude oil less  usbbl ip as a reference price to determine the applicable rate when the ip is less than  usbbl the nominal rate of the withholding tax on export for the natural gasoline will be  when the ip is greater than  usbbl the rate will be ip    x  thus far during  ip has been below us bbl so the applicable nominal rate for the exports of natural gasoline has been  on february   the ministry of economy issued resolution no  this resolution modified the variable export withholding tax regime established under resolution no  according to the new methodology the minimum tax rate is  if the international prices for propane and butane are lower than us  and us  the reference value per metric ton respectively if the propane and butane international prices are higher than the reference value tax rate applicable to the selling price is calculated on a sliding scale according the amount by which the selling price exceeds the cutoff value of us  and us  per metric ton respectively c    expansion of the natural gas transportation system since  the natural gas transportation system expansion works have been

the tax court of the province of buenos aires in february  the tax court partially upheld tgss complaint in its pronouncement the tax court stated that ethane propane and butane sales were within the scope of the turnover tax exemption but that neither propane nor butane sales qualified for the exemption in the domestic market when they were not raw materials for an industrial process  tgs filed an appeal of this decision in may  before the province of buenos aires court to obtain the exemption arguing that propane and butane sales might be utilized for other uses different from petrochemical industry on december   the company was notified of a ruling adverse to us on december   tgs filed an appeal against this sentence as of the date of these financial statements the court has not issued a final decision on february   tgs was notified with a formal assessment notice of ps  million not including interest regarding the payment of the turnover tax corresponding to the period ranging from

a transportation tariff increase to that end tgs has initiated the corresponding administrative processes before enargas c action for annulment of enargas resolutions no i and no i the resolutions on july   tgs obtained a preliminary injunction against the resolutions from the court of appeals in administrative federal matters based in the autonomous city of buenos aires the preliminary injunction ordered the executive branch the federal energy bureau enargas and nación fideicomisos sa as collection agents not to bill or intend to collect from tgs the charge calculated pursuant to both resolutions and to continue the billing and collection of the amounts stated prior to the issuance of the resolutions enargas and the government appealed the granting of the decision to the court of appeals in administrative federal matters on december   tgs expanded the grounds of our demand and requested that the case to be referred to the defendants since march   the legal proceedings are ongoing at enargas and the executive branch the bodies to which such proceedings were referred by the court of appeals for a prior intervention before the issuance of its ruling the basis for our claims is that the resolutions violate the constitutional principles that govern the matter and annulment of administrative acts because no tax burden may be enforceable without the prior existence of a law framed within the constitutional precepts and created by the legislative branch by a special law this was the basis adopted by the presiding judge to issue the previously mentioned injunction this decision was confirmed on april   by the relevant court of appeals but only for a period of six months on march   the lower court in administrative federal matters based in the city of buenos aires extended the preliminary injunction for a new period of six months thus the new injunction expires in april  given the limited duration of the injunction tgs filed an appeal before the supreme court additionally enargas and the ministry of federal planning and public investment lodged appeals with respect to the granting of the injunction on december   the supreme court rejected the appeals filed complaint by the parties and thus the injunction was granted to tgs furthermore tgs to broaden the basis for their demand after the enactment of law no  which amended law no  so as to include the natural gas processing tariff charge under the taxes the creation of which was delegated to the executive branch by the national congress tgs has referred to the presiding judge the confiscatory character that the tariff charge would have on its economic and financial condition as of the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements such proceedings are open in addition on september   the court rejected the request by enargas to declare the prosecution abstract and the injunction without effect tgss management believes it has sufficient valid arguments to defend our position and thus the company has not recorded the increase of the charge for natural gas consumptions from the date of obtaining the injunction until the date of the issuance of this annual report in the event this injunction had not been obtained the impact of the resolutions for the years ended december   taking into account the possibility of carryforward of the charge to the sales price of the product would have implied a net loss of ps  million meanwhile the accumulated impact on the retained earnings since obtaining the injunction would have involved a reduction effect of ps  million d recovery action of vat and income tax on october   tgs signed the  transitional agreement with uniren that contemplated a tariff increase of  which would be retroactively applicable to september   on december   the executive branch ratified this transitional agreement through the presidential decree no  by means of this decree tgs will be able to bill the tariff increase to our clients as soon as enargas publishes the new tariffs schedule and sets the methodology to bill the retroactive effect finally this administrative act did not become effective and therefore in september  tgs filed an acción de amparo a summary proceeding to guarantee constitutional rights due to the passing of time since the enactment of decree no  on december   the board of directors of the company resolved to discontinue the recognition of the tariff increase revenue and to reverse the credit provision of the tariff increase revenue already accrued in the year ended december   the reversal of the tariff increase does not imply any resignation to the company´s right resulting from decree no  on may   tgs filed a tax recovery appeal with respect to the income tax and vat credits generated by the reversal of the tariff increase credit mentioned above our claim was not heard after three months so on october   tgs filed an appeal before the federal tax bureau as of the date of the issuance of

administrative proceedings which involve taxation labor claims social security administrative and others arising in the ordinary course of business the companys management and its legal advisors

which  they received lower allocation of the products obtained the products which shortfall at march   is claimed to be equal to us  million plus interest the claim tgs considers that the claim contains inconsistencies resulting from misinterpretations of the contract provisions and an incorrect application of the mechanisms for calculating the allocation of the products and therefore tgs believes that the amount claimed is not supportable the company jointly with technical experts and its legal counsel continues to review the claim as it prepares to respond to the demand for

an agreement on the price stabilization of the lpg bottles whereby the industry players committed to a substantial reduction in the price of lpg bottles from october   to support lowincome consumers

revenues of our company once again the business that generated the highest revenues to tgs in  revenues related to this segment increased by ps  million from ps  million reported in  to ps  million in  this performance derives from an over  rise in sales of propane butane and natural gasoline and also from higher international prices in spite of the sharp drop the latter underwent during the last months of the year ngl production in  was higher than in  mainly due to the availability of the regasified ngl that was injected in bahía blanca  supplied by enarsa this additional gas input partially mitigated the situation of the natural gas supply interruptions that every winter affects cerri complexs production and which might become worse year after year subject to the harshness of the winter  source own information on the other hand the worldwide economic crisis affected the petrochemical market which resulted in ethane sales lower than the historical average another negative factor was the remarkable decrease in the price of butane in the local market which has been in effect since the beginnings of the last quarter as a consequence of the agreement mentioned above in connection with the stabilization of lpg prices signed by the federal energy bureau and lpg producers moreover ngl operations mentioned above added to the complex movements of propane and butane among producers

gas supply interruptions as instructed by the argentine government in order to increase the supply to residential clients and thermoelectrical plants considering the low availability of hydroelectric

figures indicate that  miles  km of pipelines are planned and under construction of these  miles  km represent projects in the planning and design phase  miles  km reflect pipelines in various stages of construction liquids and gases are transported in pipelines and any chemically stable substance can be sent through a pipeline pipelines exist for the transport of crude and refined petroleum fuels  such as oil natural gas and biofuels  and other fluids including sewage slurry water and beer pipelines are useful for transporting water for drinking or irrigation over long distances when it needs to move over hills or where canals or channels are poor choices due to considerations of evaporation pollution or environmental impact pneumatic tubes using compressed air can be used to transport solid capsules oil pipelines are made from steel or plastic tubes which are usually buried the oil is moved through the pipelines by pump stations along the pipeline natural gas and similar gaseous fuels are lightly pressurised into liquids known as natural gas liquids ngls natural gas pipelines are constructed of carbon steel highly toxic ammonia is theoretically the most dangerous substance to be transported through longdistance pipelines but accidents have been rare hydrogen pipeline transport is the transportation of hydrogen through a pipe district heating or teleheating systems use a

the first crude oil pipeline was built credit for the development of pipeline transport is disputed with competing claims for vladimir shukhov and the branobel company in the late th century and the oil transport association which first constructed a inch  mm wrought iron pipeline over a mile  km track from an oil field in pennsylvania to a railroad station in oil creek in the s pipelines are generally the most economical way to transport large quantities of oil refined oil products or natural gas over land natural gas and similar gaseous fuels are lightly pressurized into liquids knows as natural gas liquids ngls small ngl processing facilities can be located in oil fields so the butane and propane liquid under light pressure of  pounds per square inch  kpa can be shipped by rail truck or pipeline propane can be used as a fuel in oil fields to heat various facilities used by the oil drillers or equipment and trucks used in the oil patch eg propane will convert from a gas to a liquid under light pressure  psi give or take depending on temperature and is pumped into cars and trucks at less than  psi  kpa at retail stations pipelines and rail cars use about double that pressure to pump at  psi  kpa the distance to ship propane to markets is much shorter as thousands of naturalgas processing plants are located in or near oil fields many bakken basin oil companies in north dakota montana manitoba and saskatchewan gas fields separate the ngls in the field allowing the drillers to sell propane directly to small wholesalers eliminating the large refinery control of product and prices for propane or butane the most recent major pipeline to start operating in north america is a transcanada natural gas line going north across the niagara region bridges with marcellus shale gas from pennsylvania and others tied in methane or natural gas sources into the canadian province of ontario as of the fall of  supplying  percent of all the natural gas used in ontario major russian gas pipelines to europe in  this new us supplied natural gas displaces the natural gas formerly shipped to ontario from western canada in alberta and manitoba thus dropping the government regulated pipeline shipping charges because of the significantly shorter distance from gas source to consumer compared to shipping by railroad pipelines have lower cost per unit and higher capacity pipelines are preferable to transportation by truck for a number of reasons employment on completed pipelines represents only  of that of the trucking industry to avoid delays and us government regulation many small medium and large oil producers in north dakota have decided to run an oil pipeline north to canada to meet up with a canadian oil pipeline shipping oil from west to east this allows the bakken basin and three forks oil producers to get higher negotiated prices for their oil because they will not be restricted to just one wholesale market in the us the distance from the biggest oil patch in north dakota in williston north dakota is only about  miles or  kilometers to the canada–us border and manitoba mutual funds and joint ventures are big investors in new oil and gas pipelines in the fall of  the us began exporting propane to europe known as lpg as wholesale prices there are much higher than in north america additionally a pipeline is currently being constructed from north dakota to illinois commonly known as the dakota access pipeline as more north american pipelines are built even more exports of lng propane butane and other natural gas products occur on all three us coasts to give insight north dakota bakken regions oil production has grown by  from  to  north dakota oil companies are shipping huge amounts of oil by tanker rail car as they can direct the oil to the market that gives the best price and rail cars can be used to avoid a congested oil pipeline to get the oil to a different pipeline in order to get the oil to market faster or to a different less busy oil refinery however pipelines provide a cheaper means to transport by volume enbridge in canada is applying to reverse an oil pipeline going from easttowest line  and expanding it and using it to ship western canadian bitumen oil eastward from a presently rated  barrels equivalent per day pipeline it will be expanded to between one million to  million barrels per day it will bring western oil to refineries in ontario michigan ohio pennsylvania quebec and new york by early  new brunswick will also refine some of this western canadian crude and export some crude and refined oil to europe from its deep water oil ulcc loading port although pipelines can be built under the sea that process is economically and technically demanding so the majority of oil at sea is transported by tanker ships the enbridge sandpiper pipeline is proposed to transfer valuable oil from western north dakota through northwestern minnesota the pipeline will be  inches in diameter it will carry over  barrels of oil a day with a volatility of  growth of marketedit gas pipe in the dry region of antofagasta chile the market size for oil and gas pipeline construction experienced tremendous growth prior to the economic downturn in  after faltering in  demand for pipeline expansion and updating increased the following year as energy production grew by  almost  miles of north american pipeline were being planned or under construction construction and operationedit oil pipelines are made from steel or plastic tubes with inner diameter typically from  to  inches  to  mm most pipelines are typically buried at a depth of about  to  feet  to  m to protect pipes from impact abrasion and corrosion a variety of methods are used these can include wood lagging wood slats concrete coating rockshield highdensity polyethylene imported sand padding and padding machines crude oil contains varying amounts of paraffin wax and in colder climates wax buildup may occur within a pipeline often these pipelines are inspected and cleaned using pigging the practice of using devices known as pigs to perform various maintenance operations on a pipeline the devices are also known as scrapers or godevils smart pigs also known as intelligent or intelligence pigs are used to detect anomalies in the pipe such as dents metal loss caused by corrosion cracking or other mechanical damage these devices are launched from piglauncher stations and travel through the pipeline to be received at any other station downstream either cleaning wax deposits and material that may have accumulated inside the line or inspecting and recording the condition of the line for natural gas pipelines are constructed of carbon steel and vary in size from  to  inches  to  mm in diameter depending on the type of pipeline the gas is pressurized by compressor stations and is odorless unless mixed with a mercaptan odorant where required by a regulating authority ammoniaedit the worlds longest ammonia pipeline from russia to

the main problems related to the transport of ethanol by pipeline are its corrosive nature and tendency to absorb water and impurities in pipelines which are not problems with oil and natural gas insufficient volumes and costeffectiveness are other considerations limiting construction of ethanol pipelines coal and oreedit slurry pipelines are sometimes used to transport coal or ore from mines the material to be transported is closely mixed with water before being introduced to the pipeline at the far end the material must be dried one example is a kilometre  mi slurry pipeline which is planned to transport iron ore from the minasrio mine producing  million tonnes per year to the port of açu in brazil an existing example is the kilometre  mi savage river slurry pipeline in tasmania australia possibly the worlds first when it was built in  it includes a metre  ft bridge span at  metres  ft above the savage river hydrogenedit main article hydrogen pipeline transport hydrogen pipeline transport is a transportation of hydrogen through a pipe as part of the hydrogen infrastructure hydrogen pipeline transport is used to connect the point of hydrogen production or delivery of hydrogen with the point of demand with transport costs similar to cng the technology is proven most hydrogen is produced at the place of demand with every  to  miles  km an industrial production facility the  rhineruhr kilometre  mi hydrogen pipeline is still in operation as of update there are  miles  km of low pressure hydrogen pipelines in the us and  miles  km in europe wateredit main article aqueduct watercourse the los angeles aqueduct in antelope valley two millennia ago the ancient romans made use of large aqueducts to transport water from higher elevations by building the aqueducts in graduated segments that allowed gravity to push the water along until it reached its destination hundreds of these were built throughout europe and elsewhere and along with flour mills were considered the lifeline of the roman empire the ancient chinese also made use of channels and pipe systems for public works the famous han dynasty court eunuch zhang rang d  ad once ordered the engineer bi lan to construct a series of squarepallet chain pumps outside the capital city of luoyang these chain pumps serviced the imperial palaces and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a stoneware pipe system pipelines are useful for transporting water for drinking or irrigation over long distances when it needs to move over hills or where canals or channels are poor choices due to considerations of evaporation pollution or environmental impact the  km  mi goldfields water supply scheme in western australia using  mm  inch pipe and completed in  was the largest water supply scheme of its time examples of significant water pipelines in south australia are the morganwhyalla pipelne completed  and mannumadelaide completed  pipelines both part of the larger snowy mountains scheme there are two los angeles california aqueducts the owens valley aqueduct completed  and the second los angeles aqueduct completed  which also include extensive use of pipelines the great manmade river of libya supplies  cubic metres  cu yd of water each day to tripoli benghazi sirte and several other cities in libya the pipeline is over  kilometres  mi long and is connected to wells tapping an aquifer over  metres  ft underground other systemsedit district heatingedit district heating pipeline in austria with a length of  km  main article district heating district heating or teleheating systems consist of a network of insulated feed and return pipes which transport heated water pressurized hot water or sometimes steam to the customer while steam is hottest and may be used in industrial processes due to its higher temperature it is less efficient to produce and transport due to greater heat losses heat transfer oils are generally not used for economic and ecological reasons the typical annual loss of thermal energy through distribution is around  as seen in norways district heating network district heating pipelines are normally installed underground with some exceptions within the system heat storage may be installed to even out peak load demands heat is transferred into the central heating of the dwellings through heat exchangers at heat substations without mixing of the fluids in either system beeredit thor pipeline in randers denmark bars in the veltinsarena a major football ground in gelsenkirchen germany are interconnected by a kilometre  mi long beer pipeline in randers city in denmark the socalled thor beer pipeline was operated originally copper pipes ran directly from the brewery but when the brewery moved out of the city in the s thor beer replaced it with a giant tank a threekilometer beer pipeline was completed in bruges belgium in september  to reduce truck traffic on the city streets brineedit the village of hallstatt in austria which is known for its long history of salt mining claims to contain the oldest industrial pipeline in the world dating back to  it was constructed from  hollowedout tree trunks to transport brine  kilometres  mi from hallstatt to ebensee milkedit between  and  a  km milk pipeline ran between the dutch island of ameland and holwerd on the mainland of which  km beneath the wadden sea every day  litres of milk produced on the island were transported to be processed on the mainland in  the milk transport was abandoned marine pipelinesedit main article submarine pipeline in places a pipeline may have to cross water expanses such as small seas straits and rivers in many instances they lie entirely on the seabed these pipelines are referred to as marine pipelines also submarine or offshore pipelines they are used primarily to carry oil or gas but transportation of water is also important in offshore projects a distinction is made between a flowline and a pipeline the former is an intrafield pipeline in the sense that it is used to connect subsea wellheads manifolds and the platform within a particular development field the latter sometimes referred to as an export pipeline is used to bring the resource to shore the construction and maintenance of marine pipelines imply logistical challenges that are different from those onland mainly because of wave and current dynamics along with other geohazards functionsedit in general pipelines can be classified in three categories depending on purpose gathering pipelines group of smaller interconnected pipelines forming complex networks with the purpose of bringing crude oil or natural gas from several nearby wells to a treatment plant or processing facility in this group pipelines are usually short a couple hundred metres and with small diameters subsea pipelines for collecting product from deep water production platforms are also considered gathering systems transportation pipelines mainly long pipes with large diameters moving products oil gas refined products between cities countries and even continents these transportation networks include several compressor stations in gas lines or pump stations for crude and multiproducts pipelines distribution pipelines composed of several interconnected pipelines with small diameters used to take the products to the final consumer feeder lines to distribute gas to homes and businesses downstream pipelines at terminals for distributing products to tanks and storage facilities are included in this groups development and planningedit when a pipeline is built the construction project not only covers the civil engineering work to lay the pipeline and build the pumpcompressor stations it also has to cover all the work related to the installation of the field devices that will support remote operation the pipeline is routed along what is known as a right of way pipelines are generally developed and built using the following stages open season to determine market interest potential customers are given the chance to sign up for part of the new pipelines capacity rights route right of way selection pipeline design the pipeline project may take a number of forms including the construction of a new pipeline conversion of existing pipeline from one fuel type to another or improvements to facilities on a current pipeline route obtaining approval once the design is finalized and the first pipeline customers have purchased their share of capacity the project must be approved by the relevant regulatory agencies surveying the route clearing the route trenching  main route and crossings roads rail other pipes etc installing the pipe installing valves intersections etc covering the pipe and trench testing once construction is completed the new pipeline is subjected to tests to ensure its structural integrity these may include hydrostatic testing and line packing russia has pipeline troops as part of the rear services who are trained to build and repair pipelines russia is the only country to have pipeline troops operationedit field devices are instrumentation data gathering units and communication systems the field instrumentation includes flow pressure and temperature gaugestransmitters and other devices to measure the relevant data required these instruments are installed along the pipeline on some specific locations such as injection or delivery stations pump stations liquid pipelines or compressor stations gas pipelines and block valve stations the information measured by these field instruments is then gathered in local remote terminal units rtu that transfer the field data to a central location in real time using communication systems such as satellite channels microwave links or cellular phone connections pipelines are controlled and operated remotely from what is usually known as the main control room in this center all the data related to field measurement is consolidated in one central database the data is received from multiple rtus along the pipeline it is common to find rtus installed at every station along the pipeline the scada system for pipelines the scada system at the main control room receives all the field data and presents it to the pipeline operator through a set of screens or human machine interface showing the operational conditions of the pipeline the operator can monitor the hydraulic conditions of the line as well as send operational commands openclose valves turn onoff compressors or pumps change setpoints etc through the scada system to the field to optimize and secure the operation of these assets some pipeline companies are using what is called advanced pipeline applications which are software tools installed on top of the scada system that provide extended functionality to perform leak detection leak location batch tracking liquid lines pig tracking composition tracking predictive modeling look ahead modeling and operator training technologyedit componentsedit the trans alaska pipeline crossing under the tanana river and over ridge of the alaska range pipeline networks are composed of several pieces of equipment that operate together to move products from location to location the main elements of a pipeline system are initial injection station known also as supply or inlet station is the beginning of the system where the product is injected into the line storage facilities pumps or compressors are usually located at these locations compressorpump stations pumps for liquid pipelines and compressors for gas pipelines are located along the line to move the product through the pipeline the location of these stations is defined by the topography of the terrain the type of product being transported or operational conditions of the network partial delivery station known also as intermediate stations these facilities allow the pipeline operator to deliver part of the product being transported block valve station these are the first line of protection for pipelines with these valves the operator can isolate any segment of the line for maintenance work or isolate a rupture or leak block valve stations are usually located every  to  miles  km depending on the type of pipeline even though it is not a design rule it is a very usual practice in liquid pipelines the location of these stations depends exclusively on the nature of the product being transported the trajectory of the pipeline andor the operational conditions of the line regulator station this is a special type of valve station where the operator can release some of the pressure from the line regulators are usually located at the downhill side of a peak final delivery station known also as outlet stations or terminals this is where the product will be distributed to the consumer it could be a tank terminal for liquid pipelines or a connection to a distribution network for gas pipelines leak detection systemsedit since oil and gas pipelines are an important asset of the economic development of almost any country it has been required either by government regulations or internal policies to ensure the safety of the assets and the population and environment where these pipelines run pipeline companies face government regulation environmental constraints and social situations government regulations may define minimum staff to run the operation operator training requirements pipeline facilities technology and applications required to ensure operational safety for example in the state of washington it is mandatory for pipeline operators to be able to detect and locate leaks of  percent of maximum flow within fifteen minutes or less social factors also affect the operation of pipelines product theft is sometimes also a problem for pipeline companies in this case the detection levels should be under two percent of maximum flow with a high expectation for location accuracy various technologies and strategies have been implemented for monitoring pipelines from physically walking the lines to satellite surveillance the most common technology to protect pipelines from occasional leaks is computational pipeline monitoring or cpm cpm takes information from the field related to pressures flows and temperatures to estimate the hydraulic behavior of the product being transported once the estimation is completed the results are compared to other field references to detect the presence of an anomaly or unexpected situation which may be related to a leak the american petroleum institute has published several articles related to the performance of cpm in liquids pipelines the api publications are ram  – computational pipeline monitoring for liquids pipelines api  – pipeline variable uncertainties  their effects on leak detectability where a pipeline containing passes under a road or railway it is usually enclosed in a protective casing this casing is vented to the atmosphere to prevent the buildup of flammable gases or corrosive substances and to allow the air inside the casing to be sampled to detect leaks the casing vent a pipe protruding from the ground often doubles as a warning marker called a casing vent marker implementationedit as a rule pipelines for all uses are laid in most cases undergroundcitation needed however in some cases it is necessary to cross a valley or a river on a pipeline bridge pipelines for centralized heating systems are often laid on the ground or overhead pipelines for petroleum running through permafrost areas as transalaskapipeline are often run overhead in order to avoid melting the frozen ground by hot petroleum which would result in sinking the pipeline in the ground maintenanceedit maintenance of pipelines includes checking cathodic protection levels for the proper range surveillance for construction erosion or leaks by foot land vehicle boat or air and running cleaning pigs when there is anything carried in the pipeline that is corrosive us pipeline maintenance rules are covered in code of federal regulationscfr sections  cfr  for natural gas pipelines and  cfr  for petroleum liquid pipelines regulationedit an underground petroleum pipeline running through a park in the us onshore and offshore pipelines used to transport oil and gas are regulated by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa certain offshore pipelines used to produce oil and gas are regulated by the minerals management service mms in canada pipelines are regulated by either the provincial regulators or if they cross provincial boundaries or the canada–us border by the national energy board neb government regulations in canada and the united states require that buried fuel pipelines must be protected from corrosion often the most economical method of corrosion control is by use of pipeline coating in conjunction with cathodic protection and technology to monitor the pipeline above ground cathodic protection is not an option the coating is the only external protection pipelines and geopoliticsedit pipelines for major energy resources petroleum and natural gas are not merely an element of trade they connect to issues of geopolitics and international security as well and the construction placement and control of oil and gas pipelines often figure prominently in state interests and actions a notable example of pipeline politics occurred at the beginning of the year  wherein a dispute between russia and ukraine ostensibly over pricing led to a major political crisis russian stateowned gas company gazprom cut off natural gas supplies to ukraine after talks between it and the ukrainian government fell through in addition to cutting off supplies to ukraine russian gas flowing through ukraine—which included nearly all supplies to southeastern europe and some supplies to central and western europe—was cut off creating a major crisis in several countries heavily dependent on russian gas as fuel russia was accused of using the dispute as leverage in its attempt to keep other powers and particularly the european union from interfering in its near abroad oil and gas pipelines also figure prominently in the politics of central asia and the caucasus hazard identificationedit because the solvent fraction of dilbit typically comprises volatile aromatics like naptha and benzene reasonably rapid carrier vaporization can be expected to follow an aboveground spill—ostensibly enabling timely intervention by leaving only a viscous residue that is slow to migrate effective protocols to minimize exposure to petrochemical vapours are wellestablished and oil spilled from the pipeline would be unlikely to reach the aquifer unless incomplete remediation were followed by the introduction of another carrier eg a series of torrential downpours the introduction of benzene and other volatile organic compounds collectively btex to the subterranean environment compounds the threat posed by a pipeline leak particularly if followed by rain a pipeline breach would result in btex dissolution and equilibration of benzene in water followed by percolation of the admixture into the aquifer benzene can cause many health problems and is carcinogenic with epa maximum contaminant level mcl set at  μgl for potable water although it is not well studied single benzene exposure events have been linked to acute carcinogenesis additionally the exposure of livestock mainly cattle to benzene has been shown to cause many health issues such as neurotoxicity fetal damage and fatal poisoning the entire surface of an aboveground pipeline can be directly examined for material breach pooled petroleum is unambiguous readily spotted and indicates the location of required repairs because the effectiveness of remote inspection is limited by the cost of monitoring equipment gaps between sensors and data that requires interpretation small leaks in buried pipe can sometimes go undetected pipeline developers do not always prioritize effective surveillance against leaks buried pipes draw fewer complaints they are insulated from extremes in ambient temperature they are shielded from ultraviolet rays and they are less exposed to photodegradation buried pipes are isolated from airborne debris electrical storms tornadoes hurricanes hail and acid rain they are protected from nesting birds rutting mammals and wayward buckshot buried pipe is less vulnerable to accident damage eg automobile collisions and less accessible to vandals saboteurs and terrorists exposureedit previous work has shown that a worstcase exposure scenario can be limited to a specific set of conditions based on the advanced detection methods and pipeline shutoff sop developed by transcanada the risk of a substantive or large release over a short period of time contaminating groundwater with benzene is unlikely detection shutoff and remediation procedures would limit the dissolution and transport of benzene therefore the exposure of benzene would be limited to leaks that are below the limit of detection and go unnoticed for extended periods of time leak detection is monitored through a scada system that assesses pressure and volume flow every  seconds a pinhole leak that releases small quantities that cannot be detected by the scada system  flow could accumulate into a substantive spill detection of pinhole leaks would come from a visual or olfactory inspection aerial surveying or massbalance inconsistencies it is assumed that pinhole leaks are discovered within the day inspection interval however snow cover and location eg remote deep could delay detection benzene typically makes up  –  of oil and will have varying degrees of volatility and dissolution based on environmental factors even with pipeline leak volumes within scada detection limits sometimes pipeline leaks are misinterpreted by pipeline operators to be pump malfunctions or other problems the enbridge line b crude oil pipeline failure in marshall michigan on july   was thought by operators in edmonton to be from column separation of the dilbit in that pipeline the leak in wetlands along the kalamazoo river was only confirmed  hours after it happened by a local gas company employee in michigan spill frequencyvolumeedit although the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa has standard baseline incident frequencies to estimate the number of spills transcanada altered these assumptions based on improved pipeline design operation and safety whether these adjustments are justified is debatable as these assumptions resulted in a nearly fold decrease in spill estimates given that the pipeline crosses  miles of the ogallala aquifer or  of the entire pipeline length and the year life of the entire pipeline is expected to have between  –  spills approximately  –  spills can be expected to occur over the aquifer an estimate of  spills over the aquifer each lasting  days results in  days of potential exposure over the  year lifetime of the pipeline in the reduced scope ‘worst case exposure scenario’ the volume of a pinhole leak at  of max flowrate for  days has been estimated at  barrels or  million gallons of oil according to phmsa’s incident database only  of all spills in the last  years were  barrels benzene fate and transportedit scenario for benzene leaching to groundwater benzene is considered a light aromatic hydrocarbon with high solubility and high volatilityclarification needed it is unclear how temperature and depth would impact the volatility of benzene so assumptions have been made that benzene in oil  weight by volume would not volatilize before equilibrating with water using the octanolwater partition coefficient and a year precipitation event for the area a worstcase estimate of  mgl of benzene is anticipated to flow toward the aquifer the actual movement of the plume through groundwater systems is not well described although one estimate is that up to  billion gallons of water in the ogallala aquifer could become contaminated with benzene at concentrations above the mcl the final environmental impact statement from the state department does not include a quantitative analysis because it assumed that most benzene will volatilize previous dilbit spill remediation difficultiesedit one of the major concerns about dilbit is the difficulty in cleaning it up enbridges line b a inch crude oil pipeline ruptured in marshall michigan on july   mentioned above spilled at least  gallons of dilbit after detection of the leak booms and vacuum trucks were deployed heavy rains caused the river to overtop

pipeline pipelines exist for the transport of crude and refined petroleum fuels  such as oil natural gas and biofuels  and other fluids including sewage slurry water and beer pipelines are useful for transporting water for drinking or irrigation over long distances when it needs to move over hills or where canals or channels are poor choices due to considerations of evaporation pollution or environmental impact pneumatic tubes using compressed air can be used to transport solid capsules oil pipelines are made from steel or plastic tubes which are usually buried the oil is moved through

competing claims for vladimir shukhov and the branobel company in the late th century and the oil transport association which first constructed a inch  mm wrought iron pipeline over a mile  km track from an oil field in pennsylvania to a railroad station in oil creek in the s pipelines are generally the most economical way to transport large quantities of oil refined oil products or natural gas over land natural gas and similar gaseous fuels are lightly pressurized into liquids knows as natural gas liquids ngls small ngl processing facilities can be located in oil fields so the butane and propane liquid under light pressure of  pounds per square inch  kpa can be shipped by rail truck or pipeline propane can be used as a fuel in oil fields to heat various facilities used by the oil drillers or equipment and trucks used in the oil patch eg propane will convert from a gas to a liquid under light pressure  psi give or take depending on temperature and is pumped into cars and trucks at less than  psi  kpa at retail stations pipelines and rail cars use about double that pressure to pump at  psi  kpa the distance to ship propane to markets is much shorter as thousands of naturalgas processing plants are located in or near oil fields many bakken basin oil companies in north dakota montana manitoba and saskatchewan gas fields separate the ngls in the field allowing the drillers to sell propane directly to small wholesalers eliminating the large refinery control of product and prices for propane or butane the most recent major pipeline to start operating in north america is a transcanada natural gas line going north across the niagara region bridges with marcellus shale gas from pennsylvania and others tied in methane or natural gas sources into the canadian province of ontario as of the fall of  supplying  percent of all the natural gas used in ontario major russian gas pipelines to europe in  this new us supplied natural gas displaces the natural gas formerly shipped to ontario from western canada in alberta and manitoba thus dropping the government regulated pipeline shipping charges because of the significantly shorter distance from gas source to consumer compared to shipping by railroad pipelines have lower cost per unit and higher capacity pipelines are preferable to transportation by truck for a number of reasons employment on completed pipelines represents only  of that of the trucking industry to avoid delays and us government regulation many small medium and large oil producers in north dakota have decided to run an oil pipeline north to canada to meet up with a canadian oil pipeline shipping oil from west to east this allows the bakken basin and three forks oil producers to get higher negotiated prices for their oil because they will not be restricted to just one wholesale market in the us the distance from the biggest oil patch in north dakota in williston north dakota is only about  miles or  kilometers to the canada–us border and manitoba mutual funds and joint ventures are big investors in new oil and gas pipelines in the fall of  the us began exporting propane to europe known as lpg as wholesale prices there are much higher than in north america additionally a pipeline is currently being constructed from north dakota to illinois commonly known as the dakota access pipeline as more north american pipelines are built even more exports of lng propane butane and other natural gas products occur on all three us coasts to give insight north dakota bakken regions oil production has grown by  from  to  north dakota oil companies are shipping huge amounts of oil by tanker rail car as they can direct the oil to the market that gives the best price and rail cars can be used to avoid a congested oil pipeline to get the oil to a different pipeline in order to get the oil to market faster or to a different less busy oil refinery however pipelines provide a cheaper means to transport by volume enbridge in canada is applying to reverse an oil pipeline going from easttowest line  and expanding it and using it to ship western canadian bitumen oil eastward from a presently rated  barrels equivalent per day pipeline it will be expanded to between one million to  million barrels per day it will bring western oil to refineries in ontario michigan ohio pennsylvania quebec and new york by early  new brunswick will also refine some of this western canadian crude and export some crude and refined oil to europe from its deep water oil ulcc loading port although pipelines can be built under the sea that process is economically and technically demanding so the majority of oil at sea is transported by tanker ships the enbridge sandpiper pipeline is proposed to transfer valuable oil from western north dakota through northwestern minnesota the pipeline will be  inches in diameter it will carry over  barrels of oil a day with a volatility of  growth of marketedit gas pipe in the dry region of antofagasta chile the market size for oil and gas pipeline construction experienced tremendous growth prior to the economic downturn in  after faltering in  demand for pipeline expansion and updating increased the following year as energy production grew by  almost  miles of north american pipeline were being planned or under construction construction and operationedit oil pipelines are made from steel or plastic tubes with inner diameter typically from  to  inches  to  mm most pipelines are typically buried at a depth of about  to  feet  to  m to protect pipes from impact abrasion and corrosion a variety of methods are used these can include wood lagging wood slats concrete coating rockshield highdensity polyethylene imported sand padding and padding machines crude oil contains varying amounts of paraffin wax and in colder climates wax buildup may occur within a pipeline often these pipelines are inspected and cleaned using pigging the practice of using devices known as pigs to perform various maintenance operations on a pipeline the devices are also known as scrapers or godevils smart pigs also known as intelligent or intelligence pigs are used to detect anomalies in the pipe such as dents metal loss caused by corrosion cracking or other mechanical damage these devices are launched from piglauncher stations and travel through the pipeline to be received at any other station downstream either cleaning wax deposits and material that may have accumulated inside the line or inspecting and recording the condition of the line for natural gas pipelines are constructed of carbon steel and vary in size from  to  inches  to  mm in diameter depending on the type of pipeline the gas is pressurized by compressor stations and is odorless unless mixed with a mercaptan odorant where required by a regulating authority ammoniaedit the worlds longest ammonia pipeline from russia to ukraine highly toxic ammonia is theoretically the most dangerous substance to be transported through longdistance pipelinescitation needed however incidents on ammoniatransporting lines are uncommon  unlike on industrial ammoniaprocessing equipmentcitation needed a

been used for transportation of ethanol in brazil and there are several ethanol pipeline projects in brazil and the united states the main problems related to the transport of ethanol by pipeline are its corrosive nature and tendency to absorb water and impurities in pipelines which are not problems with oil and natural gas insufficient volumes and costeffectiveness are other considerations limiting construction of ethanol pipelines coal and oreedit slurry pipelines are sometimes used to transport coal or ore from mines the material to be transported is closely mixed with water before being introduced to the pipeline at the far end the material must be dried one example is a kilometre  mi slurry pipeline which is planned to transport iron ore from the minasrio mine producing  million tonnes per year to the port of açu in brazil an existing example is the kilometre  mi savage river slurry pipeline in tasmania australia possibly the worlds first when it was built in  it includes a metre  ft bridge span at  metres  ft above the savage river hydrogenedit main article hydrogen pipeline transport hydrogen pipeline transport is a transportation of hydrogen through a pipe as part of the hydrogen infrastructure hydrogen pipeline transport is used to connect the point of hydrogen production or delivery of hydrogen with the point of demand with transport costs similar to cng the technology is proven most hydrogen is produced at the place of demand with every  to  miles  km an industrial production facility the  rhineruhr kilometre  mi hydrogen pipeline is still in operation as of update there are  miles  km of low pressure hydrogen pipelines in the us and  miles  km in europe wateredit main article aqueduct watercourse the los angeles aqueduct in antelope valley two millennia ago the ancient romans made use of large aqueducts to transport water from higher elevations by building the aqueducts in graduated segments that allowed gravity to push the water along until it reached its destination hundreds of these were built throughout europe and elsewhere and along with flour mills were considered the lifeline of the roman empire the ancient chinese also made use of channels and pipe systems for public works the famous han dynasty court eunuch zhang rang d  ad once ordered the engineer bi lan to construct a series of squarepallet chain pumps outside the capital city of luoyang these chain pumps serviced the imperial palaces and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a stoneware pipe system pipelines are useful for transporting water for drinking or irrigation over long distances when it needs to move over hills or where canals or channels are poor choices due to considerations of evaporation pollution or environmental impact the  km  mi goldfields water supply scheme in western australia using  mm  inch pipe and completed in  was the largest water supply scheme of its time examples of significant water pipelines in south australia are the morganwhyalla pipelne completed  and mannumadelaide completed  pipelines both part of the larger snowy mountains scheme there are two los angeles california aqueducts the owens valley aqueduct completed  and the second los angeles aqueduct completed  which also include extensive use of pipelines the great manmade river of libya

of a network of insulated feed and return pipes which transport heated water pressurized hot water or sometimes steam to the customer while steam is hottest and may be used in industrial processes due to its higher temperature it is less efficient to produce and transport due to greater heat losses heat transfer oils are generally not used for economic and ecological reasons the typical annual loss of thermal energy through distribution is around  as seen in norways district heating network district heating pipelines are normally installed underground with some exceptions within the system heat storage may be installed to even out peak load demands heat is transferred into the central heating of the dwellings through heat exchangers at heat substations without mixing of the fluids in either

island were transported to be processed on the mainland in  the milk transport was abandoned marine pipelinesedit main article submarine pipeline in places a pipeline may have to cross water expanses such as small seas straits and rivers in many instances they lie entirely on the seabed these pipelines are referred to as marine pipelines also submarine or offshore pipelines they are used primarily to carry oil or gas but transportation of water is also important in offshore projects a distinction is made between a flowline and a pipeline the former is an intrafield pipeline in the sense that it is used to connect subsea wellheads manifolds and the platform within a particular development field the latter sometimes referred to as an export pipeline is used to bring the resource to shore the construction and maintenance of marine pipelines imply logistical challenges that are different from those onland mainly because of wave and current dynamics along with other geohazards functionsedit in general pipelines can be classified in three categories depending on purpose gathering pipelines group of smaller interconnected pipelines forming complex networks with the purpose of bringing crude oil or natural gas from several nearby wells to a treatment plant or processing facility in this group pipelines are usually short a couple hundred metres and with small diameters subsea pipelines for collecting product from deep water production platforms are also considered gathering systems transportation pipelines mainly long pipes with large diameters moving products oil gas refined products between cities countries and even continents these transportation networks include several compressor stations in gas lines or pump stations for crude and multiproducts pipelines distribution pipelines composed of several interconnected pipelines with small diameters used to take the products to the final consumer feeder lines to distribute gas to homes and businesses downstream pipelines at terminals for distributing products to tanks and storage facilities are included in this groups development and planningedit when a pipeline is built the construction project not only covers the civil engineering work to lay the pipeline and build the pumpcompressor stations it also has to cover all the work related to the installation of the field devices that will support remote operation the pipeline is routed along what is known as a right of way pipelines are generally developed and built using the following stages open season to determine market interest potential customers are given the chance to sign up for part of the new pipelines capacity rights route right of way selection pipeline design the pipeline project may take a number of forms including the construction of a new pipeline conversion of existing pipeline from one fuel type to another or improvements to facilities on a current pipeline route obtaining approval once the design is finalized and the first pipeline customers have purchased their share of capacity the project must be approved by the relevant regulatory agencies surveying the route clearing the route trenching  main route and crossings roads rail other pipes etc installing the pipe installing valves intersections etc covering the pipe and trench testing once construction is completed the new pipeline is subjected to tests to ensure its structural integrity these may include hydrostatic testing and line packing russia has pipeline troops as part of the rear services who are trained to build and repair pipelines russia is the only country to have pipeline troops operationedit field devices are instrumentation data gathering units and communication systems the field instrumentation includes flow pressure and temperature gaugestransmitters and other devices to measure the relevant data required these instruments are installed along the pipeline on some specific locations such as injection or delivery stations pump stations liquid pipelines or compressor stations gas pipelines and block valve stations the information measured by these field instruments is then gathered in local remote terminal units rtu that transfer the field data to a central location in real time using communication systems such as satellite channels microwave links or cellular phone connections pipelines are controlled and operated remotely from what is usually known as the main control room in this center all the data related to field measurement is consolidated in one central database the data is received from multiple rtus along the pipeline it is common to find rtus installed at every station along the pipeline the scada system for pipelines the scada system at the main control room receives all the field data and presents it to the pipeline operator through a set of screens or human machine interface showing the operational conditions of the pipeline the operator can monitor the hydraulic conditions of the line as well as send operational commands openclose valves turn onoff compressors or pumps change setpoints etc through the scada system to the field to optimize and secure the operation of these assets some pipeline companies are using what is called advanced pipeline applications which are software tools installed on top of the scada system that provide extended functionality to perform leak detection leak location batch tracking liquid lines pig tracking composition tracking predictive modeling look ahead modeling and operator training technologyedit componentsedit the trans alaska pipeline crossing under the tanana river and over ridge of the alaska range pipeline networks are composed of several pieces of equipment that operate together to move products from location to location the main elements of a pipeline system are initial injection station known also as supply or inlet station is the beginning of the system where the product is injected into the line storage facilities pumps or compressors are usually located at these locations compressorpump stations pumps for liquid pipelines and compressors for gas pipelines are located along the line to move the product through the pipeline the location of these stations is defined by the topography of the terrain the type of product being transported or operational conditions of the network partial delivery station known also as intermediate stations these facilities allow the pipeline operator to deliver part of the product being transported block valve station these are the first line of protection for pipelines with these valves the operator can isolate any segment of the line for maintenance work or isolate a rupture or leak block valve stations are usually located every  to  miles  km depending on the type of pipeline even though it is not a design rule it is a very usual practice in liquid pipelines the location of these stations depends exclusively on the nature of the product being transported the trajectory of the pipeline andor the operational conditions of the line regulator station this is a special type of valve station where the operator can release some of the pressure from the line regulators are usually located at the downhill side of a peak final delivery station known also as outlet stations or terminals this is where the product will be distributed to the consumer it could be a tank terminal for liquid pipelines or a connection to a distribution network for gas pipelines leak detection systemsedit since oil and gas pipelines are an important asset of the economic development of almost any country it has been required either by government regulations or internal policies to ensure the safety of the assets and the population and environment where these pipelines run pipeline companies face government regulation environmental constraints and social situations government regulations may define minimum staff to run the operation operator training requirements pipeline facilities technology and applications required to ensure operational safety for example in the state of washington it is mandatory for pipeline operators to be able to detect and locate leaks of  percent of maximum flow within fifteen minutes or less social factors also affect the operation of pipelines product theft is sometimes also a problem for pipeline companies in this case the detection levels should be under two percent of maximum flow with a high expectation for location accuracy various technologies and strategies have been implemented for monitoring pipelines from physically walking the lines to satellite surveillance the most common technology to protect pipelines from occasional leaks is computational pipeline monitoring or cpm cpm takes information from the field related to pressures flows and temperatures to estimate the hydraulic behavior of the product being transported once the estimation is completed the results are compared to other field references to detect the presence of an anomaly or unexpected situation which may be related to a leak the american petroleum institute has published several articles related to the performance of cpm in liquids pipelines the api publications are ram  – computational pipeline monitoring for liquids pipelines api  – pipeline variable uncertainties  their effects on leak detectability where a pipeline containing passes under a road or railway it is usually enclosed in a protective casing this casing is vented to the atmosphere to prevent the buildup of flammable gases or corrosive substances and to allow the air inside the casing to be sampled to detect leaks the casing vent a pipe protruding from the ground often doubles as a warning marker called a casing vent marker implementationedit as a rule pipelines for all uses are laid in most cases undergroundcitation needed however in some cases it is necessary to cross a valley or a river on a pipeline bridge pipelines for centralized heating systems are often laid on the ground or overhead pipelines for petroleum running through permafrost areas as transalaskapipeline are often run overhead in order to avoid melting the frozen ground by hot petroleum which would result in sinking the pipeline in the ground maintenanceedit maintenance of pipelines includes checking cathodic protection levels for the proper range surveillance for construction erosion or leaks by foot land vehicle boat or air and running cleaning pigs when there is anything carried in the pipeline that is corrosive us pipeline maintenance rules are covered in code of federal regulationscfr sections  cfr  for natural gas pipelines and  cfr  for petroleum liquid pipelines regulationedit an underground petroleum pipeline running through a park in the us onshore and offshore pipelines used to transport oil and gas are regulated by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa certain offshore pipelines used to produce oil and gas are regulated by the minerals management service mms in canada pipelines are regulated by either the provincial regulators or if they cross provincial boundaries or the canada–us border by the national energy board neb government regulations in canada and the united states require that buried fuel pipelines must be protected from corrosion often the most economical method of corrosion control is by use of pipeline coating in conjunction with cathodic protection and technology to monitor the pipeline above ground cathodic protection is not an option the coating is the only external protection pipelines and geopoliticsedit pipelines for major energy resources petroleum and natural gas are not merely an element of trade they connect to issues of geopolitics and international security as well and the construction placement and control of oil and gas pipelines often figure prominently in state interests and actions a notable example of pipeline politics occurred at the beginning of the year  wherein a dispute between russia and ukraine ostensibly over pricing led to a major political crisis russian stateowned gas company gazprom cut off natural gas supplies to ukraine after talks between it and the ukrainian government fell through in addition to cutting off supplies to ukraine russian gas flowing through ukraine—which included nearly all supplies to southeastern europe and some supplies to central and western europe—was cut off creating a major crisis in several countries heavily dependent on russian gas as fuel russia was accused of using the dispute as leverage in its attempt to keep other powers and particularly the european union from interfering in its near abroad oil and gas pipelines also figure prominently in the politics of central asia and the caucasus hazard identificationedit because the solvent fraction of dilbit typically comprises volatile aromatics like naptha and benzene reasonably rapid carrier vaporization can be expected to follow an aboveground spill—ostensibly enabling timely intervention by leaving only a viscous residue that is slow to migrate effective protocols to minimize exposure to petrochemical vapours are wellestablished and oil spilled from the pipeline would be unlikely to reach the aquifer unless incomplete remediation were followed by the introduction of another carrier eg a series of torrential downpours the introduction of benzene and other volatile organic compounds collectively btex to the subterranean environment compounds the threat posed by a pipeline leak particularly if followed by rain a pipeline breach would result in btex dissolution and equilibration of benzene in water followed by percolation of the admixture into the aquifer benzene can cause many health problems and is carcinogenic with epa maximum contaminant level mcl set at  μgl for potable water although it is not well studied single benzene exposure events have been linked to acute carcinogenesis additionally the exposure of livestock mainly cattle to benzene has been shown to cause many health issues such as neurotoxicity fetal damage and fatal poisoning the entire surface of an aboveground pipeline can be directly examined for material breach pooled petroleum is unambiguous readily spotted and indicates the location of required repairs because the effectiveness of remote inspection is limited by the cost of monitoring equipment gaps between sensors and data that requires interpretation small leaks in buried pipe can sometimes go undetected pipeline developers do not always prioritize effective surveillance against leaks buried pipes draw fewer complaints they are insulated from extremes in ambient temperature they are shielded from ultraviolet rays and they are less exposed to photodegradation buried pipes are isolated from airborne debris electrical storms tornadoes hurricanes hail and acid rain they are protected from nesting birds rutting mammals and wayward buckshot buried pipe is less vulnerable to accident damage eg automobile collisions and less accessible to vandals saboteurs and terrorists exposureedit previous work has shown that a worstcase exposure scenario can be limited to a specific set of conditions based on the advanced detection methods and pipeline shutoff sop developed by transcanada the risk of a substantive or large release over a short period of time contaminating groundwater with benzene is unlikely detection shutoff and remediation procedures would limit the dissolution and transport of benzene therefore the exposure of benzene would be limited to leaks that are below the limit of detection and go unnoticed for extended periods of time leak detection is monitored through a scada system that assesses pressure and volume flow every  seconds a pinhole leak that releases small quantities that cannot be detected by the scada system  flow could accumulate into a substantive spill detection of pinhole leaks would come from a visual or olfactory inspection aerial surveying or massbalance inconsistencies it is assumed that pinhole leaks are discovered within the day inspection interval however snow cover and location eg remote deep could delay detection benzene typically makes up  –  of oil and will have varying degrees of volatility and dissolution based on environmental factors even with pipeline leak volumes within scada detection limits sometimes pipeline leaks are misinterpreted by pipeline operators to be pump malfunctions or other problems the enbridge line b crude oil pipeline failure in marshall michigan on july   was thought by operators in edmonton to be from column separation of the dilbit in that pipeline the leak in wetlands along the kalamazoo river was only confirmed  hours after it happened by a local gas company employee in michigan spill frequencyvolumeedit although the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa has standard baseline incident frequencies to estimate the number of spills transcanada altered these assumptions based on improved pipeline design operation and safety whether these adjustments are justified is debatable as these assumptions resulted in a nearly fold decrease in spill estimates given that the pipeline crosses  miles of the ogallala aquifer or  of the entire pipeline length and the year life of the entire pipeline is expected to have between  –  spills approximately  –  spills can be expected to occur over the aquifer an estimate of  spills over the aquifer each lasting  days results in  days of potential exposure over the  year lifetime of the pipeline in the reduced scope ‘worst case exposure scenario’ the volume of a pinhole leak at  of max flowrate for  days has been estimated at  barrels or  million gallons of oil according to phmsa’s incident database only  of all spills in the last  years were  barrels benzene fate and transportedit scenario for benzene leaching to groundwater benzene is considered a light aromatic hydrocarbon with high solubility and high volatilityclarification needed it is unclear how temperature and depth would impact the volatility of benzene so assumptions have been made that benzene in oil  weight by volume would not volatilize before equilibrating with water using the octanolwater partition coefficient and a year precipitation event for the area a worstcase estimate of  mgl of benzene is anticipated to flow toward the aquifer the actual movement of the plume through groundwater systems is not well described although one estimate is that up to  billion gallons of water in the ogallala aquifer could become contaminated with benzene at concentrations above the mcl the final environmental impact statement from the state department does not include a quantitative analysis because it assumed that most benzene will volatilize previous dilbit spill remediation difficultiesedit one of the major concerns about dilbit is the difficulty in cleaning it up enbridges line b a inch crude oil pipeline ruptured in marshall michigan on july   mentioned above spilled at least  gallons of dilbit after detection of the leak booms and vacuum trucks were deployed heavy rains caused the river to overtop existing dams and carried dilbit  miles downstream before the

pipeline were in three countries pipeline and gas journal’s worldwide survey figures indicate that  miles  km of pipelines are planned and under construction of these  miles  km represent projects in the planning and design phase  miles  km reflect pipelines in various stages of construction liquids and gases are transported in pipelines and any chemically stable substance can be sent through a pipeline pipelines exist for the transport of crude and refined petroleum fuels  such as oil natural gas and biofuels  and other fluids including sewage slurry water and beer pipelines are useful for transporting water for drinking or irrigation over long distances when it needs to move over hills or where canals or channels are poor choices due to considerations of evaporation pollution or environmental impact pneumatic tubes using compressed air can be used to transport solid capsules oil pipelines are made from steel or plastic tubes which are usually buried the oil is moved through the pipelines by pump stations along the pipeline natural gas and similar gaseous fuels are lightly pressurised into liquids known as natural gas liquids ngls natural gas pipelines are constructed of carbon steel highly toxic ammonia is theoretically the most dangerous substance to be transported through longdistance pipelines but accidents have been rare hydrogen pipeline transport is the

launcherreceiver belonging to the natural gas pipeline in switzerland it is uncertain when the first crude oil pipeline was built credit for the development of pipeline transport is disputed with competing claims for vladimir shukhov and the branobel company in the late th century and the oil transport association which first constructed a inch  mm wrought iron pipeline over a mile  km track from an oil field in pennsylvania to a railroad station in oil creek in the s pipelines are generally the most economical way to transport large quantities of oil refined oil products or natural gas over land natural gas and similar gaseous fuels are lightly pressurized into liquids knows as natural gas liquids ngls small ngl processing facilities can be located in oil fields so the butane and propane liquid under light pressure of  pounds per square inch  kpa can be shipped by rail truck or pipeline propane can be used as a fuel in oil fields to heat various facilities used by the oil drillers or equipment and trucks used in the oil patch eg propane will convert from a gas to a liquid under light pressure  psi give or take depending on temperature and is pumped into cars and trucks at less than  psi  kpa at retail stations pipelines and rail cars use about double that pressure to pump at  psi  kpa the distance to ship propane to markets is much shorter as thousands of naturalgas processing plants are located in or near oil fields many bakken basin oil companies in north dakota montana manitoba and saskatchewan gas fields separate the ngls in the field allowing the drillers to sell propane directly to small wholesalers eliminating the large refinery control of product and prices for propane or butane the most recent major pipeline to start operating in north america is a transcanada natural gas line going north across the niagara region bridges with marcellus shale gas from pennsylvania and others tied in methane or natural gas sources into the canadian province of ontario as of the fall of  supplying  percent of all the natural gas used in ontario major russian gas pipelines to europe in  this new us supplied natural gas displaces the natural gas formerly shipped to ontario from western canada in alberta and manitoba thus dropping the government regulated pipeline shipping charges because of the significantly shorter distance from gas source to consumer compared to shipping by railroad pipelines have lower cost per unit and higher capacity pipelines are preferable to transportation by truck for a number of reasons employment on completed pipelines represents only  of that of the trucking industry to avoid delays and us government regulation many small medium and large oil producers in north dakota have decided to run an oil pipeline north to canada to meet up with a canadian oil pipeline shipping oil from west to east this allows the bakken basin and three forks oil producers to get higher negotiated prices for their oil because they will not be restricted to just one wholesale market in the us the distance from the biggest oil patch in north dakota in williston north dakota is only about  miles or  kilometers to the canada–us border and manitoba mutual funds and joint ventures are big investors in new oil and gas pipelines in the fall of  the us began exporting propane to europe known as lpg as wholesale prices there are much higher than in north america additionally a pipeline is currently being constructed from north dakota to illinois commonly known as the dakota access pipeline as more north american pipelines are built even more exports of lng propane butane and other natural gas products occur on all three us coasts to give insight north dakota bakken regions oil production has grown by  from  to  north dakota oil companies are shipping huge amounts of oil by tanker rail car as they can direct the oil to the market that gives the best price and rail cars can be used to avoid a congested oil pipeline to get the oil to a different pipeline in order to get the oil to market faster or to a different less busy oil refinery however pipelines provide a cheaper means to transport by volume enbridge in canada is applying to reverse an oil pipeline going from easttowest line  and expanding it and using it to ship western canadian bitumen oil eastward from a presently rated  barrels equivalent per day pipeline it will be expanded to between one million to  million barrels per day it will bring western oil to refineries in ontario michigan ohio pennsylvania quebec and new york by early  new brunswick will also refine some of this western canadian crude and export some crude and refined oil to europe from its deep water oil ulcc loading port although pipelines can be built under the sea that process is economically and technically demanding so the majority of oil at sea is transported by tanker ships the enbridge sandpiper pipeline is proposed to transfer valuable oil from western north dakota through northwestern minnesota the pipeline will be  inches in diameter it will carry over  barrels of oil a day with a volatility of  growth of marketedit gas pipe in the dry region of antofagasta chile the market size for oil and gas pipeline construction experienced tremendous growth prior to the economic downturn in  after faltering in  demand for pipeline expansion and updating increased the following year as energy production grew by  almost  miles of north american pipeline were being planned or under construction construction and operationedit oil pipelines are made from steel or plastic tubes with inner diameter typically from  to  inches  to  mm most pipelines are typically buried at a depth of about  to  feet  to  m to protect pipes from impact abrasion and corrosion a variety of methods are used these can include wood lagging wood slats concrete coating rockshield highdensity polyethylene imported sand padding and padding machines crude oil contains varying amounts of paraffin wax and in colder climates wax buildup may occur within a pipeline often these pipelines are inspected and cleaned using pigging the practice of using devices known as pigs to perform various maintenance operations on a pipeline the devices are also known as scrapers or godevils smart pigs also known as intelligent or intelligence pigs are used to detect anomalies in the pipe such as dents metal loss caused by corrosion cracking or other mechanical damage these devices are launched from piglauncher stations and travel through the pipeline to be received at any other station downstream either cleaning wax deposits and material that may have accumulated inside the line or inspecting and recording the condition of the line for natural gas pipelines are constructed of carbon steel and vary in size from  to  inches  to  mm in diameter depending on the type of pipeline the gas is pressurized by compressor stations and is odorless unless mixed with a mercaptan odorant where required by a regulating authority ammoniaedit the worlds longest ammonia pipeline from russia to ukraine highly toxic ammonia is theoretically the most dangerous substance to be transported through longdistance pipelinescitation needed however incidents on ammoniatransporting lines are uncommon  unlike on industrial ammoniaprocessing equipmentcitation needed a major ammonia pipeline is the ukrainian transammiak line connecting the togliattiazot facility in russia to the exporting black seaport of odessa alcohol fuelsedit see also biobutanol pipelines have been used for transportation of ethanol in brazil and there are several ethanol pipeline projects in brazil and the united states the main problems related to the transport of ethanol by pipeline are its corrosive nature and tendency to absorb water and impurities in pipelines which are not problems with oil and natural gas insufficient volumes and costeffectiveness are other considerations limiting construction of ethanol pipelines coal and oreedit slurry pipelines are sometimes used to transport coal or ore from mines the material to be transported is closely mixed with water before being introduced to the pipeline at the far end the material must be dried one example is a kilometre  mi slurry pipeline which is planned to transport iron ore from the minasrio mine producing  million tonnes per year to the port of açu in brazil an existing example is the kilometre  mi savage river slurry pipeline in tasmania australia possibly the worlds first when it was built in  it includes a metre  ft bridge span at  metres  ft above the savage river hydrogenedit main article hydrogen pipeline transport hydrogen pipeline transport is a transportation of hydrogen through a pipe as part of the hydrogen infrastructure hydrogen pipeline transport is used to connect the point of hydrogen production or delivery of hydrogen with the point of demand with transport costs similar to cng the technology is proven most hydrogen is produced at the place of demand with every  to  miles  km an industrial production facility the  rhineruhr kilometre  mi hydrogen pipeline is still in operation as of update there are  miles  km of low pressure hydrogen pipelines in the us and  miles  km in europe wateredit main article aqueduct watercourse the los angeles aqueduct in antelope valley two millennia ago the ancient romans made use of large aqueducts to transport water from higher elevations by building the aqueducts in graduated segments that allowed gravity to push the water along until it reached its destination hundreds of these were built throughout europe and elsewhere and along with flour mills were considered the lifeline of the roman empire the ancient chinese also made use of channels and pipe systems for public works the famous han dynasty court eunuch zhang rang d  ad once ordered the engineer bi lan to construct a series of squarepallet chain pumps outside the capital city of luoyang these chain pumps serviced the imperial palaces and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a stoneware pipe system pipelines are useful for transporting water for drinking or irrigation over long distances when it needs to move over hills or where canals or channels are poor choices due to considerations of evaporation pollution or environmental impact the  km  mi goldfields water supply scheme in western australia using  mm  inch pipe and completed in  was the largest water supply scheme of its time examples of significant water pipelines in south australia are the morganwhyalla pipelne completed  and mannumadelaide completed  pipelines both part of the larger snowy mountains scheme there are two los angeles california aqueducts the owens valley aqueduct completed  and the second los angeles aqueduct completed  which also include extensive use of pipelines the great manmade river of libya supplies  cubic metres  cu yd of water each day to tripoli benghazi sirte and several other cities in libya the pipeline is over  kilometres  mi long and is connected to wells tapping an aquifer over  metres  ft underground other systemsedit district heatingedit district heating pipeline in austria with a length of  km  main article district heating district heating or teleheating systems consist of a network of insulated feed and return pipes which transport heated water pressurized hot water or sometimes steam to the customer while steam is hottest and may be used in industrial processes due to its higher temperature it is less efficient to produce and transport due to greater heat losses heat transfer oils are generally not used for economic and ecological reasons the typical annual loss of thermal energy through distribution is around  as seen in norways district heating network district heating pipelines are normally installed underground with some exceptions within the system heat storage may be installed to even out peak load demands heat is transferred into the central heating of the dwellings through heat exchangers at heat substations without mixing of the fluids in either system beeredit thor pipeline in randers denmark bars in the veltinsarena a major football ground in gelsenkirchen germany are interconnected by a kilometre  mi long beer pipeline in randers city in denmark the socalled thor beer pipeline was operated originally copper pipes ran directly from the brewery but when the brewery moved out of the city in the s thor beer replaced it with a giant tank a threekilometer beer pipeline was completed in bruges belgium in september  to reduce truck traffic on the city streets brineedit the village of hallstatt in austria which is known for its long history of salt mining claims to contain the oldest industrial pipeline in the world dating back to  it was constructed from  hollowedout tree trunks to transport brine  kilometres  mi from hallstatt to ebensee milkedit between  and  a  km milk pipeline ran between the dutch island of ameland and holwerd on the mainland of which  km beneath the wadden sea every day  litres of milk produced on the island were transported to be processed on the mainland in  the milk transport was abandoned marine pipelinesedit main article submarine pipeline in places a pipeline may have to cross water expanses such as small seas straits and rivers in many instances they lie entirely on the seabed these pipelines are referred to as marine pipelines also submarine or offshore pipelines they are used primarily to carry oil or gas but transportation of water is also important in offshore projects a distinction is made between a flowline and a pipeline the former is an intrafield pipeline in the sense that it is used to connect subsea wellheads manifolds and the platform within a particular development field the latter sometimes referred to as an export pipeline is used to bring the resource to shore the construction and maintenance of marine pipelines imply logistical challenges that are different from those onland mainly because of wave and current dynamics along with other geohazards functionsedit in general pipelines can be classified in three categories depending on purpose gathering pipelines group of smaller interconnected pipelines forming complex networks with the purpose of bringing crude oil or natural gas from several nearby wells to a treatment plant or processing facility in this group pipelines are usually short a couple hundred metres and with small diameters subsea pipelines for collecting product from deep water production platforms are also considered gathering systems transportation pipelines mainly long pipes with large diameters moving products oil gas refined products between cities countries and even continents these transportation networks include several compressor stations in gas lines or pump stations for crude and multiproducts pipelines distribution pipelines composed of several interconnected pipelines with small diameters used to take the products to the final consumer feeder lines to distribute gas to homes and businesses downstream pipelines at terminals for distributing products to tanks and storage facilities are included in this groups development and planningedit when a pipeline is built the construction project not only covers the civil engineering work to lay the pipeline and build the pumpcompressor stations it also has to cover all the work related to the installation of the field devices that will support remote operation the pipeline is routed along what is known as a right of way pipelines are generally developed and built using the following stages open season to determine market interest potential customers are given the chance to sign up for part of the new pipelines capacity rights route right of way selection pipeline design the pipeline project may take a number of forms including the construction of a new pipeline conversion of existing pipeline from one fuel type to another or improvements to facilities on a current pipeline route obtaining approval once the design is finalized and the first pipeline customers have purchased their share of capacity the project must be approved by the relevant regulatory agencies surveying the route clearing the route trenching  main route and crossings roads rail other pipes etc installing the pipe installing valves intersections etc covering the pipe and trench testing once construction is completed the new pipeline is subjected to tests to ensure its structural integrity these may include hydrostatic testing and line packing russia has pipeline troops as part of the rear services who are trained to build and repair pipelines russia is the only country to have pipeline troops operationedit field devices are instrumentation data gathering units and communication systems the field instrumentation includes flow pressure and temperature gaugestransmitters and other devices to measure the relevant data required these instruments are installed along the pipeline on some specific locations such as injection or delivery stations pump stations liquid pipelines or compressor stations gas pipelines and block valve stations the information measured by these field instruments is then gathered in local remote terminal units rtu that transfer the field data to a central location in real time using communication systems such as satellite channels microwave links or cellular phone connections pipelines are controlled and operated remotely from what is usually known as the main control room in this center all the data related to field measurement is consolidated in one central database the data is received from multiple rtus along the pipeline it is common to find rtus installed at every station along the pipeline the scada system for pipelines the scada system at the main control room receives all the field data and presents it to the pipeline operator through a set of screens or human machine interface showing the operational conditions of the pipeline the operator can monitor the hydraulic conditions of the line as well as send operational commands openclose valves turn onoff compressors or pumps change setpoints etc through the scada system to the field to optimize and secure the operation of these assets some pipeline companies are using what is called advanced pipeline applications which are software tools installed on top of the scada system that provide extended functionality to perform leak detection leak location batch tracking liquid lines pig tracking composition tracking predictive modeling look ahead modeling and operator training technologyedit componentsedit the trans alaska pipeline crossing under the tanana river and over ridge of the alaska range pipeline networks are composed of several pieces of equipment that operate together to move products from location to location the main elements of a pipeline system are initial injection station known also as supply or inlet station is the beginning of the system where the product is injected into the line storage facilities pumps or compressors are usually located at these locations compressorpump stations pumps for liquid pipelines and compressors for gas pipelines are located along the line to move the product through the pipeline the location of these stations is defined by the topography of the terrain the type of product being transported or operational conditions of the network partial delivery station known also as intermediate stations these facilities allow the pipeline operator to deliver part of the product being transported block valve station these are the first line of protection for pipelines with these valves the operator can isolate any segment of the line for maintenance work or isolate a rupture or leak block valve stations are usually located every  to  miles  km depending on the type of pipeline even though it is not a design rule it is a very usual practice in liquid pipelines the location of these stations depends exclusively on the nature of the product being transported the trajectory of the pipeline andor the operational conditions of the line regulator station this is a special type of valve station where the operator can release some of the pressure from the line regulators are usually located at the downhill side of a peak final delivery station known also as outlet stations or terminals this is where the product will be distributed to the consumer it could be a tank terminal for liquid pipelines or a connection to a distribution network for gas pipelines leak detection systemsedit since oil and gas pipelines are an important asset of the economic development of almost any country it has been required either by government regulations or internal policies to ensure the safety of the assets and the population and environment where these pipelines run pipeline companies face government regulation environmental constraints and social situations government regulations may define minimum staff to run the operation operator training requirements pipeline facilities technology and applications required to ensure operational safety for example in the state of washington it is mandatory for pipeline operators to be able to detect and locate leaks of  percent of maximum flow within fifteen minutes or less social factors also affect the operation of pipelines product theft is sometimes also a problem for pipeline companies in this case the detection levels should be under two percent of maximum flow with a high expectation for location accuracy various technologies and strategies have been implemented for monitoring pipelines from physically walking the lines to satellite surveillance the most common technology to protect pipelines from occasional leaks is computational pipeline monitoring or cpm cpm takes information from the field related to pressures flows and temperatures to estimate the hydraulic behavior of the product being transported once the estimation is completed the results are compared to other field references to detect the presence of an anomaly or unexpected situation which may be related to a leak the american petroleum institute has published several articles related to the performance of cpm in liquids pipelines the api publications are ram  – computational pipeline monitoring for liquids pipelines api  – pipeline variable uncertainties  their effects on leak detectability where a pipeline containing passes under a road or railway it is usually enclosed in a protective casing this casing is vented to the atmosphere to prevent the buildup of flammable gases or corrosive substances and to allow the air inside the casing to be sampled to detect leaks the casing vent a pipe protruding from the ground often doubles as a warning marker called a casing vent marker implementationedit as a rule pipelines for all uses are laid in most cases undergroundcitation needed however in some cases it is necessary to cross a valley or a river on a pipeline bridge pipelines for centralized heating systems are often laid on the ground or overhead pipelines for petroleum running through permafrost areas as transalaskapipeline are often run overhead in order to avoid melting the frozen ground by hot petroleum which would result in sinking the pipeline in the ground maintenanceedit maintenance of pipelines includes checking cathodic protection levels for the proper range surveillance for construction erosion or leaks by foot land vehicle boat or air and running cleaning pigs when there is anything carried in the pipeline that is corrosive us pipeline maintenance rules are covered in code of federal regulationscfr sections  cfr  for natural gas pipelines and  cfr  for petroleum liquid pipelines regulationedit an underground petroleum pipeline running through a park in the us onshore and offshore pipelines used to transport oil and gas are regulated by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa certain offshore pipelines used to produce oil and gas are regulated by the minerals management service mms in canada pipelines are regulated by either the provincial regulators or if they cross provincial boundaries or the canada–us border by the national energy board neb government regulations in canada and the united states require that buried fuel pipelines must be protected from corrosion often the most economical method of corrosion control is by use of pipeline coating in conjunction with cathodic protection and technology to monitor the pipeline above ground cathodic protection is not an option the coating is the only external protection pipelines and geopoliticsedit pipelines for major energy resources petroleum and natural gas are not merely an element of trade they connect to issues of geopolitics and international security as well and the construction placement and control of oil and gas pipelines often figure prominently in state interests and actions a notable example of pipeline politics occurred at the beginning of the year  wherein a dispute between russia and ukraine ostensibly over pricing led to a major political crisis russian stateowned gas company gazprom cut off natural gas supplies to ukraine after talks between it and the ukrainian government fell through in addition to cutting off supplies to ukraine russian gas flowing through ukraine—which included nearly all supplies to southeastern europe and some supplies to central and western europe—was cut off creating a major crisis in several countries heavily dependent on russian gas as fuel russia was accused of using the dispute as leverage in its attempt to keep other powers and particularly the european union from interfering in its near abroad oil and gas pipelines also figure prominently in the politics of central asia and the caucasus hazard identificationedit because the solvent fraction of dilbit typically comprises volatile aromatics like naptha and benzene reasonably rapid carrier vaporization can be expected to follow an aboveground spill—ostensibly enabling timely intervention by leaving only a viscous residue that is slow to migrate effective protocols to minimize exposure to petrochemical vapours are wellestablished and oil spilled from the pipeline would be unlikely to reach the aquifer unless incomplete remediation were followed by the introduction of another carrier eg a series of torrential downpours the introduction of benzene and other volatile organic compounds collectively btex to the subterranean environment compounds the threat posed by a pipeline leak particularly if followed by rain a pipeline breach would result in btex dissolution and equilibration of benzene in water followed by percolation of the admixture into the aquifer benzene can cause many health problems and is carcinogenic with epa maximum contaminant level mcl set at  μgl for potable water although it is not well studied single benzene exposure events have been linked to acute carcinogenesis additionally the exposure of livestock mainly cattle to benzene has been shown to cause many health issues such as neurotoxicity fetal damage and fatal poisoning the entire surface of an aboveground pipeline can be directly examined for material breach pooled petroleum is unambiguous readily spotted and indicates the location of required repairs because the effectiveness of remote inspection is limited by the cost of monitoring equipment gaps between sensors and data that requires interpretation small leaks in buried pipe can sometimes go undetected pipeline developers do not always prioritize effective surveillance against leaks buried pipes draw fewer complaints they are insulated from extremes in ambient temperature they are shielded from ultraviolet rays and they are less exposed to photodegradation buried pipes are isolated from airborne debris electrical storms tornadoes hurricanes hail and acid rain they are protected from nesting birds rutting mammals and wayward buckshot buried pipe is less vulnerable to accident damage eg automobile collisions and less accessible to vandals saboteurs and terrorists exposureedit previous work has shown that a worstcase exposure scenario can be limited to a specific set of conditions based on the advanced detection methods and pipeline shutoff sop developed by transcanada the risk of a substantive or large release over a short period of time contaminating groundwater with benzene is unlikely detection shutoff and remediation procedures would limit the dissolution and transport of benzene therefore the exposure of benzene would be limited to leaks that are below the limit of detection and go unnoticed for extended periods of time leak detection is monitored through a scada system that assesses pressure and volume flow every  seconds a pinhole leak that releases small quantities that cannot be detected by the scada system  flow could accumulate into a substantive spill detection of pinhole leaks would come from a visual or olfactory inspection aerial surveying or massbalance inconsistencies it is assumed that pinhole leaks are discovered within the day inspection interval however snow cover and location eg remote deep could delay detection benzene typically makes up  –  of oil and will have varying degrees of volatility and dissolution based on environmental factors even with pipeline leak volumes within scada detection limits sometimes pipeline leaks are misinterpreted by pipeline operators to be pump malfunctions or other problems the enbridge line b crude oil pipeline failure in marshall michigan on july   was thought by operators in edmonton to be from column separation of the dilbit in that pipeline the leak in wetlands along the kalamazoo river was only confirmed  hours after it happened by a local gas company employee in michigan spill frequencyvolumeedit although the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa has standard baseline incident frequencies to estimate the number of spills transcanada altered these assumptions based on improved pipeline design operation and safety whether these adjustments are justified is debatable as these assumptions resulted in a nearly fold decrease in spill estimates given that the pipeline crosses  miles of the ogallala aquifer or  of the entire pipeline length and the year life of the entire pipeline is expected to have between  –  spills approximately  –  spills can be expected to occur over the aquifer an estimate of  spills over the aquifer each lasting  days results in  days of potential exposure over the  year lifetime of the pipeline in the reduced scope ‘worst case exposure scenario’ the volume of a pinhole leak at  of max flowrate for  days has been estimated at  barrels or  million gallons of oil according to phmsa’s incident database only  of all spills in the last  years were  barrels benzene fate and transportedit scenario for benzene leaching to groundwater benzene is considered a light aromatic hydrocarbon with high solubility and high volatilityclarification needed it is unclear how temperature and depth would impact the volatility of benzene so assumptions have been made that benzene in oil  weight by volume would not volatilize before equilibrating with water using the octanolwater partition coefficient and a year precipitation event for the area a worstcase estimate of  mgl of benzene is anticipated to flow toward the aquifer the actual movement of the plume through groundwater systems is not well described although one estimate is that up to  billion gallons of water in the ogallala aquifer could become contaminated with benzene at concentrations above the mcl the final environmental impact statement from the state department does not include a quantitative analysis because it assumed that most benzene will volatilize previous dilbit spill remediation difficultiesedit one of the major concerns about dilbit is the difficulty in cleaning it up enbridges line b a inch crude oil pipeline ruptured in marshall michigan on july   mentioned above spilled at least  gallons of dilbit after detection of the leak booms and vacuum trucks were deployed heavy rains caused the river to overtop existing dams and carried dilbit  miles downstream before the spill was contained remediation work collected over  million gallons of oil and almost  cubic yards of oilcontaminated sediment and debris from the kalamazoo river system however oil was still being

material through a pipe the latest data in  gives a total of slightly less than  miles  km of pipeline in  countries of the world the united states had  russia had  and canada had  thus  of all pipeline were in three countries pipeline and gas journal’s worldwide survey figures indicate that  miles  km of pipelines are planned and under construction of these  miles  km represent projects in the planning and design phase  miles  km reflect pipelines in various stages of construction liquids and gases are transported in pipelines and any chemically stable substance can be sent through a pipeline pipelines exist for the transport of crude and refined petroleum fuels  such as oil natural gas and biofuels  and other fluids including sewage slurry water and beer pipelines are useful for transporting water for drinking or irrigation over long distances when it needs to move over hills or where canals or channels are poor choices due to considerations of evaporation pollution or environmental impact pneumatic tubes using compressed air can be used to transport solid capsules oil pipelines are made from steel or plastic tubes which are usually buried the oil is moved through the pipelines by pump stations along the pipeline natural gas and similar gaseous fuels are lightly pressurised into liquids known as natural gas liquids ngls natural gas pipelines are constructed of carbon steel highly toxic ammonia is theoretically the most dangerous substance to be transported through longdistance pipelines but accidents have been rare hydrogen pipeline transport is the transportation of hydrogen through a pipe district heating or teleheating systems use a network of insulated pipes which transport heated water pressurized hot water or sometimes steam to the customer

launcherreceiver belonging to the natural gas pipeline in switzerland it is uncertain when the first crude oil pipeline was built credit for the development of pipeline transport is disputed with competing claims for vladimir shukhov and the branobel company in the late th century and the oil transport association which first constructed a inch  mm wrought iron pipeline over a mile  km track from an oil field in pennsylvania to a railroad station in oil creek in the s pipelines are generally the most economical way to transport large quantities of oil refined oil products or natural gas over land natural gas and similar gaseous fuels are lightly pressurized into liquids knows as natural gas liquids ngls small ngl processing facilities can be located in oil fields so the butane and propane liquid under light pressure of  pounds per square inch  kpa can be shipped by rail truck or pipeline propane can be used as a fuel in oil fields to heat various facilities used by the oil drillers or equipment and trucks used in the oil patch eg propane will convert from a gas to a liquid under light pressure  psi give or take depending on temperature and is pumped into cars and trucks at less than  psi  kpa at retail stations pipelines and rail cars use about double that pressure to pump at  psi  kpa the distance to ship propane to markets is much shorter as thousands of naturalgas processing plants are located in or near oil fields many bakken basin oil companies in north dakota montana manitoba and saskatchewan gas fields separate the ngls in the field allowing the drillers to sell propane directly to small wholesalers eliminating the large refinery control of product and prices for propane or butane the most recent major pipeline to start operating in north america is a transcanada natural gas line going north across the niagara region bridges with marcellus shale gas from pennsylvania and others tied in methane or natural gas sources into the canadian province of ontario as of the fall of  supplying  percent of all the natural gas used in ontario major russian gas pipelines to europe in  this new us supplied natural gas displaces the natural gas formerly shipped to ontario from western canada in alberta and manitoba thus dropping the government regulated pipeline shipping charges because of the significantly shorter distance from gas source to consumer compared to shipping by railroad pipelines have lower cost per unit and higher capacity pipelines are preferable to transportation by truck for a number of reasons employment on completed pipelines represents only  of that of the trucking industry to avoid delays and us government regulation many small medium and large oil producers in north dakota have decided to run an oil pipeline north to canada to meet up with a canadian oil pipeline shipping oil from west to east this allows the bakken basin and three forks oil producers to get higher negotiated prices for their oil because they will not be restricted to just one wholesale market in the us the distance from the biggest oil patch in north dakota in williston north dakota is only about  miles or  kilometers to the canada–us border and manitoba mutual funds and joint ventures are big investors in new oil and gas pipelines in the fall of  the us began exporting propane to europe known as lpg as wholesale prices there are much higher than in north america additionally a pipeline is currently being constructed from north dakota to illinois commonly known as the dakota access pipeline as more north american pipelines are built even more exports of lng propane butane and other natural gas products occur on all three us coasts to give insight north dakota bakken regions oil production has grown by  from  to  north dakota oil companies are shipping huge amounts of oil by tanker rail car as they can direct the oil to the market that gives the best price and rail cars can be used to avoid a congested oil pipeline to get the oil to a different pipeline in order to get the oil to market faster or to a different less busy oil refinery however pipelines provide a cheaper means to transport by volume enbridge in canada is applying to reverse an oil pipeline going from easttowest line  and expanding it and using it to ship western canadian bitumen oil eastward from a presently rated  barrels equivalent per day pipeline it will be expanded to between one million to  million barrels per day it will bring western oil to refineries in ontario michigan ohio pennsylvania quebec and new york by early  new brunswick will also refine some of this western canadian crude and export some crude and refined oil to europe from its deep water oil ulcc loading port although pipelines can be built under the sea that process is economically and technically demanding so the majority of oil at sea is transported by tanker ships the enbridge sandpiper pipeline is proposed to transfer valuable oil from western north dakota through northwestern minnesota the pipeline will be  inches in diameter it will carry over  barrels of oil a day with a volatility of  growth of marketedit gas pipe in the dry region of antofagasta chile the market size for oil and gas pipeline construction experienced tremendous growth prior to the economic downturn in  after faltering in  demand for pipeline expansion and updating increased the following year as energy production grew by  almost  miles of north american pipeline were being planned or under construction construction and operationedit oil pipelines are made from steel or plastic tubes with inner diameter typically from  to  inches  to  mm most pipelines are typically buried at a depth of about  to  feet  to  m to protect pipes from impact abrasion and corrosion a variety of methods are used these can include wood lagging wood slats concrete coating rockshield highdensity polyethylene imported sand padding and padding machines crude oil contains varying amounts of paraffin wax and in colder climates wax buildup may occur within a pipeline often these pipelines are inspected and cleaned using pigging the practice of using devices known as pigs to perform various maintenance operations on a pipeline the devices are also known as scrapers or godevils smart pigs also known as intelligent or intelligence pigs are used to detect anomalies in the pipe such as dents metal loss caused by corrosion cracking or other mechanical damage these devices are launched from piglauncher stations and travel through the pipeline to be received at any other station downstream either cleaning wax deposits and material that may have accumulated inside the line or inspecting and recording the condition of the line for natural gas pipelines are constructed of carbon steel and vary in size from  to  inches  to  mm in diameter depending on the type of pipeline the gas is pressurized by compressor stations and is odorless unless mixed with a mercaptan odorant where required by a regulating authority ammoniaedit the worlds longest ammonia pipeline from russia to ukraine highly toxic ammonia is theoretically the most dangerous substance to be transported through longdistance pipelinescitation needed however incidents on ammoniatransporting lines are uncommon  unlike on industrial ammoniaprocessing equipmentcitation needed a major ammonia pipeline is the ukrainian transammiak line connecting the togliattiazot facility in russia to the exporting black seaport of odessa alcohol fuelsedit see also biobutanol pipelines have been used for transportation of ethanol in brazil and there are several ethanol pipeline projects in brazil and the united states the main problems related to the transport of ethanol by pipeline are its corrosive nature and tendency to absorb water and impurities in pipelines which are not problems with oil and natural gas insufficient volumes and costeffectiveness are other considerations limiting construction of ethanol pipelines coal and oreedit slurry pipelines are sometimes used to transport coal or ore from mines the material to be transported is closely mixed with water before being introduced to the pipeline at the far end the material must be dried one example is a kilometre  mi slurry pipeline which is planned to transport iron ore from the minasrio mine producing  million tonnes per year to the port of açu in brazil an existing example is the kilometre  mi savage river slurry pipeline in tasmania australia possibly the worlds first when it was built in  it includes a metre  ft bridge span at  metres  ft above the savage river hydrogenedit main article hydrogen pipeline transport hydrogen pipeline transport is a transportation of hydrogen through a pipe as part of the hydrogen infrastructure hydrogen pipeline transport is used to connect the point of hydrogen production or delivery of hydrogen with the point of demand with transport costs similar to cng the technology is proven most hydrogen is produced at the place of demand with every  to  miles  km an industrial production facility the  rhineruhr kilometre  mi hydrogen pipeline is still in operation as of update there are  miles  km of low pressure hydrogen pipelines in the us and  miles  km in europe wateredit main article aqueduct watercourse the los angeles aqueduct in antelope valley two millennia ago the ancient romans made use of large aqueducts to transport water from higher elevations by building the aqueducts in graduated segments that allowed gravity to push the water along until it reached its destination hundreds of these were built throughout europe and elsewhere and along with flour mills were considered the lifeline of the roman empire the ancient chinese also made use of channels and pipe systems for public works the famous han dynasty court eunuch zhang rang d  ad once ordered the engineer bi lan to construct a series of squarepallet chain pumps outside the capital city of luoyang these chain pumps serviced the imperial palaces and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a stoneware pipe system pipelines are useful for transporting water for drinking or irrigation over long distances when it needs to move over hills or where canals or channels are poor choices due to considerations of evaporation pollution or environmental impact the  km  mi goldfields water supply scheme in western australia using  mm  inch pipe and completed in  was the largest water supply scheme of its time examples of significant water pipelines in south australia are the morganwhyalla pipelne completed  and mannumadelaide completed  pipelines both part of the larger snowy mountains scheme there are two los angeles california aqueducts the owens valley aqueduct completed  and the second los angeles aqueduct completed  which also include extensive use of pipelines the great manmade river of libya supplies  cubic metres  cu yd of water each day to tripoli benghazi sirte and several other cities in libya the pipeline is over  kilometres  mi long and is connected to wells tapping an aquifer over  metres  ft underground other systemsedit district heatingedit district heating pipeline in austria with a length of  km  main article district heating district heating or teleheating systems consist of a network of insulated feed and return pipes which transport heated water pressurized hot water or sometimes steam to the customer while steam is hottest and may be used in industrial processes due to its higher temperature it is less efficient to produce and transport due to greater heat losses heat transfer oils are generally not used for economic and ecological reasons the typical annual loss of thermal energy through distribution is around  as seen in norways district heating network district heating pipelines are normally installed underground with some exceptions within the system heat storage may be installed to even out peak load demands heat is transferred into the central heating of the dwellings through heat exchangers at heat substations without mixing of the fluids in either system beeredit thor pipeline in randers denmark bars in the veltinsarena a major football ground in gelsenkirchen germany are interconnected by a kilometre  mi long beer pipeline in randers city in denmark the socalled thor beer pipeline was operated originally copper pipes ran directly from the brewery but when the brewery moved out of the city in the s thor beer replaced it with a giant tank a threekilometer beer pipeline was completed in bruges belgium in september  to reduce truck traffic on the city streets brineedit the village of hallstatt in austria which is known for its long history of salt mining claims to contain the oldest industrial pipeline in the world dating back to  it was constructed from  hollowedout tree trunks to transport brine  kilometres  mi from hallstatt to ebensee milkedit between  and  a  km milk pipeline ran between the dutch island of ameland and holwerd on the mainland of which  km beneath the wadden sea every day  litres of milk produced on the island were transported to be processed on the mainland in  the milk transport was abandoned marine pipelinesedit main article submarine pipeline in places a pipeline may have to cross water expanses such as small seas straits and rivers in many instances they lie entirely on the seabed these pipelines are referred to as marine pipelines also submarine or offshore pipelines they are used primarily to carry oil or gas but transportation of water is also important in offshore projects a distinction is made between a flowline and a pipeline the former is an intrafield pipeline in the sense that it is used to connect subsea wellheads manifolds and the platform within a particular development field the latter sometimes referred to as an export pipeline is used to bring the resource to shore the construction and maintenance of marine pipelines imply logistical challenges that are different from those onland mainly because of wave and current dynamics along with other geohazards functionsedit in general pipelines can be classified in three categories depending on purpose gathering pipelines group of smaller interconnected pipelines forming complex networks with the purpose of bringing crude oil or natural gas from several nearby wells to a treatment plant or processing facility in this group pipelines are usually short a couple hundred metres and with small diameters subsea pipelines for collecting product from deep water production platforms are also considered gathering systems transportation pipelines mainly long pipes with large diameters moving products oil gas refined products between cities countries and even continents these transportation networks include several compressor stations in gas lines or pump stations for crude and multiproducts pipelines distribution pipelines composed of several interconnected pipelines with small diameters used to take the products to the final consumer feeder lines to distribute gas to homes and businesses downstream pipelines at terminals for distributing products to tanks and storage facilities are included in this groups development and planningedit when a pipeline is built the construction project not only covers the civil engineering work to lay the pipeline and build the pumpcompressor stations it also has to cover all the work related to the installation of the field devices that will support remote operation the pipeline is routed along what is known as a right of way pipelines are generally developed and built using the following stages open season to determine market interest potential customers are given the chance to sign up for part of the new pipelines capacity rights route right of way selection pipeline design the pipeline project may take a number of forms including the construction of a new pipeline conversion of existing pipeline from one fuel type to another or improvements to facilities on a current pipeline route obtaining approval once the design is finalized and the first pipeline customers have purchased their share of capacity the project must be approved by the relevant regulatory agencies surveying the route clearing the route trenching  main route and crossings roads rail other pipes etc installing the pipe installing valves intersections etc covering the pipe and trench testing once construction is completed the new pipeline is subjected to tests to ensure its structural integrity these may include hydrostatic testing and line packing russia has pipeline troops as part of the rear services who are trained to build and repair pipelines russia is the only country to have pipeline troops operationedit field devices are instrumentation data gathering units and communication systems the field instrumentation includes flow pressure and temperature gaugestransmitters and other devices to measure the relevant data required these instruments are installed along the pipeline on some specific locations such as injection or delivery stations pump stations liquid pipelines or compressor stations gas pipelines and block valve stations the information measured by these field instruments is then gathered in local remote terminal units rtu that transfer the field data to a central location in real time using communication systems such as satellite channels microwave links or cellular phone connections pipelines are controlled and operated remotely from what is usually known as the main control room in this center all the data related to field measurement is consolidated in one central database the data is received from multiple rtus along the pipeline it is common to find rtus installed at every station along the pipeline the scada system for pipelines the scada system at the main control room receives all the field data and presents it to the pipeline operator through a set of screens or human machine interface showing the operational conditions of the pipeline the operator can monitor the hydraulic conditions of the line as well as send operational commands openclose valves turn onoff compressors or pumps change setpoints etc through the scada system to the field to optimize and secure the operation of these assets some pipeline companies are using what is called advanced pipeline applications which are software tools installed on top of the scada system that provide extended functionality to perform leak detection leak location batch tracking liquid lines pig tracking composition tracking predictive modeling look ahead modeling and operator training technologyedit componentsedit the trans alaska pipeline crossing under the tanana river and over ridge of the alaska range pipeline networks are composed of several pieces of equipment that operate together to move products from location to location the main elements of a pipeline system are initial injection station known also as supply or inlet station is the beginning of the system where the product is injected into the line storage facilities pumps or compressors are usually located at these locations compressorpump stations pumps for liquid pipelines and compressors for gas pipelines are located along the line to move the product through the pipeline the location of these stations is defined by the topography of the terrain the type of product being transported or operational conditions of the network partial delivery station known also as intermediate stations these facilities allow the pipeline operator to deliver part of the product being transported block valve station these are the first line of protection for pipelines with these valves the operator can isolate any segment of the line for maintenance work or isolate a rupture or leak block valve stations are usually located every  to  miles  km depending on the type of pipeline even though it is not a design rule it is a very usual practice in liquid pipelines the location of these stations depends exclusively on the nature of the product being transported the trajectory of the pipeline andor the operational conditions of the line regulator station this is a special type of valve station where the operator can release some of the pressure from the line regulators are usually located at the downhill side of a peak final delivery station known also as outlet stations or terminals this is where the product will be distributed to the consumer it could be a tank terminal for liquid pipelines or a connection to a distribution network for gas pipelines leak detection systemsedit since oil and gas pipelines are an important asset of the economic development of almost any country it has been required either by government regulations or internal policies to ensure the safety of the assets and the population and environment where these pipelines run pipeline companies face government regulation environmental constraints and social situations government regulations may define minimum staff to run the operation operator training requirements pipeline facilities technology and applications required to ensure operational safety for example in the state of washington it is mandatory for pipeline operators to be able to detect and locate leaks of  percent of maximum flow within fifteen minutes or less social factors also affect the operation of pipelines product theft is sometimes also a problem for pipeline companies in this case the detection levels should be under two percent of maximum flow with a high expectation for location accuracy various technologies and strategies have been implemented for monitoring pipelines from physically walking the lines to satellite surveillance the most common technology to protect pipelines from occasional leaks is computational pipeline monitoring or cpm cpm takes information from the field related to pressures flows and temperatures to estimate the hydraulic behavior of the product being transported once the estimation is completed the results are compared to other field references to detect the presence of an anomaly or unexpected situation which may be related to a leak the american petroleum institute has published several articles related to the performance of cpm in liquids pipelines the api publications are ram  – computational pipeline monitoring for liquids pipelines api  – pipeline variable uncertainties  their effects on leak detectability where a pipeline containing passes under a road or railway it is usually enclosed in a protective casing this casing is vented to the atmosphere to prevent the buildup of flammable gases or corrosive substances and to allow the air inside the casing to be sampled to detect leaks the casing vent a pipe protruding from the ground often doubles as a warning marker called a casing vent marker implementationedit as a rule pipelines for all uses are laid in most cases undergroundcitation needed however in some cases it is necessary to cross a valley or a river on a pipeline bridge pipelines for centralized heating systems are often laid on the ground or overhead pipelines for petroleum running through permafrost areas as transalaskapipeline are often run overhead in order to avoid melting the frozen ground by hot petroleum which would result in sinking the pipeline in the ground maintenanceedit maintenance of pipelines includes checking cathodic protection levels for the proper range surveillance for construction erosion or leaks by foot land vehicle boat or air and running cleaning pigs when there is anything carried in the pipeline that is corrosive us pipeline maintenance rules are covered in code of federal regulationscfr sections  cfr  for natural gas pipelines and  cfr  for petroleum liquid pipelines regulationedit an underground petroleum pipeline running through a park in the us onshore and offshore pipelines used to transport oil and gas are regulated by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa certain offshore pipelines used to produce oil and gas are regulated by the minerals management service mms in canada pipelines are regulated by either the provincial regulators or if they cross provincial boundaries or the canada–us border by the national energy board neb government regulations in canada and the united states require that buried fuel pipelines must be protected from corrosion often the most economical method of corrosion control is by use of pipeline coating in conjunction with cathodic protection and technology to monitor the pipeline above ground cathodic protection is not an option the coating is the only external protection pipelines and geopoliticsedit pipelines for major energy resources petroleum and natural gas are not merely an element of trade they connect to issues of geopolitics and international security as well and the construction placement and control of oil and gas pipelines often figure prominently in state interests and actions a notable example of pipeline politics occurred at the beginning of the year  wherein a dispute between russia and ukraine ostensibly over pricing led to a major political crisis russian stateowned gas company gazprom cut off natural gas supplies to ukraine after talks between it and the ukrainian government fell through in addition to cutting off supplies to ukraine russian gas flowing through ukraine—which included nearly all supplies to southeastern europe and some supplies to central and western europe—was cut off creating a major crisis in several countries heavily dependent on russian gas as fuel russia was accused of using the dispute as leverage in its attempt to keep other powers and particularly the european union from interfering in its near abroad oil and gas pipelines also figure prominently in the politics of central asia and the caucasus hazard identificationedit because the solvent fraction of dilbit typically comprises volatile aromatics like naptha and benzene reasonably rapid carrier vaporization can be expected to follow an aboveground spill—ostensibly enabling timely intervention by leaving only a viscous residue that is slow to migrate effective protocols to minimize exposure to petrochemical vapours are wellestablished and oil spilled from the pipeline would be unlikely to reach the aquifer unless incomplete remediation were followed by the introduction of another carrier eg a series of torrential downpours the introduction of benzene and other volatile organic compounds collectively btex to the subterranean environment compounds the threat posed by a pipeline leak particularly if followed by rain a pipeline breach would result in btex dissolution and equilibration of benzene in water followed by percolation of the admixture into the aquifer benzene can cause many health problems and is carcinogenic with epa maximum contaminant level mcl set at  μgl for potable water although it is not well studied single benzene exposure events have been linked to acute carcinogenesis additionally the exposure of livestock mainly cattle to benzene has been shown to cause many health issues such as neurotoxicity fetal damage and fatal poisoning the entire surface of an aboveground pipeline can be directly examined for material breach pooled petroleum is unambiguous readily spotted and indicates the location of required repairs because the effectiveness of remote inspection is limited by the cost of monitoring equipment gaps between sensors and data that requires interpretation small leaks in buried pipe can sometimes go undetected pipeline developers do not always prioritize effective surveillance against leaks buried pipes draw fewer complaints they are insulated from extremes in ambient temperature they are shielded from ultraviolet rays and they are less exposed to photodegradation buried pipes are isolated from airborne debris electrical storms tornadoes hurricanes hail and acid rain they are protected from nesting birds rutting mammals and wayward buckshot buried pipe is less vulnerable to accident damage eg automobile collisions and less accessible to vandals saboteurs and terrorists exposureedit previous work has shown that a worstcase exposure scenario can be limited to a specific set of conditions based on the advanced detection methods and pipeline shutoff sop developed by transcanada the risk of a substantive or large release over a short period of time contaminating groundwater with benzene is unlikely detection shutoff and remediation procedures would limit the dissolution and transport of benzene therefore the exposure of benzene would be limited to leaks that are below the limit of detection and go unnoticed for extended periods of time leak detection is monitored through a scada system that assesses pressure and volume flow every  seconds a pinhole leak that releases small quantities that cannot be detected by the scada system  flow could accumulate into a substantive spill detection of pinhole leaks would come from a visual or olfactory inspection aerial surveying or massbalance inconsistencies it is assumed that pinhole leaks are discovered within the day inspection interval however snow cover and location eg remote deep could delay detection benzene typically makes up  –  of oil and will have varying degrees of volatility and dissolution based on environmental factors even with pipeline leak volumes within scada detection limits sometimes pipeline leaks are misinterpreted by pipeline operators to be pump malfunctions or other problems the enbridge line b crude oil pipeline failure in marshall michigan on july   was thought by operators in edmonton to be from column separation of the dilbit in that pipeline the leak in wetlands along the kalamazoo river was only confirmed  hours after it happened by a local gas company employee in michigan spill frequencyvolumeedit although the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa has standard baseline incident frequencies to estimate the number of spills transcanada altered these assumptions based on improved pipeline design operation and safety whether these adjustments are justified is debatable as these assumptions resulted in a nearly fold decrease in spill estimates given that the pipeline crosses  miles of the ogallala aquifer or  of the entire pipeline length and the year life of the entire pipeline is expected to have between  –  spills approximately  –  spills can be expected to occur over the aquifer an estimate of  spills over the aquifer each lasting  days results in  days of potential exposure over the  year lifetime of the pipeline in the reduced scope ‘worst case exposure scenario’ the volume of a pinhole leak at  of max flowrate for  days has been estimated at  barrels or  million gallons of oil according to phmsa’s incident database only  of all spills in the last  years were  barrels benzene fate and transportedit scenario for benzene leaching to groundwater benzene is considered a light aromatic hydrocarbon with high solubility and high volatilityclarification needed it is unclear how temperature and depth would impact the volatility of benzene so assumptions have been made that benzene in oil  weight by volume would not volatilize before equilibrating with water using the octanolwater partition coefficient and a year precipitation event for the area a worstcase estimate of  mgl of benzene is anticipated to flow toward the aquifer the actual movement of the plume through groundwater systems is not well described although one estimate is that up to  billion gallons of water in the ogallala aquifer could become contaminated with benzene at concentrations above the mcl the final environmental impact statement from the state department does not include a quantitative analysis because it assumed that most benzene will volatilize previous dilbit spill remediation difficultiesedit one of the major concerns about dilbit is the difficulty in cleaning it up enbridges line b a inch crude oil pipeline ruptured in marshall michigan on july   mentioned above spilled at least  gallons of dilbit after detection of the leak booms and vacuum trucks were deployed heavy rains caused the river to overtop existing dams and carried dilbit  miles downstream before the

pipeline were in three countries pipeline and gas journal’s worldwide survey figures indicate that  miles  km of pipelines are planned and under construction of these  miles  km represent projects in the planning and design phase  miles  km reflect pipelines in various stages of construction liquids and gases are transported in pipelines and any chemically stable substance can be sent through a pipeline pipelines exist for the transport of crude and refined petroleum fuels  such as oil natural gas and biofuels  and other fluids including sewage slurry water and beer pipelines are useful for transporting water for drinking or irrigation over long distances when it needs to move over hills or where canals or channels are poor choices due to considerations of evaporation pollution or environmental impact pneumatic tubes using compressed air can be used to transport solid capsules oil pipelines are made from steel or plastic tubes which are usually buried the oil is moved through the pipelines by pump stations along the pipeline natural gas and similar gaseous fuels are lightly pressurised into liquids known as natural gas liquids ngls natural gas pipelines are constructed of

launcherreceiver belonging to the natural gas pipeline in switzerland it is uncertain when the first crude oil pipeline was built credit for the development of pipeline transport is disputed with competing claims for vladimir shukhov and the branobel company in the late th century and the oil transport association which first constructed a inch  mm wrought iron pipeline over a mile  km track from an oil field in pennsylvania to a railroad station in oil creek in the s pipelines are generally the most economical way to transport large quantities of oil refined oil products or natural gas over land natural gas and similar gaseous fuels are lightly pressurized into liquids knows as natural gas liquids ngls small ngl processing facilities can be located in oil fields so the butane and propane liquid under light pressure of  pounds per square inch  kpa can be shipped by rail truck or pipeline propane can be used as a fuel in oil fields to heat various facilities used by the oil drillers or equipment and trucks used in the oil patch eg propane will convert from a gas to a liquid under light pressure  psi give or take depending on temperature and is pumped into cars and trucks at less than  psi  kpa at retail stations pipelines and rail cars use about double that pressure to pump at  psi  kpa the distance to ship propane to markets is much shorter as thousands of naturalgas processing plants are located in or near oil fields many bakken basin oil companies in north dakota montana manitoba and saskatchewan gas fields separate the ngls in the field allowing the drillers to sell propane directly to small wholesalers eliminating the large refinery control of product and prices for propane or butane the most recent major pipeline to start operating in north america is a transcanada natural gas line going north across the niagara region bridges with marcellus shale gas from pennsylvania and others tied in methane or natural gas sources into the canadian province of ontario as of the fall of  supplying  percent of all the natural gas used in ontario major russian gas pipelines to europe in  this new us supplied natural gas displaces the natural gas formerly shipped to ontario from western canada in alberta and manitoba thus dropping the government regulated pipeline shipping charges because of the significantly shorter distance from gas source to consumer compared to shipping by railroad pipelines have lower cost per unit and higher capacity pipelines are preferable to transportation by truck for a number of reasons employment on completed pipelines represents only  of that of the trucking industry to avoid delays and us government regulation many small medium and large oil producers in north dakota have decided to run an oil pipeline north to canada to meet up with a canadian oil pipeline shipping oil from west to east this allows the bakken basin and three forks oil producers to get higher negotiated prices for their oil because they will not be restricted to just one wholesale market in the us the distance from the biggest oil patch in north dakota in williston north dakota is only about  miles or  kilometers to the canada–us border and manitoba mutual funds and joint ventures are big investors in new oil and gas pipelines in the fall of  the us began exporting propane to europe known as lpg as wholesale prices there are much higher than in north america additionally a pipeline is currently being constructed from north dakota to illinois commonly known as the dakota access pipeline as more north american pipelines are built even more exports of lng propane butane and other natural gas products occur on all three us coasts to give insight north dakota bakken regions oil production has grown by  from  to  north dakota oil companies are shipping huge amounts of oil by tanker rail car as they can direct the oil to the market that gives the best price and rail cars can be used to avoid a congested oil pipeline to get the oil to a different pipeline in order to get the oil to market faster or to a different less busy oil refinery however pipelines provide a cheaper means to transport by volume enbridge in canada is applying to reverse an oil pipeline going from easttowest line  and expanding it and using it to ship western canadian bitumen oil eastward from a presently rated  barrels equivalent per day pipeline it will be expanded to between one million to  million barrels per day it will bring western oil to refineries in ontario michigan ohio pennsylvania quebec and new york by early  new brunswick will also refine some of this western canadian crude and export some crude and refined oil to europe from its deep water oil ulcc loading port although pipelines can be built under the sea that process is economically and technically demanding so the majority of oil at sea is transported by tanker ships the enbridge sandpiper pipeline is proposed to transfer valuable oil from western north dakota through northwestern minnesota the pipeline will be  inches in diameter it will carry over  barrels of oil a day with a volatility of  growth of marketedit gas pipe in the

and updating increased the following year as energy production grew by  almost  miles of north american pipeline were being planned or under construction construction and operationedit oil pipelines are made from steel or plastic tubes with inner diameter typically from  to  inches  to  mm most pipelines are typically buried at a depth of about  to  feet  to  m to protect pipes from impact abrasion and corrosion a variety of methods are used these can include wood lagging wood slats concrete coating rockshield highdensity polyethylene imported sand padding and padding machines crude oil contains varying amounts of paraffin wax and in colder climates wax buildup may occur within a pipeline often these pipelines are inspected and cleaned using pigging the practice of using devices known as pigs to perform various maintenance operations on a pipeline the devices are also known as scrapers or godevils smart pigs also known as intelligent or intelligence pigs are used to detect anomalies in the pipe such as dents metal loss caused by corrosion cracking or other mechanical damage these devices are launched from piglauncher stations and travel through the pipeline to be received at any other station downstream either cleaning wax deposits and material that may have accumulated inside the line or inspecting and recording the condition of the line for natural gas pipelines are constructed of carbon steel and vary in size from  to  inches  to  mm in diameter depending on the type of pipeline the gas is pressurized by compressor stations and is odorless unless mixed with a mercaptan odorant where required by a regulating authority ammoniaedit the worlds longest ammonia pipeline from russia to ukraine highly toxic ammonia is theoretically the most dangerous substance to be transported through longdistance pipelinescitation needed however incidents on ammoniatransporting lines are uncommon  unlike on industrial ammoniaprocessing equipmentcitation needed a major ammonia pipeline is the ukrainian transammiak line connecting the togliattiazot facility in russia to the exporting black seaport of odessa alcohol fuelsedit see also biobutanol pipelines have been used for transportation of ethanol in brazil and there are several ethanol pipeline projects in brazil and the united states the main problems related to the transport of ethanol by pipeline are its corrosive nature and tendency to absorb water and impurities in pipelines which are not problems with oil and natural gas insufficient volumes and costeffectiveness are other considerations limiting construction of ethanol pipelines coal and oreedit slurry pipelines are sometimes used to transport coal or ore from mines the material to be transported is closely mixed with water before being introduced to the pipeline at the far end the material must be dried one example is a kilometre  mi slurry pipeline which is planned to transport iron ore from the minasrio mine producing  million tonnes per year to the port of açu in brazil an existing example is the kilometre  mi savage river slurry pipeline in tasmania australia possibly the worlds first when it was built in  it includes a metre  ft bridge span at  metres  ft above the savage river hydrogenedit main article hydrogen pipeline transport hydrogen pipeline transport is a transportation of hydrogen through a pipe as part of the hydrogen infrastructure hydrogen pipeline transport is used to connect the point of hydrogen production or delivery of hydrogen with the point of demand with transport costs similar to cng the technology is proven most hydrogen is produced at the place of demand with every  to  miles  km an industrial production facility the  rhineruhr kilometre  mi hydrogen pipeline is still in operation as of update there are  miles  km of low pressure hydrogen pipelines in the us and  miles  km in europe wateredit main article aqueduct watercourse the los angeles aqueduct in antelope valley two millennia ago the ancient romans made use of large aqueducts to transport water from higher elevations by building the aqueducts in graduated segments that allowed gravity to push the water along until it reached its destination hundreds of these were built throughout europe and elsewhere and along with flour mills were considered the lifeline of the roman empire the ancient chinese also made use of channels and pipe systems for public works the famous han dynasty court eunuch zhang rang d  ad once ordered the engineer bi lan to construct a series of squarepallet chain pumps outside the capital city of luoyang these chain pumps serviced the imperial palaces and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a stoneware pipe system pipelines are useful for transporting water for drinking or irrigation over long distances when it needs to move over hills or where canals or channels are poor choices due to considerations of evaporation pollution or environmental impact the  km  mi goldfields water supply scheme in western australia using  mm  inch pipe and completed in  was the largest water supply scheme of its time

of a network of insulated feed and return pipes which transport heated water pressurized hot water or sometimes steam to the customer while steam is hottest and may be used in industrial processes due to its higher temperature it is less efficient to produce and transport due to greater heat losses heat transfer oils are generally not used for economic and ecological reasons the typical annual loss of thermal energy through distribution is around  as seen in norways district heating network district heating pipelines are normally installed underground with some exceptions within the system heat storage may be installed to even out peak load demands heat is transferred into the central heating of the dwellings through heat exchangers at heat substations without mixing of the fluids in either

ebensee milkedit between  and  a  km milk pipeline ran between the dutch island of ameland and holwerd on the mainland of which  km beneath the wadden sea every day  litres of milk produced on the island were transported to be processed on the mainland in  the milk transport was abandoned marine pipelinesedit main article submarine pipeline in places a pipeline may have to cross water expanses such as small seas straits and rivers in many instances they lie entirely on the seabed these pipelines are referred to as marine pipelines also submarine or offshore pipelines they are used primarily to carry oil or gas but transportation of water is also important in offshore projects a distinction is made between a flowline and a pipeline the former is an intrafield pipeline in the sense that it is used to connect subsea wellheads manifolds and the platform within a particular development field the latter sometimes referred to as an export pipeline is used to bring the resource to shore the construction and maintenance of marine pipelines imply logistical challenges that are different from those onland mainly because of wave and current dynamics along with other geohazards functionsedit in general pipelines can be classified in three categories depending on purpose gathering pipelines group of smaller interconnected pipelines forming complex networks with the purpose of bringing crude oil or natural gas from several nearby wells to a treatment plant or processing facility in this group pipelines are usually short a couple hundred metres and with small diameters subsea pipelines for collecting product from deep water production platforms are also considered gathering systems transportation pipelines mainly long pipes with large diameters moving products oil gas refined products between cities countries and even continents these transportation networks include several compressor stations in gas lines or pump stations for crude and multiproducts pipelines distribution pipelines composed of several interconnected pipelines with small diameters used to take the products to the final consumer feeder lines to distribute gas to homes and businesses downstream pipelines at terminals for distributing products to tanks and storage facilities are included in this groups development and planningedit when a pipeline is built the construction project not only covers the civil engineering work to lay the pipeline and build the pumpcompressor stations it also has to cover all the work related to the installation of the field devices that will support remote operation the pipeline is routed along what is known as a right of way pipelines are generally developed and built using the following stages open season to determine market interest potential customers are given the chance to sign up for part of the new pipelines capacity rights route right of way selection pipeline design the pipeline project may take a number of forms including the construction of a new pipeline conversion of existing pipeline from one fuel type to another or improvements to facilities on a current pipeline route obtaining approval once the design is finalized and the first pipeline customers have purchased their share of capacity the project must be approved by the relevant regulatory agencies surveying the route clearing the route trenching  main route and crossings roads rail other pipes etc installing the pipe installing valves intersections etc covering the pipe and trench testing once construction is completed the new pipeline is subjected to tests to ensure its structural integrity these may include hydrostatic testing and line packing russia has pipeline troops as part of the rear services who are trained to build and repair pipelines russia is the only country to have pipeline troops operationedit field devices are instrumentation data gathering units and communication systems the field instrumentation includes flow pressure and temperature gaugestransmitters and other devices to measure the relevant data required these instruments are installed along the pipeline on some specific locations such as injection or delivery stations pump stations liquid pipelines or compressor stations gas pipelines and block valve stations the information measured by these field instruments is then gathered in local remote terminal units rtu that transfer the field data to a central location in real time using communication systems such as satellite channels microwave links or cellular phone connections pipelines are controlled and operated remotely from what is usually known as the main control room in this center all the data related to field measurement is consolidated in one central database the data is received from multiple rtus along the pipeline it is common to find rtus installed at every station along the pipeline the scada system for pipelines the scada system at the main control room receives all the field data and presents it to the pipeline operator through a set of screens or human machine interface showing the operational conditions of the pipeline the operator can monitor the hydraulic conditions of the line as well as send operational commands openclose valves turn onoff compressors or pumps change setpoints etc through the scada system to the field to optimize and secure the operation of these assets some pipeline companies are using what is called advanced pipeline applications which are software tools installed on top of the scada system that provide extended functionality to perform leak detection leak location batch tracking liquid lines pig tracking composition tracking predictive modeling look ahead modeling and operator training technologyedit componentsedit the trans alaska pipeline crossing under the tanana river and over ridge of the alaska range pipeline networks are composed of several pieces of equipment that operate together to move products from location to location the main elements of a pipeline system are initial injection station known also as supply or inlet station is the beginning of the system where the product is injected into the line storage facilities pumps or compressors are usually located at these locations compressorpump stations pumps for liquid pipelines and compressors for gas pipelines are located along the line to move the product through the pipeline the location of these stations is defined by the topography of the terrain the type of product being transported or operational conditions of the network partial delivery station known also as intermediate stations these facilities allow the pipeline operator to deliver part of the product being transported block valve station these are the first line of protection for pipelines with these valves the operator can isolate any segment of the line for maintenance work or isolate a rupture or leak block valve stations are usually located every  to  miles  km depending on the type of pipeline even though it is not a design rule it is a very usual practice in liquid pipelines the location of these stations depends exclusively on the nature of the product being transported the trajectory of the pipeline andor the operational conditions of the line regulator station this is a special type of valve station where the operator can release some of the pressure from the line regulators are usually located at the downhill side of a peak final delivery station known also as outlet stations or terminals this is where the product will be distributed to the consumer it could be a tank terminal for liquid pipelines or a connection to a distribution network for gas pipelines leak detection systemsedit since oil and gas pipelines are an important asset of the economic development of almost any country it has been required either by government regulations or internal policies to ensure the safety of the assets and the population and environment where these pipelines run pipeline companies face government regulation environmental constraints and social situations government regulations may define minimum staff to run the operation operator training requirements pipeline facilities technology and applications required to ensure operational safety for example in the state of washington it is mandatory for pipeline operators to be able to detect and locate leaks of  percent of maximum flow within fifteen minutes or less social factors also affect the operation of pipelines product theft is sometimes also a problem for pipeline companies in this case the detection levels should be under two percent of maximum flow with a high expectation for location accuracy various technologies and strategies have been implemented for monitoring pipelines from physically walking the lines to satellite surveillance the most common technology to protect pipelines from occasional leaks is computational pipeline monitoring or cpm cpm takes information from the field related to pressures flows and temperatures to estimate the hydraulic behavior of the product being transported once the estimation is completed the results are compared to other field references to detect the presence of an anomaly or unexpected situation which may be related to a leak the american petroleum institute has published several articles related to the performance of cpm in liquids pipelines the api publications are ram  – computational pipeline monitoring for liquids pipelines api  – pipeline variable uncertainties  their effects on leak detectability where a pipeline containing passes under a road or railway it is usually enclosed in a protective casing this casing is vented to the atmosphere to prevent the buildup of flammable gases or corrosive substances and to allow the air inside the casing to be sampled to detect leaks the casing vent a pipe protruding from the ground often doubles as a warning marker called a casing vent marker implementationedit as a rule pipelines for all uses are laid in most cases undergroundcitation needed however in some cases it is necessary to cross a valley or a river on a pipeline bridge pipelines for centralized heating systems are often laid on the ground or overhead pipelines for petroleum running through permafrost areas as transalaskapipeline are often run overhead in order to avoid melting the frozen ground by hot petroleum which would result in sinking the pipeline in the ground maintenanceedit maintenance of pipelines includes checking cathodic protection levels for the proper range surveillance for construction erosion or leaks by foot land vehicle boat or air and running cleaning pigs when there is anything carried in the pipeline that is corrosive us pipeline maintenance rules are covered in code of federal regulationscfr sections  cfr  for natural gas pipelines and  cfr  for petroleum liquid pipelines regulationedit an underground petroleum pipeline running through a park in the us onshore and offshore pipelines used to transport oil and gas are regulated by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa certain offshore pipelines used to produce oil and gas are regulated by the minerals management service mms in canada pipelines are regulated by either the provincial regulators or if they cross provincial boundaries or the canada–us border by the national energy board neb government regulations in canada and the united states require that buried fuel pipelines must be protected from corrosion often the most economical method of corrosion control is by use of pipeline coating in conjunction with cathodic protection and technology to monitor the pipeline above ground cathodic protection is not an option the coating is the only external protection pipelines and geopoliticsedit pipelines for major energy resources petroleum and natural gas are not merely an element of trade they connect to issues of geopolitics and international security as well and the construction placement and control of oil and gas pipelines often figure prominently in state interests and actions a notable example of pipeline politics occurred at the beginning of the year  wherein a dispute between russia and ukraine ostensibly over pricing led to a major political crisis russian stateowned gas company gazprom cut off natural gas supplies to ukraine after talks between it and the ukrainian government fell through in addition to cutting off supplies to ukraine russian gas flowing through ukraine—which included nearly all supplies to southeastern europe and some supplies to central and western europe—was cut off creating a major crisis in several countries heavily dependent on russian gas as fuel russia was accused of using the dispute as leverage in its attempt to keep other powers and particularly the european union from interfering in its near abroad oil and gas pipelines also figure prominently in the politics of central asia and the caucasus hazard identificationedit because the solvent fraction of dilbit typically comprises volatile aromatics like naptha and benzene reasonably rapid carrier vaporization can be expected to follow an aboveground spill—ostensibly enabling timely intervention by leaving only a viscous residue that is slow to migrate effective protocols to minimize exposure to petrochemical vapours are wellestablished and oil spilled from the pipeline would be unlikely to reach the aquifer unless incomplete remediation were followed by the introduction of another carrier eg a series of torrential downpours the introduction of benzene and other volatile organic compounds collectively btex to the subterranean environment compounds the threat posed by a pipeline leak particularly if followed by rain a pipeline breach would result in btex dissolution and equilibration of benzene in water followed by percolation of the admixture into the aquifer benzene can cause many health problems and is carcinogenic with epa maximum contaminant level mcl set at  μgl for potable water although it is not well studied single benzene exposure events have been linked to acute carcinogenesis additionally the exposure of livestock mainly cattle to benzene has been shown to cause many health issues such as neurotoxicity fetal damage and fatal poisoning the entire surface of an aboveground pipeline can be directly examined for material breach pooled petroleum is unambiguous readily spotted and indicates the location of required repairs because the effectiveness of remote inspection is limited by the cost of monitoring equipment gaps between sensors and data that requires interpretation small leaks in buried pipe can sometimes go undetected pipeline developers do not always prioritize effective surveillance against leaks buried pipes draw fewer complaints they are insulated from extremes in ambient temperature they are shielded from ultraviolet rays and they are less exposed to photodegradation buried pipes are isolated from airborne debris electrical storms tornadoes hurricanes hail and acid rain they are protected from nesting birds rutting mammals and wayward buckshot buried pipe is less vulnerable to accident damage eg automobile collisions and less accessible to vandals saboteurs and terrorists exposureedit previous work has shown that a worstcase exposure scenario can be limited to a specific set of conditions based on the advanced detection methods and pipeline shutoff sop developed by transcanada the risk of a substantive or large release over a short period of time contaminating groundwater with benzene is unlikely detection shutoff and remediation procedures would limit the dissolution and transport of benzene therefore the exposure of benzene would be limited to leaks that are below the limit of detection and go unnoticed for extended periods of time leak detection is monitored through a scada system that assesses pressure and volume flow every  seconds a pinhole leak that releases small quantities that cannot be detected by the scada system  flow could accumulate into a substantive spill detection of pinhole leaks would come from a visual or olfactory inspection aerial surveying or massbalance inconsistencies it is assumed that pinhole leaks are discovered within the day inspection interval however snow cover and location eg remote deep could delay detection benzene typically makes up  –  of oil and will have varying degrees of volatility and dissolution based on environmental factors even with pipeline leak volumes within scada detection limits sometimes pipeline leaks are misinterpreted by pipeline operators to be pump malfunctions or other problems the enbridge line b crude oil pipeline failure in marshall michigan on july   was thought by operators in edmonton to be from column separation of the dilbit in that pipeline the leak in wetlands along the kalamazoo river was only confirmed  hours after it happened by a local gas company employee in michigan spill frequencyvolumeedit although the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa has standard baseline incident frequencies to estimate the number of spills transcanada altered these assumptions based on improved pipeline design operation and safety whether these adjustments are justified is debatable as these assumptions resulted in a nearly fold decrease in spill estimates given that the pipeline crosses  miles of the ogallala aquifer or  of the entire pipeline length and the year life of the entire pipeline is expected to have between  –  spills approximately  –  spills can be expected to occur over the aquifer an estimate of  spills over the aquifer each lasting  days results in  days of potential exposure over the  year lifetime of the pipeline in the reduced scope ‘worst case exposure scenario’ the volume of a pinhole leak at  of max flowrate for  days has been estimated at  barrels or  million gallons of oil according to phmsa’s incident database only  of all spills in the last  years were  barrels benzene fate and transportedit scenario for benzene leaching to groundwater benzene is considered a light aromatic hydrocarbon with high solubility and high volatilityclarification needed it is unclear how temperature and depth would impact the volatility of benzene so assumptions have been made that benzene in oil  weight by volume would not volatilize before equilibrating with water using the octanolwater partition coefficient and a year precipitation event for the area a worstcase estimate of  mgl of benzene is anticipated to flow toward the aquifer the actual movement of the plume through groundwater systems is not well described although one estimate is that up to  billion gallons of water in the ogallala aquifer could become contaminated with benzene at concentrations above the mcl the final environmental impact statement from the state department does not include a quantitative analysis because it assumed that most benzene will volatilize previous dilbit spill remediation difficultiesedit one of the major concerns about dilbit is the difficulty in cleaning it up enbridges line b a inch crude oil pipeline ruptured in marshall michigan on july   mentioned above spilled at least  gallons of dilbit after detection of the leak booms and vacuum trucks were deployed heavy rains caused the river to overtop existing dams and carried dilbit  miles downstream before the

pipeline were in three countries pipeline and gas journal’s worldwide survey figures indicate that  miles  km of pipelines are planned and under construction of these  miles  km represent projects in the planning and design phase  miles  km reflect pipelines in various stages of construction liquids and gases are transported in pipelines and any chemically stable substance can be sent through a pipeline pipelines exist for the transport of crude and refined petroleum fuels  such as oil natural gas and biofuels  and other fluids including sewage slurry water and beer pipelines are useful for transporting water for drinking or irrigation over long distances when it needs to move over hills or where canals or channels are poor choices due to considerations of evaporation pollution or environmental impact pneumatic tubes using compressed air can be used to transport solid capsules oil pipelines are made from steel or plastic tubes which are usually buried the oil is moved through the pipelines by pump stations along the pipeline natural gas and similar gaseous fuels are lightly pressurised into liquids known as natural gas liquids ngls natural gas pipelines are constructed of

launcherreceiver belonging to the natural gas pipeline in switzerland it is uncertain when the first crude oil pipeline was built credit for the development of pipeline transport is disputed with competing claims for vladimir shukhov and the branobel company in the late th century and the oil transport association which first constructed a inch  mm wrought iron pipeline over a mile  km track from an oil field in pennsylvania to a railroad station in oil creek in the s pipelines are generally the most economical way to transport large quantities of oil refined oil products or natural gas over land natural gas and similar gaseous fuels are lightly pressurized into liquids knows as natural gas liquids ngls small ngl processing facilities can be located in oil fields so the butane and propane liquid under light pressure of  pounds per square inch  kpa can be shipped by rail truck or pipeline propane can be used as a fuel in oil fields to heat various facilities used by the oil drillers or equipment and trucks used in the oil patch eg propane will convert from a gas to a liquid under light pressure  psi give or take depending on temperature and is pumped into cars and trucks at less than  psi  kpa at retail stations pipelines and rail cars use about double that pressure to pump at  psi  kpa the distance to ship propane to markets is much shorter as thousands of naturalgas processing plants are located in or near oil fields many bakken basin oil companies in north dakota montana manitoba and saskatchewan gas fields separate the ngls in the field allowing the drillers to sell propane directly to small wholesalers eliminating the large refinery control of product and prices for propane or butane the most recent major pipeline to start operating in north america is a transcanada natural gas line going north across the niagara region bridges with marcellus shale gas from pennsylvania and others tied in methane or natural gas sources into the canadian province of ontario as of the fall of  supplying  percent of all the natural gas used in ontario major russian gas pipelines to europe in  this new us supplied natural gas displaces the natural gas formerly shipped to ontario from western canada in alberta and manitoba thus dropping the government regulated pipeline shipping charges because of the significantly shorter distance from gas source to consumer compared to shipping by railroad pipelines have lower cost per unit and higher capacity pipelines are preferable to transportation by truck for a number of reasons employment on completed pipelines represents only  of that of the trucking industry to avoid delays and us government regulation many small medium and large oil producers in north dakota have decided to run an oil pipeline north to canada to meet up with a canadian oil pipeline shipping oil from west to east this allows the bakken basin and three forks oil producers to get higher negotiated prices for their oil because they will not be restricted to just one wholesale market in the us the distance from the biggest oil patch in north dakota in williston north dakota is only about  miles or  kilometers to the canada–us border and manitoba mutual funds and joint ventures are big investors in new oil and gas pipelines in the fall of  the us began exporting propane to europe known as lpg as wholesale prices there are much higher than in north america additionally a pipeline is currently being constructed from north dakota to illinois commonly known as the dakota access pipeline as more north american pipelines are built even more exports of lng propane butane and other natural gas products occur on all three us coasts to give insight north dakota bakken regions oil production has grown by  from  to  north dakota oil companies are shipping huge amounts of oil by tanker rail car as they can direct the oil to the market that gives the best price and rail cars can be used to avoid a congested oil pipeline to get the oil to a different pipeline in order to get the oil to market faster or to a different less busy oil refinery however pipelines provide a cheaper means to transport by volume enbridge in canada is applying to reverse an oil pipeline going from easttowest line  and expanding it and using it to ship western canadian bitumen oil eastward from a presently rated  barrels equivalent per day pipeline it will be expanded to between one million to  million barrels per day it will bring western oil to refineries in ontario michigan ohio pennsylvania quebec and new york by early  new brunswick will also refine some of this western canadian crude and export some crude and refined oil to europe from its deep water oil ulcc loading port although pipelines can be built under the sea that process is economically and technically demanding so the majority of oil at sea is transported by tanker ships the enbridge sandpiper pipeline is proposed to transfer valuable oil from western north dakota through northwestern minnesota the pipeline will be  inches in diameter it will carry over  barrels of oil a day with a volatility of  growth of marketedit gas pipe in the

are made from steel or plastic tubes with inner diameter typically from  to  inches  to  mm most pipelines are typically buried at a depth of about  to  feet  to  m to protect pipes from impact abrasion and corrosion a variety of methods are used these can include wood lagging wood slats concrete coating rockshield highdensity polyethylene imported sand padding and padding machines crude oil contains varying amounts of paraffin wax and in colder climates wax buildup may occur within a pipeline often these pipelines are inspected and cleaned using pigging the practice of using devices known as pigs to perform various maintenance operations on a pipeline the devices are also known as scrapers or godevils smart pigs also known as intelligent or intelligence pigs are used to detect anomalies in the pipe such as dents metal loss caused by corrosion cracking or other mechanical damage these devices are launched from piglauncher stations and travel through the pipeline to be received at any other station downstream either cleaning wax deposits and material that may have accumulated inside the line or inspecting and recording the condition of the line for natural gas pipelines are constructed of carbon steel and vary in size from  to  inches  to  mm in diameter depending on the type of pipeline the gas is pressurized by compressor stations and is odorless unless mixed with a mercaptan odorant where required by a regulating authority ammoniaedit the worlds longest ammonia pipeline from russia to ukraine highly toxic ammonia is theoretically the most dangerous substance to be transported through longdistance pipelinescitation needed however incidents on ammoniatransporting lines are uncommon  unlike on industrial ammoniaprocessing equipmentcitation needed a major ammonia pipeline is the ukrainian transammiak line connecting the togliattiazot facility in russia to the exporting black seaport of odessa alcohol fuelsedit see also biobutanol pipelines have been used for transportation of ethanol in brazil and there are several ethanol pipeline projects in brazil and the united states the main problems related to the transport of ethanol by pipeline are its corrosive nature and tendency to absorb water and impurities in pipelines which are not problems with oil and natural gas insufficient volumes and costeffectiveness are other considerations limiting construction of ethanol pipelines coal and oreedit slurry pipelines are sometimes used to transport coal or ore from mines the material to be transported is closely mixed with water before being introduced to the pipeline at the far end the material must be dried one example is a kilometre  mi slurry pipeline which is planned to transport iron ore from the minasrio mine producing  million tonnes per year to the port of açu in brazil an existing example is the kilometre  mi savage river slurry pipeline in tasmania australia possibly the worlds first when it was built in  it

valley two millennia ago the ancient romans made use of large aqueducts to transport water from higher elevations by building the aqueducts in graduated segments that allowed gravity to push the water along until it reached its destination hundreds of these were built throughout europe and elsewhere and along with flour mills were considered the lifeline of the roman empire the ancient chinese also made use of channels and pipe systems for public works the famous han dynasty court eunuch zhang rang d  ad once ordered the engineer bi lan to construct a series of squarepallet chain pumps outside the capital city of luoyang these chain pumps serviced the imperial palaces and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a stoneware pipe system

island were transported to be processed on the mainland in  the milk transport was abandoned marine pipelinesedit main article submarine pipeline in places a pipeline may have to cross water expanses such as small seas straits and rivers in many instances they lie entirely on the seabed these pipelines are referred to as marine pipelines also submarine or offshore pipelines they are used primarily to carry oil or gas but transportation of water is also important in offshore projects a distinction is made between a flowline and a pipeline the former is an intrafield pipeline in the sense that it is used to connect subsea wellheads manifolds and the platform within a particular development field the latter sometimes referred to as an export pipeline is used to bring the resource to shore the construction and maintenance of marine pipelines imply logistical challenges that are different from those onland mainly because of wave and current dynamics along with other geohazards functionsedit in general pipelines can be classified in three categories depending on purpose gathering pipelines group of smaller interconnected pipelines forming complex networks with the purpose of bringing crude oil or natural gas from several nearby wells to a treatment plant or processing facility in this group pipelines are usually short a couple hundred metres and with small diameters subsea pipelines for collecting product from deep water production platforms are also considered gathering systems transportation pipelines mainly long pipes with large diameters moving products oil gas refined products between cities countries and even continents these transportation networks include several compressor stations in gas lines or pump stations for crude and multiproducts pipelines distribution pipelines composed of several interconnected pipelines with small diameters used to take the products to the final consumer feeder lines to distribute gas to homes and businesses downstream pipelines at terminals for distributing products to tanks and storage facilities are included in this groups development and planningedit when a pipeline is built the construction project not only covers the civil engineering work to lay the pipeline and build the pumpcompressor stations it also has to cover all the work related to the installation of the field devices that will support remote operation the pipeline is routed along what is known as a right of way pipelines are generally developed and built using the following stages open season to determine market interest potential customers are given the chance to sign up for part of the new pipelines capacity rights route right of way selection pipeline design the pipeline project may take a number of forms including the construction of a new pipeline conversion of existing pipeline from one fuel type to another or improvements to facilities on a current pipeline route obtaining approval once the design is finalized and the first pipeline customers have purchased their share of capacity the project must be approved by the relevant regulatory agencies surveying the route clearing the route trenching  main route and crossings roads rail other pipes etc installing the pipe installing valves intersections etc covering the pipe and trench testing once construction is completed the new pipeline is subjected to tests to ensure its structural integrity these may include hydrostatic testing and line packing russia has pipeline troops as part of the rear services who are trained to build and repair pipelines russia is the only country to have pipeline troops operationedit field devices are instrumentation data gathering units and communication systems the field instrumentation includes flow pressure and temperature gaugestransmitters and other devices to measure the relevant data required these instruments are installed along the pipeline on some specific locations such as injection or delivery stations pump stations liquid pipelines or compressor stations gas pipelines and block valve stations the information measured by these field instruments is then gathered in local remote terminal units rtu that transfer the field data to a central location in real time using communication systems such as satellite channels microwave links or cellular phone connections pipelines are controlled and operated remotely from what is usually known as the main control room in this center all the data related to field measurement is consolidated in one central database the data is received from multiple rtus along the pipeline it is common to find rtus installed at every station along the pipeline the scada system for pipelines the scada system at the main control room receives all the field data and presents it to the pipeline operator through a set of screens or human machine interface showing the operational conditions of the pipeline the operator can monitor the hydraulic conditions of the line as well as send operational commands openclose valves turn onoff compressors or pumps change setpoints etc through the scada system to the field to optimize and secure the operation of these assets some pipeline companies are using what is called advanced pipeline applications which are software tools installed on top of the scada system that provide extended functionality to perform leak detection leak location batch tracking liquid lines pig tracking composition tracking predictive modeling look ahead modeling and operator training technologyedit componentsedit the trans alaska pipeline crossing under the tanana river and over ridge of the alaska range pipeline networks are composed of several pieces of equipment that operate together to move products from location to location the main elements of a pipeline system are initial injection station known also as supply or inlet station is the beginning of the system where the product is injected into the line storage facilities pumps or compressors are usually located at these locations compressorpump stations pumps for liquid pipelines and compressors for gas pipelines are located along the line to move the product through the pipeline the location of these stations is defined by the topography of the terrain the type of product being transported or operational conditions of the network partial delivery station known also as intermediate stations these facilities allow the pipeline operator to deliver part of the product being transported block valve station these are the first line of protection for pipelines with these valves the operator can isolate any segment of the line for maintenance work or isolate a rupture or leak block valve stations are usually located every  to  miles  km depending on the type of pipeline even though it is not a design rule it is a very usual practice in liquid pipelines the location of these stations depends exclusively on the nature of the product being transported the trajectory of the pipeline andor the operational conditions of the line regulator station this is a special type of valve station where the operator can release some of the pressure from the line regulators are usually located at the downhill side of a peak final delivery station known also as outlet stations or terminals this is where the product will be distributed to the consumer it could be a tank terminal for liquid pipelines or a connection to a distribution network for gas pipelines leak detection systemsedit since oil and gas pipelines are an important asset of the economic development of almost any country it has been required either by government regulations or internal policies to ensure the safety of the assets and the population and environment where these pipelines run pipeline companies face government regulation environmental constraints and social situations government regulations may define minimum staff to run the operation operator training requirements pipeline facilities technology and applications required to ensure operational safety for example in the state of washington it is mandatory for pipeline operators to be able to detect and locate leaks of  percent of maximum flow within fifteen minutes or less social factors also affect the operation of pipelines product theft is sometimes also a problem for pipeline companies in this case the detection levels should be under two percent of maximum flow with a high expectation for location accuracy various technologies and strategies have been implemented for monitoring pipelines from physically walking the lines to satellite surveillance the most common technology to protect pipelines from occasional leaks is computational pipeline monitoring or cpm cpm takes information from the field related to pressures flows and temperatures to estimate the hydraulic behavior of the product being transported once the estimation is completed the results are compared to other field references to detect the presence of an anomaly or unexpected situation which may be related to a leak the american petroleum institute has published several articles related to the performance of cpm in liquids pipelines the api publications are ram  – computational pipeline monitoring for liquids pipelines api  – pipeline variable uncertainties  their effects on leak detectability where a pipeline containing passes under a road or railway it is usually enclosed in a protective casing this casing is vented to the atmosphere to prevent the buildup of flammable gases or corrosive substances and to allow the air inside the casing to be sampled to detect leaks the casing vent a pipe protruding from the ground often doubles as a warning marker called a casing vent marker implementationedit as a rule pipelines for all uses are laid in most cases undergroundcitation needed however in some cases it is necessary to cross a valley or a river on a pipeline bridge pipelines for centralized heating systems are often laid on the ground or overhead pipelines for petroleum running through permafrost areas as transalaskapipeline are often run overhead in order to avoid melting the frozen ground by hot petroleum which would result in sinking the pipeline in the ground maintenanceedit maintenance of pipelines includes checking cathodic protection levels for the proper range surveillance for construction erosion or leaks by foot land vehicle boat or air and running cleaning pigs when there is anything carried in the pipeline that is corrosive us pipeline maintenance rules are covered in code of federal regulationscfr sections  cfr  for natural gas pipelines and  cfr  for petroleum liquid pipelines regulationedit an underground petroleum pipeline running through a park in the us onshore and offshore pipelines used to transport oil and gas are regulated by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa certain offshore pipelines used to produce oil and gas are regulated by the minerals management service mms in canada pipelines are regulated by either the provincial regulators or if they cross provincial boundaries or the canada–us border by the national energy board neb government regulations in canada and the united states require that buried fuel pipelines must be protected from corrosion often the most economical method of corrosion control is by use of pipeline coating in conjunction with cathodic protection and technology to monitor the pipeline above ground cathodic protection is not an option the coating is the only external protection pipelines and geopoliticsedit pipelines for major energy resources petroleum and natural gas are not merely an element of trade they connect to issues of geopolitics and international security as well and the construction placement and control of oil and gas pipelines often figure prominently in state interests and actions a notable example of pipeline politics occurred at the beginning of the year  wherein a dispute between russia and ukraine ostensibly over pricing led to a major political crisis russian stateowned gas company gazprom cut off natural gas supplies to ukraine after talks between it and the ukrainian government fell through in addition to cutting off supplies to ukraine russian gas flowing through ukraine—which included nearly all supplies to southeastern europe and some supplies to central and western europe—was cut off creating a major crisis in several countries heavily dependent on russian gas as fuel russia was accused of using the dispute as leverage in its attempt to keep other powers and particularly the european union from interfering in its near abroad oil and gas pipelines also figure prominently in the politics of central asia and the caucasus hazard identificationedit because the solvent fraction of dilbit typically comprises volatile aromatics like naptha and benzene reasonably rapid carrier vaporization can be expected to follow an aboveground spill—ostensibly enabling timely intervention by leaving only a viscous residue that is slow to migrate effective protocols to minimize exposure to petrochemical vapours are wellestablished and oil spilled from the pipeline would be unlikely to reach the aquifer unless incomplete remediation were followed by the introduction of another carrier eg a series of torrential downpours the introduction of benzene and other volatile organic compounds collectively btex to the subterranean environment compounds the threat posed by a pipeline leak particularly if followed by rain a pipeline breach would result in btex dissolution and equilibration of benzene in water followed by percolation of the admixture into the aquifer benzene can cause many health problems and is carcinogenic with epa maximum contaminant level mcl set at  μgl for potable water although it is not well studied single benzene exposure events have been linked to acute carcinogenesis additionally the exposure of livestock mainly cattle to benzene has been shown to cause many health issues such as neurotoxicity fetal damage and fatal poisoning the entire surface of an aboveground pipeline can be directly examined for material breach pooled petroleum is unambiguous readily spotted and indicates the location of required repairs because the effectiveness of remote inspection is limited by the cost of monitoring equipment gaps between sensors and data that requires interpretation small leaks in buried pipe can sometimes go undetected pipeline developers do not always prioritize effective surveillance against leaks buried pipes draw fewer complaints they are insulated from extremes in ambient temperature they are shielded from ultraviolet rays and they are less exposed to photodegradation buried pipes are isolated from airborne debris electrical storms tornadoes hurricanes hail and acid rain they are protected from nesting birds rutting mammals and wayward buckshot buried pipe is less vulnerable to accident damage eg automobile collisions and less accessible to vandals saboteurs and terrorists exposureedit previous work has shown that a worstcase exposure scenario can be limited to a specific set of conditions based on the advanced detection methods and pipeline shutoff sop developed by transcanada the risk of a substantive or large release over a short period of time contaminating groundwater with benzene is unlikely detection shutoff and remediation procedures would limit the dissolution and transport of benzene therefore the exposure of benzene would be limited to leaks that are below the limit of detection and go unnoticed for extended periods of time leak detection is monitored through a scada system that assesses pressure and volume flow every  seconds a pinhole leak that releases small quantities that cannot be detected by the scada system  flow could accumulate into a substantive spill detection of pinhole leaks would come from a visual or olfactory inspection aerial surveying or massbalance inconsistencies it is assumed that pinhole leaks are discovered within the day inspection interval however snow cover and location eg remote deep could delay detection benzene typically makes up  –  of oil and will have varying degrees of volatility and dissolution based on environmental factors even with pipeline leak volumes within scada detection limits sometimes pipeline leaks are misinterpreted by pipeline operators to be pump malfunctions or other problems the enbridge line b crude oil pipeline failure in marshall michigan on july   was thought by operators in edmonton to be from column separation of the dilbit in that pipeline the leak in wetlands along the kalamazoo river was only confirmed  hours after it happened by a local gas company employee in michigan spill frequencyvolumeedit although the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa has standard baseline incident frequencies to estimate the number of spills transcanada altered these assumptions based on improved pipeline design operation and safety whether these adjustments are justified is debatable as these assumptions resulted in a nearly fold decrease in spill estimates given that the pipeline crosses  miles of the ogallala aquifer or  of the entire pipeline length and the year life of the entire pipeline is expected to have between  –  spills approximately  –  spills can be expected to occur over the aquifer an estimate of  spills over the aquifer each lasting  days results in  days of potential exposure over the  year lifetime of the pipeline in the reduced scope ‘worst case exposure scenario’ the volume of a pinhole leak at  of max flowrate for  days has been estimated at  barrels or  million gallons of oil according to phmsa’s incident database only  of all spills in the last  years were  barrels benzene fate and transportedit scenario for benzene leaching to groundwater benzene is considered a light aromatic hydrocarbon with high solubility and high volatilityclarification needed it is unclear how temperature and depth would impact the volatility of benzene so assumptions have been made that benzene in oil  weight by volume would not volatilize before equilibrating with water using the octanolwater partition coefficient and a year precipitation event for the area a worstcase estimate of  mgl of benzene is anticipated to flow toward the aquifer the actual movement of the plume through groundwater systems is not well described although one estimate is that up to  billion gallons of water in the ogallala aquifer could become contaminated with benzene at concentrations above the mcl the final environmental impact statement from the state department does not include a quantitative analysis because it assumed that most benzene will volatilize previous dilbit spill remediation difficultiesedit one of the major concerns about dilbit is the difficulty in cleaning it up enbridges line b a inch crude oil pipeline ruptured in marshall michigan on july   mentioned above spilled at least  gallons of dilbit after detection of the leak booms and vacuum trucks were deployed heavy rains caused the river to overtop existing dams and carried dilbit  miles downstream before the

the planning and design phase  miles  km reflect pipelines in various stages of construction liquids and gases are transported in pipelines and any chemically stable substance can be sent through a pipeline pipelines exist for the transport of crude and refined petroleum fuels  such as oil natural gas and biofuels  and other fluids including sewage slurry water and beer pipelines are useful for transporting water for drinking or irrigation over long distances when it needs to move over hills or where canals or channels are poor choices due to considerations of evaporation pollution or environmental impact pneumatic tubes using compressed air can be used to transport solid capsules oil pipelines are made from steel or plastic tubes which are usually buried the oil is moved through the pipelines by pump stations along the pipeline natural gas and similar gaseous fuels are lightly pressurised into liquids known as natural gas liquids ngls natural gas pipelines are constructed of carbon steel highly toxic ammonia is theoretically the most dangerous substance to be transported through longdistance pipelines but accidents have been rare hydrogen pipeline transport is the

launcherreceiver belonging to the natural gas pipeline in switzerland it is uncertain when the first crude oil pipeline was built credit for the development of pipeline transport is disputed with competing claims for vladimir shukhov and the branobel company in the late th century and the oil transport association which first constructed a inch  mm wrought iron pipeline over a mile  km track from an oil field in pennsylvania to a railroad station in oil creek in the s pipelines are generally the most economical way to transport large quantities of oil refined oil products or natural gas over land natural gas and similar gaseous fuels are lightly pressurized into liquids knows as natural gas liquids ngls small ngl processing facilities can be located in oil fields so the butane and propane liquid under light pressure of  pounds per square inch  kpa can be shipped by rail truck or pipeline propane can be used as a fuel in oil fields to heat various facilities used by the oil drillers or equipment and trucks used in the oil patch eg propane will convert from a gas to a liquid under light pressure  psi give or take depending on temperature and is pumped into cars and trucks at less than  psi  kpa at retail stations pipelines and rail cars use about double that pressure to pump at  psi  kpa the distance to ship propane to markets is much shorter as thousands of naturalgas processing plants are located in or near oil fields many bakken basin oil companies in north dakota montana manitoba and saskatchewan gas fields separate the ngls in the field allowing the drillers to sell propane directly to small wholesalers eliminating the large refinery control of product and prices for propane or butane the most recent major pipeline to start operating in north america is a transcanada natural gas line going north across the niagara region bridges with marcellus shale gas from pennsylvania and others tied in methane or natural gas sources into the canadian province of ontario as of the fall of  supplying  percent of all the natural gas used in ontario major russian gas pipelines to europe in  this new us supplied natural gas displaces the natural gas formerly shipped to ontario from western canada in alberta and manitoba thus dropping the government regulated pipeline shipping charges because of the significantly shorter distance from gas source to consumer compared to shipping by railroad pipelines have lower cost per unit and higher capacity pipelines are preferable to transportation by truck for a number of reasons employment on completed pipelines represents only  of that of the trucking industry to avoid delays and us government regulation many small medium and large oil producers in north dakota have decided to run an oil pipeline north to canada to meet up with a canadian oil pipeline shipping oil from west to east this allows the bakken basin and three forks oil producers to get higher negotiated prices for their oil because they will not be restricted to just one wholesale market in the us the distance from the biggest oil patch in north dakota in williston north dakota is only about  miles or  kilometers to the canada–us border and manitoba mutual funds and joint ventures are big investors in new oil and gas pipelines in the fall of  the us began exporting propane to europe known as lpg as wholesale prices there are much higher than in north america additionally a pipeline is currently being constructed from north dakota to illinois commonly known as the dakota access pipeline as more north american pipelines are built even more exports of lng propane butane and other natural gas products occur on all three us coasts to give insight north dakota bakken regions oil production has grown by  from  to  north dakota oil companies are shipping huge amounts of oil by tanker rail car as they can direct the oil to the market that gives the best price and rail cars can be used to avoid a congested oil pipeline to get the oil to a different pipeline in order to get the oil to market faster or to a different less busy oil refinery however pipelines provide a cheaper means to transport by volume enbridge in canada is applying to reverse an oil pipeline going from easttowest line  and expanding it and using it to ship western canadian bitumen oil eastward from a presently rated  barrels equivalent per day pipeline it will be expanded to between one million to  million barrels per day it will bring western oil to refineries in ontario michigan ohio pennsylvania quebec and new york by early  new brunswick will also refine some of this western canadian crude and export some crude and refined oil to europe from its deep water oil ulcc loading port although pipelines can be built under the sea that process is economically and technically demanding so the majority of oil at sea is transported by tanker ships the enbridge sandpiper pipeline is proposed to transfer valuable oil from western north dakota through northwestern minnesota the pipeline will be  inches in diameter it will carry over  barrels of oil a day with a volatility of  growth of marketedit gas pipe in the

are made from steel or plastic tubes with inner diameter typically from  to  inches  to  mm most pipelines are typically buried at a depth of about  to  feet  to  m to protect pipes from impact abrasion and corrosion a variety of methods are used these can include wood lagging wood slats concrete coating rockshield highdensity polyethylene imported sand padding and padding machines crude oil contains varying amounts of paraffin wax and in colder climates wax buildup may occur within a pipeline often these pipelines are inspected and cleaned using pigging the practice of using devices known as pigs to perform various maintenance operations on a pipeline the devices are also known as scrapers or godevils smart pigs also known as intelligent or intelligence pigs are used to detect anomalies in the pipe such as dents metal loss caused by corrosion cracking or other mechanical damage these devices are launched from piglauncher stations and travel through the pipeline to be received at any other station downstream either cleaning wax deposits and material that may have accumulated inside the line or inspecting and recording the condition of the line for natural gas pipelines are constructed of carbon steel and vary in size from  to  inches  to  mm in diameter depending on the type of pipeline the gas is pressurized by compressor stations and is odorless unless mixed with a mercaptan odorant where required by a regulating authority ammoniaedit the worlds longest ammonia pipeline from russia to ukraine highly toxic ammonia is theoretically the most dangerous substance to be transported through longdistance pipelinescitation needed however incidents on ammoniatransporting lines are uncommon  unlike on industrial ammoniaprocessing equipmentcitation needed a major ammonia pipeline is the ukrainian transammiak line connecting the togliattiazot facility in russia to the exporting black seaport of odessa alcohol fuelsedit see also biobutanol pipelines have been used for transportation of ethanol in brazil and there are several ethanol pipeline projects in brazil and the united states the main problems related to the transport of ethanol by pipeline are its corrosive nature and tendency to absorb water and impurities in pipelines which are not problems with oil and natural gas insufficient volumes and costeffectiveness are other considerations limiting construction of ethanol pipelines coal and oreedit slurry pipelines are sometimes used to transport coal or ore from mines the material to be transported is closely mixed with water before being introduced to the pipeline at the far end the material must be dried one example is a kilometre  mi slurry pipeline which is planned to transport iron ore from the minasrio mine producing  million tonnes per year to the port of açu in brazil an existing example is the kilometre  mi savage river slurry pipeline in tasmania australia possibly the worlds first when it was built in  it includes a metre  ft bridge span at  metres  ft above the savage river hydrogenedit main article hydrogen pipeline transport hydrogen pipeline transport is a transportation of hydrogen through a pipe as part of the hydrogen infrastructure hydrogen pipeline transport is used to connect the point of hydrogen production or delivery of hydrogen with the point of demand with transport costs similar to cng the technology is proven most hydrogen is produced at the place of demand with every  to  miles  km an industrial production facility the  rhineruhr kilometre  mi hydrogen pipeline is still in operation as of update there are  miles  km of low pressure hydrogen pipelines in the us and  miles  km in europe wateredit main article aqueduct watercourse the los angeles aqueduct in antelope valley two millennia ago the ancient romans made use of large aqueducts to transport water from higher elevations by building the aqueducts in graduated segments that allowed gravity to push the water along until it reached its destination hundreds of these were built throughout europe and elsewhere and along with flour mills were considered the lifeline of the roman empire the ancient chinese also made use of channels and pipe systems for public works the famous han dynasty court eunuch zhang rang d  ad once ordered the engineer bi lan to construct a series of squarepallet chain pumps outside the capital city of luoyang these chain pumps serviced the imperial palaces and living quarters of the capital city as the water lifted by the chain pumps was brought in by a stoneware pipe system pipelines are useful for transporting water for drinking or irrigation over long distances when it needs to move over hills or where canals or channels are poor choices due to considerations of evaporation pollution or environmental impact the  km  mi goldfields water supply scheme in western australia using  mm  inch pipe and completed in  was the largest water supply scheme of its time examples of significant water pipelines in south australia are the morganwhyalla pipelne completed  and mannumadelaide completed  pipelines both part of the larger snowy mountains scheme there are two los angeles california aqueducts the owens valley aqueduct completed  and the second los angeles aqueduct completed  which also include extensive use of pipelines the great manmade river of libya supplies  cubic metres  cu yd of water each day to tripoli benghazi sirte and several other cities in libya the pipeline is over  kilometres  mi long and is connected to wells tapping an aquifer over  metres  ft underground other systemsedit district heatingedit district heating pipeline in austria with a length of  km  main article district heating district heating or teleheating systems consist of a network of insulated feed and return pipes which transport heated water pressurized hot water or sometimes steam to the customer while steam is hottest and may be used in industrial processes due to its higher temperature it is less efficient to produce and transport due to greater heat losses heat transfer oils are generally not used for economic and ecological reasons the typical annual loss of thermal energy through distribution is around  as seen in norways district heating network district heating pipelines are normally installed underground with some exceptions within the system heat storage may be installed to even out peak load demands heat is transferred into the central heating of the dwellings through heat exchangers at heat substations without mixing of the fluids in either system beeredit thor pipeline in randers denmark bars in the veltinsarena a major football ground in gelsenkirchen germany are interconnected by a kilometre  mi long beer pipeline in randers city in denmark the socalled thor beer pipeline was operated originally copper pipes ran directly from the brewery but when the brewery moved out of the city in the s thor beer replaced it with a giant tank a threekilometer beer pipeline was completed in bruges belgium in september  to reduce truck traffic on the city streets brineedit the village of hallstatt in austria which is known for its long history of salt mining claims to contain the oldest industrial pipeline in the world dating back to  it was constructed from  hollowedout tree trunks to transport brine  kilometres  mi from hallstatt to ebensee milkedit between  and  a  km milk pipeline ran between the dutch island of ameland and holwerd on the mainland of which  km beneath the wadden sea every day  litres of milk produced on the island were transported to be processed on the mainland in  the milk transport was abandoned marine pipelinesedit main article submarine pipeline in places a pipeline may have to cross water expanses such as small seas straits and rivers in many instances they lie entirely on the seabed these pipelines are referred to as marine pipelines also submarine or offshore pipelines they are used primarily to carry oil or gas but transportation of water is also important in offshore projects a distinction is made between a flowline and a pipeline the former is an intrafield pipeline in the sense that it is used to connect subsea wellheads manifolds and the platform within a particular development field the latter sometimes referred to as an export pipeline is used to bring the resource to shore the construction and maintenance of marine pipelines imply logistical challenges that are different from those onland mainly because of wave and current dynamics along with other geohazards functionsedit in general pipelines can be classified in three categories depending on purpose gathering pipelines group of smaller interconnected pipelines forming complex networks with the purpose of bringing crude oil or natural gas from several nearby wells to a treatment plant or processing facility in this group pipelines are usually short a couple hundred metres and with small diameters subsea pipelines for collecting product from deep water production platforms are also considered gathering systems transportation pipelines mainly long pipes with large diameters moving products oil gas refined products between cities countries and even continents these transportation networks include several compressor stations in gas lines or pump stations for crude and multiproducts pipelines distribution pipelines composed of several interconnected pipelines with small diameters used to take the products to the final consumer feeder lines to distribute gas to homes and businesses downstream pipelines at terminals for distributing products to tanks and storage facilities are included in this groups development and planningedit when a pipeline is built the construction project not only covers the civil engineering work to lay the pipeline and build the pumpcompressor stations it also has to cover all the work related to the installation of the field devices that will support remote operation the pipeline is routed along what is known as a right of way pipelines are generally developed and built using the following stages open season to determine market interest potential customers are given the chance to sign up for part of the new pipelines capacity rights route right of way selection pipeline design the pipeline project may take a number of forms including the construction of a new pipeline conversion of existing pipeline from one fuel type to another or improvements to facilities on a current pipeline route obtaining approval once the design is finalized and the first pipeline customers have purchased their share of capacity the project must be approved by the relevant regulatory agencies surveying the route clearing the route trenching  main route and crossings roads rail other pipes etc installing the pipe installing valves intersections etc covering the pipe and trench testing once construction is completed the new pipeline is subjected to tests to ensure its structural integrity these may include hydrostatic testing and line packing russia has pipeline troops as part of the rear services who are trained to build and repair pipelines russia is the only country to have pipeline troops operationedit field devices are instrumentation data gathering units and communication systems the field instrumentation includes flow pressure and temperature gaugestransmitters and other devices to measure the relevant data required these instruments are installed along the pipeline on some specific locations such as injection or delivery stations pump stations liquid pipelines or compressor stations gas pipelines and block valve stations the information measured by these field instruments is then gathered in local remote terminal units rtu that transfer the field data to a central location in real time using communication systems such as satellite channels microwave links or cellular phone connections pipelines are controlled and operated remotely from what is usually known as the main control room in this center all the data related to field measurement is consolidated in one central database the data is received from multiple rtus along the pipeline it is common to find rtus installed at every station along the pipeline the scada system for pipelines the scada system at the main control room receives all the field data and presents it to the pipeline operator through a set of screens or human machine interface showing the operational conditions of the pipeline the operator can monitor the hydraulic conditions of the line as well as send operational commands openclose valves turn onoff compressors or pumps change setpoints etc through the scada system to the field to optimize and secure the operation of these assets some pipeline companies are using what is called advanced pipeline applications which are software tools installed on top of the scada system that provide extended functionality to perform leak detection leak location batch tracking liquid lines pig tracking composition tracking predictive modeling look ahead modeling and operator training technologyedit componentsedit the trans alaska pipeline crossing under the tanana river and over ridge of the alaska range pipeline networks are composed of several pieces of equipment that operate together to move products from location to location the main elements of a pipeline system are initial injection station known also as supply or inlet station is the beginning of the system where the product is injected into the line storage facilities pumps or compressors are usually located at these locations compressorpump stations pumps for liquid pipelines and compressors for gas pipelines are located along the line to move the product through the pipeline the location of these stations is defined by the topography of the terrain the type of product being transported or operational conditions of the network partial delivery station known also as intermediate stations these facilities allow the pipeline operator to deliver part of the product being transported block valve station these are the first line of protection for pipelines with these valves the operator can isolate any segment of the line for maintenance work or isolate a rupture or leak block valve stations are usually located every  to  miles  km depending on the type of pipeline even though it is not a design rule it is a very usual practice in liquid pipelines the location of these stations depends exclusively on the nature of the product being transported the trajectory of the pipeline andor the operational conditions of the line regulator station this is a special type of valve station where the operator can release some of the pressure from the line regulators are usually located at the downhill side of a peak final delivery station known also as outlet stations or terminals this is where the product will be distributed to the consumer it could be a tank terminal for liquid pipelines or a connection to a distribution network for gas pipelines leak detection systemsedit since oil and gas pipelines are an important asset of the economic development of almost any country it has been required either by government regulations or internal policies to ensure the safety of the assets and the population and environment where these pipelines run pipeline companies face government regulation environmental constraints and social situations government regulations may define minimum staff to run the operation operator training requirements pipeline facilities technology and applications required to ensure operational safety for example in the state of washington it is mandatory for pipeline operators to be able to detect and locate leaks of  percent of maximum flow within fifteen minutes or less social factors also affect the operation of pipelines product theft is sometimes also a problem for pipeline companies in this case the detection levels should be under two percent of maximum flow with a high expectation for location accuracy various technologies and strategies have been implemented for monitoring pipelines from physically walking the lines to satellite surveillance the most common technology to protect pipelines from occasional leaks is computational pipeline monitoring or cpm cpm takes information from the field related to pressures flows and temperatures to estimate the hydraulic behavior of the product being transported once the estimation is completed the results are compared to other field references to detect the presence of an anomaly or unexpected situation which may be related to a leak the american petroleum institute has published several articles related to the performance of cpm in liquids pipelines the api publications are ram  – computational pipeline monitoring for liquids pipelines api  – pipeline variable uncertainties  their effects on leak detectability where a pipeline containing passes under a road or railway it is usually enclosed in a protective casing this casing is vented to the atmosphere to prevent the buildup of flammable gases or corrosive substances and to allow the air inside the casing to be sampled to detect leaks the casing vent a pipe protruding from the ground often doubles as a warning marker called a casing vent marker implementationedit as a rule pipelines for all uses are laid in most cases undergroundcitation needed however in some cases it is necessary to cross a valley or a river on a pipeline bridge pipelines for centralized heating systems are often laid on the ground or overhead pipelines for petroleum running through permafrost areas as transalaskapipeline are often run overhead in order to avoid melting the frozen ground by hot petroleum which would result in sinking the pipeline in the ground maintenanceedit maintenance of pipelines includes checking cathodic protection levels for the proper range surveillance for construction erosion or leaks by foot land vehicle boat or air and running cleaning pigs when there is anything carried in the pipeline that is corrosive us pipeline maintenance rules are covered in code of federal regulationscfr sections  cfr  for natural gas pipelines and  cfr  for petroleum liquid pipelines regulationedit an underground petroleum pipeline running through a park in the us onshore and offshore pipelines used to transport oil and gas are regulated by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa certain offshore pipelines used to produce oil and gas are regulated by the minerals management service mms in canada pipelines are regulated by either the provincial regulators or if they cross provincial boundaries or the canada–us border by the national energy board neb government regulations in canada and the united states require that buried fuel pipelines must be protected from corrosion often the most economical method of corrosion control is by use of pipeline coating in conjunction with cathodic protection and technology to monitor the pipeline above ground cathodic protection is not an option the coating is the only external protection pipelines and geopoliticsedit pipelines for major energy resources petroleum and natural gas are not merely an element of trade they connect to issues of geopolitics and international security as well and the construction placement and control of oil and gas pipelines often figure prominently in state interests and actions a notable example of pipeline politics occurred at the beginning of the year  wherein a dispute between russia and ukraine ostensibly over pricing led to a major political crisis russian stateowned gas company gazprom cut off natural gas supplies to ukraine after talks between it and the ukrainian government fell through in addition to cutting off supplies to ukraine russian gas flowing through ukraine—which included nearly all supplies to southeastern europe and some supplies to central and western europe—was cut off creating a major crisis in several countries heavily dependent on russian gas as fuel russia was accused of using the dispute as leverage in its attempt to keep other powers and particularly the european union from interfering in its near abroad oil and gas pipelines also figure prominently in the politics of central asia and the caucasus hazard identificationedit because the solvent fraction of dilbit typically comprises volatile aromatics like naptha and benzene reasonably rapid carrier vaporization can be expected to follow an aboveground spill—ostensibly enabling timely intervention by leaving only a viscous residue that is slow to migrate effective protocols to minimize exposure to petrochemical vapours are wellestablished and oil spilled from the pipeline would be unlikely to reach the aquifer unless incomplete remediation were followed by the introduction of another carrier eg a series of torrential downpours the introduction of benzene and other volatile organic compounds collectively btex to the subterranean environment compounds the threat posed by a pipeline leak particularly if followed by rain a pipeline breach would result in btex dissolution and equilibration of benzene in water followed by percolation of the admixture into the aquifer benzene can cause many health problems and is carcinogenic with epa maximum contaminant level mcl set at  μgl for potable water although it is not well studied single benzene exposure events have been linked to acute carcinogenesis additionally the exposure of livestock mainly cattle to benzene has been shown to cause many health issues such as neurotoxicity fetal damage and fatal poisoning the entire surface of an aboveground pipeline can be directly examined for material breach pooled petroleum is unambiguous readily spotted and indicates the location of required repairs because the effectiveness of remote inspection is limited by the cost of monitoring equipment gaps between sensors and data that requires interpretation small leaks in buried pipe can sometimes go undetected pipeline developers do not always prioritize effective surveillance against leaks buried pipes draw fewer complaints they are insulated from extremes in ambient temperature they are shielded from ultraviolet rays and they are less exposed to photodegradation buried pipes are isolated from airborne debris electrical storms tornadoes hurricanes hail and acid rain they are protected from nesting birds rutting mammals and wayward buckshot buried pipe is less vulnerable to accident damage eg automobile collisions and less accessible to vandals saboteurs and terrorists exposureedit previous work has shown that a worstcase exposure scenario can be limited to a specific set of conditions based on the advanced detection methods and pipeline shutoff sop developed by transcanada the risk of a substantive or large release over a short period of time contaminating groundwater with benzene is unlikely detection shutoff and remediation procedures would limit the dissolution and transport of benzene therefore the exposure of benzene would be limited to leaks that are below the limit of detection and go unnoticed for extended periods of time leak detection is monitored through a scada system that assesses pressure and volume flow every  seconds a pinhole leak that releases small quantities that cannot be detected by the scada system  flow could accumulate into a substantive spill detection of pinhole leaks would come from a visual or olfactory inspection aerial surveying or massbalance inconsistencies it is assumed that pinhole leaks are discovered within the day inspection interval however snow cover and location eg remote deep could delay detection benzene typically makes up  –  of oil and will have varying degrees of volatility and dissolution based on environmental factors even with pipeline leak volumes within scada detection limits sometimes pipeline leaks are misinterpreted by pipeline operators to be pump malfunctions or other problems the enbridge line b crude oil pipeline failure in marshall michigan on july   was thought by operators in edmonton to be from column separation of the dilbit in that pipeline the leak in wetlands along the kalamazoo river was only confirmed  hours after it happened by a local gas company employee in michigan spill frequencyvolumeedit although the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa has standard baseline incident frequencies to estimate the number of spills transcanada altered these assumptions based on improved pipeline design operation and safety whether these adjustments are justified is debatable as these assumptions resulted in a nearly fold decrease in spill estimates given that the pipeline crosses  miles of the ogallala aquifer or  of the entire pipeline length and the year life of the entire pipeline is expected to have between  –  spills approximately  –  spills can be expected to occur over the aquifer an estimate of  spills over the aquifer each lasting  days results in  days of potential exposure over the  year lifetime of the pipeline in the reduced scope ‘worst case exposure scenario’ the volume of a pinhole leak at  of max flowrate for  days has been estimated at  barrels or  million gallons of oil according to phmsa’s incident database only  of all spills in the last  years were  barrels benzene fate and transportedit scenario for benzene leaching to groundwater benzene is considered a light aromatic hydrocarbon with high solubility and high volatilityclarification needed it is unclear how temperature and depth would impact the volatility of benzene so assumptions have been made that benzene in oil  weight by volume would not volatilize before equilibrating with water using the octanolwater partition coefficient and a year precipitation event for the area a worstcase estimate of  mgl of benzene is anticipated to flow toward the aquifer the actual movement of the plume through groundwater systems is not well described although one estimate is that up to  billion gallons of water in the ogallala aquifer could become contaminated with benzene at concentrations above the mcl the final environmental impact statement from the state department does not include a quantitative analysis because it assumed that most benzene will volatilize previous dilbit spill remediation difficultiesedit one of the major concerns about dilbit is the difficulty in cleaning it up enbridges line b a inch crude oil pipeline ruptured in marshall michigan on july   mentioned above spilled at least  gallons of dilbit after detection of the leak booms and vacuum trucks were deployed heavy rains caused the river to overtop existing dams and carried dilbit  miles downstream before the
