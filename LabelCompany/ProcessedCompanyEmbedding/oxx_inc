over to the contact page to send a message with your inquiry making coffee why did you make the coffeeboxx just single serve our single serve coffeeboxx lets you brew a hot fresh cup of coffee  oz  oz or  oz whenever you want one no need to drink a whole pot quickly before it gets stale or pour a pot of coffee into an insulated vacuum bottle that’ll only keep it hot for so long with single serve brewing when you’re ready for your next cup you just make one single serve coffee pods are also perfect for brewing coffee on the go they are sealed selfcontained filtering units and the ground coffee inside each pod is fresh unlike the bags or cans of preground coffee where you use a few scoops at a time as the rest loses freshness bottom line single serve means a perfect cuppa with less waste i like the single serve idea but don’t like using disposable pods is there an alternative yes there are a number of reusable pods that you can refill with your favorite preground coffee we’ve found the ecofill™ brand to be reliable you can find it in our shop can you make tea and other noncoffee based drinks and food the coffeeboxx features a unique dedicated hot water line this means no coffee ground residue in your tea or ramen select the water button on the control panel to get hot fresh water pop a teabag hot cocoa mix or a pack of noodles directly into a cup to get your preferred fix how many cups of coffee do you get out of one tank of water you will get up to  cups of coffee in one tank  oz of water if you choose the  oz setting each time what size cup can i use in the coffeeboxx the coffeeboxx has a roomy area to fit large cups insulated mugs and some thermoses with the drip tray it can accommodate a ” tall cup by removing the drip tray it can accommodate an ” tall cup the area is ” wide is there a builtin water filter there is a replaceable water filter in the top of the water tank reservoir do i need to use filtered water or can i get it from the tap the coffeeboxx uses a charcoal filter so water from the tap works great the filter removes contaminants and impurities but don’t go filling the water tank from a pond or stream – that needs a different type of filtration does the coffeeboxx work with all brands of coffee pods the coffeeboxx works with all kcup® compatible single serve coffee pods product specs how much does it weigh the coffeeboxx weighs  lbs when it the water tank is empty what are the dimensions of the coffeeboxx it is ″l x ″w x ″h power why didn’t you make the coffeeboxx with a battery it takes a lot of power to make good hot coffee so unfortunately the batteries we’ve come to know and love just don’t have the strength to do the trick well a car battery will work the coffeeboxx pulls down w so we recommend at least a w inverter if you go that route – but be sure to consult the manufacturer of the alternate power source before using the coffeeboxx to make sure the power source is connected correctly and can safely supply the required power what are the specs on power the coffeeboxx is a v ac w appliance maintenance and coverage what kind of maintenance and cleaning should i do to keep the coffeeboxx running its best just like changing the oil in your car and your furnace filter in your house regular maintenance can go a long way be sure to clean the brewing compartment drip tray and water tank regularly also we recommend descaling every three months descaling removes calcium deposits that can build up like they do on any coffeemaker see instructions in the owner’s manual link to manual on how to use vinegar and the proper steps the coffeeboxx will remind you when it’s time descaling helps to ensure the best performance of your machine as well as the best tasting coffee can i leave the coffeeboxx out in freezing temperatures we all know what happens when things freeze and it’s not pretty always store the coffeeboxx in a dry controlled environment empty the water tank and allow it to completely air dry prior to storage follow the directions for flushing the machine on page  of the user guide what does the oneyear warranty cover it warrants that your oxx appliance will be free of defects in materials or workmanship under normal use for one year from the date of purchase we will repair or replace based on our review the oxx appliance without charge upon its receipt of proof of purchase this does not cover consequential or incidental damages such as property damage see full warranty info in the user guide accessories can i get extra water tanks yes you can purchase water tanks in our shop is there a compartment to hold the coffee pods etc there is not a place in the coffeeboxx to hold coffee pods however this is a case designed just for the coffeeboxx and its accessories the case is designed to allow its use within the case unzip a panel to lower the drip tray and another to access the control panel additional compartments hold coffee pods sugar creamer stirs etc you can find this awesome case in our shop does the coffeeboxx come in other colors yes you can purchase the limited edition coffeeboxx in black in our shop can i get a custom coffeeboxx with my name at this time we are unable to customize your coffeeboxx misc q why do i need a rugged coffee maker today’s countertopbased appliances like coffee makers are made for just that – a clean climatecontrolled countertop space inside the coffeeboxx was designed from the ground up based on portability and outdoor use with those special conditions in mind everything had to be rethought – components needed to be reinforced plastic needed to be uv resistant the water tank needed to be spill proof and the entire unit had to be lightweight and compact to store you get all that with the coffeeboxx can i also use it in my home or office absolutely made for the outdoors the coffeeboxx loves to brew coffee indoors just like a good indoor gig takes you out of the elements i have a question not in the faq

related tags business development engineering high tech technology urban innovation exchange  jim doan and andrew vanwylen of oxx inc are using engineering and ingenuity to make products for rough environments with the flagship coffeeboxx their small company is spreading out from its roots in grand rapids oxx inc is bringing ordinary luxuries to extraordinary places from its home within start gardens enclave at  ottawa the company is putting out durable products that make the limitations of extreme workplaces a thing of the past   engineer andrew vanwylen describes oxxs mission as a promise to bring the comforts of the kitchen or office break room to hardworking individuals who otherwise don’t get to enjoy things the rest of us take for granted   the companys flagship product the coffeeboxx was the idea of oxx founder and former design manager for whirlpool ceo jim doan its being marketed and sold in the us and canada as an incredibly tough yet portable and lightweight coffee maker just about everybody starts their day with coffee regardless of where theyre working on a construction site or the office people start their day with coffee its kind of an essential building block of the working day vanwylen says    the coffeeboxx was created not only to meet that demand but to best the ubiquitous stale coffee found in remote outdoor work or camp sites with advances in kcup brewing technology doan says there are new more efficient ways to produce a quality cup of coffee we just developed a system around that to heat up the water and shoot it through that capsule it was more compelling that a traditional drip system doan says for us the ability to be the first company to bring coffee beyond the home or office sounded very compelling there was an opportunity to provide good coffee to people who just dont work in offices theyre outside for work or outdoor recreation where you dont normally brew coffee since the product was launched and began selling last year vanwylen says he has regularly been hearing stories from coffeeboxx users in exciting and dangerous environments one client is a disaster relief first responder   he travels in after natural disasters to help the community vanwylen says he brings along quite a bit equipment to aide in the recovering but he says that the coffeeboxx is the first one he sets up because it energizes the team and brings a smile to those that need it most   the coffeeboxx has even been used at cruising altitudes as vanwylen has heard from a member of the us air force    he flies around the world in a c and brews coffee at  feet vanwylen says adding that hearing these stories is rewarding in many ways these customers are what keep us going they work hard and make our country great we are proud to make sure they have a cup of hot coffee while doing so the coffeeboxx from oxx on vimeothe product was featured on a nov  episode of science channels allamerican makers doan and vanwylen watched as the show hosts disassembled the coffeeboxx analyzed its integrity reassembled it and dropped it a few times before making some test coffee   the oxx team is meticulous and thorough with its testing the coffeeboxx prototypes have been through a lot brewing hundreds of gallons of coffee and hot water brewing underneath the wheels of a parked jeep wrangler and being dropped from different heights it was taken apart and redesigned for strength and utility several times before it met the specifications the team was looking for vanwylen even field tested a unit over a july th weekend   i went up to a cabin with a bunch of buddies and the coffeeboxx he says i use this thing in real life so i brought it up to the cabin and we kind of tossed it around a dirt yard afterwards we used it the entire weekend to brew coffee and it worked great   vanwylen says there are many other products in oxxs pipeline too    wherever you work youve got any number of appliances a microwave ice maker things that heat food or chill food ways to make beverages vanwylen says there are conveniences that make a work day a lot more pleasant   those are the conveniences that oxx seeks to deliver to more people in more places   working at oxx is exciting because of the value we bring to our customers vanwylen says   vanwylen has a degree in finance from grand valley state university and will be finishing up an engineering degree in april  it was actually in one of his engineering classes that he first got involved with oxx a program alumni asked his class if someone would want to work with a team that made tools   he didnt even tell me they made coffee vanwylen says the product hadnt been released and it was very secretive he said it was a startup company that makes the world’s toughest tools for those who need it i followed along because it sounded like fun   vanwylen is still having fun and oxx is operating smoothly with a pared down staff of five to eight people in concentrated roles the company operates out of two pods in the start garden facility one being office space and the other vanwylens prototyping and testing lab currently the coffeeboxx is manufactured and assembled in china but vanwylen is able to accomplish any research and development or design from his lab in grand rapids    for more information on oxx inc visit httpwwwoxxcom   matthew russell is the project editor for
