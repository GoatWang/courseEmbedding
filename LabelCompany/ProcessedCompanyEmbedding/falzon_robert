profound and groundbreaking book profound because it collates the latest research on the importance of fathers in families but not just fathers also mothers faith and family groundbreaking because it also includes personal stories case studies and gives strategies for success and happiness unique because it is fresh and nothing like it has been written before” – warwick marsh ceo of dadskids recipient of the  fol fatherhood of the year award “this book is not only a very captivating read but also a very informative one it should be compulsory reading for marriage preparation courses as i read the book i was amazed at how much evidence there was on the importance of fathers but how little has been done to help fatherless children fortunately this book provides some suggested remedial strategies in that direction” – veronica kearney mother of four and teacher for 3 years “in their encouraging and inspiring book the father factor pp  peter o’shea and robert falzon have done australian men and therefore their families or future families a great service they write about father matters and it shows if anyone is uncertain that fathers really do matter in the lives of their children men who are searching for guidance and wisdom in terms of being a good father and in my experience that is most men who are fathers or who want to be fathers will benefit from giving this book their time and attention the authors assert that the impact of engaged and responsible fathering is felt far beyond the boundaries of the family indeed society is safer and healthier for all because of it” – dr brian sullivan counsellor and teacher the father factor prompts the reader to consider the evidence on what drives success and happiness what emerges from the research is the
