orbcomm inc orbc gary milne special situations growth longterm horizonsummaryproduct shipments in q will exceed expectations and lead to a revenue beatdeals with jb hunt and us postal service will yield  new subs and hardware in  this represents  of  organic growth sold by the end of februarypartnerships with cimc and carrier transicold will yield manufacturerinstalled orbcomm solutionshighmargin ais revenue is steadily increasing each quarterwhen my first article on orbcomm nasdaqorbc was published in august   the stock traded around  and it is still there today in the interim period the stock has traded as high as  and as low as  when the market overreacted to a q miss timing is always the hardest part when it comes to growth stories and orbcomm has proven no exception while  was disappointing in terms of stock performance most of it came down to issues with product shipments in q and q which we will discuss later in this article i lay out my reasons why  should be a year of increased growth and strong results for the company sturdy growth in  at the end of february  orbcomm was selected by jb hunt nasdaqjbht to equip its plus intermodal and overtheroad otr trailing fleets with endtoend tracking and monitoring this is a huge deal for the company both in terms of product and service revenue in addition att closed a deal with the us postal service which utilizes orbcomms solution for tracking postal service assets on the q earnings call marc eisenberg the ceo referred to this deal as tens of thousands of units at attus postal service and later as  that could be tens of thousands of units with an upside of  over the next year or two the significance of these two deals is best understood in terms of orbcomms typical organic growth as shown below using  units for these combined deals accounts for  of their  organic growth being booked by the end of february  it appears highly likely that  new subscriber numbers and product revenue will handily beat those for  it should be noted that the implementation of these new customers will not be linear throughout the year and the ceo cited the jb hunt implementation as an example so there is a portion of the year that jb hunt stacks a lot of trailers in q q and weve got to zoom ahead to get as many installed in those quarters as we can marc eisenberg q earnings call these two deals represent a dream start for  that should bode well for sturdy growth in subs and product food safety management act  the second wave i detailed in my prior article the significance of the fsma and i wont repeat that here what is important is that the fsma has two significant compliance dates for sanitary transportation there are a few exceptions but in essence it looks like this march    carriers with greater than  employees march    carriers with less than  employees the first date has passed and orbcomm has been very successful in converting numerous large refrigerated shippers into customers the second date march   applies to all small carriers across the nation with less than  employees we believe fsma will continue to generate strong demand for our industry leading cold chain solutions marc eisenberg q earnings call this second wave of demand will grow throughout  and orbcomm is perfectly situated to benefit from it the product business orbcomms financial reports break revenue down into services and products which have an approximate  split over the last two quarters product revenues have been below company guidance and the major contributor to revenue misses in both quarters in q service revenues increased  over the prioryear period to  million product sales of  million were  million or  lower than the prioryear period in the q earnings call management gave several reasons for the shortfall first weve now moved the majority of our products to a new contract manufacturer in mexico while this was a necessary change due to the pricing advantages we will be seeing it wasnt without some glitches we had a number of incomplete system shipped which prevented us from recognizing a significant amount of revenue a second issue we ran into was that we had distribution partners that pushed some of their deployments in q product sales picked up but the anticipated rebound from the q backlog did not materialize and again the numbers fell short of expectations from the q press release product sales during the fourth quarter of  were  million compared to  million during the same period last year decreasing  million or  product sales were lower largely due to the timing of deployments and delays in obtaining the required lte product certifications which resulted in a shift of about  units of backlog or  million to the first quarter of  with certification of its new lte module completed in late december the company finally looks set to clear the majority of its backlog in q  these circumstances should setup orbcomm for strong product sales in q  analysts have conservative expectations in the  q earnings call management gave the following guidance for fullyear  service revenue  million product revenue  million by comparison  revenues were  million for services and  million for product growth in subscriber revenue is predictable as new subs are added and the tight range given is relatively easy to predict in q  service revenues were  million taking a typical  quarterly increase in service revenue yields  million for q  a quick look at the analyst estimates from yahoo finance shows us that combined revenue for q is expected to be  million product sales is by far the more variable number so let us take a closer look at that if we deduct the  million from  million we are left with an estimate of  million in q product sales with  million in product revenue in q  it means the average analyst is expecting a rebound of only  million in product sales compare this to earlier in the year where product sales rebounded from  million in q to  million in q an increase of  million due to shipping delays in q given the product backlog going into  cited as  million in the q press release certification of the companys new lte module in december and two large deals already signed it seems quite likely that orbcomm will beat on product sales which will lead to an overall revenue beat for q growth in automatic identification system ais ais is a system that broadcasts a ships identification position and other data this system is mandated by the international maritime organization on all large vessels orbcomm continues to expand its footprint in this space as its partners close deals with agencies around the world orbcomms partner kordia awarded multiyear contract by australian maritime safety authority orbcomms partner maerospace awarded multiyear contract for the canadian government in the q earnings call the cfo made this comment on ais growth ais revenues now at  million per quarter are trending over  million on an annual run rate heading toward our expected  million to  million per year this segment of the business keeps growing steadily its highmargin nature gives it an oversized contribution to the bottom line strategic partnerships orbcomm has two partnerships which will make a highly significant contribution to growth over the next few years the first is cimc the largest manufacturer of shipping containers in the world see my prior article for more information on shipping containers here is how marc eisenberg described the status of the relationship in the q earnings call well theres no factory installs yet with cimc but cimc is  theyve committed to  units per year first couple of years their product is just about ready theyre out there pitching the deal pitching their deals on an aftermarket basis and you know their expectation you know theyve committed to  in year three and  in year four the second is carrier transicold the biggest name in refrigerated transportation together they have built a carrierbranded oem solution these are going in aftermarket but will come as a factoryinstalled option in the future this was marc eisenbergs update in the q earnings call were continuing to make progress in the launch of our customized cold chain telematics solution for carrier transicold truck and trailer transport refrigeration units we started shipping to carrier in q carrier believes there is significant demand through their dealer network in north america and expect this to be followed by some factory installs in early  having leading manufacturers build an orbcomm solution into their product makes the company a strong incumbent that is harder to displace it also generates new subscribers and regular product sales without the overhead of the typical sales process conclusion for the past decade orbcomm has evangelised its solution for tracking and monitoring assets on a global basis as a seller in search of buyers now the landscape is shifting and fleet management telematics and cold chain monitoring are all becoming essential to the smooth and costefficient operation of the supply chain buyer resistance is fading and selling the orbcomm solution has never been easier the en masse adoption by large fleets like jb hunt maersk otcpkamkaf and carrier demonstrate this technology has moved from a futuristic nicety into the realm of common business necessity the average subscriber monthly fee at orbcomm is   a number which is dwarfed by the value of operational efficiencies it delivers as orbcomms solution shifts to a competitive necessity it would appear the pricing structure offers opportunity to increase revenue without significantly impairing the value proposition to the customer the year is off to a great start with the jb hunt and us postal service deals add to that the resolution of product shipment issues from qq and orbcomm looks set to deliver in  disclosure i amwe are long orbc i wrote

its orbcomm generation  og and ais equipped og satellites operating in the very high frequency vhf band thirdparty leo constellationsthe company utilizes its orbcommconnect platform to translate and integrate the communications from its range of network service partners into a manageable set of commands and responses and information transport this creates a common user platform for provisioning billing and multimode access for iot applications and enables access to network and terminal management tools for wholesale integration with its network the company provides its customers a subscriber component which consists of satellite subscriber communicators and cellular terrestrial units or wireless modems incorporating sims used by end users to transmit and receive messages to and from their assets and its system in addition its web applications provide specialized data feeds that are established through its application gateway interface to thirdparty dispatch systems and customer software applications to provide customers data and analytics from telematics products and specialized sensorsthe data is transferred to either a subscriber communicator or a terrestrialbased wireless device using a sim on the partner cellular providers network if the data is transferred to a satellite subscriber communicator data is transmitted to the next satellite that comes into view in near realtime the data is then routed by the satellite to the next gateway earth station ges that it connects to which in turn forwards it to the orbcomm gateway control center gcc within the gcc the data is processed safestored and forwarded to its ultimate destination and if requested an acknowledgment that the message content has been received is transmitted back to the subscriber communicators if the data is transferred to a cellular device data is routed through the partner carriers network through a virtual private network vpn to the orbcomm gcc and forwarded to its destination in real time the destination for transferred data may be another subscriber communicator a sim a corporate resource management system various personal or business internet email address a pager or a text messagecapable cellular phone or various other combinations in addition data can be sent in the reverse direction a feature which is utilized by many applications to remotely control assets using

creating large wave of opportunity in refrigerated shipping and distributionsatellite launch risk is removed and satellite network capacity has increased xvery impressive portfolio of satellite and cellular partners hardware products saas solutions and industry leading customersverizon showing interest in internet of things solution players introduction long before the internet of things became a technology term and investing buzzword orbcomm nasdaqorbc was connecting terrestrial objects such as shipping containers and construction equipment things to the internet via its satellite network orbcomm is perceived as a satellite company but really has  things to sell devices that send status message over a network two way communications over their satellite or partner cellular network a range of industry specific software as a service applications putting these three things together and we get devices  network  apps think that over for a minute devices that communicate over a network to software that monitorsreportschanges based on what it sees that sounds like a dictionary definition for the internet of things however orbcomm is largely seen as a satellite company with a small subscriber network when in fact it is at the nexus of three technologies that are all central to the iot revolution iot devices networking and saas solutions read on to see why i believe orbcomm is poised to rapidly grow their subscriber and enterprise solutions base over the  years especially in the areas of shipping and distribution this article does not evaluate the present financials of orbcomm or make estimates on future share price the goal is to evaluate the company and the potential market for their goods and services orbcomms background orbcomm has a long history dating back to its origins as orbital sciences inc in  and has operated a satellite network since  in  it was acquired by new ownership and became a public company in  through a process of organic growth and an aggressive acquisition strategy orbc now has m subscribers and expects annual revenues for  around m orbc revenue annual data by ycharts revenue sources hardware these are the communication devices that gather data from a physical object on the ground and transmit the data to the nearest orbiting satellite or via cellular hardware accounts for about  of their revenue network services orbcomm has over m subscribers for their network services subscribers pay a monthly fee to use the orbcomm network which includes their own satellite or partner terrestrial cellular networks enterprise solutions orbcomm has  subscribers to their enterprise solutions which provide turnkey saas applications to companies in the transportation and distribution business trucking shipping and intermodal as well as solutions for heavy equipment and scada system remember devices  network  apps  internet of things the orbcomm network december  saw the completed launch of  new og satellites bringing the total to  og satellites and  og satellites which are still operating after  years in service each og satellite has the capacity of  og satellites and also supports much larger message sizes improvements in the og satellites allow the terrestrial devices to be smaller and use less power the successful launch of these satellites was a large risk that has now been eliminated in addition to the  orbcomm owned satellites orbcomm also has agreements with inmarsat and globalstar to ensure global coverage even in countries such as china and russia where licenses are almost impossible to obtain in addition to satellite modems orbcomm also sells cellular and dual mode devices to accommodate the broadest range of a customers need the orbcomm cellular solution works with att verizon tmobile orange rogers telefonica and vodafone the global network is built the biggest risk is off the table and network capacity has increased at least tenfold the network is ready to scale up dramatically from its  million network subscribers with minimal incremental capex investment the orbcomm solution orbcomm provides a global solution that allows its customers to monitor any kind of asset regardless of its physical location the main uses at present are transportation trailers shipping containers fleet and driver management intermodal containers sample customers are walmart cimc maersk carrier union pacific hub group heavy equipment construction and agriculture sample customers are john deere komatsu caterpillar hyundai volvo monitoring and control remote industrial infrastructure such as oil and gas electrical grid water and waste management a simple example a refrigerated container carries perishable goods with an orbcomm solution the container can continuously transmit information such as location temperature humidity power fuel door openclose events to a central monitoring station should the temperature go outside specified limits a technician can be dispatched to resolve the issue before the load spoils the opportunity in shipping intermodal containers the global capacity for intermodal shipping containers in  was estimated to be  million teu a teu is a twenty foot equivalent container so a  foot container   teu while the exact number of containers is unknown  million is a reasonable estimate in  the new container capacity added was estimated at  million teu and another  million teu for replacement of lostdamagedretired containers this places the number of new containers built each year at  million containers china international marine corp is the worlds largest builder of containers china produces  of world supply estimated to be around  of the world supply or approximately  million units each year in november of  cimc selected orbcomm to build an oem solution for cimc which went into testing in early  the potential opportunity here is huge relative to their current subscriber base refrigerated containers reefers maersk one the largest shippers in the world has a fleet of over  refrigerated containers referred to as reefers in the industry in may  the coo of maersk went public on their decision to retrofit their entire reefer fleet with remote monitoring in a year project today  of the claims made against maersk relate to failures of reefer units so they have a strong economic incentive to solve this problem orbcomm subsidiary wam technologies acquired  supplied the telematics application and device management middleware for the final solution orbcomms reeferconnect solution is now deployed on over  reefer containers worldwide and are managed via their reeferconnect saas application the opportunity in distribution there are estimated to be  million trucks in the us alone approximately  million of these are semis with about  million accompanying semi trailers many of these trucks and semis form part of commercial fleets and orbcomm has established a very strong position in refrigerated trucking and a competitive position in dry van fleet management orbcomms reefer customer list reads like a whos who of the refrigerated trucking industry including cr england werner carrier celadon marten prime inc swift tyson walmart and many others food safety modernization act the fsma is the most sweeping reform of us food safety laws in more than  years it aims to assure the safety of food throughout the supply chain through the introduction of new requirements to food manufacturers processors transporters and distributors there are seven foundational rules within the act with the most relevant rule being the sanitary transportation of human and animal food the sanitary transportation rule applies to the us food chain as follows shippers receivers loaders and carriers who transport food within the united states by truck or rail shippers in other countries who ship food to the united states by truck rail ship or air and arrange for the transfer of the intact container onto a motor or rail vehicle for transportation within the us if that food will be consumed or distributed in the united states companies involved in the transportation of food intended for export are covered by the rule until the shipment reaches a port or us border the rule does not apply to exporters who ship food through the united states for example from canada to mexico by truck or rail if the food does not enter us distribution most shippers have until march of  to comply with these new regulations companies with less than  employees have at least  additional year for full fsma compliance dates click here while reefers are by nature temperature controlled the new act requires that the shipper must be able to provide a log of the controlled environment upon request from the receiver or an auditor these records must be kept for a period not exceeding  year orbcomms existing reefertrak and reeferconnect saas product provides a turnkey solution of hardware and software that is ready to address this market need the fsma is driving forward a wave of adoption ahead of the march  deadline and orbcomm is a major beneficiary some recent wins aug th   northern refrigerated to equip all reefers with orbcomm solution by end of  aug th   carrier transicold selects orbcomm to build oem telematics solution for carrier july th   gulik trucking selects orbcomm for its refrigerated trucking fleets dry van solutions trucking companies also see benefits in tracking dry van trailers to give a global overview of their equipment and drivers orbcomm does not have a dominant position in the much larger dry van market but they do have a competitive turnkey solution cargowatch with robust communications dual cellsatellite that integrate with leading trucking software such as tmwsuite and loadmaster some recent wins august th   lj rogers trucking selects orbcomms asset tracking solution for its dry van trailer fleet august rd   barnes transportation selects orbcomms trailer tracking solution for its dry van fleet july th   gulik trucking selects orbcomm for its dry van fleet orbcomms introduction of an award winning solar powered trailer tracking device in  the gt  has been well received in the industry the slim ruggedized and easy to install gt  has eliminated a number of barriers to broad adoption of this type of solution in the dry van business heavy equipment management and telematics orbcomm has achieved a dominant position in providing telematic solutions for mobile heavy machinery customers with orbcomms fleetview saas solution can have a near real time view of their entire fleet along with the information that is most important in maximizing the value of that asset with heavy equipment often used outside the range of a cellular network it makes a lot of sense to utilize orbcomms satellite or satellitecellular solution in this market the following marquee customers use an orbcomm solution caterpillar john deere hitachi volvo hyundai heavy industries komatsu doosan terex scada system monitoring scada stands for supervisory control and data acquisition and is a commonly used acronym in the area of engineering controls up until this point the orbcomm solutions discussed generally relay data from the device trailer container railcar back to a central point on the internet in this category data is collected and commands are issued to a remote device to control its operation examples of this type of need are often found in the utilities industry a pipeline may span thousands of miles and contain scores of pumping stations with pressure sensors pumps and valves these often span remote areas of the country where cellular connections are not an option using an orbcomm solution pumps can be stopped and started valves opened and closed etc in july of  orbcomm announced that it had won the smart grid product of the year award for its dualmode satellitecellular solution which enables utility companies to manage their smart grids by monitoring and controlling reclosers and other network distribution devices in real time orbcomm allows you to connect anything that you wish to monitor or control anywhere on the planet in near real time utilities are a critical part of a nations infrastructure so they are early adopters for this kind of technology inevitably the use of this type of solution will expand into other industries and find new use cases as the technology becomes cheaper automatic identification system ais ais is a system that broadcasts a vessels identification position and other data this system is mandated by the international maritime organization on all large vessels while this system was initially designed with collision avoidance in mind its use has broadened to include security counter piracy environmental monitoring accident investigation ala costa concordia fishing zone compliance port logistics and even analysis of shipping patterns as an indicator of economic strength all orbcomm satellites are ais equipped and orbcomm keeps increasing its ais revenue each year in q of  ais revenue was up  yy to m and will continue to grow due to a recent contract win by their resellerpartner luxspace sarl to provide ais data to the european maritime safety agency this year agreement will start to add ais revenue in q of  although ais sounds like an outlier from its core business it is simply iot applied to ships in this case orbcomm primarily provides network services and others provide the devices and analytical applications why buy now the chart below shows orbcomms share price since the company went public in november of  orbc data by ycharts compare the chart above to the typical gartner hype cycle which accompanies many tech ipos the peak of inflated expectations was in  the trough of disillusionment around  when investors realize its not going to change the world overnight we have traveled along the slope of enlightenment and entered into the plateau of productivity which represents the point at which broad mainstream adoption of a new technologysolution is taking place orbcomm is a mature company with a strong product line that is ready to capitalise on a business segment that is in a transitional phase from early adopter to broad adoption the fsma ensures that food shippers and distributors move to an iot solution and we will see a market segment reefers have full adoption over the next year or so orbcomm has a strong moat in its private satellite network that is designed specifically to handle mm data this unique asset allows orbcomm to cover most of the earth and will make it a very strong contender for intermodal shipping allowing containers to be tracked from source to final destination regardless of cellular infrastructure orbcomm offers dual mode devices that support both satellite and cellular transmission orbcomm is laser focused on their business they have been in the mm business from the start and do not have to pivot to take advantage of the opportunity that iot brings the onset of iot plays directly into their existing product portfolio and transforms the appearance of their business from niche satellite solutions player into mainstream iot solutions provider orbcomm demonstrates a strong commitment to the bottom line the two charts below show the relationships between sga and rd expense in relation to annual revenue sga cost as a fraction of annual revenue has shown a strong down trend whilst rd has remained relatively flat at around  flat over the same period fundamental chart data by ycharts orbcomm is a growing company with a  cagr in revenues and  cagr in ebitda since  this demonstrates a growing company which is also fiscally responsible for more information on company history and financial metrics click here an acquisition target earlier this month aug st  verizon nysevz agreed to acquire fleetmatics nysefltx for  billion fleetmatics provides fleet management solutions based on cellular communications and had around  vehicles under subscription at the time of the deal click here for the wsj article on this acquisition in june  verizon agreed to acquire privately held telogis a specialized telematics company for an unspecified amount click here for the story if history is any guide we will see aggregation of iot players by larger wellestablished companies with deeper pockets we used to have thousands of isps and telephone companies but those numbers dwindled quickly as they were acquired usually at a premium during the s and s in the new frontier of iot we are likely to see the same pattern repeat as the industry behemoths stake their claims on the data landscape of the future with a market cap around m and m subscribers orbcomms valuation is subscriber by comparison verizon is paying  per subscriber for fleetmatics im not drawing a direct comparison between these two companies as fleetmatics has a much stronger record of profitability and there are obvious synergies but i do see these two companies as having a great number of similarities the future at its heart orbcomm is an internet of things company with a unique network offering that provides a strong competitive moat the challenge in front of orbcomm is one of scale orbcomm has recently added  subscribers per quarter excluding acquisitions i believe the fsma deadline will drive the new subscriber rate notably higher and we will see this reflected in the quarterly results between  q and q  orbcomm is operating marginally below profitability losing m in fy  and m in the first half of fy  i expect a strong increase in subscribers over the next  quarters which will put orbcomm into a position of consistent quarterly profit i believe the total addressable market for orbcomm is in the tens of millions and the company is well positioned to capture a very significant share of this market before the end of the decade disclosure i amwe are long orbc i wrote this article myself and it

generation satellites launched in  was retired in april  due to intermittent service two additional satellites one from each of plane b and plane d were retired in  also due to intermittent service the other five satellites that are not operational experienced failures earlier the absence of these eight satellites can increase system latency and decrease overall capacity orbcomm has invested in replacement satellites as the first generation is at or nearing end of life on  june  six additional orbcomm satellites were launched with the cosmosm rocket one orbcomm cds weighing  kg and five orbcomm quick launches weighing  kg each these new satellites were built by german ohb system ag platform and by orbital sciences corporation payload and included a secondary ais design and production of the satellite platform was subcontracted by ohb system to russian kb polyot on november   orbcomm filed a report to the united states securities and exchange commission stating that since launch communications capability for three of the quicklaunch satellites and the cds has been lost the failed satellites experienced attitude control system anomalies as well as anomalies with its power systems which resulted in the satellites not pointing towards the sun and the earth as expected and as a consequence have reduced power generation the company filed a  million claim with its insurers
