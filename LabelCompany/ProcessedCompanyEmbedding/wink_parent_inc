kastrenakes apr   am edt share tweet linkedin nathan smith knew that wink would have to go it was early in  and the smart home company hed started less than a year earlier was being held back by the very thing that brought it into existence quirky we knew that wink needed a parent other than quirky to achieve its full potential smith tells the verge in under a year smith had gone from founding wink inside of quirky to looking for a way to escape it quirky was very much a launchpad for us the reasons were obvious quirky the ambitious tech incubator was a wildly mismanaged sinking ship it was going broke and little of its business seemed sustainable outside of wink so months before quirky declared bankruptcy wink started searching for a suitor we were out looking at either raising some money to spin wink out as a separate company or a potential acquisition for wink smith says in november of  wink sold to the component manufacturer flex formerly known as flextronics for  million an unglamorous transition that struck many as a lastditch bid for survival flex had been manufacturing wink’s smart home hubs so the pairing wasn’t entirely out of nowhere but to wink customers it seemed like their smart home service might just disappear amid the chaos now smith contends that free from quirkys baggage wink is betterpositioned than ever to take on the smart home market weve always thought that wink was best suited to use the resources and scale of a good parent company says smith who is today winks chief technical officer quirky was very much a launchpad for us the wink hub image credit wink wink which launched in  with a smart home hub tying together several competing standards now has  million devices on its network with another  coming online every week wink declined to say across how many homes smith says growth hasnt slowed down continuing throughout winks ejection from a failing parent we never lost a step as far as user and device growth he says flex can seem like a strange bedfellow for continuing that journey but the truth is wink didn’t have much choice as smith notes quirky’s financial situation encumbered wink to a certain extent though it had been looking for a buyer for months — and though quirky technically put it up for auction — wink largely ended up in flex’s lap because quirky owed flex a ton of money nearly  million according to its bankruptcy filing making it quirky’s single largest creditor by handing over wink for  million quirky was able to write off a big portion of its debt and flex ensured it didn’t walk away empty handed unlike quirky flex doesnt focus on consumers winks new parent company focuses on making electronics for other businesses not on selling electronics and services to consumers like wink does that means wink doesnt inherit powerful retail relationships like it did under quirky one of those partnerships with home depot plays a big role in winks existing and continued success it’s maintained that relationship even after the separation flex does have its advantages its profitable for one so wink doesnt have to worry about disappearing next year so long as flex stays interested in the smart home market and smith says that flex can direct companies with smart home aspirations toward wink allowing flex to build their products and integrate them with winks system wink remains independent inside of flex but smith implies that the two will work together closely when the right products come along it has nothing to announce along those lines just yet however the wink relay a touchscreen controller for smart home products image credit wink in the future smith suggests that the wink hub could go away eventually being integrated with any number of hardware devices when the hub first launched in  a wink vp commented to the new york times that wed love not to be in the hub business that makes flexs acquisition feel a bit more logical opening up opportunities for wink to embeds the hub inside more practical smart home products though smith still sees this as a few years down the line smith says winks immediate goal isnt to ramp up user growth or available products — its to make using smart home products on its network easier for homeowners thats an increasingly important battle as the smart home landscape has become far more competitive over the past two years attracting entrenched tech giants apple is now in the market i try to think on my good days that were not in competition with apple smith says i certainly dont like betting against them and samsung bought a company called smartthings that offers a product thats almost identical to wink thats why smith views building a smoother smart home experience as the key to winks continued expansion if you look at smartthings on the app store and you look at us on the app store youll see the difference right away smith says its a  star app i think people will gravitate toward experiences that make things simple for them winks competition is getting stronger but it now has time to compete winks plan to get there involves essentially making its users forget it even exists were gonna be rolling out features that sort of allow you to use wink more but use the app less smith says the hope is that wink can make the smart home legitimately smart letting products automate themselves rather than requiring homeowners to program in everything they want to happen imagine if your lights just knew your schedule and turned on and off automatically weve been working on this for two years internally smith says these features are actually going to live up to the promises the smart home has been making for years of course there are good reasons no one has gotten there yet the smart home landscape is still a mess and winks solution for it — tie together multiple standards — is functional but inelegant not to mention something that can be reproduced by competitors but going into  wink very much seems to be in a better place its growing its planning new features and it doesn’t have quirky’s black cloud hanging over its head wink isnt a profitable company yet its working out a timeline with flex for when that might happen but it now has a stretch of road to get there the smart home landscape is far from settled and it seems like wink is still in the fight over what itll look like next up in tech

you don’t know it’s there keep the front door secure and looking good with the smart yale assure lock sl  common problems with your dishwasher and how to fix them logitech’s pop home switch starter pack makes controlling your smart home easy quirky is on a mission to bring the smart home to everyone through it’s own platform wink thanks to partnerships with the home depot and general electric quirky says it’s got  people using the wink app alongside compatible products it’s been a rapid ascent for the small startup and quirky wants to keep it going the company announced seven new products on tuesday at an event held in its headquarters in manhattan new york quirky aims to help average every day people build their own personal smart home one connected device at a time every device is relatively cheap especially in comparison with bigname products like nest and others of course many of the more expensive products including nest are compatible with the wink app quirky introduced the wink hub a few months ago which aims to connect all the different smart devices in your home regardless of the frequency they’re on be it wifi bluetooth zwave or what have you with the help of ge quirky is continuing in the same vein its seven new products range from the fully customizable spotter uniq to the basic tapt light switch and outlink outlet you can preorder all of the following products on wink’s website but here’s a description of each one quirkyge tripper windowdoor sensor  tripper is an incredibly tiny sensor that you can attach to any door or window it detects when a door or window has been opened closed or otherwise tampered with and can alert you of the disturbance the battery should last for two years before you need to replace it quirky says it’ll cost  for two and they’ll ship in december quirkyge overflow water sensor  overflow is a water sensor that detects moisture levels in your home and warns you if you have a serious leak it costs  quirkyge outlink wall outlet and energy monitor  outlink is a smart outlet that not only helps you keep track of the amount of electricity you’re using but also turns any appliance into a smart appliance all you have to do is plug a device into the outlet and you can turn it on or off remotely outlink will cost  and is available now quirkyge tapt light switch  tapt is a light switch that can connect any buttonpowered device on with the tap of a button it costs  and is available now quirkyge ascend garage door controller  ascend is essentially a sensor that you place on your garage door which allows you to open and close it it also sends you alerts if it’s been disturbed or you accidentally left the garage door open you can also set it up for guest use removing the need to give your housesitter keys quirky says  percent of people enter homes through the garage door and at  it’s a bargain you’ll have to wait until next year to get one but you can preorder it now quirkyge spotter multipurpose sensor  spotter uniq is perhaps the most interesting device quirky unveiled today the inventor denny fong previously made the original spotter for quirky but wanted to make one that was more customizable the spotter uniq is fully customizable from the ground up you can choose any of four different sensors including options like barometric pressure temperature humidity motion carbon monoxide and many more you can also choose what color you want it to come in so that it matches your wallpaper depending on which sensors you choose it’ll cost between  and  the spotter uniq ships in december quirkyge norm thermostat  norm is “the death of the thermostat” according to quirky it’s just a small white box that you tack on your wall but it communicates with all the other devices in the house to access information from the sensors the sensors then help norm determine the best way to control the climate of your entire house the antithermostat will cost you just  but it works best if you have multiple wink products of course it’ll ship in a few weeks the wink app free and available for ios and android the wink app also got a few big updates so users can now access a few more features including activity shortcuts and robots under the activity section you’ll see every action you told a connected device to do on that day the shortcuts section lets you program settings for multiple devices at the same time that way if you’re having a movie night wink will automatically dim or turn off the lights close the shades turn on your tv and so on the robots section is really the part of the app where you can set up home automation in that part of the app you can tell the lights to come on at a certain hour cue the doors to lock at  pm before you go to bed and so on apparently automation is actually pretty popular with wink users as  percent of them are already using the feature wink now has its own website where all the compatible products are listed videos of the products in action are posted and the company gives advice to wouldbe smart home builders it’s all part of its hope to build awareness and convince americans that the smart home can be affordable and accessible to all quirky jokes that “the light bulb is the gateway drug to the connected home” because  percent of devices on the wink platform are light bulbs however quirky believes that once you see how easy and effortless it is to control your lights with the wink app you’ll be inspired to try smart outlets like outlink sensors like spotter and switches like tapt the approach seems to be working too about  percent of wink users own three or more devices quirky wink and ge are really just getting started in the space but it’s clear that they mean business wink  crunchbase
