product and examples of mvp startupfreak after idea stage when you start working on your product development let it be a software hardware product or a service that you are offering the minimum viable product mvp is a strategy used for fast and quantitative market testing of a product or product feature popularized by eric ries for web applications what is minimum viable product  mvp  mvp is a strategy which you can use to increase your chances of success here’s the road map go talk to some customers who might have a problem tell them your theory about how you believe they could solve their problem based on your solution get them to validate your hypothesis… you might actually be wrong in your assumptions obtain a preliminary commitment from the customer to purchase your solution based on the validated assumptions go raise some funding based on that commitment build and release your prototype product on an incremental basis to your beta customer partnerpeople who have agreed upon your hypothesis obtain proof of concept and testimonialsfeedback raise another round of “go to market” financing to start adding features and polish the packaging and presentation all you need to do is to figure out a way to connect to your early adapters find out what they want from your product and how your product will help them examples of mvp lets start with eric ries the godfather of mvp read his book on lean startups asked his blog readers to preorder his book before he had written a chapter or inked a book deal he was able to feel confident in the market’s interest and got enormous leverage in pitching the book to publishers dropbox ‘s initial idea was to make an extremely easytouse file sharing tool the mvp was  a product demo video of what dropbox looked like put on their website before they launch any product and ask to signup in case they liked what the video demo’d it helped the company attract a  waitlist within  hours based on the overwhelming response they slowly allowed select users to begin using dropbox as they continued to develop the product the idea was conceived by drew houston on a bus to new york when he planned to do some coding during the  hour ride but left his usb drive at home now over  million users  million in venture funding a rumored  to  billion valuation approximately  million of revenue in  google‘s initial idea was to download all internet on one computer and build a search around that and as their mvp strategy they downloaded stanford’s datalinks developed pagerank for that added linux search there after mvpminimum viable
