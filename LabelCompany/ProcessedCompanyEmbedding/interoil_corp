company in papua new guinea interoil conducts its operations through three segments exploration and production refining and marketing and wholesale and retail distribution the exploration and production segment engages in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas it owns four exploration licenses and two retention licenses in papua new guinea covering approximately eight million acres the refining and marketing segment operations include the refining of crude oil and the marketing of refined products the wholesales and retail distribution segment engages in the bulk storage transportation distribution wholesaling and retailing of refined petroleum products in papua new guinea it distributes diesel jet fuel gasoline and fuel oil as well as commercial and industrial lubricants such as engine and hydraulic oils interoil was founded in  and is based in cairns australia the gas discovery in new guinea is only the beginning for this company lng is the future httpwwwmarketoraclecoukarticlehtml   interoil ioc is a canadian integrated exploration assets refinery near distribution monopoly located in papua new guinea png after having struck two earlier profusely flowing natural gas and liquids wells flowing at  and mmcfd respectively they hit an absolute killer with antelope which flowed at a whopping mmcfd httpstockchartscomhscuisnatgaspwyrmndyidp     record well summing up a few findings mmcfd with the pipe only  open for safety reasons and the log indicated that the permeability at the top did not allow the lower section of the reservoir to contribute to the flow test that is all the gas just came from the top  of the reservoir bbd in condensates  meters ft of net pay zone which is more than three times the size of the biggest american well ft and the gas  water contact has not even been determined yet the largest calculated absolute open flow caof at  billion cubic feet of natural gas per day  average porosity from the seismics the antelope field is  x  kilometres let’s put that in perspective just three wells flow mmcfd more than enough to supply the daily needs of an lng facility this is roughly equivalent to the daily productivity of southwestern energy swn enterprise value of  billion it is larger than the daily production of ultra petroleum upl enterprise value of roughly  billion the recordbreaking well by itself has larger daily production than the entire corporation of range resources enterprise value  billion and all that with just three wells with seismics indicating plenty of potential left for more this leads to another important point how interoil’s location and quality of its resource provides it with a large cost advantage over most competitors for the most lucrative lng market in the world asia pacific cost advantages png is located next to the world’s most lucrative lng market asia pacific png is a very low cost location and has a rather business friendly regulation which put resources located here at a considerable advantage australia has emerged as the next big lng play for asia pacific but its labour tax and regulation costs are a multiple of those in png yet tens of billions of dollars are going into these australian coal seam projects even in today’s low energy and credit constrained environment and where interoil can supply a lng facility from just three wells coal seam gas projects need to drill treat and man literally thousands of wells interoil’s planned lng facility is estimated at just  billion low for international standards even a rival comparable project on the same cheap png location led by oilsearch and exxon xom is budgeted at  billion for a  million tonne per annum facility interoil’s facility will have a capacity of m tonne the interoil project is cheaper because the gas comes from a single resouce and unlike oilsearch important infrastructure is already in place interoil does not have to build a harbor housing power facilities water facilities deep water jetty system interoil already has land rights and their pipeline is less than half the distance and is not in the mountainous terrain of the highlands like exxon  oilsearch’s what will happen next  determining the condensate ratio at depth and looking for oil this will be done by sidetracking antelope and proceed with three dst tests for the condensates which increase with depths and oil within the next  days the first three dst tests will not deliver a ‘wow’ factor their aim is to find out the gas  condensate ratio at different depths this is a necessary task for getting a grip on designing the best way to produce these condensates a wow factor might come from the last dst test specifically to test an interval where there might be oil csiro the famed australian engineering bureau has commented that the gas is likely to come from an oil system so there is a reasonable chance there is oil somewhere in antelope however oil has a habit of migrating to unexpected places so actually locating it might be problematic  reserve reports these might not provide much ‘wow’ factor either as these reports tend to concentrate on what can be proven now not on how much more there might very well be according to seismics so they have a conservative bias and are unlikely to come close to the numbers going around on the boards tcf or interoil tcf getting reserves on the books is significant interoil doesn’t have any now and exploration companies are mostly valued on their reserves also any reasonable doubt about whether interoil has enough gas to support an lng facility will disappear  selling up to a  stake after preliminary discussions with major oil companies national oil companies and international natural gas utilities interoil and its advisors will determine the most suitable industry farmin to acquire up to  interest in its lng assets interoil has retained the services of bnp paribas bnpqypk and abn ambro abn as advisors there is no shortage in potential partners two categories are most likely asian utilities and big oil companies the latter are looking to add reserves in a world where more and more resources are nationalized the former are trying to secure longterm energy supplies as a matter of national security both parties have longterm horizons and deep pockets and the extraordinary economics of their elk  antelope discovery ensure that it’s one of the most competitive natural gas resources to develop getting the gas condensates out would improve the economics even more as it provides early cashflow further derisking the project valuation raymond james in a recent research report used two valuation methods a net asset valuation nav and comparing it with similar deals for the nav exercise they used the following assumptions tcf of gas   working interest  risk factor mcf multiple very conservative in the light of “asia’s premium priced typically mcf lng market and valuations in the depressed us gas market typically  to mcf and mmbbls of condensates at  per barrel and risked the same way they arrive at a nav of  per share roughly  times current prices with substantial upside to both the amount of gas its valuation and reducing the risk factor with independent reserve reports perhaps even more interesting was raymond james comparing a possible interoil deal with nippon oil buying agl’s  stake in the png exploration interest and lng facility planned by oilsearch and exxon for  million last december arguing interoil’s assets are comparable to those for sale in the above transaction a  stake would fetch  billion and put the enterprise value at a whopping  billion all this suggests that longerterm this stock can only move in one way and that is up  with regards  to

httpfinanceyahoocomnewsinteroilrecoversoilfromiwhtml analyst pavel molchanov  an important point to underscore is that our risked navshare of  detailed in our march  comment  nearly twice the current share price  gives credit only for natural gas and condensate resource based on the yearend  independent reserve report the nav does not give any credit for prospective oil resource so any such resource represents pure option value  the proverbial icing on the cake   monday september   interoil issues statement regarding proposed lng project in papua new guinea company pleased with support

government of papua new guinea signs interoil’s lng project agreement government of papua new guinea to take  cairns australia and houston tx  december   pomsox ioc today announced that the png national government has signed the company’s project agreement for the construction of a liquefied natural gas lng plant in papua new guinea following approval of the project agreement by the national executive council on december  the minister for petroleum hon william duma and acting governorgeneral dr allan marat signed the agreement securing png’s second lng project the signing was witnessed by the prime minister sir michael somare the agreement sets fiscal terms for a twenty year period which include a  company tax rate and certain exemptions applicable to large scale projects of this nature it also provides for a  ownership stake to be held by the government of papua new guinea’s nominee petromin png holdings limited a further  ownership stake will be taken by landowners directly affected by the plant as previously announced the proposed lng project would be developed by interoil and its joint venture partners pacific lng operations ltd and petromin png holdings limited the project targets a  to  billion lng facility with multiple trains additionally the agreement provides for the expansion of the plant up to  million tons per annum mmtpa while current plans call for first production of lng towards the end of  or beginning of  interoil is progressing a proposed liquids stripping plant to be located in gulf province in late early  which would provide an attractive revenue stream prior to the commissioning of the lng plant sir michael somare prime minister of papua new guinea stated “the government of papua new guinea through its long standing partnership with interoil has secured an ownership stake across the entire value chain from wellhead to lng offtake in a world class energy development project that will significantly contribute to national prosperity and fiscal security for many years to come the national equity interest to be held by the state’s nominee petromin png holdings limited aligns the country’s economic interests with its partners and provides strategic assets for national security”  interoil corporation nyse ioc   february      antelope reaches total vertical depth preparations for horizontal extension under way cairns australia
