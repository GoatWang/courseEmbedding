the truth about layla living with cancer and the biggest fan under the distribution agreements goliath will receive  of the gross revenues for each picture it distributes in general the companys distribution contracts cover both domestic and international licensing agreements however for the picture the biggest fan the company obtained limited distribution rights no revenue has been recognized to date production agreements on march   we signed a distribution agreement with mar vista entertainment llc to distribute a feature length motion picture currently in postproduction by us per the agreement we will receive  in advance payments per an agreed delivery schedule for providing distribution rights on the motion picture bridal bootcamp a romantic comedy movie being produced by us to mar vista entertainment llc additionally mar vista entertainment llc will receive  of the gross proceeds for a period of  years on the motion picture as of july   we have received  of the advance payments subsequent to july   we have received an additional  on september   we signed a distribution agreement with mar vista entertainment llc to distribute a feature length motion picture currently completed by us per the agreement we will receive  in advance payments per an agreed delivery schedule for providing distribution rights on the motion picture merry exes a christmas holiday movie being produced by us to mar vista entertainment llc additionally mar vista entertainment llc will receive  of the gross proceeds for a period of  years on the motion picture as of july   we have

schedule for providing distribution rights on the motion picture terror birds a science fiction movie produced by us to mar vista entertainment llc additionally mar vista entertainment llc will

this film on april   we signed an agreement whereby we agreed to invest  to kko productions to produce a feature length motion picture known as forgiven per the agreement we will receive  of adjusted gross proceeds after its initial investment has been entirely recouped through adjusted gross proceed additionally we will receive two on screen credits as executive producer as well as receiving credit on all advertising publicity and packaging of the motion picture the investment of  presented in other assets on the balance sheet has not yet been repaid due to the fact that no revenues will be generated until this motion pictures released what is the timeline for your activities during the next  months over the next  days to one year our efforts will be concentrated on developing and producing content with distributors for licensing by them of at least three projects what is this going to cost you we expect that producing the aforementioned content will cost approximately  per project however licensing and distribution will be handled by an experienced distributor for a fee of anywhere from    and the costs of advertising and marketing will be handled by them and charged against gross distribution licensing proceeds why are these motion pictures not being distributed already the motion pictures that are being produced by the company and distributed by mar vista entertainment llc take anywhere from six to nine months from completion of production and delivery to obtain licensing agreements generically the main reason why good quality motion pictures are not distributed is that the production of a motion picture requires money and creativity and marketing a motion picture requires an entirely different set of skills many people dream of making a movie few aspire to distribute them we estimate that there are in excess of  such motion pictures gathering dust there also have been and continue to be substantial tax incentives for motion picture production in many states and international territories so that many producers do not need to depend on successful marketing in order to find investors for their projects a secondary factor is the difficulty of finding a reputable distributor we think that our management has an excellent reputation in the industry and we will be able to obtain distribution rights for content finally many distributors as well as buyers do not have an interest in niche market films because they see the market as limited goliath sees the problem to be rather there is no market merely because no one has assembled a critical mass of films for these niches most participants in the motion picture industry are based in hollywood and the major coastal metropolitan areas our faithbased films especially are targeted toward the bible belt and the flyover country places that the industry has consistently overlooked why are you able to identify and acquire these motion pictures and educational videos after attending all the major content acquisition markets around the world over the last three years our staff has developed relationships with numerous quality filmmakers who need assistance in marketing and distributing their product goliath has also developed vital relationships with many of the major content distributors and networks many of the filmmakers have requested the companys assistance in marketing and distributing their product goliath will continue to pursue the marketing and distribution of product that is demanded in the marketplace and desired by major aggregators distributors networks and studios so how are you different than amazon netflix blockbuster and hulu to name a few how can you compete with them they have a lot of money and name recognition why wouldnt they jump into your niches as a content provider we are not competing with these entities but rather are working on providing them with quality content as an example netflix has such a high demand for programming content they are spending  billion this year for the acquisition of completed programming as well as for the development of original content by them therefore as is mentioned part of their resources are directed toward acquiring content and part is targeting inhouse and joint venture production of quality content this content will be targeted to their subscription base on a domestic and international level there are a number of quality content producers that work with the major networks and content distributors goliath is moving toward becoming one of these content providers we believe there exists significant opportunities for our company in that the demand for programming is increasing almost exponentially irrespective of the platform for viewing by the consumersubscriber the demand for quality content is continuing to expand as an example there are currently approximately  original scripted programs being aired in the entire television universe  a cancellation rate of  reflects a number that represents the entire programming universe in the late s and early s the upward trend is ongoing which is where we see an opportunity for goliath to provide product to reach many components of the overall market dont cable and satellite networks already offer specialty channels like tbn for faith based and bet black entertainment television for the africanamerican community as mentioned above about netflix even though these channels maybe in niche markets they must expand the type genre and format of the content that they are showing in order to remain viable therefore the opportunity to assist them by providing quality programming is ongoing and expanding what other niches are you looking at entering we believe that there is an increasing and ongoing trend in home entertainment in servicing niches many viewers have cable or satellite service with hundreds of channels but view only a few channels that cater to their particular interests one significant type of niche we are targeting are the numerous immigrant groups in the united states other than spanish speaking immigrants coverage is scarce the last official data  from the us census bureau is that  million persons in the us are foreign born with  from latin america  from asia and  from europe foreignborn immigrants like to watch movies from their home countries there are many interest groups that might be interested in specialty movies or programming as an example in hawaii and southern california for instance surfing is quite popular and there exists a huge body of surfing films which would be of interest what about ancillary markets we plan to incorporate advertising and marketing through social media and traditional outlets to the highest degree possible what films do you have now in inventory we presently have acquired the distribution rights to the following motion pictures  seducing spirits the perfect argument marina murders film struggle divorce in america a wonderful summer the truth about layla living with cancer the biggest fan days of redemption on borrowed time tumbleweed virus x farewell buddies and the pit under the distribution agreements goliath will receive  of the gross revenues for each of the pictures we distribute in general our distribution contracts cover both domestic and international licensing agreements however for the picture the biggest fan we obtained limited distribution rights how do these distribution rights work we enter into a distribution agreement for each motion picture terms may be perpetual or limited by years the motion pictures that we are acquiring with the proceeds of this offering will have a term of five years we will generally obtain a fee of  to  of gross revenues licensing will be flexible for usage applications on a yearly or multiyear basis most markets especially foreign territories have a tendency to continuously renew content licensing how many employees do you have do you have an office we have just  employees and we believe that is sufficient during the development production and content aggregation phase of our development our administrative office is in marina del rey california do you have a website our website is wwwgoliathfilmandmediainternationalcom we have a mirror site at wwwgoliathfilmandmediacom critical accounting policies and estimates the sec has defined a companys
