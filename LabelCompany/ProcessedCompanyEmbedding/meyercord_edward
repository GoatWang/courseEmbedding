will turn the call over to extremes president and ceo ed meyercord for his opening comments edward meyercord thank you laurie and thank you all for joining us this afternoon today were pleased to announce solid third quarter results that beat our earnings per share guidance of  by  and more than tripled our earnings per share from the march quarter a year ago the results underscore the success of our accretive acquisition of the wing wireless business from zebra which drove  yearoveryear top line growth and significantly increased cash flow during the quarter the results also reflect the improved profitability and quality of our core extreme networking business this makes  consecutive quarters that our extreme team has met or exceeded our earnings guidance we came up short of where we wanted to be on the revenue side but we more than made up for it with higherquality solution sales stronger gross margins and aggressive cost controls the march quarter was an unusually busy quarter for us with many projects taking place behind the scenes in addition to the integration of the zebra wireless lan assets that are now consolidated into our normal business operations we realigned our workforce to take advantage of expanding wireless opportunities and new geographies and to accelerate the achievement of our target operating income margins and we went live with a major it conversion to a new platform supporting our global service sales and service delivery operations retiring a yearold civil system the project with our new master data management system lays important groundwork for scaled operations in the future in addition to this we announced the avaya and brocade deals during the quarter which ill provide more detail on later in the call we believe the result of all the recent initiatives will be transformative extreme will be a clear leader in the enterprise networking industry with the   the  market share position and the new extreme will have the important distinction of being the only pureplay endtoend provider weve strengthened our profitability with improved sales productivity and operating efficiency and weve built the foundation for a scalable operating and it systems infrastructure to support well over  billion global revenue base after we integrate the avaya and brocade transactions turning to our financial results our  yearoveryear growth in revenue was driven primarily by wireless both from a full quarter of our new wing wireless products which performed slightly ahead of expectations for the quarter and yearoveryear growth in our traditional extremewireless products orders from large retailers and transportation logistics customers many of whom fall in the fortune  were in our top  deals in the americas and emea regions we saw approximately  million in crossselling revenue synergy across wing wireless and extremeswitching portfolios during the quarter we expect these crossselling activities to gain momentum throughout future quarters in the march quarter we drove higher gross margins to over  up  basis points yearoveryear and ahead of our street guidance we achieved this while onboarding wing wireless revenue that was projected to be in the low  range our field sales teams have done an excellent job reining in discounts and positioning higherquality solutions versus box selling were realizing benefits and see continued savings opportunities in our supply chain operations and we have several ongoing initiatives relating to software licensing product life cycle management partner programs supply chain and discounting policies to continue driving toward our  goal from a strategic perspective our execution of the zebra acquisition is validating our thesis to pursue accretive acquisitions recent results and our outlook highlight that this acquisition is going better than expected wireless is becoming a bigger driver of the entire edge solution including wired and the wing wireless customers are outspoken and have responded favorably to our  insource support model the level of extreme responsiveness and our solutions approach to their digital business needs it is opening doors to other significant networking opportunities even into the data center of some of these large fortune  enterprise accounts we see customer demand for a networking alternative to the larger industry players with highly competitive solutions from the wireless and wired edge through the aggregation layer core and data center there is demand for vertically driven solutions that solve customer issues as they migrate to digital wireless and hybrid cloud environments and finally enterprise customers value superior customer support that comes with a lower total cost of ownership a customer example is one of the worlds largest logistics companies that relies on more than  of our access points and our wireless intrusion protection software to track millions of packages each day they want us to compete for their wired edge and expressed interest in our fabric technology and opened up discussions with their data center team other examples are german manufacturing customers large health care providers in the us primary and higher education customers in all of our geos that now have expanded solutions complemented with zebra avaya or brocade the customer and partner community response to our deal announcements has been terrific at closing we will have greater penetration in our target verticals with critical reference accounts and we will have over  new enterprise customers we will offer expanded solutions to avayas vos and vosbased platform customers leveraging their highly automated agile and secure fabric technologies on the brocade side we will offer expanded solutions including the new agile and automated slx platform into thousands of largescale enterprise customers while we continue to support and innovate on the bdx switching and mlx routing platforms our engineering and product management teams from extreme avaya and brocade are already meeting and are working collaboratively on our combined technology vision and future road map we will benefit from the newly refreshed platform releases for both avaya and brocade with vos and slx platforms and advanced fabric technologies that bring security visibility automation resiliency and flexibility into the data center and campus networks at any scale each of our companies has been driving independently toward a brightbox model a common technology base where we support simple form factors built on merchant silicon and a common linux base our collective vision is to provide the industrys first fully customizable networking platforms powered by a set of services and functions access through a cloud  a common cloud library of features were early in the process but theres a lot of excitement within our teams about building on our leadership position in enterprise networking in the near term and in all cases our customer technology and product strategy for avaya and brocade will be the same as zebra business as usual we will provide our prospective customers partners and distributors continuity of product line were mapping a path forward at natural technology inflection points without disrupting customer environments as far as the status of the avaya transaction at this point were unaware of any other bidders involved in avayas bankruptcy sale process we will have more clarity after the may  sale hearing were working closely with the avaya teams on business and operations integration planning and are excited about the quality of talent we will onboard if our deal is approved in the auction process we will expect to close the transaction in the early july time frame with respect to brocade their leadership has been very engaged and helpful with our integration planning process were excited about the talent we will bring to extreme and the enthusiasm they are bringing to our pureplay networking vision broadcom and brocade have indicated they expect their transaction will close in broadcoms fiscal third quarter ending in late july and we will expect to close our transaction within  days of that day as a reminder we will be hosting an investor conference in new york city on friday morning june  we will have our senior leadership present and cover our technology vision product road map and gotomarket strategy for the new extreme we hope you can  hope you can join us finally turning back to our financial outlook were expecting more than  yearoveryear revenue growth in the fourth quarter that includes organic growth in core extreme were launching our first multirate switching platforms this quarter with our x highdensity gigabit switches suited for topofrack and leafandspine architectures while the new extremeswitching x and xg ethernet multirate switches support  gig  gig and  gig data rates this has been much anticipated in the field and fills an important product gap for us we also released our retail guest analytics solution as part of our new extreme wing wireless offerings we have upside strength in our pipeline in the americas and high confidence levels in all geos we expect continued gross margin improvement and maintain our long term objective to drive gross margins in excess of  also were projecting doubledigit operating income margins in the fourth quarter we expect our yearoveryear earnings per share to grow by more than  with that ill turn it over to drew to review our results and guidance in detail benjamin davies thanks ed first i would like to start with a few financial highlights from our third fiscal quarter of  specifically the increase in our gross margin and the strong growth in our earnings and free cash flow as compared to the same period last year discounting improvements enhanced operational efficiencies and contributions from the acquired wireless lan business from zebra drove the increases in our gross margin and earnings free cash flow growth benefited from profitability and accretion and accounts receivable collections from the wireless lan business these are all strong indications that were on our way to achieving our margin target numbers i would like to now briefly cover the financial highlights of the quarter and encourage you to refer to our earnings presentation that has been posted on our ir website for more details now lets move to the third fiscal quarter results starting with revenue q  revenue was  million compared to  million in q and  million in q a year ago our revenue increased  yearoveryear was driven by the additional revenue from the acquired wireless lan business partially offset by backend linearity of the quarter and discipline over discounting the geographic split of our revenues were as follows north america contributed    to total revenue emea contributed  asia pacific contributed  and latin america contributed  product revenue for q was  million compared to  million in q and  million in q last year q service revenue was  million compared to  million in q and  million in q last year moving on to gross margin and operating expenses in q gaap gross margin was  compared to  in q and  in q last year nongaap gross margin was  and compares to  in q and  in q last year a  basis point increase from the yearago period our nongaap gross margins grew significantly driven primarily by improvements in discounting reduced supply chain costs and the increase in service revenue partially offset by the impact of blending the lower gross margins with the new wireless lan business id also like to add that our nongaap product margin was up  basis points yearoveryear for q q gaap operating expenses were  million compared to  million in q and  million in q last year in addition to the ongoing amortization of intangibles and stockbased compensation charges q gaap operating expense includes charges of  million for integration and restructuring cost related to the acquisition of the wireless lan business and our exit of certain leased facilities q nongaap operating expenses were  million compared to  million in q and  million in q of  the yearonyear increase in both gaap and nongaap operating expenses were mainly attributed to the additional operating expenses from the acquired wireless lan business third quarter gaap operating loss was  million compared to a loss of  million in q and compares to a loss of  million in fiscal q of  third quarter nongaap operating income was  million flat compared to  million in q and compares to operating income of  million in fiscal q of  our nongaap operating income margin improved to  up from  yearoveryear the increase was driven by our improvement in gross margin accretion of the zebra wireless lan acquisition and better controls of our operating expenses gaap net loss for q was  million or  per share compared to a loss of  million or  per share in q and a net loss of  million or  per share in q last year nongaap net income for the quarter was  million or  per diluted share compared to net income of  million or  per diluted share in q and net income of  million or  per diluted share in q of  turning to the balance sheet q total cash and cash equivalents ended the quarter at  million up  million from last quarter and up  million from q of fiscal  our cash balance was net of the  million deposit paid toward our bid for the avaya networking assets in the quarter cash flow from operations was  million compared to  million in q and  million in q last year free cash flow was  million compared to  million in q and  million in q last year the yearoveryear increase was attributed to improved profitability and accretion and accounts receivable collections from the wireless lan acquisition accounts receivables were  million at the end of q down  million from last quarter and up  million from q of fy  accounts receivable declined during the quarter was as  declined during the quarter as we collected all of the receivables purchased from the wireless lan business dso decreased to  days this quarter from  days in q and increased from  days in q of  inventory ended at  million up  from last quarter and down  million from q of  total debt outstanding at the end of q was  million compared to  million in q of fy  now lets move to the guidance for our fourth fiscal quarter we expect q revenue to be in the range of  million to  million representing a  to  increase compared to q last year gross  gaap gross margin is anticipated to be in the range of  and  and nongaap gross margin is anticipated to be in the range of  and  operating expenses are expected to be in a range of  million to  million on a gaap basis and  million to  million on a nongaap basis the sequential increase represents greater sales commissions on increased sales as well as increased headcount in sales as we fill open positions in apac and north america to better serve these markets we expect q interest expense to be  million tax expense is expected to be flat to q levels gaap net income is expected to be in the range of  million to  million or a profit of  to  per diluted share it note that this is  this guidance represents the first quarterly gaap net income for extreme networks since the fourth fiscal quarter of  nongaap net income is expected to be in the range of  million to  million or  to  per diluted share the average shares outstanding are expected to be  million on a gaap basis and on a nongaap basis the guidance we have provided for q does not include the impact of the avaya networking business or the brocade data center networking business acquisitions our current expectation is that the avaya networking transaction closes in early july and the broadcom networking transaction closes in our first fiscal quarter of  we will provide additional guidance for each transaction as the close dates become more definitive it with that i will now open it up for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of matt robison with wunderlich matthew robison yes just i guess obvious question is maybe you could help us understand a little bit more about the revenue story coming in under your expectations and what youve learned that gives you confidence that youll be able to achieve the guidance youve given for the current quarter edward meyercord thanks matt this is ed yes for some reason it was a very backendloaded quarter we had really high percentage of the orders that came in right at the bitter end it put pressure on supply chain and getting product out the door and i commented earlier that i dont want to get into dealbydeal specifics but that was clearly a factor and so some of that will spill over into q and thats one of the reasons why we have confidence the other thing going on is that were being more stingy out in the field were selling more solutions and were being more disciplined around lower margin opportunities that are going our way and so were turning away a fair number of deals and id say we probably turned away a bit more than we expected matthew robison okay so why  so if you hadnt been so stingy you would have been at the bottom of your range or obviously it worked you got to the bottom line number and the margins were nice but edward meyercord yes indiscernible going through different deals and we could recreate our revenue and gross margin or better look at the end of the day i think if we werent as backend loaded that alone would have put us right up where we needed to be and then i think theres just additional pressure because of the discipline on the sales side matthew robison were there any  how does that map in the verticals or regions the backendloadedness edward meyercord yes the americas was strong a little softness in emea on a relative basis apac steady over last year were seeing  we have new leadership there were expecting a pretty nice rebound in that region were also expecting emea  the teams in all of our geos have a lot of confidence in their commit levels and the pipeline weve got and weve built in a little extra conservativism in our methodologies around how were forecasting so i hope thats helpful operator your next question comes from the line of mark kelleher with da davidson mark kelleher just as a quick followup to that because of the backend loading does that mean youve got greater backlog going into the june quarter does that give you some better confidence in that quarter edward meyercord mark this is ed yes it does mark kelleher okay and then on the  is there a way you can size up the zebra contribution or maybe give us some feel for what the organic growth would have been without zebra edward meyercord yes so i  with respect to zebra zebra came in in line with our expectations maybe even slightly ahead the big plus from zebra is that the gross margins were better than we had expected so that contributed to gross margin strength i think weve guided previously to say that were at  million to benjamin davies  million to  million is what we guided before edward meyercord  million to  million benjamin davies yes and we were in that range even a little better than our forecast mark kelleher okay and with regard to the acquisitions i assume its still too early to be having any communication with either of those groups right theres no way to kind of coordinate and im just thinking that brocade is a indiscernible edward meyercord no thats indiscernible thats not the case we actively working mark kelleher oh you are okay edward meyercord actively working cross functionally with both avaya and brocade teams we have a cross functions and weve been doing a lot of work our teams have been working collaboratively where we have conference rooms filled with brocade avaya and extreme teams hammering through our vision our technology vision our product roadmap and how this is all going to come together over the next  years our teams are working on business integration technology integration from an operating platform perspective when we look at quotetocash cycles and were actively working as i mentioned before were not aware of any other bidders in the avaya process i should also say we think we would know were pretty certain that we would know if there were bidders so at this point were locked and loaded and were already working on combining the companies the same thing with brocade we have a signed deal with brocade and broadcom so as soon as that deal closes then were going to be positioned to close within  days of that were actively working on the combination of the  companies very excited about the amazing customers that these companies have and how theyre going to fold in and how it fits into our enterprise vision the talented people there are some terrific resources that were picking up and as the ceo of the company the chemistry of the teams and the enthusiasm and energy around pureplay networking its fun to be around so the teams are really excited and its going to be a busy summer operator your next question comes from the line of alex henderson with needham alexander henderson so a couple of quick questions first one i just wanted to go back to the organic growth of extreme versus the acquisition i think if i back that out you were  or  organic growth excluding the acquisition and i know thats a little bit of a mixed calculation because you merged  teams and obviously theres some crossselling going on in there so is that a correct estimate roughly edward meyercord alex i  let me comment and i could let drew jump in if he wants to because of the backended nature and what we pushed we were down probably   yearoveryear on the extreme side i think we would have been right there we would have been flat as i mentioned before were projecting modest organic growth in the extreme business in q alexander henderson okay so second question is going at these deals where youve decided to be more aggressive about getting your price as opposed to giving discounts which is a great thing to do and im totally for it but the question is are you losing those customers or are they just saying well im not going to buy it if im not going to get a discount and theyre still sitting out there with the older equipment having not replaced it or somebody else getting in and putting gear in is it a competitive situation or are you in fact just not getting the deal because i wanted a discount or im not going to do it edward meyercord alex im not sure youre going to like the answer its a combination of both weve got  we have    orders in the quarter approximately and then when were looking at discount authorizations theres tens and tens and tens of different deals that come through in some cases its business that we probably dont want and were going to let that go in other cases maybe deals get pushed out or maybe the purchase decision is delayed alexander henderson the reason i asked the question is a lot of people wont buy a deal buy something that they want until the sales on and if  it often happens is that theyll wait and theyll think well ill get it next quarter at the end of the quarter and then that doesnt happen then after a couple of quarters of waiting they finally say i really do need the equipment and step up is there some pentup demand do you think as a result of this approach that sitting there going id like to buy it but im not getting the price and eventually theyll cave edward meyercord alex its a tough call id hope that thats the case but its really hard for us to say what i will say is we have held the line on discounting right up through the end of the quarter so historically you might have seen some gross margin degradation or discount increases towards the end of the quarter and our teams are doing a terrific job of holding the line we really  we give a lot of credit to the field and the new approach and the leadership team and how theyre running the business alexander henderson the other question on conditions clearly europe is a little bit soft its pretty much every company thats reported so far can you talk to what percentage of your european business is related to uk which is going through some transitional issues as well as france which has got an election going on that was scaring people is that part of whats causing some of the flux there or is it just execution in the environment ambiently is it similar in germany for instance as it would be in those other two edward meyercord it is for us germany is our strongest market in emea and the  that team continues to perform well and we see the market remaining strong for extreme we have seen some disruption in the uk its hard to call how brexitrelated it is or to put our finger on exactly whats going on there we have a lot of initiatives underway to turn that around we also have strong market position in middle east and some markets like turkey for example where theres been a lot of unrest and a lot of things going on in that market and  that weve seen some business slide there but overall were bullish on emea and the  some of the softness we had this quarter our teams think that theyre going to get it back in the fourth benjamin davies we also had some softness in oildependent countries as well so kind of the whole emea and middle east edward meyercord yes alexander henderson so it sounds like the pretty broad mix of areas that had some pressure one last question and ill cede the floor as youre thinking about being a  billionplus revenue company post these deals obviously i would think you would benefit enormously on the purchasing scale have you had any discussions with your suppliers on what the benefit of that might look like and what kind of margin improvement you could get as a result of volume discounts as you aggregate these product lines and any thought on how much of the product purchasing youre doing can actually be aggregated without having to redesign the parts so that theyre common edward meyercord yes and this goes back to marks question were  our teams are actively working this and the answer is yes we see a lot of opportunities we have opportunities to leverage our relationship with broadcom our largest vendor or supplier and then with our manufacturers were seeing a lot of opportunities so its a work in process itd be premature for me to try to provide specific guidance but we do expect it to get to our  gross margin objective next year and we think thats only going to be accelerated with these acquisitions obviously from an operating income perspective theres operating leverage with the businesses that were bringing over so theres a fair amount of synergies so we will expect to see leverage on the operating income line as well alexander henderson can you at least address what portion of the parts are common and what portion of the parts would need to be redesigned in order to get commonality to get this  the volume benefits edward meyercord yes i mean were all  were using the merchant silicon theres overlap in some of our suppliers and therere some new opportunities its  it would be a bit premature for me to comment specifically on that maybe we can take it offline after the call operator your next question comes from the line of simon leopold with raymond james simon leopold great a couple of things i just want to follow up on one was maybe rather than focusing on the organic inorganic if we could get a sense of what portion of total product revenue was directly related to wireless lan edward meyercord sure wireless lan was over  for the quarter thats helpful i dont know if theres any other comments that you want to add drew thats the number benjamin davies yes no thats it its growing yes simon leopold okay and then i guess the other thing i want to come back to is within your prepared remarks you sounded more constructive on your own highend ethernet switching elements and then with the acquisition from brocade avago youd be picking up some other data center higherperformance ethernet switches that puts you into a somewhat different competitive environment than youve been traditionally thats going to put more weight of you facing off with companies like juniper and arista and not just cisco and hp can you talk a little bit about how that shift in the competitive landscape affects your strategy edward meyercord sure interestingly it doesnt really change our strategy simon it just gives us more ways to sell into existing customers you might be surprised to learn how many fortune  customers we have that are using  that we acquired through zebra and that extreme supports anyway we have  i gave an example of a very large fortune  logistics company that is  were a very strategic supplier of that company and they really like the quality of service that theyre getting for us the level of attention that were providing out of the edge they want to expand our presence at the edge and theyve invited in and now were having discussions with their data center teams about fabric and our switching technologies now its the higher end of the enterprise so were still focused on the enterprise were endtoend wired wireless from the wired and wireless edge all the way through the data center now with brocade youre right were a much larger data center we really see the competition there being cisco hp and that market is buying through arista arista has been very vertically focused were not sure if were overlapped now with arista but we may see more of them its really going to be a continued competition with cisco and hp operator operator instructions and your next question comes from the line of al tobia with sidus alfred tobia ed ive a couple of questions first was the large deals from the zebra side of things i know that there were some figure deals that were out there have any closed or do you expect any in june edward meyercord yes the answer  zebra has very large customers retail transportation logistics and typically the order sizes are a lot larger were looking  in terms of the pipeline theres a lot of big deals out there with these kinds of customers and as i mentioned to simon before what were excited about is the fact that there are opportunities to sell other products into these customers and were excited about those opportunities benjamin davies just this quarter al  of our top  deals came on the zebra side alfred tobia okay but i think when we spoke you said that there were about  to  of these sort of needlemoving deals that were around and you hadnt forecasted and they hadnt materialized so did any really large deals close in the quarter or no edward meyercord no alfred tobia okay second thing is the backend loading regarding the june linearities just what youve seen so far through april did you  was april above normal linearity edward meyercord yes alfred tobia okay then the  operating margin target that was given if i remember correctly before the brocade and the avaya deals it was said that based on zebra that you would be able to do  in the september quarter so is that still the case will you be able to do doubledigit margins without the impact of those deals in september edward meyercord well we got pretty close to it this quarter were not going to benjamin davies were forecasting in next quarter but youre talking about the september quarter right edward meyercord indiscernible the september quarter i dont think were going to forecast q at this time al but i think alfred tobia i thought the statement was you guys were going to be able to do doubledigit margins even in the seasonally weak quarters of  is that  am i indiscernible benjamin davies yes we just  i mean we just havent guided there yet and were very close i mean were  this quarter and last quarter and well be very close we just havent given guidance for q yet and by the time we do its going to be  its going to have revenues from both the avaya and brocade deals alfred tobia right okay and then just assuming those deals close on that time line the funding for them and the time at which you kind of pay down that debt to where youre sort of cashneutral on the balance sheet what are we looking at there roughly and then im done with my questions benjamin davies yes so kind of what we have left or what we have to borrow here is we have  well what we have left to pay so we paid a  million deposit on the avaya deal so weve got about  million left to pay on the avaya deal and  million on day  for the brocade deal so we need about  million were going to take about that much were still working on the final amendment to our credit agreement but well take roughly that amount it could be a little more a little less depending on our cash flows in q and our cash flow forecast for q and were expecting the cash flows from the new deals to really pay for the incremental debt within  to  quarters operator im showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference back to mr ed meyercord edward meyercord thank you well in closing id like to say im pleased with the progress that our team is making were executing well on our operating plan highlighted by  quarters in a row of delivering on our earnings guidance weve got exciting new growth opportunities that lie ahead with our new wireless lan customers innovative new product releases and the exciting expansion of our business once we close avaya and brocade which we expect will bring in in excess of  million of revenue and put us north of  billion an important milestone for extreme so id like to thank shareholders and customers for their continued support and all of our employees for all their hard work thank you and i look forward to seeing many of you at our june

mix of tactical advice to help his clients in the current business climate ed meyercord’s plan for extreme networks proves to be ‘better than most’ extreme networks continues industry consolidation with acquisition of brocade’s data center networking business email a friend to use commas to separate multiple email addresses from privacy policy thank you your message has been sent sorry there was an error emailing this page credit extreme networks related extreme swallows brocades data center networking business for m juniper takes a swipe at extreme’s network buying spree plans extreme networks buying avaya networking good for customers of both companies video mingis on tech the lowdown on cisco live any fan of the pga tour will never forget the “better than most” call by nbc’s gary koch on march   tiger woods stepped up to execute one of the most difficult putts of his career halfway to the hole koch uttered the words “better than most” as it looked like his putt was going to be a good one it wound up going in and that become yet another notable moment in tiger’s illustrious career where great execution was becoming the norm in the highly tumultuous networking market extreme networks’ ceo ed meyercord continues to make moves that are “better than most” putting his company in a position to be a longterm share gainer in a market that badly needs more strong vendors in late  extreme acquired zebra technologies’ wlan business for  million giving it instant credibility in some of zebra’s larger accounts such as fedex earlier this year extreme made a move to purchase avaya’s networking business by becoming the stalking horse bidder in the business unit that was put up for sale in avaya’s bankruptcy process yesterday extreme executed another deal that should be considered better than most when it announced it had entered into an agreement to purchase brocade’s data center switching routing and analytics business from broadcom following broadcom’s acquisition of brocade under the terms of the agreement brocade will sell those assets to extreme for  million which consist of  million at closing and  million to be paid in deferred payments as well as the additional profit sharing to be paid over a fiveyear term  what extreme networks will get from brocadeextreme will acquire the following products as part of the dealthe hardware portfolio of products includes brocade’s vdx mls and new slx hardware platforms all are great products but the new slx family has embedded visibility and devops like automation making it one of the most agile networking products available todayin addition to the hardware extreme will get the following  flow optimizer workflow composer and automation suites from the stackstorm acquisiton automation suites network visibility network analytics visibility manager packet broker virtual packet broker nva virtual tap vtap in michael cooney’s story about extreme’s purchase of brocade’s data center networking business he indicated that extreme was receiving all software but from what i understand the following assets will not be moving over to extreme brocade’s sdn controller network functions virtualization nfv software and manager vyatta virtual application delivery controller adc the price extreme is paying is a tremendous deal for a business unit that extreme is expecting to do  million in revenue and now puts the company well over a billion dollars making it the largest pureplay networking vendor and the  vendor by share to hpe and of course ciscowhy the deal with brocadebroadcom is notablethis deal will be significant to extreme in a number of ways first the brocade data center business has very little overlap with existing business extreme and avaya networking sell data center equipment to many enterprises but not many would be considered the type of organization whose business is the data center brocade has many customers where data center performance means everything these are large universities with networks that power rd media companies that are sending massive amount of video over the network and government institutions these are all very sophisticated customers with demanding requirements and they chose brocade for the quality and performance of productsextreme’s customers and resellers should benefit from the strength of the portfolio as well as the software capabilities workflow composer is an outstanding platform that can automate many of the repetitive tasks in a data center eliminating the possibility of human error and speeding up provisioning by orders of magnitudewhat’s interesting to note about zebra avaya networking and brocade data center is that each of those vendors has core businesses that are not networking but had allocated a significant amount of rd into building their latest products the technology from the purchased companies is as good or better than anyone’s but since networking wasn’t the core of the business the new products were slow to ramp so now extreme is benefitting from the rd these companies did with new products that can be used to win customers that they may not have been able to with the existing product line broadcom benefits toofor broadcom one might look at the purchase price and scratch their heads considering the wifi and access business is being sold for  million to arris on the surface it appears that extreme is the big winner in this but in actuality broadcom benefits too broadcom chips are used in almost every network vendor’s products and it benefits the company to have larger network vendors that can push one another into adopting the new silicon faster to keep up with the competition a few larger vendors with more resources are better than a bunch of small ones that can’t absorb new technology too fast customers of brocade avaya and extreme should not be concerned as extreme isn’t planning any major disruption to products any time soon meyercord has repeatedly told me they will do what is best for the customer and they are committed to that statement for the long hauli suspect that extreme isn’t finished with its ma activities yet and i expect that whatever they choose to do next we will likely consider to be another move that was “better than most” as great execution is becoming the norm join the network world communities on facebook and linkedin to comment
