orientation    social networks rebecca van dyck is vp of consumer  brand marketing at facebook she has also held senior marketing leadership roles at such iconic marketing companies as levi strauss  co apple and nike’s advertising agency wiedenkennedy she spoke with kevin lane keller in march her edited remarks follow  the wonderful quality of marketing is that it is based on the successful blending of art and science you can’t let one half of that marketing equation become too heavy it really must be a balance of both ingredients  being a very datadriven company is a blessing and curse at facebook we know and can measure so much and we can get feedback so quickly that does help inform us and make our work better but we cant let that become too dominant there is something to be said for instincts and the art of the process for example we just finished a campaign in japan to increase downloads of our app and the number of people using facebook we had a lot of awesome information about people who already use it and people who didnt where they live and how to reach them and what they like and didn’t like about facebook but when it came down to it we couldnt just “paint by numbers” to get to the solution we had to use our creative instincts we worked with wiedenkennedy our agency in japan the creative teams there struggled a little bit until the creative director said “instead of trying to make this campaign solve the business problem for facebook have the campaign solve a more personal problem for your friendships and your relationships” so as they were developing the creative we asked the creative teams to use pictures of their own friends and family as soon as they did that the floodgates opened up and we were able to come up with very personal and relevant messaging for the japanese consumer it was so personal that was really great  one of the most innovative things we can do is to ensure some consistency with our brand for customers there’s so much talk about being innovative but i think that one of the most innovative things we can do is to retain some consistency for our customers its surprisingly hard for brands and marketers to do since we constantly strive for the next big thing and change almost to a fault what i mean by consistency in marketing is the generosity that comes from just standing still a little bit for our consumers so that they get to really know who we are  at levi’s for example the brand had grown to mean many different things in every corner of the world one of the big tasks we had as a market organization was to reduce and trim that down and get one brand voice around the world it was more important at the time for us to be consistent and to stay on the same track and use the same messaging for a while although that didnt mean that we couldnt execute it in innovative ways  the source of all wonderful marketing is the collective efforts from the many diverse people that make up your team im an athlete i played soccer all through college and my coach would always say that there was something different and good about each one of us he would then try to figure out what to pull out all of us based on our individual strengths for example i was really bad with my left foot and hes say “but rebecca you’re really fast so move twice as hard to get the ball onto your dominant foot and play that with strength” each of us had our own little special strength but it was a collection of all of our strengths and even little quirks that made us a strong team im thinking about that teambuilding approach a lot right now at facebook we’re in the process of building an inhouse creative marketing department were bringing in different strengths in different fields and looking for the unique strengths in everyone and figuring out how to make that a positive to the team overall im absolutely loving the process of bringing it all together   the more monosyllabic we become about who we are the more boring the work is we know that as a management technique it can be dangerous if companies are all made up of likeminded people similarly it is the diversity of skills the diversity of background and genders and ethnicities that makes our marketing much more authentic and rich and interesting but it can’t be just a pickup game there has to be strong leadership that same coach in college would say that he could make the game bend to his needs he could see the whole field and understand the competition and adjust the game we played to achieve our main goal which was winning at facebook an important part of the culture is that we are open and fluid and superdemocratic historically what that meant from a marketing standpoint was that everyone would share their work but ultimately they would decide what they felt was the right thing to do you had a bunch of people creatively solving problems their own way and it was admittedly kind of quirky and fun and interesting but now as were growing and building this team weve had to put in structured review processes and decisionmaking several teams may be working on the same problem but only one solution wins at the end of the day putting in some checks and balances is new culturally but it’s important to provide that sharp point that focus and that leadership  as a marketer there is something to be said for working at founderled companies i was fortunate to be doing nikes advertising when phil knight was running nike i was also at wiedenkennedy at the time when dan wieden was running the agency and i was at apple when steve jobs was running that company levis didnt have a founder around and we felt it here at facebook i again have the benefit of a founderled company it is important for marketers to understand not only who the consumer is—but to understand where the company has come from and what its vision is when you work at a founderled company whenever youre in trouble you can look to that person and imagine whats going through their mind and why they built this company in the first place that always helps ground us and bring us back to the product and brand truths at the same time you cant just look back it is super important to remember not only where youve come from but also recognize who is the spirit that is projecting the intent for the future as well   with facebook’s growth comes a great responsibility ive also been fortunate to work at companies in the past where marketing to the consumer is at the forefront of every conversation when i arrived at facebook however consumer marketing didnt exist as it did at my other companies it was a young company that was very busy making products making software—certainly for consumers but also just intrigued with the product creation process itself in the initial growth period for facebook a lot of product choices were about trying to get consumers to use it as much as possible the end goal was altruistically good certainly the more content you have from your friends the better it is for everyone thats the whole promise of the product  but with such an emphasis on growth we were often ahead of where the consumer was and what they were confortable with now weve matured and we recognize we have a great responsibility we have a lot of people who are using this product one of our marketing challenges is to show that we are going to be thoughtful and careful and generous and considerate with your experience and your information and your friends that is our awesome and important responsibility to our
