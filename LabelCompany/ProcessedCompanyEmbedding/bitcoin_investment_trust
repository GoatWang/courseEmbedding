product for ethereum classic etc in the first quarter of this year this will be the second investment product for the company the first was the bitcoin investment trust bit bitcoincom caught up with grayscale ceo and founder barry silbert to find out more about this new product also read needham probability of approval for a bitcoin etf ‘very low’  from bit to etc trust it has been over three years since grayscale launched its first product the bit on september   when the price of bitcoin was roughly  and the market cap was only about  billion modeled on the spdr® gold shares etf the trust was created for investors looking for bitcoin exposure by the end of last year it had  million in assets under management the bit has always been a private placement for accredited investors trading overthecounter now the company waiting to be listed on the nyse arca has ceased all private offerings but continues to trade on otcqx under the symbol gbtc as the bit begins its journey away from being a private vehicle for only accredited investors grayscale is introducing another private investment vehicle called the ‘ethereum etc investment trust‘ eit it allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of ethereum classic without actually owning any etc the etc investment trust according to silbert the new product is modeled after the bit “it will be an openended trust that holds etc” he described as such the trust can issue and redeem shares at any time regarding the decision to launch this new trust silbert told bitcoincom we’re excited about the potential for ethereum classic and the underlying token etc and believe there is demand from investors that would like to invest in a vehicle that enables them to participate in the price movement via a titled security etc is the newer of the two ethereum cryptocurrencies resulting from the july  hard fork of the ethereum blockchain it is “a continuation of the original ethereum blockchain – the classic version preserving untampered history free from external interference and subjective tampering of transactions” its website describes while etc is the original protocol and has fewer modifications than the other ethereum cryptocurrency eth many of the developers and the community behind ethereum have moved on to eth etc now trades on several exchanges including bitfinex and poloniex at press time the cryptocurrency is trading at us approximately half of its alltimehigh price from immediately after the split with a market cap of around  million for accredited investors silbert confirmed that the eit “will be launched as a private vehicle open to accredited investor” the grayscale website now describes its new product just as it did with the bit stating that the eit is not registered with the sec and the eit’s shares are being offered in a private placement pursuant to rule c under regulation d the securities act of  mandates all companies to register any securities with the sec that they are offering or selling however there are some exemptions such as one provided by regulation d reg d which allows a company to sell its securities to accredited investors without registering with the commission by filing form d ‘notice of exempt offering of securities’ there are many ways to qualify as an accredited investor for example anyone with a net worth exceeding  million or with an income of more than  in the two most recent years and reasonably expects the same for the current year is qualified while there is much to do before launching the eit silbert said the company is “planning to launch in q” adding that they are “waiting for the monetary policy supply cap to get finalized” what do you think of the etc trust let us know in the comments section below images courtesy of

advertise search bitcoin news news oped submit a press release press releases about bitcoin news advertise   featured january    by kevin helms      bitcoin investment trust could ipo by october bitcoin investment trust bit wants to be listed on nyse arca according to a registration statement filed friday with the us securities and exchange commission sec this is the second proposed bitcoin investment trust listing on the exchange the first solidx bitcoin trust has yet to be approved by the sec using solidx as a model it could take the commission until october to make a decision whether to approve or disapprove bit’s listing also read sec delays decision on solidx bitcoin trust  as donald trump prepared to be inaugurated as the th president of the united states on january  barry silbert filed a registration statement with the sec seeking an initial public offering ipo for his flagship fund bit bit’s shares are to be listed under the symbol gbtc on the nyse arca the ipo “this is an initial public offering of the trust’s shares” bit’s registration statement reads the shares “are designed to provide investors with a costeffective and convenient way to invest in bitcoin” grayscale investments llc is the sponsor of the trust delaware trust company is the trustee the bank of new york mellon is the transfer agent as well as the administrator and xapo inc is the custodian the annual fee for investors will remain at  percent the proposed maximum offering is  million of the trust’s shares silbert’s grayscale investments llc simultaneously announced that it “has ceased its ongoing private placement and will no longer issue shares of the bitcoin investment trust through its previous c private placement” however bit’s shares will continue to be quoted in the secondary market overthecounter on otcqx under the symbol gbtc while the registration with the sec is pending approval gbtc currently has assets under management of  million as of the end of december  possible time frame a possible time frame for the sec to either approve or disapprove bit’s listing on the nyse arca can be estimated using solidx bitcoin trust as an example solidx originally filed with the commission to list on the nyse arca on july   after the company’s initial filing the next step will be for the exchange to file with the sec “a proposed rule change to list and trade shares” under nyse arca equities rule  for solidx the nyse arca filed with the sec on july   which was two days after solidx filed given that bit’s filing was on a friday the nyse arca could file with the sec early next week then the proposed rule change would be published for comments in the federal register this usually happens between two to three weeks after a filing with the sec for solidx it was published on august   approximately three weeks after filing that means the proposed rule change for bit should be published in the federal register sometime in the second or third week of february after publishing in the federal register the commission has  days to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change however it can also extend that period by a maximum of  days if necessary which is a total of  days from the publication in the federal register for solidx the sec has already chosen to extend the consideration period as long as it could to march   for bit  days from a likely date of publication in the federal register would be early august and  days after that would be early october likelihood of approval the sec has a habit of delaying making decisions on bitcoin investment funds as seen by the delay for solidx taking the maximum time allowed by the securities exchange act recently needham  company which provides investment coverage of bit suggested that the chance of the sec approving bitcoin etfs is very low at less than  percent president trump according to needham there is no more extension available for the commission after the  days the firm also suggested that the commission may not make a decision by the deadline in which case “the proposed rule change is automatically approved” needham’s report reads the firm believes this will increase the likelihood of an etf being approved then there’s the ‘trump factor’ the new administration may be more bitcoin friendly than the previous administration “we need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in american businesses and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm american workers” president trump recently said do you think the sec will approve bit’s listing by october let us know in the comments section below images courtesy of wsj wikimedia grayscale sec solidx there are no bigger bitcoin believers than the bitcoincom team

prices have more or less inched up and at the turn of the year they started to approach record highs on thursday the value of a bitcoin reached  however later thursday morning prices suddenly fell by about  liquidity dried up—no shorts no sellers which means a volatile little bubble formed quickly peter smith chief executive of bitcoin wallet blockchain told cnbc those sudden ups and downs would be bad news for your portfolio although bitcoin had a more than  return on investment in  its also five times more volatile than the sp  said campbell harvey a professor of finance at duke university who described bitcoin as an extremely risky investment even if you were to buy bitcoin low and sell high you still might not see the big payday youre hoping for you try to sell it and by the time the order goes through the price may have dropped said matthew elbeck a professor of marketing at troy university its really really not worth it for the ordinary consumer if you do choose to take the plunge and buy a bitcoin make sure its a very small part of your diversified portfolio—and that you can afford to lose your investment i would never recommend this on a standalone basis harvey said still for some people living internationally—like venezuelans plagued with a shortage of cash and those in china where the government has restricted movement of capital outside of the country—bitcoin presents an attractive option to get ahold of cash harvey said its rising popularity in these countries are part of the reason behind bitcoins recent surge regardless of bitcoins ups and downs the technology behind it—particularly the blockchain the common ledger that the virtual currency uses—could have a longlasting impact as a medium of exchange as harvey told moneys taylor tepper in  should you invest in bitcoin that’s a decision you’ll have to make on your own but what you should consider are the fact that bitcoin still remains one of the most watched and speculated currencies of all time  here are a few very interesting fact regarding bitcoin and something to think about when pondering if this coin will rise to astronomic heights or shrivel and fade away it’s had it’s fair share major setbacks such as the silk road scandal mt gox collapsing which was one of the worlds biggest bitcoin exchanges and a host of other problems  yet it remains a new method of payment solution for a quickly growing number of large companies around the world there are only so many bitcoins available in the world  we cannot create more bitcoins like we do with money which only services to deflate the actual value of paper currencies  once all the bitcoins are released into the systems they will actually go up in value do to supply and demand  if bitcoin is adopted on a mass scale it’s value will in fact go up  just how much no one knows bitcoins work as a payment solution like paypal payza or those types of sites  it eliminates the need for the typical banking transaction fees associated with large volume transfers of money  with bitcoin any two parties can do business without borders and without fees  the general public still doesn’t understand this fact bitcoin is now processing more transactions than paypal and is less than th of it’s age deciding on whether to invest in bitcoins or not should not be based on it’s usdbitcoin pricing valuation at the moment  that number is no where near it’s real mark research bitcoin what it is used for what it would do for society and if you believe it’s going to be adopted then invest in it  never purchase what you cannot afford to lose and don’t take more risk than you are comfortable with decide how you want to invest in bitcoin as there are many ways to acquire it  you can and ride it’s price value then sell it  many currency traders use to handle their trades for them automatically  you can buy a select amount of coins and hold onto them  you can try your hand at and generate them that way no matter what you do bitcoin is sure a fun and interesting thing to watch  we hope you like this information and come back to visits soon please leave your comments below   bitcoin virtual money or risky investment by claes bell • bankratecom in an age when most of our money is little more than electrons in our banks computers it may feel like bitcoins and other virtual currencies arent that different from the dollars you directly deposit into your account each week or the k account that holds your nest egg but bitcoins are different it is an online currency that can be transferred through a computer or smartphone without an intermediate financial institution while its true that many investors these days experience their portfolios primarily as numbers on a computer screen owning a stock means you have a small piece of something thats at least partially tangible that is the company has offices factories and other assets similarly all those blips in your checking account can be withdrawn as cash and carried around in your wallet and that cash is backed by the financial  and literal  firepower of the us government share this story linkedin delicious reddit stumbleupon email story on the other hand bitcoins exist almost exclusively as entries on a giant virtual ledger stored on computers worldwide while the purely digital nature of bitcoins may make some uncomfortable it does have a major upside a users bitcoins cant be frozen by an angry government and the movement of bitcoins in and out of a country cant be prevented says jelena mirkovic a computer scientist and assistant professor at the university of southern californias information sciences institute bitcoins are created or issued by a central bank they are created by miners who solve one of a series of increasingly complex math problems through a combination of computing power and luck mirkovic says a miner who solves the problem gets to put his name next to a predetermined number of bitcoins on a ledger which records all bitcoin transactions and is constantly shared and updated by a peertopeer network similar to the original version of the musicsharing service napster the number of bitcoins and the speed at which they can be created is mathematically limited with successful mining that earns fewer and fewer bitcoins over time until the number reaches a little less than  million thats when it stops youre trying lots of different combinations to find the solution mirkovic says there is not a way to solve this quickly so you have to just do a lot of trials in order to find the answer and thats what controls the market thats what guarantees that you cant just manufacture lots of coins an unconventional currency when it comes to actually making daytoday transactions bitcoins arent yet as useful as conventional currency mirkovic says at the moment only a handful of businesses mostly online accept bitcoins as payment including blogging site wordpress and reddit you know how if someone steals your debit card information and makes a bunch of purchases you can report the theft and get your money back that doesnt happen with bitcoins which puts the onus for security squarely on users in order to make a bitcoin transaction you need a private key that corresponds to the bitcoin address where your coins are held that key consists of a code consisting of a long string of numbers and letters which bitcoin users can keep on a slip of paper or in a file on their computer programs called wallets also can be used to keep track of a users private keys without that key its pretty much impossible for a thief to steal a users bitcoins mirkovic says but should someone manage to gain access to a bitcoin owners hard drive though malware or other means and steal their private keys they could use it to transfer that owners bitcoins to themselves once done such transactions like all bitcoin transactions are permanent and irreversible to prevent that bitcoin users should consider storing their private keys on a separate computer than the one they use for daytoday transactions and browsing so that theyre out of reach of hackers mirkovic says compared to more conventional investments such as stocks or bonds the market for bitcoins is still in its infancy read more httpswwwbankratecomfinanceinvestingbitcoinvirtualmoneyriskyinvestmentaspxixzzzcrugk follow us bankrate on twitter  bankrate on facebook in this article we’ll talk about investing in bitcoin and if it’s a smart play or not  there’s a few factors at play other than the price of bitcoin that you should be aware of before making your decision  we’ll also cover a few ways to invest in the digital currency bitcoin has been one of the most amazing currencies to watch in the history of mankind first of all the value of bitcoin is only as strong as the trust that the bitcoin community places in it which means it holds an intrinsic value and not a real value such as gold silver or land  those commodities will always hold value and can be traded no matter what happens in the world  if someone were to pull the plug on our power grid bitcoin would literally become absolutely worthless in an instant  so would paper currencies however so their existence has actually provided precedence for the creation of the new digital currency so while the faith we maintain as a society in our technological advancement grows it also paves the way for this new phenomenon of bitcoins and all other altcoins the value of a single bitcoin rose quickly in  to a record  per bitcoin  this was mainly due to a large number of quick profit opportunists jumping on the new gold rush  it’s value has since fallen to less than half of it’s high while the world still tries to figure out what exactly is bitcoin and how it will become useful to the general public however the speed at which the currency is being adopted by huge corporations is staggering  address a bitcoin address is similar to a physical address or an email it is the only information you need to provide for someone to pay you with bitcoin an important difference however is that each address should only be used for a single transaction bit bit is a common unit used to designate a subunit of a bitcoin   bits is equal to  bitcoin btc or b this unit is usually more convenient for pricing tips goods and services bitcoin bitcoin  with capitalization is used when describing the concept of bitcoin or the entire network itself eg i was learning about the bitcoin protocol todaybitcoin  without capitalization is used to describe bitcoins as a unit of account eg i sent ten bitcoins today it is also often abbreviated btc or xbt block a block is a record in the block chain that contains and confirms many waiting transactions roughly every  minutes on average a new block including transactions is appended to the through mining block chain the block chain is a public record of bitcoin transactions in chronological order the block chain is shared between all bitcoin users it is used to verify the permanence of bitcoin transactions and to prevent double spending btc btc is a common unit used to designate one bitcoin b confirmation confirmation means that a transaction has been processed by the network and is highly unlikely to be reversed transactions receive a confirmation when they are included in a and for each subsequent block even a single confirmation can be considered secure for low value transactions although for larger amounts like  us it makes sense to wait for  confirmations or more each confirmation exponentially decreases the risk of a reversed transaction cryptography cryptography is the branch of mathematics that lets us create mathematical proofs that provide high levels of security online commerce and banking already uses cryptography in the case of bitcoin cryptography is used to make it impossible for anybody to spend funds from another users wallet or to corrupt the block chain it can also be used to encrypt a wallet so that it cannot be used without a password double spend if a malicious user tries to spend their bitcoins to two different recipients at the same time this is double spending bitcoin mining and the block chain are there to create a consensus on the network about which of the two transactions will confirm and be considered valid hash rate the hash rate is the measuring unit of the processing power of the bitcoin network the bitcoin network must make intensive mathematical operations for security purposes when the network reached a hash rate of  ths it meant it could make  trillion calculations per second mining bitcoin mining is the process of making computer hardware do mathematical calculations for the bitcoin network to confirm transactions and increase security as a reward for their services bitcoin miners can collect transaction fees for the transactions they confirm along with newly created bitcoins mining is a specialized and competitive market where the rewards are divided up according to how much calculation is done not all bitcoin users do bitcoin mining and it is not an easy way to make money pp peertopeer refers to systems that work like an organized collective by allowing each individual to interact directly with the others in the case of bitcoin the network is built in such a way that each user is broadcasting the transactions of other users and crucially no bank is required as a third party private key a private key is a secret piece of data that proves your right to spend bitcoins from a specific wallet through a cryptographic your private keys are stored in your computer if you use a software wallet they are stored on some remote servers if you use a web wallet private keys must never be revealed as they allow you to spend bitcoins for their respective bitcoin wallet signature a cryptographic signature is a mathematical mechanism that allows someone to prove ownership in the case of bitcoin a bitcoin wallet and its are linked by some mathematical magic when your bitcoin software signs a transaction with the appropriate private key the whole network can see that the signature matches the bitcoins being spent however there is no way for the world to guess your private key to steal your hardearned bitcoins wallet a bitcoin wallet is loosely the equivalent of a physical wallet on the bitcoin network the wallet actually contains your which allow you to spend the bitcoins allocated to it in the block chain each bitcoin wallet can show you the total balance of all bitcoins it controls and lets you pay a
