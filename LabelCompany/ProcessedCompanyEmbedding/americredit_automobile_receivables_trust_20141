this series rating sensitivity unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce cnl levels higher than the base case and would likely result in declines of ce and remaining loss coverage levels available to the notes decreased ce may make certain note ratings susceptible to potential negative rating actions depending on the extent of the decline in coverage hence fitch conducts sensitivity analysis by stressing a transactions initial base case cnl assumption by x and x and examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes the x and x increases of the base case cnl represent moderate and severe stresses respectively and are intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to unexpected
