considered credit worthy yet are unrated because they carry no debt on their books click tenant ratings for list of tenants for nnn properties who buys nnn properties nnn properties are appealing to those who wish to have outright ownership of their commercial real estate investments and have little to no management responsibility the alternative ways of owning non management commercial real estate would be to own a security in the form of a mutual fund or reit or invest in fractional ownership tenant in common properties a major advantage of  direct ownership is control and the ability to defer future capital gains by doing a  exchange when the property is sold for many investors the lack of immediate liquidity inherent in nnn properties is offset by the lack of volatility nnn properties offer when compared to a securitized investment investors should carefully consider their need for liquidity when considering investing in nnn properties how are nnn properties valued nnn properties typically are valued using their capitalization rate also referred to as cap rate nnn properties cap rates reflects the value of a stream of economic benefits discounted for time and risk generally this is computed as a pretax cap rate using the net operating income noi for nnn properties noi is income less all expenses before debt service the cap rate is the noi divided by the purchase price for nnn properties conversely the noi divided by the cap rate will equal the purchase or selling price example of cap rates for nnn properties noi   purchase or selling price noi   cap rate how are cap rates determined for nnn properties some of the major considerations when calculating cap rates for nnn properties are the credit worthiness of the tenant the length of the lease typically  to  years the type of lease triple net nnn or double net nn see below for definition type and frequency of bumps or increases if any in rent cost of financing strength of the demographics of the property location nature of the improvements are the improvements easily converted for another tenant or are they special purpose that would require significant expense and time to convert before re tenanting age and condition of the improvements the more positive the above factors for nnn properties the lower the cap rate or the higher the value of the property related to its income stream conversely if the above factors for nnn properties are weak the cap rate will be higher and the resulting value will be lower reflecting the greater risk of the investment it is important to remember that markets are not perfect and low cap rate nnn properties are not necessary a lower risk investment they could simply be a bad investment that is over priced astute investors seek nnn properties that are mispriced in their favor namely a higher cap rate for a property that has lower risk factors what is buildtosuit in a buildtosuit the landlord builds the improvements for the tenant and the tenant leases them back typically on a net lease the net lease rent payable by the tenant is a function of the construction and financing costs of the project this arrangement allows the tenant to move in and occupy the property with zero initial cost the net lease rent is fully deductible over the lease term making the tenants aftertax cost less than with alternative forms of assetbased financing what is a ground lease a ground lease is a method for separating ownership of the improvements building from the ownership of the underlying fee ground typically ground leases are long term net leases where the tenant pays all expenses except debt service any financing for the improvements are paid for by the tenant in some cases the ground lease is subordinated to the debt on the improvements on unsubordinated ground lease no lien is placed against the fee simple title to the land instead the leasehold estate is the primary security for any debt on the improvements there is no depreciation with the ownership of a ground lease many investors favor ground leases because they dont need to use their own funds to build the improvements yet end up owning the improvements on termination of the lease when the net lease ends the improvements revert to the owner of the ground lease the owner benefits from the full rent for both the land and the improvements tenants like ground leases because they reduce the tenants cost of development by eliminating land acquisition costs a long term net lease provides predictable rent payments that are deductible by the tenant for federal and state income tax purposes typically ground leases are long term net leases and include set rent escalations foreclosure rights and reversionary right improvements revert to owner of ground lease at termination of the lease what is a sale leaseback a real estate sale leaseback is when a business sells its commercial property for current market value and then leases it back typically using a net lease the seller retains the use of their real estate and frees up capital which can be used to invest back into the business real estate sale leasebacks are popular because they generate capital for immediate use within the business a long term net lease on a sale leaseback create a predictable rent that is deductible for federal and state income tax purposes some businesses do sale and leaseback transactions for equipment as well types net leases nnn properties are generally categorized as either true triple net nnn or double net nn the distinction between nnn and nn leases is an important one as can be seen in the following definitions absolute triple net nnn the tenant pays operating expenses such as maintenance repairs taxes and replacement for the entire property without limitation the owners pay the mortgage only this is the type of lease that most investors expect when purchasing nnn properties bond lease nnn a bond lease is a slight variation on the true triple nnn lease because the tenant is required to absolutely comply with their rent and operating expense obligations regardless of extenuating circumstances affecting the property ie even if the property is under eminent domain proceedings double net lease nn similar to nnn leases but with additional owner responsibilities the owner is generally liable for the structural components of the building such as the roof foundation loadbearing walls and parking leases will vary so they should be carefully read net lease alternative for investors considering nnn properties but who would like

from pcq pck and pzc are also generally exempt from california state income taxes and distributions from pnf pni and pyn are generally exempt from new york state and city income taxes there can be no assurance that all distributions paid by these funds will be exempt from federal income taxes or applicable state or local income taxesdistributions may include ordinary income net capital gains andor returns of capital generally a return of capital occurs when the amount distributed by a fund includes a portion of or is comprised entirely of your investment in the fund in addition to or rather than your prorata portion of the funds net income or capital gains a funds distributions in any period may be more or less than the net return earned by the fund on its investments and therefore should not be used as a measure of performance or confused with yield or income a return of capital is not taxable rather it reduces a shareholders tax basis in his or her shares of the fund if a fund estimates that a portion of its distribution may be comprised of amounts from sources other than net investment income such fund will notify shareholders of the estimated composition of such distribution through a separate written notice such notices are provided for informational purposes only and should not be used for tax reporting purposes final tax characteristics of all fund distributions will be provided on form div which is mailed after the close of the calendar yearit is important to note that differences exist between a funds daily internal accounting records a funds financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and recordkeeping practices under income tax regulations it is possible that a fund may not issue a section 9 notice in situations where the funds financial statements prepared later and in accordance with us gaap or the final tax character of those distributions might later report that the sources of those distributions included capital gains andor a return of capital please see the funds most recent shareholder reports for more detailsa funds distribution rate may be affected by numerous factors including changes in realized and projected market returns fund performance and other factors there can be no assurance that a change in market conditions or other factors will not result in a change in a fund distribution rate at a future timecertain funds may engage in investment strategies including the use of derivatives to among other things generate current distributable income even if such strategies could potentially result in declines in the funds net asset value a funds income and gaingenerating strategies including certain derivatives strategies may generate current income and gains taxable as ordinary income sufficient to support monthly distributions even in situations when the fund has experienced a decline in net assets due to for example adverse changes in the broad us or nonus equity markets or the funds debt investments or arising from its use of derivatives a fund may enter into opposite sides of interest rate swap and other derivatives for the principal purpose of generating distributable gains on the one side characterized as ordinary income for tax purposes that are not part of the funds duration or yield curve management strategies paired swap transactions with a substantial possibility that the fund will later realize a corresponding capital loss and potential decline in net asset value with respect to the opposite side transaction to the extent it does not have corresponding offsetting capital gains consequently common shareholders may receive distributions and owe tax at a time when their investment in the fund has declined in value which tax may be at ordinary income rates and which may be economically similar to a taxable return of capital the tax treatment of certain derivatives may be open to different interpretations any recharacterization of payments made or received by a fund pursuant to derivatives potentially could affect the amount timing or character of fund distributions in addition the tax treatment of such investment strategies may be changed by regulation or otherwiseread moreas with any stock the price of a funds common shares will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors shares of closedend management investment companies frequently trade at a price that is less than a discount or more than a premium from their net asset value if a funds shares trade at a premium to net asset value there is no assurance that
