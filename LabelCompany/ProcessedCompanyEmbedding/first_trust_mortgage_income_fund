provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from aaa highest to d lowest investment grade is defined as those issuers that have a longterm credit rating of bbb or higher subinvestment grade ratings are those rated bb or lower nr indicates no rating the credit ratings shown relate to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying securities in the fund and not to the fund or its shares us treasury us agency and us agency mortgagebacked securities appear under government credit ratings are subject to change footnotes  the nav represents the funds net assets assets less liabilities divided by the funds common shares outstanding  fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their share price rather than net asset value nav which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than nav premium or less than nav discount  most recent distribution paid or declared to todays date subject to change in the future there is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends  distribution rates are calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution paid or declared through todays date and then dividing by the most recent market price the distribution consists of the sum of net investment income net realized shortterm capital gains net realized longterm capital gains and return of capital distribution rates may vary any distribution adjustment will not be reflected until after the declaration

status of all distributions paid in the current year will be made after yearend  a measure of a bonds sensitivity to interest rate changes that reflects the change in a bonds price given a change in yield it accounts for the likelihood of changes in the timing of cash flows in response to interest rate movements  total return is the combination of reinvested dividend income and reinvested capital gains distributions at prices obtained by the dividend reinvestment plan if any and changes in the nav and share price the nav total return takes into account the funds total annual expenses and does not reflect sales load past performance is not indicative of future results  leverage is a technique where a closedend funds manager borrows assets at one rate and invests the proceeds from the borrowed assets at another rate seeking to increase yield and total return use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses  market value information used in calculating the percentages is based upon trade date plus one recording of transactions which can differ from regulatory financial reports forms ncsr and nq that are based on trade date recording of security transactions holdings are subject to change risk considerations investment return and market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost the debt securities in which the fund invests are subject to certain risks including issuer risk reinvestment risk prepayment risk credit risk and interest rate risk issuer risk is the risk that the value of fixedincome securities may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the issuer reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the funds portfolio will decline if the fund invests the proceeds from matured traded or called bonds at market interest rates that are below the fund portfolios current earnings rate prepayment risk is the risk that upon a prepayment the actual outstanding debt on which the fund derives interest income will be reduced credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest andor principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result interest rate risk is the risk that fixedincome securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates a portion of the funds managed assets may be invested in subordinated classes of mortgagebacked securities such subordinated classes are subject to a greater degree of nonpayment risk than are senior classes of the same issuer or agency use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses the risks of
