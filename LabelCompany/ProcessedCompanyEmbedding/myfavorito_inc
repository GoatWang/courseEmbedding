on november   products stem culture if you’ve read a good amount of my blog posts and my profile you probably feel like you know me pretty well however i have yet to reveal the most important fact about myself of all– what my favorite digilent product is well my favorite released product is the zybo in fact to commemorate this blog post i took this picture with the zybot zybo and my zybo shirt

about author kaitlyn franz when i started school i wasn’t interested in any of things i’m passionate about now in fact originally i started out wanting to study art but then i decided i didn’t want to have people telling me what to create so i changed to music then i decided i didn’t want to ruin a hobby by making it my career at the same time my physics class was teaching a unit on the physics of music and i thought that was way interesting so i changed to physics then by the time physics was over i decided that the coolest part of physics was electricity and magnetism and i may as well get a degree that transfers directly into a career so while all this was happening i was attending shoreline community college and during that time i found my passion or rather presented itself repeatedly until i realized maybe i should take a hint from the universe while at community college i was asked to help at the high school by tutoring chemistry students then i was asked to help at the elementary school by being a math olympiad coach i continued both because i found i really enjoyed it i also had an opportunity and was hired to be a tutor in the math learning center at the community college a job i really loved at the same time i was working as a nanny which i had been doing for several years the main reason because i could and would answer the hard questions the kids asked honestly ie why is the sky blue i then was recommended by the patrons of the mlc to the transfer tutoring center private tutoring and developed a wait list of students through all these opportunities at some point i realized that i loved watching people go from totally lost to masters of a subject i was also forced to admit that having all these opportunities continually renewed i must have been somewhat good at it so i decided i wanted to teach which fits with my mission oriented personality i saw a serious lack of passionate ece professors in the institutions i attended at wsu i continued this trend by being ask to ta for computer science and electrical engineering being a ta for a total of  semesters this continued by getting an amazing opportunity in my first semester at washington state university to work at digilent an educational company so even if i didn’t want to teach turns out i can’t avoid it luckily it is my main passion related posts july    i have waveforms  do i need
