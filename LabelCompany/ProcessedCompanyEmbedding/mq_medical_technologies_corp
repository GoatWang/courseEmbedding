and exchange messages with other queue managers or ibm mq clients allows ibm mq appliance to be the runtime messaging provider for applications written using the ibm mq light api—as well as supporting connectivity from other programming interfaces such as the message queue interface mqi and java message service jms offers an additional deployment option with ibm mq appliances that operates alongside softwarebased ibm mq deployments—either a single queue manager or multiple queue managers can be defined for each appliance provides a messaging hub with applications connecting to the ibm mq appliance as ibm mq clients or through other ibm mq queue managers can be used as the coordination queue manager for management file transfer in an ibm mq advanced deployment providing filetofile transfer filetomessage transfer and message–tofile transfer enables the configuration of queue managers and resources to be quickly created by copying existing ibm mq queue managers or through mqsc scripts improves security with endtoend message and file content data encryption allows encryption of message contents at rest based on predefined policies helps ensure that message contents are protected without changes to applications aids security and integrity and simplifies maintenance with lockeddown appliance hardware—no additional software can be installed and no user files stored keeps data safe with builtin high availability and disaster recovery capabilities automatically recovers data locally and synchronously through pairing with a second appliance recovers data over large distances asynchronously to one or more additional appliances deployed remotely lowers cost of ownership through rapid deployment and simplified administration and maintenance provides a familiar experience to existing ibm mq administrators and a userfriendly one to new users eases maintenance through certified firmware updates—which include both ibm mq software updates and appliance firmware updates features remote administration of the appliance through the ibm mq console provides administration guidance regarding unused appliance capacity and supports dashboard customization to display
