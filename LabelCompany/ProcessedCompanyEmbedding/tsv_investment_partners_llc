by the reporting entities meridians prior filings have focused on the what and when elements of the securities reporting and corporate governance problems involving cyanotech  this filing will focus on the who and why elements with particular focus on the involvement of the rudolph steiner foundation background on may   meridian delivered a letter to cyanotechs board of directors detailing extensive reporting and governance issues involving cyanotechs chairman and largest shareholder michael davis and its second largest shareholder the rudolph steiner foundation  after delivering the may  letter meridian sought to discuss its contents with cyanotechs board of directors and when it became clear that cyanotechs board was unwilling to engage in any discussions meridian filed a lawsuit in federal court on may   as detailed in its october   schedule d filing meridian believes davis has created an undisclosed group with the rudolph steiner foundation in order that davis and rsf might control the board of directors of cyanotech and thereby control the companys business  while the facts speak for themselves with respect to davis activities in creating a group with rsf there has remained the question as to why davis and rsf have taken their unusual actions  this filing explores the question of motivations for both davis and rsf  whenever possible this filing provides direct quotations from available public materials in order to make clear that meridian is providing information that is both accurate and fair rudolph steiner foundation dba rsf social finance rudolph steiner foundation rsf is a selfdescribed sociallyresponsible investment organization that seeks to revolutionize how people relate to money by transforming what it means to earn a return   on its website rsf informs that it seeks to redirect the flow of money in local markets and heal an economy often damaged by exploitation and resource depletion  rsf takes its name and purpose from the work of rudolph steiner a germanaustrian philosopher and social reformer who died in   steiner founded an esoteric spiritual movement called anthroposophy which includes teaching in the areas of education artistic expression medicine and agriculture  steiners ideas included a concept of spiritual science involving clairvoyant experiences and the belief that individuals are reincarnated in a variety of different peoples and races over successive lives most relevant to cyanotech are rsfs beliefs concerning the practice of agriculture according to the biodynamic association bda an organization created in  that awakens and enlivens cocreative relationships between humans and the earth rudolph steiner was the founder of the biodynamic approach to agriculture  according to bda steiner came to the conclusion that western civilization would gradually bring destruction to itself and the earth if it did not begin to develop an understanding of the spiritual world and its interrelationship with the physical world steiner is credited as being the first to bring the perspective of the farm as a single selfsustaining organism that thrives through biodiversity steiner developed a unique and comprehensive approach to soil plant animal and human health that recognizes the importance of the healthy interplay of cosmic and earthly influences with this knowledge he developed a set of homeopathic preparations…that help build up the farms innate immune system and vital forces rsfs investment activities from information on its website it appears the focus of rsfs investment activities is providing capital to support food initiatives  rsf reports that many of the entities it funds are biodynamic or sympathetic to bd melding ethical and spiritual ideas with practical farming and sustainability goals  rsf also explains on its website that all of our philanthropic investment options are return agnostic and do not seek marketrate returns as a primary goal   consistent with its mission aligned investment approach rsf announced in  that in response to the indirect opaque impersonal and volatile nature of the stock market rsf divested from all public equities and redirected capital to investments more closely aligned with its values  in  in partnership with leslie christian of portfolio  investments rsf published a white paper entitled a new foundation for portfolio management that rsf says challenges traditional notions of portfolio theory and investment management  stating that its own investment approach is grounded in the understanding that economic growth cannot be infinite on a planet with finite natural resources rsfs white paper argues that the possibility of longterm continuous zero or negative economic growth precipitated by ecological limits warrants deeper consideration for longterm investment portfolios  rsfs white paper concludes with the objective that rsf serve as an example for other investors who want to engage in whole portfolio activation where  of a portfolio is aligned with mission  this mission includes decoupling from wall street as much as possible rsfs investment in cyanotech rsf became a shareholder of cyanotech in  and has reported in its schedule g filings that it currently owns  of the companys outstanding shares  because rsfs filings related to cyanotech are the only sec ownership filings rsf has ever made it appears that cyanotech is the only public company in which rsf has ever held an ownership stake greater than  in studying rsfs investment in cyanotech we note that i rsf became a shareholder in  the same year it reported that it was divesting of all of its public company holdings and ii rsf executed what for it was an extraordinary international privatelynegotiated purchase of a  block of cyanotech shares taking rsfs holdings above  and requiring rsf to file the only g it has ever filed in  the same year it published its investment white paper describing its intention of decoupling from wall street as much as possible given rsfs strong interest in agriculture and in particular its desire to meld ethical and spiritual ideas with practical farming and sustainability goals meridian believes that its participation with davis in controlling cyanotech has become a part of rsfs goal to transform society by causing cyanotech to operate consistent with rsfs spiritual science and growthrelated philosophies the group controlling cyanotech in its previous filings meridian has focused on the what and when elements of the group that has been created by rsf and michael davis  after researching rsfs public statements of principles and purpose meridian believes it can now begin to understand the who and why elements of the actions it has observed taken by cyanotechs control group as discussed in meridians may   schedule d filing it is wellknown to those around cyanotech that michael davis has a very close relationship with rsf  according to the companys previous ceo davis took the executive to visit rsfs offices on his very first day on the job with cyanotech  davis has now confirmed that every single share of cyanotech stock held by rsf was acquired with the direct participation of davis either as a gift of shares from a daviscontrolled entity or as a gift of cash to be used to acquire cyanotech shares having now studied the philosophy and investment strategy of rsf meridian believes it has a more complete understanding of what davis and rsf have been seeking to accomplish with their control group at cyanotech  this understanding helps to explain some of the unusual business practices and strategic decisions observed at cyanotech  recall first these elements of rsfs investment strategy · decoupling from wall street as much as possible · do not seek marketrate returns as a primary goal · the possibility of longterm continuous zero or negative economic growth precipitated by ecological limits next consider the following unusual business practices and strategic decisions observed at cyanotech · the company conducts no investor relations – there are no investor calls no investor roadshows there is not even a powerpoint designed to introduce investors to the company · the company provides minimal disclosure in its quarterly sec filings and press releases following a template that discloses numeric data with very little commentary thus leaving outside investors without material information about the companys business drivers eg why is it taking so long for cyanotech to adapt its production methodologies in order to increase the amount of astaxanthin available for sale · the board of directors actively discourages management and employees from engaging with investors as an example as part of its standard practice meridian sent a representative to cyanotechs  annual meeting of shareholders  as part of this standard practice meridian contacted the company weeks in advance to inform the company of its planned visit and request an opportunity to meet with management and directors and if possible tour the companys facilities in hawaii  a company representative replied that cyanotech no longer provided tours and that meridian would be welcome at the shareholder meeting  yet cyanotechs board knowing that an investor had traveled thousands of miles to meet with company representatives immediately cleared the room following adjournment of the formal scripted shareholder meeting thus providing only minutes for the meetandgreet that is standard at every other small public shareholder meeting meridian has ever attended  it was only by the personal intervention of cyanotech founder gerry cysewski that any purpose was salvaged from the trip as he arranged for a short tour of cyanotechs farm · cyanotechs last two ceos were generally wellregarded by the companys outside shareholders  both were terminated without explanation shortly after leading the company through periods of rapid and positive business development  both ceos saw their termination result in the loss of significant cash and equity incentives that had accrued during their tenure · after more than a year of cyantech disclosing difficulties in increasing astaxanthin production and subsequent research by meridian into the potential of investing in closedsystems that would protect the algae from environmental influences meridian twice approached the company offering to provide capital if that would help the company implement the necessary production changes  meridian received no response from these offers  instead meridian soon after learned that cyanotech had terminated the employment of the ceo that had communicated meridians offer to the board · in addition to his role as chairman of the board of directors davis is chairman of the boards nominating and governance committee  in this position davis has established a pattern of recruiting individuals to serve on cyanotechs board that have no prior public company board experience · the directors recruited by chairman davis have responded in a surprisingly passive manner to revelations that their chairman and largest shareholder has for years failed to make proper sec filings with respect to his holdings in cyanotech  after an independent investigation reported that certain facts relating to the relationship between the companys two largest shareholders davis and rsf could be consistent with the existence a group the boards reaction was to defer to davis urging him to consider whether or not a group exists · the directors recruited by chairman davis after having been publicly challenged concerning numerous public company corporate governance deficiencies including multiple apparent conflicts of interest reported to the companys outside shareholders that the board was aware of and is untroubled by such conflicts · at davis urging cyanotech recently replaced its honolulubased law firm goodsill anderson which describes itself as focused on the business needs of clients in hawaii and around the world with practice areas including securities law banking real estate tax and attorneys knowledgeable in such specialized areas as mergers and acquisitions environmental law antitrust aviation admiralty and international trade  the firm that replaced cyanotechs historic corporate counsel is a san franciscobased law firm farella braun that describes itself as trial lawyers first with experience including complex litigation involving class actions antitrust and unfair competition business litigation involving securities commodities and ma disputes  cyanotechs new corporate counsel had previously represented davis and his affiliated foundations and therefore was likely involved in davis gifts to rsf that resulted in rsfs large holdings in cyanotech  the firms website states we represent more than  philanthropic organizations from community private family and corporate foundations to charitable trusts and public charities and we have proven experience for tax efficient transfers of individual wealth to personal familial or corporate exempt organizations including the best and proper method to accept account for and plan to receive gifts of value including cash securities real estate art and other precious commodities conclusion in its prior filings meridian has focused on the actions of michael davis to create a group with rsf and to cause cyanotech to take actions that appear inconsistent with proper public company corporate government practices and the fiduciary obligations of cyanotechs board of directors  meridian believes it is important to understand why davis decided to collaborate with rsf  in this regard rsfs  white paper promoting a new investment approach that is  missionfocused on longterm investments where the possibility of longterm continuous zero or negative economic growth was acceptable appears to be central  that same year davis gave rsf  million to acquire the  block that would elevate rsfs ownership in cyanotech to  and the combined ownership of the davisrsf group to   it was also in that same year that
