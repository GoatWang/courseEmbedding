atlantic waste holdings lp star atlantic and veolia environnement sa to enjoin star atlantics proposed acquisition of veolia environnment sas us subsidiary veolia es solid waste inc veolia plaintiff complains and alleges as follows i nature of the action  pursuant to a share purchase agreement dated july   star atlantic proposes to acquire all of the outstanding shares of veolias common stock defendants star atlantic and veolia currently compete to provide small container commercial waste collection and municipal solid waste msw disposal in certain geographic areas in the united states the proposed transaction would substantially lessen competition for small container commercial waste collection services as a result of star atlantics acquisition of veolia in the macon georgia area the proposed transaction also would substantially lessen competition for msw disposal service as a result of star atlantics acquisition of veolias msw disposal assets in northern new jersey and central georgia  defendants star atlantic and veolia are two of only a few significant providers of small container commercial waste collection services in the macon metropolitan area and msw disposal services in northern new jersey and central georgia unless the acquisition is enjoined consumers of small container commercial waste collection andor msw disposal services in these areas likely will pay higher prices and receive fewer services as a consequence page  of the elimination of vigorous competition between star atlantic and veolia accordingly star atlantics acquisition of veolia would violate section  of the clayton act  usc sec  ii the defendants and the transaction  star atlantic is a delaware limited partnership with its headquarters in new york new york star atlantic provides collection transfer recycling and disposal services in alabama florida georgia mississippi north carolina south carolina and tennessee through its subsidiary advanced disposal services inc and in massachusetts vermont new york new jersey pennsylvania maryland and west virginia through its subsidiary interstate waste services inc in  star atlantic had estimated total revenues of  million

kentucky missouri illinois minnesota wisconsin michigan indiana pennsylvania and new jersey in  veolia es solid waste inc had estimated total revenues of  million  on july   defendants star atlantic and veolia entered into a share purchase agreement pursuant to which star atlantic proposes to acquire all of the outstanding shares of veolias common stock in a transaction valued at  billion iii jurisdiction and venue  the united states brings this action under section  of the clayton act  usc sec  as amended to prevent and restrain defendants from violating section  of the clayton act  usc sec   defendants star atlantic and veolia collect msw from residential commercial and industrial customers and they own and operate transfer stations and landfills that process and dispose of msw in their small container commercial waste collection and msw disposal businesses star atlantic and veolia make sales and purchases in interstate commerce ship waste in the flow of interstate commerce and engage in activities substantially affecting interstate commerce the court has jurisdiction over this action and over the parties pursuant to  usc sec  and  usc sec sec  and   defendants have consented to venue and personal jurisdiction in the district of columbia venue is therefore proper in this district under section  of the clayton act  usc sec  and  usc sec c iv trade and commerce a the relevant service markets  small container commercial waste collection  waste collection firms or haulers collect msw from residential commercial and industrial establishments and transport the waste to a disposal site such as a transfer station landfill or incinerator for processing and disposal private waste haulers typically contract directly with customers for the collection of waste generated by commercial accounts msw generated by residential customers on the other hand often is collected either by local governments or by private haulers pursuant to contracts bid by or franchises granted by municipal authorities  small container commercial waste collection means the business of collecting msw from commercial and industrial accounts usually in dumpsters ie a small container with one to ten cubic yards of storage capacity and transporting or hauling such waste to a disposal site by use of a frontend or rearend load truck typical small container commercial waste collection customers include office and apartment buildings and retail establishments eg stores and restaurants as used herein small container commercial waste collection does not include the collection of rolloff containers or residential collection service  small container commercial waste collection service differs in many important respects from the collection of residential or other types of waste an individual commercial customer typically generates substantially more msw than a residential customer to handle this high volume of msw efficiently haulers often provide commercial customers with small containers also called dumpsters for storing the waste haulers organize their commercial accounts into routes and collect and transport the msw generated by these accounts in frontend load fel trucks uniquely wellsuited for commercial waste collection less frequently haulers may use more maneuverable but less efficient rearend load rel trucks especially in those areas in which a collection route includes narrow alleyways or streets fel trucks are unable to navigate narrow passageways easily and cannot efficiently collect the waste located in them  on a typical small container commercial waste collection route an operator drives a fel vehicle to the customers container engages a mechanism that grasps and lifts the container over the front of the truck and empties the container into the vehicles storage section where the waste is compacted and stored the operator continues along the route collecting msw from each of the commercial accounts until the vehicle is full the operator then drives the fel truck to a disposal facility such as a transfer station landfill or incinerator and empties the contents of the vehicle depending on the number of locations and the amount of waste collected on the route the operator may make one or more trips to the disposal facility in the servicing of the route  in contrast to a small container commercial waste collection route a residential waste collection route is significantly more laborintensive the customers msw is stored in much smaller containers eg garbage bags or trash cans and instead of fel trucks waste collection firms routinely use rel or sideload trucks manned by larger crews usually twoperson or threeperson teams on residential routes crews generally handload the customers msw typically by tossing garbage bags and emptying trash cans into the vehicles storage section because of the differences in the collection processes residential customers and commercial customers usually are organized into separate routes  likewise other types of collection activities such as the use of rolloff containers typically used for construction debris and the collection of liquid or hazardous waste are rarely combined with small container commercial waste collection this separation of routes is due to differences in the hauling equipment required the volume of waste collected health and safety concerns and the ultimate disposal option used  the differences in the types and volume of msw collected and in the equipment used in collection services distinguish small container commercial waste collection from all other types of waste collection activities absent competition from other small container commercial waste collection firms a small container commercial waste collection service provider profitably could increase its charges without losing significant sales or revenues to firms engaged in the provision of other page  types of waste collection services thus small container commercial waste collection is a line of commerce or relevant service for purposes of analyzing the effects of the acquisition under section  of the clayton act  usc sec   disposal of municipal solid waste  msw means municipal solid waste a term of art used to describe solid putrescible waste generated by households and commercial establishments such as retail stores offices restaurants warehouses and nonmanufacturing activities in industrial facilities msw does not include special handling waste eg waste from manufacturing processes regulated medical waste sewage and sludge hazardous waste or waste generated by construction or demolition sites msw has physical characteristics that readily distinguish it from other liquid or solid waste  in order to be disposed of lawfully msw must be disposed in a landfill or an incinerator and such facilities must be located on approved sites and operated under prescribed procedures federal state and local safety environmental zoning and permit laws and regulations dictate critical aspects of storage handling transportation processing and disposal of msw in each market in less densely populated areas of the country msw often is disposed of directly into landfills that are permitted and regulated by the state landfill permit restrictions often impose limitations on the type and amount of waste that can be deposited in many urban and suburban areas landfills are scarce due to high population density and the limited availability of suitable land accordingly msw generated in such areas often is burned in an incinerator or taken to a transfer station a transfer station is an intermediate disposal site for the processing and temporary storage of msw before transfer in bulk to more distant landfills or incinerators for final disposal anyone who fails to dispose of msw in a lawful manner can be subject to severe civil and criminal penalties  because of the strict laws and regulations that govern the disposal of msw there are no good substitutes for msw disposal in landfills or incinerators or at transfer stations located near the source of the waste absent competition from other providers of msw disposal services a firm providing msw disposal services profitably could increase its charges to haulers of msw without losing significant sales to any other firm thus disposal of msw is a line of commerce or relevant service for purposes of analyzing the effects of the acquisition under section  of the clayton act  usc sec  b relevant geographic markets  small container commercial waste collection  small container commercial waste collection is generally provided in highly localized areas because to operate efficiently and profitably a hauler must have sufficient density ie a large number of commercial accounts that are reasonably close together in its small container commercial waste collection operations if a hauler has to drive significant distances between customers it earns less money for the time the truck is operating for the same reason the accounts must be near the operators base of operations it is economically impractical for a small container commercial waste collection firm to service metropolitan areas from a distant base which requires that the fel truck travel long distances just to arrive at its route haulers therefore generally establish garages and related facilities within each major local area served  in bibb jones peach monroe and crawford counties in georgia the macon metropolitan area a local small container commercial waste collection firm absent competition from other small container commercial waste collection firms profitably could increase charges to local customers without losing significant sales to more distant competitors accordingly the macon metropolitan area is a section of the country or relevant geographic market for purposes of analyzing the effects of the acquisition under section  of the clayton act  usc sec   disposal of municipal solid waste  msw is transported by collection trucks to landfills and transfer stations and the price and availability of disposal sites close to a haulers routes is a major factor that determines a haulers competitiveness and profitability the cost of transporting msw to a disposal site often is a substantial component of the cost of disposal the cost advantage of local disposal sites limits the areas where msw can be transported economically and disposed of by haulers and creates localized markets for msw disposal services  in bergen and passaic counties in new jersey northern new jersey and in bibb jones peach monroe crawford twiggs taylor macon and houston counties in georgia central georgia the high costs of transporting msw and the substantial travel time to other disposal facilities based on distance natural barriers and congested roadways limit the distance that haulers of msw generated in those areas can travel economically to dispose of their waste the firms that compete for the disposal of msw generated in each of these areas own landfills or transfer stations located within the area in each area absent competition from other local msw disposal operators a firm providing msw disposal services profitably could increase its charges for the disposal of msw generated in the area without losing significant sales to more distant disposal sites accordingly northern new jersey and central georgia are relevant geographic markets for purposes of analyzing the competitive effects of the acquisition under section  of the clayton act  usc sec  c anticompetitive effects of the proposed acquisition  the acquisition of veolia by star atlantic would remove a significant competitor in small container commercial waste collection or the disposal of msw in already highly concentrated and difficulttoenter markets in each of these markets the resulting significant increase in concentration loss of competition and absence of any reasonable prospect of significant new entry or expansion by market incumbents likely will result in higher prices for the collection of small container commercial waste or the disposal of msw  small container commercial waste collection service in the macon metropolitan area  in the macon metropolitan area the proposed acquisition would reduce from four to three the number of significant competitors in the collection of small container commercial waste annual revenue from small container commercial waste collection in the macon metropolitan area is approximately  million after the acquisition star atlantic would have approximately  percent of the total number of small container commercial waste collection routes in the market using a standard measure of market concentration called the hhi defined and explained in appendix a incorporating market shares based on small container commercial waste collection routes the postmerger hhi for small container commercial waste collection in the macon metropolitan area would be approximately  an page  increase of  points over the premerger hhi of   msw disposal in central georgia  in central georgia the proposed acquisition would reduce from four to three the number of significant competitors for the disposal of msw after the acquisition defendants would have approximately  percent of the msw disposal market based on waste tonnages accepted by the landfills in  the postmerger hhi for msw disposal service in central georgia would be approximately  an increase of  points over the premerger hhi of   msw disposal in northern new jersey  in northern new jersey the proposed acquisition would reduce from four to three the number of significant competitors for the disposal of msw annual revenue from msw disposal in this market is approximately  million after the acquisition defendants would have approximately  percent of the msw disposal market using market shares based on  tonnages as a measure of concentration the postmerger hhi for msw disposal service would be approximately  an increase of  points over the premerger hhi of  d entry into small container commercial waste collection in the macon metropolitan area  significant new entry into small container commercial waste collection is difficult and timeconsuming in the macon metropolitan area a new entrant into small container commercial waste collection cannot provide a significant competitive constraint on the prices charged by market incumbents until it achieves minimum efficient scale and operating efficiencies comparable to existing firms in order to obtain a comparable operating efficiency a new firm must achieve route densities similar to those of firms already competing in the market however the incumbents ability to engage in price discrimination and to enter into longterm contracts with collection customers is often effective in preventing new entrants from winning a large enough base of customers to achieve efficient routes in sufficient time to constrain the postacquisition firm from significantly raising prices differences in the service provided by an incumbent hauler to each customer permit the incumbent easily to meet competition from new entrants by pricing its services lower to any individual customer that wants to switch to the new entrant incumbent firms frequently also use three to fiveyear contracts which may automatically renew or contain large liquidated damage provisions for contract termination such contracts make it more difficult for a customer to switch to a new hauler in order to obtain lower prices for its collection service by making it more difficult for new haulers to obtain customers these practices increase the cost and time required by an entrant to form an efficient route reducing the likelihood that the entrant ultimately will be successful e entry into msw disposal in northern new jersey and central georgia  significant new entry into the disposal of msw in northern new jersey and central georgia would be difficult and timeconsuming obtaining a permit to construct a new disposal facility or to expand an existing one is a costly and timeconsuming process that typically takes many years to conclude first suitable land is scarce second even when land is available local public opposition often increases the time and uncertainty of successfully permitting a facility last it is also difficult to overcome environmental concerns and satisfy other governmental requirements  where it is not practical to construct and permit a landfill it is necessary to use a transfer station to facilitate the use of more distant disposal options many of the problems associated with the permitting and construction of a landfill likewise make it difficult to permit and construct a transfer station  in northern new jersey and central georgia entry by constructing and permitting a new msw disposal facility would be costly and timeconsuming and unlikely to prevent market incumbents from significantly raising prices for the disposal of msw following the acquisition v violations alleged  star atlantics proposed acquisition of veolias outstanding shares likely would lessen competition substantially for small container commercial waste collection services in the macon metropolitan area and for msw disposal services in northern new jersey and central georgia in violation of section  of the clayton act  usc sec   unless enjoined the proposed acquisition likely would have the following anticompetitive effects relating to small container commercial waste collection services among others a actual and potential competition between star atlantic and veolia would be eliminated b competition likely would be lessened substantially and c prices likely would

action except that the court would retain jurisdiction to construe modify or enforce the provisions of the final judgment and to punish violations thereof ii description of the events giving rise to the alleged violations a the defendants star atlantic is a delaware limited partnership with its headquarters in new york new york star atlantic provides collection transfer recycling and disposal services in alabama florida georgia mississippi north carolina south carolina and tennessee through its subsidiary advanced disposal services inc and in massachusetts vermont new york new jersey pennsylvania maryland and west virginia through its subsidiary interstate waste services inc in  star atlantic had estimated total revenues of  million veolia environnement sa is a french corporation with a whollyowned subsidiary veolia es solid waste inc that offers collection transfer recycling and disposal services in florida georgia alabama kentucky missouri illinois minnesota wisconsin michigan indiana pennsylvania and new jersey in  veolia es solid waste inc had estimated total revenues of  million b the competitive effects of the transaction msw is solid putrescible waste generated by households and commercial establishments waste collection firms or haulers contract to collect msw from residential and commercial customers and transport the waste to private and public msw disposal facilities eg transfer stations and landfills which for a fee process and legally dispose of the waste small container commercial waste collection is one component of msw collection which also includes residential and other waste collection star atlantic and veolia compete in the collection of small container commercial waste and the disposal of msw  the effect of the transaction on competition in small container commercial waste collection in the macon metropolitan area small container commercial waste collection service is the collection of msw from commercial businesses such as office and apartment buildings and retail establishments eg stores and restaurants for shipment to and disposal at an approved disposal facility because of the type and volume of waste generated by commercial accounts and the frequency of service required haulers organize commercial accounts into routes and generally use specialized equipment to store collect and transport msw from these accounts to approved msw disposal sites this equipment eg one to tencubicyard containers for msw storage and frontend load vehicles commonly used for collection and transportation of msw is uniquely wellsuited for providing small container commercial waste collection service providers of other types of waste collection services eg residential and rolloff services are not good substitutes for small container commercial waste collection firms in these types of waste collection efforts firms use different waste storage equipment eg garbage cans or semistationary rolloff containers and different vehicles eg rearload sideload or rolloff trucks which for a variety of reasons cannot be conveniently or efficiently used to store collect or transport msw generated by commercial accounts and hence are rarely used on small container commercial waste collection routes in the event of a small but significant page  increase in price for small container commercial waste collection services customers would not switch to any other alternative thus the complaint alleges that the provision of small container commercial waste collection services constitutes a line of commerce or relevant service for purposes of analyzing the effects of the transaction the complaint alleges that the provision of small container commercial waste collection service takes place in compact highly localized geographic markets it is expensive to transport msw long distances between collection customers or to disposal sites to minimize transportation costs and maximize the scale density and efficiency of their msw collection operations small container commercial waste collection firms concentrate their customers and collection routes in small areas firms with operations concentrated in a distant area cannot easily compete against firms whose routes and customers are locally based distance may significantly limit a remote firms ability to provide commercial waste collection service as frequently or conveniently as that offered by local firms with nearby routes also local small container commercial waste collection firms have significant cost advantages over other firms and can profitably increase their charges to local small container commercial waste collection customers without losing significant sales to firms outside the area applying this analysis the complaint alleges that in bibb jones peach monroe and crawford counties in georgia the macon metropolitan area a local small container commercial waste collection monopolist absent competition from other small container commercial waste collection firms profitably could increase charges to local customers without losing significant sales to more distant competitors accordingly the macon metropolitan area is a section of the country or a relevant geographic market for the purpose of assessing the competitive effects of a combination of star atlantic and veolia in the provision of small container commercial waste collection services there are significant entry barriers into small container commercial waste collection a new entrant into small container commercial waste collection services must achieve a minimum efficient scale and operating efficiencies comparable to those of existing firms in order to provide a significant competitive constraint on the prices charged by market incumbents in order to obtain comparable operating efficiencies a new firm must achieve route density similar to existing firms however the incumbents ability to price discriminate and to enter into longterm contracts with existing small container commercial waste collection firms can leave too few customers available to the entrant to create an efficient route in a sufficiently confined geographic area the incumbent firm can selectively and temporarily charge an unbeatably low price to specified customers targeted by new entrants longterm contracts often run for three to five years and may automatically renew or contain large liquidated damage provisions for contract termination such terms make it more costly or difficult for a customer to switch to a new small container commercial waste collection firm and obtain lower prices for its collection service because of these factors a new entrant may find it difficult to compete by offering its services at preentry price levels comparable to the incumbent and may find an increase in the cost and time required to form an efficient route thereby limiting a new entrants ability to build an efficient route and reducing the likelihood that the entrant will ultimately succeed the need for route density the use of longterm contracts with restrictive terms and the ability of existing firms to price discriminate raise significant barriers to entry by new firms which likely will be forced to compete at lower than preentry price levels in the past such barriers have made entry and expansion difficult by new or smallersized competitors in small container commercial waste collection markets in the macon metropolitan area the proposed acquisition would reduce from four to three the number of significant competitors in the collection of small container commercial waste annual revenue from small container commercial waste collection in the macon metropolitan area is approximately  million after the acquisition star atlantic would have approximately  percent of the total number of small container commercial waste collection routes in the market  the effects of the transaction on competition in the disposal of municipal solid waste in northern new jersey and central georgia a number of federal state and local safety environmental zoning and permit laws and regulations dictate critical aspects of storage handling transportation processing and disposal of msw in order to be disposed of lawfully msw must be disposed in a landfill or an incinerator permitted to accept msw and such facilities must be located on approved sites and operated under prescribed procedures federal state and local safety environmental zoning and permit laws and regulations dictate critical aspects of storage handling transportation processing and disposal of msw in each market in less densely populated areas of the country msw often is disposed of directly into landfills that are permitted and regulated by the state landfill permit restrictions often impose limitations on the type and amount of waste that can be deposited in many urban and suburban areas landfills are scarce due to high population density and the limited availability of suitable land accordingly msw generated in such areas often is burned in an incinerator or taken to a transfer station a transfer station is an intermediate disposal site for the processing and temporary storage of msw before transfer in bulk to more distant landfills or incinerators for final disposal anyone who fails to dispose of msw in a lawful manner can be subject to severe civil and criminal penalties because of the strict laws and regulations that govern the disposal of msw there are no good substitutes for msw disposal in landfills or incinerators or at transfer stations located near the source of the waste a local monopolist providing msw disposal services absent competition from other providers of msw disposal services profitably could increase its charges to haulers of msw by a small but significant amount without losing significant sales to any other firm thus the disposal of msw constitutes a line of commerce or relevant service for purposes of analyzing the effects of the acquisition msw is transported by collection trucks to landfills and transfer stations and the price and availability of disposal sites close to a haulers routes is a major factor that determines a haulers competitiveness and profitability the cost of transporting msw to a disposal site often is a substantial component of the cost of disposal the cost advantage of local disposal sites limits the areas where msw can be transported economically and disposed of by haulers and creates localized markets for msw disposal services in bergen and passaic counties in new jersey northern new jersey and in bibb jones peach monroe crawford twiggs taylor macon and houston counties in georgia central georgia the high costs of transporting msw and the substantial travel time to other disposal facilities based on distance natural barriers and congested page  roadways limit the distance that haulers of msw generated in those areas can travel economically to dispose of their waste the firms that compete for the disposal of msw generated in each of those areas own landfills or transfer stations located within the area in the event that all of the owners of those local disposal facilities imposed a small but significant increase in the price of msw disposal haulers of msw generated in each area could not profitably turn to more distant disposal facilities firms that compete for the disposal of msw generated in each area absent competition from other local msw disposal operators profitably could increase their charges for disposal of msw generated in the area without losing significant sales to more distant disposal sites accordingly northern new jersey and central georgia are relevant geographic markets for purposes of analyzing the competitive effects of the acquisition under section  of the clayton act  usc sec  there are significant barriers to entry in msw disposal obtaining a permit to construct a new disposal facility or to expand an existing one is a costly and timeconsuming process that typically takes many years to conclude local public opposition often increases the time and uncertainty of successfully permitting a facility it is also difficult to overcome environmental concerns and satisfy other governmental requirements likewise many of the problems associated with the permitting and construction of a landfill make it difficult to permit and construct a transfer station in northern new jersey and central georgia entry by a new msw disposal facility would be costly and timeconsuming and unlikely to prevent market incumbents from significantly raising prices for the disposal of msw following the acquisition in northern new jersey the proposed acquisition would reduce from four to three the number of significant competitors for the disposal of msw annual revenue from msw disposal in this market is approximately  million after the acquisition defendants would have approximately  percent of the msw disposal market in central georgia the proposed acquisition would reduce from four to three the number of significant competitors for the disposal of msw after the acquisition defendants would have approximately  percent of the msw disposal market based on waste tonnages accepted by the landfills in  iii explanation of the proposed final judgment the divestiture requirements of the proposed final judgment will eliminate the anticompetitive effects of the acquisition in small container commercial waste collection service in the macon metropolitan area and msw disposal service in northern new jersey and central georgia the requirements will remove sufficient small container commercial waste collection andor msw disposal assets from the merged firms control and place them in the hands of a firm that is independent of the merged firm and capable of preserving the competition that otherwise would have been lost as a result of the acquisition the proposed final judgment requires defendants within  days after the filing of the complaint or five  days after notice of the entry of the final judgment by the court whichever is later to divest as a viable ongoing business or businesses a small container commercial waste collection assets routes trucks containers and customer lists in the macon metropolitan area and b msw disposal assets landfills transfer stations material recovery facilities leasehold rights garages and offices trucks and vehicles scales permits and intangible assets such as customer lists and contracts in northern new jersey and in central georgia the assets must be divested to purchasers approved by the united states and in such a way as to satisfy the united states that they can and will be operated by the purchaser or purchasers as part of a viable ongoing business or businesses that can compete effectively in each relevant market defendants must take all reasonable steps necessary to accomplish the divestitures quickly and shall cooperate with prospective purchasers  a material recovery facility is a facility permitted to accept and recover those recyclable portions of a commercial waste stream such as paper plastic and glass in the event that defendants do not accomplish the divestitures within the period prescribed in the proposed final judgment the final judgment provides that the court will appoint a trustee selected by the united states to effect the divestitures if a trustee is appointed the proposed final judgment provides that defendants will pay all costs and expenses of the trustee the trustees commission will be structured so as to provide an incentive for the trustee based on the price obtained and the speed with which the divestitures are accomplished after his or her appointment becomes effective the trustee will file monthly reports with the court and the united states setting forth his or her efforts to accomplish the divestitures at the end of six months if the divestitures have not been accomplished the trustee and the united states will make recommendations to the court which shall enter such orders as appropriate in order to carry out the purpose of the trust including extending the trust or the term of the trustees appointment to eliminate the anticompetitive effects of the acquisition in the market for small container commercial waste collection service in the macon metropolitan area defendants must divest  veolias small container commercial waste collection routes  and  and at the acquirers option the veolia hauling facility in byron georgia and  veolias small container commercial waste collection route  and at the acquirers option the veolia hauling facility in thomaston georgia to eliminate the anticompetitive effects of the acquisition in the market for msw disposal service in northern new jersey and central georgia defendants must divest  veolias two transfer stations in paterson new jersey and its transfer station in totowa new jersey and  veolias two transfer stations in byron georgia and thomaston georgia and the veolia landfill in mauk georgia the proposed final judgment provides that divestiture of the divestiture assets may be made to one or more acquirers so long as the northern new jersey disposal assets are divested to a single acquirer and the central georgia disposal assets and the macon metropolitan area waste collection assets are divested to a single acquirer in central georgia and the macon metropolitan area this provision is intended to encourage the continued operation of an efficient vertically integrated competitor whose participation in each market would replicate closely the competition existing prior to the acquisition in northern new jersey buyers of msw disposal and recycling services generally prefer to have a single supplier of both and owners of transfer stations that also can recycle have an advantage over those that cannot the single acquirer provision for the northern new jersey disposal assets ensures that the acquirer will be able to offer customers msw disposal services through each of the three divested transfer stations as well as recycling services through the material recovery facility associated with the veolia river street transfer station one of the three page  stations to be divested the ability of the acquirer to offer customers both msw disposal and recycling services will allow it to operate more effectively and replicate closely the competition existing in northern new jersey prior to the acquisition in addition star atlantic for the duration of its contracts with any of its current small container commercial waste collection service customers in the macon metropolitan area shall not initiate new contracts or lengthen or alter any material term of such contracts except when a customer seeks a contractual change without prompting or encouragement from star atlantic this provision is intended to prevent star atlantic from using its acquisition of veolia as a justification for extending the contracts of its small container commercial waste customers in the macon metropolitan area thereby precluding competition in a large segment of this market iv remedies available to potential private litigants section  of the clayton act  usc sec  provides that any person who has been injured as a result of conduct prohibited by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages the person has suffered as well as costs and reasonable attorneys fees entry of the proposed final judgment will neither impair nor assist the bringing of any private antitrust damage action under the provisions of section a of the clayton act  usc sec a the proposed final judgment has no prima facie effect in any subsequent private lawsuit that may be brought against defendants v procedures available for modification of the proposed final judgment the united states and defendants have stipulated that the proposed final judgment may be entered by the court after compliance with the provisions of the appa provided that the united states has not withdrawn its consent the appa conditions entry upon the courts determination that the proposed final judgment is in the public interest the appa provides a period of at least sixty days preceding the effective date of the proposed final judgment within which any person may submit to the united states written

or the last date of publication in a newspaper of the summary of this competitive impact statement whichever is later all comments received during this period will be considered by the united states department of justice which remains free to withdraw its consent to the proposed final judgment at any time prior to the courts entry of judgment the comments and the response of the united states will be filed with the court in addition comments will be posted on the us department of justice antitrust divisions internet web site and under certain circumstances published in the federal register written comments should be submitted to maribeth petrizzi chief litigation ii section antitrust division united states department of justice  fifth street nw suite  washington dc  the proposed final judgment provides that the court retains jurisdiction over this action and the parties may apply to the court for any order necessary or appropriate for the modification interpretation or enforcement of the final judgment vi alternatives to the proposed final judgment the united states considered as an alternative to the proposed final judgment a full trial on the merits against defendants the united states could have continued the litigation and sought preliminary and permanent injunctions preventing star atlantics acquisition of veolia the united states is satisfied however that the divestiture of the assets described in the proposed final judgment will preserve competition for small container commercial waste collection service in the macon metropolitan area and for msw disposal service in northern new jersey and central georgia thus the proposed final judgment would achieve all or substantially all of the relief the united states would have obtained through litigation but would avoid the time expense and uncertainty of a full trial on the merits of the complaint vii standard of review under the appa for the proposed final judgment the clayton act as amended by the appa requires that proposed consent judgments in antitrust cases brought by the united states be subject to a sixtyday comment period after which the court shall determine whether entry of the proposed final judgment is in the public interest  usc sec e in making that determination the court in accordance with the statute as amended in  is required to consider a the competitive impact of such judgment including termination of alleged violations provisions for enforcement and modification duration of relief sought anticipated effects of alternative remedies actually considered whether its terms are ambiguous and any other competitive considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment that the court deems necessary to a determination of whether the consent judgment is in the public interest and b the impact of entry of such judgment upon competition in the relevant market or markets upon the public generally and individuals alleging specific injury from the violations set forth in the complaint including consideration of the public benefit if any to be derived from a determination of the issues at trial  usc sec ea  b in considering these statutory factors the courts
