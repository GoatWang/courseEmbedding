henri moissan at the site of a massive meteorite strike in arizona this intriguing new stone was named moissanite in his honor and moissan spent the rest of his life attempting to recreate this rare mineral in his laboratory it wasnt until the late s that scientists  working in a research laboratory located in research triangle park north carolina  developed the innovative thermal growing process that creates silicon carbide crystals these crystals are fashioned into moissanite gemstones that rival any natural gemstone for fire and brilliance these manmade gems are more durable than diamond sapphire ruby or emerald is moissanite a brand of diamond or a simulated diamondno moissanite is not a substitute for diamond either scientifically chemically or emotionally charles  colvard created

maintain its fire and brilliance forever color  clarity will moissanite fade or change color over timeno there are no likely situations in which the color of moissanite will be permanently changed moissanite does undergo a temporary color change when exposed to extreme heat from a jewelers torch during jewelry repair but with proper bench techniques there will be no lasting damage and the stone will return to its normal color once it cools is moissanite graded on the gia diamond color grading scalethere are three grades of moissanite available today colorless def range nearcolorless ghi range and with faint hues of color jk range does moissanite have inclusionsyes moissanite can have needlelike inclusions that can be seen under x magnification however they are not visible to the naked eye and do not affect the clarity of the stone its worth noting that nearly every gem has some sort of inclusion they are unique characteristics which occur in the formation of the crystalline structure hardness resistance to scratching  toughness resistance to breaking is moissanite resistant to scratchingyes moissanite is durable tough and extremely resistant to scratching and abrasion with a hardness of  moissanite is harder than all other gemstones except diamond charles  colvard provides a limited lifetime warranty that protects against damage to the stone does moissanite break easilyno moissanite is one of the toughest known gemstones studies in high pressure research have shown that moissanite is highly resistant to breaking and chipping charles  colvard provides a limited lifetime warranty that protects against damage to the stone is moissanite heat resistantyes moissanite exhibits more heat resistance than many other gemstones including diamond tests prove that at ºf  higher than the equivalent intensity of a house fire  moissanite gems remain intact and as brilliant as the day they were created this heat tolerance makes moissanite unlikely to suffer damage during jewelry repair identifying moissanite how can moissanite be distinguished from other colorless gemstones there are five  methods determine if doubling of facet junctions is visible through magnification use a jeweler’s loupe to examine the girdle of the stone  forever one™ and forever brilliant® moissanite stones approximately mm and larger are engraved on the girdle for easy identification examine for needlelike inclusions typically perpendicular to the table facet which are visible in moissanite under x loupe magnification examine for specific refractive and gravity indices have a trained gemologist or jeweler use a testing device specifically designed to distinguish moissanite from diamond purchasing moissanite what is the difference between forever one ™ forever brilliant® and forever classic™ moissanitecharles  colvard forever one moissanite is a triumph of art science and sustained effort the structural configuration of this new moissanite material is what yields its unsurpassed colorless def quality while chemically it is still silicon carbide sic and its optical and hardness properties remain the same it is the stacking of sic material in the manufacturing process that makes forever one moissanite unlike any of its predecessors through its research and development efforts working with forever one charles  colvard has developed a second grade of forever one in ghi quality this near colorless gemstone emits a faint icy hue compared to its forever brilliant predecessor which yields a warm hue this new nearcolorless gemstone is only

availableyes moissanite is available in various shapes and sizes the most popular cut continues to be the round brilliant cut and fancy cuts such as asscher cushion oval and square brilliant are available as well why is moissanite sold by millimeter rather than by carat weightthe carat is the traditional unit of measurement for a diamonds weight moissanite is not measured in carats because it weighs approximately  percent less than diamond for example a mm round diamond would weigh ct while a mm round moissanite would weigh ct the two stones would be the same size  mm in diameter all stones for sale are listed with their size in millimeters and the diamond equivalent weight dew in carats will moissanite retain its value over timedue to its rarity and unrivaled beauty charles

facts what is moissanitemoissanite is a rare naturally occurring mineral also known as silicon carbide which was first discovered by the nobel prizewinning chemist dr henri moissan at the site of a massive meteorite strike in arizona this intriguing new stone was named moissanite in his honor and moissan spent the rest of his life attempting to recreate this rare mineral in his laboratory it wasnt until the late s that scientists  working in a research laboratory located in research triangle park north carolina  developed the innovative thermal growing process that creates silicon carbide crystals these crystals are fashioned into moissanite gemstones that rival any natural gemstone for fire and brilliance these manmade gems are more durable than diamond sapphire ruby or emerald is

forever classic™ moissanitecharles  colvard forever one moissanite is a triumph of art science and sustained effort the structural configuration of this new moissanite material is what yields its

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf
