department of homeland security there are more than  million containers worldwide and it is estimated that there are approximately  million shipboard trips annually among seaports around the world  the maritime container shipping industry increases at an annual rate of about  almost  of the world’s manufactured goods are moved by container and roughly  arriving by ship in the usa alone there are more than  of nonnorth american trade arrives by ship most of which is transported in maritime shipping containers these containers consist of large and sturdy metal boxes typically  ft wide by  ft high and  ft in length containers are moved frequently being transferred often between ships railroad cars and highway tractortrailers     pan ocean container supplies co ltd   pan ocean container supplies co ltd otcbb paoc utilizes innovative solutions to build industryleading shipping and multipurpose containers in order to execute a carefully engineered design concept pan ocean is dedicated to manufacturing secure green intelligent and lightweight containers recognized for its high industry standards pan ocean was awarded its international organization for standardization iso certification in january  manufacturing companies that meet iso standards and are granted its seal of approval are regarded highly in the container manufacturing industry and to date the company offers five individualized containers   pan ocean was founded in july  and initiated production in july  based in jiaxing zhejiang province pan ocean has become china’s leading enterprise in container manufacturing currently the company has a registered capital of  million dollars with a total investment of  million dollars the entire project requisition of land is  square meters m square feet  square meters k square feet of which is allocated to the building area and  square meters k square feet is allocated to the container yard the expected annual output is  teu twentyfoot equivalent unit   there are four individual production plants cold work fabrication subassembly main assembly and painting respectively pan ocean’s collaboration of advanced technology and expertise enables the company to produce secure high quality highyield cargo containers in a costeffective manner     market opportunity the wall st journal cites that chinas container ports have registered some of their biggest gains in porthandling volumes this year as a result of us economic growth and european economic recovery  after analyzing the last month of the third quarter  wsj found that “traffic at chinese coastal container ports which number more than a dozen grew  in september  according to analyst helane becker an increase in global gdp leads to container demand growth by two or three times global gross domestic product is a key indicator for global economy which combines all individual economies worldwide when looking at the gross domestic product  gdp of selected global regions it is obvious that gdp is highest in industrialized countries   global gdp for  according to statista is at  up from ’s  and nearly an entire percentage point higher than that of    these figures support the potential growth containerized trade should see into the coming year in addition to this the competitive advantage for pan ocean stems from an successful mix of several key factors including    qualitycertified with worldwide distribution capabilities wellestablished relationships with leading international shipping leasing and container trading companies clear strategy and design concept advanced equipment to produce a highyield latest welding techniques to ensure the highest quality cost efficient production processes situated in close proximity to major airports ports and railways   additional opportunities for pan ocean outside of shipping   pan ocean represents a tremendous opportunity for the container manufacturing industry in addition to a strategic alignment with major shipping leasing and container trading companies paoc has new product and expansion initiatives in the works the new product comes in the form of shipping container homes these ecofriendly custom homes incorporate the latest technology of building architecture with shipping container therefore this ideal material will allow paoc to build the homes efficiently and at a low cost   more and more architects builders and prospective home owners are seeing the potential of shipping containers as modular building components in architecture and green prefab home building designs  the iso shipping container has been designed to stringent standards not only to withstand the extreme weather conditions on sea voyages but also to withstand the stacking of  fully laden containers makes it an ideal construction medium    new geography estimates that america will have to house some  million more people by  so the demand for humane affordable sustainable housing is going to escalate dramatically in the coming years  for most americans particularly millennials the demand for affordable homes near workplaces will be paramount shipping crates have been used in construction for thousands of years but today the old practice is being revived with entrepreneurial innovative outsidethebox thinking   these containers can be cut fabricated remodeled and turned into a basic home structure for approximately  a square foot compared to the us median list price per square foot  according to zillow this puts a whole new industry in front of shipping container manufacturers and even if global shipping were to decline dramatically these companies could still benefit from the increased demand for affordable housing solutions     opportunity to capitalize on value proposition   in the shipping container industry there are several market leading companies that have continued to beat estimates  textainer group holdings ltd tgh which holds a current market cap of billion reported thirdquarter earnings of  million earnings adjusted for nonrecurring gains came to  cents per share which beat wall street expectations the average estimate of analysts surveyed by zacks investment research was for earnings of  cents per share    cai international inc cap with a current market cap of m reported earnings of  million in its third quarter earnings adjusted for nonrecurring gains were  cents per share and in line with textainer these results beat wall street expectations the average estimate of analysts surveyed was for earnings of  cents per share  so for investors looking to profit on shipping container companies the industry looks ripe for future growth in our opinion  market participants like textainer and cai trade above  per share currently pan ocean trades at share with a market cap just slightly under m or about  that of cai international    should things be held equal and pan ocean moves toward a similar market cap as cai or even that of textainer price per share would be in the area of  per share  currently pan ocean shows that it could be incredibly undervalued at its current trading price with massive potential to increase in value as the company continues to progress further in the shipping container industry    paoc current price volume bid ask days range paoc detailed quote dmmmmyyyy post new msg follow board my stocks  hide intro view

of approval are regarded highly in the container manufacturing industry and to date the company offers five individualized containers  pan ocean was founded in july  and initiated production in july  based in jiaxing zhejiang province pan ocean has become china’s leading enterprise in container manufacturing currently the company has a registered capital of  million dollars with a total investment of  million dollars the entire project requisition of land is  square meters m square feet  square meters k square feet of which is allocated to the building area and  square meters k square feet is allocated to the container yard the expected annual output is  teu twentyfoot equivalent unit there are four individual production plants cold work fabrication subassembly main assembly and painting respectively pan ocean’s collaboration of advanced technology and expertise enables the company to produce secure high quality highyield cargo containers in a costeffective manner market opportunity the wall st journal cites that chinas container ports have registered some of their biggest gains in porthandling volumes this year as a result of us economic growth and european economic recovery after analyzing the last month of the third quarter  wsj found that “traffic at chinese coastal container ports which number more than a dozen grew  in september according to analyst helane becker an increase in global gdp leads to container demand growth by two or three times global gross domestic product is a key indicator for global economy which combines all individual economies worldwide when looking at the gross domestic product  gdp of selected global regions it is obvious that gdp is highest in industrialized countries  global gdp for  according to statista is at  up from ’s  and nearly an entire percentage point higher than that of   these figures support the potential growth containerized trade should see into the coming year in addition to this the competitive advantage for pan ocean stems from an successful mix of several key factors including    ·       qualitycertified with worldwide distribution capabilities  wellestablished relationships with leading international shipping leasing and container trading companies  clear strategy and design concept advanced equipment to produce a highyield latest welding techniques to ensure the highest quality cost efficient production processes  situated in close proximity to major airports ports and railways additional opportunities for pan ocean outside of shipping pan ocean represents a tremendous opportunity for the container manufacturing industry in addition to a strategic alignment with major shipping leasing and container trading companies paoc has new product and expansion initiatives in the works the new product comes in the form of shipping container homes these ecofriendly custom homes incorporate the latest technology of building architecture with shipping container therefore this ideal material will allow paoc to build the homes efficiently and at a low cost more and more architects builders and prospective home owners are seeing the potential of shipping containers as modular building components in architecture and green prefab home building designs the iso shipping container has been designed to stringent standards not only to withstand the extreme weather conditions on sea voyages but also to withstand the stacking of  fully laden containers makes it an ideal construction medium  new geography estimates that america will have to house some  million more people by  so the demand for humane affordable sustainable housing is going to escalate dramatically in the coming years for most americans particularly millennials the demand for affordable homes near workplaces will be paramount shipping crates have been used in construction for thousands of years but today the old practice is being revived with entrepreneurial innovative outsidethebox thinking  these containers can be cut fabricated remodeled and turned into a basic home structure for approximately  a square foot compared to the us median list price per square foot  according to zillow this puts a whole new industry in front of shipping container manufacturers and even if global shipping were to decline dramatically these companies could still benefit from the increased demand for affordable housing solutions opportunity to capitalize on value proposition in the shipping container industry there are several market leading companies that have continued to beat estimates textainer group holdings ltd tgh which holds a current market cap of billion reported thirdquarter earnings of  million earnings adjusted for nonrecurring gains came to  cents per share which beat wall street expectations the average estimate of analysts surveyed by zacks investment research was for earnings of  cents per share  cai international inc cap with a current market cap of m reported earnings of  million in its third quarter earnings adjusted for nonrecurring gains were  cents per share and in line with textainer these results beat wall street expectations the average estimate of analysts surveyed was for earnings of  cents per share so for investors looking to profit on shipping container companies the industry looks ripe for future growth in our opinion market participants like textainer and cai trade above  per share currently pan ocean trades at share with a market cap just slightly under m or about  that of cai international  should things be held equal and pan ocean moves toward a similar market cap as cai or even that of textainer price per share would be in the area of  per share currently pan ocean shows that it could be incredibly undervalued at its current trading price with massive potential to increase in value as the company continues to progress further in the shipping container industry     this press release has been viewed  times on pr buzz
