cio and evp of technology academy if you’re not involved in of art university erik is cio and evp of technology for academy of art university the largest art  design university in the country prior to 0 erik was cio for invista sarl and led all it activities in more than 0 sites worldwide erik has spent almost a third of his career living outside the united states including asia where he served for four years as the chief information officer  and business consulting services for dupont for the region challenges in technology to meet enterprise needs in  and expectations the most important challenge is to at all times have a full understand of our students’ needs at all points in their lifecycle with us from prospective students to alumni we want every member of our team that is serving the student to benefit from the knowledge that one of our other team members has so that no opportunities are missed in terms of helping students prepare for the workforce wish list for  continued progress in integrating across legacy platforms and reducing the technology barriers effort and costs amazingly desktop procurement deployment and support are time draining activities that keep us away from students and the cost productivity for utility services wireless bandwidth and storage aren’t keeping track with increased demand from a base of digital native creative since i am wishing i would wish for the technology providers and journalists to reach a greater audience on how information  technology is changing business practice technology trends impacting enterprise business environment instrumentation and personalization are two of those trends i know “big data” is buzzy but to me the collection of data is fundamentally principle to any attempt to infer fact by processing big data the chemical engineer in me loves the idea that instruments are being deployed to measure anything and everything anywhere and that we can have access to process and result metrics that have never been thinkable before very rich personalization adding the social information that the culture has evolved is allowing huge impact on process effectiveness and commercial success better yet we all now expect this level of service from vendors and reward it consistently the areas in business environment where solutions do not yet exist or not up to the mark and which if existed wouldve made job easier every technology leader is challenged by the burden of support vs the benefits of processes  functionality creating new values investment is limited so this boring old issue remains protecting proprietary information has grown well beyond trade secrets into student protection and privacy and we must constantly be vigilant it is a constant battle that requires a serious investment  but that is a cio’s reality my roles and responsibilities as a cio the operational excellence part of the cio’s job has grown in scale and scope because the technology has become more mission critical but i believe the strategic relevance of the role has increased more so due to the changing competitive environment tighter margins create more stress on limited project budgets responding to the changing consumer nature and expectations quickly changes the playing field and technology complexity and change management is also greater than ever – and i believe today’s cios are more relevant to the success of the enterprise than at any time before lessons i learned as a cio that can help you short and sweet truly know the way your business creates value not the way they currently make money but how value is created and sustained if you’re not involved in the dialogue about how the firm creates value and how information and technology affects that you will not

to be open and honest he says i wont say it was easy it was a continual process with my wife and family mentally and emotionally preparing for a protracted search is critical says iain mckeand director of the uk cio practice at recruiter harvey nash not only does the supply of cio candidates worldwide far exceed the demand he says but the business climate has also changed since the last time many cios conducted a search where a cio may once have received job offers based on reputation and wellknown it achievements those factors are only part of the equation today the great recession

chemistry products and services distributor univar an it executive must understand business and macroeconomics in addition to knowing his target companys challenges and how he can appeal directly to the ceo and board of directors viens interviewed for several cio jobs while he consulted from 0 to  entrepreneurial flair technology knowhow visionary skills and talent management are just a few of the assets a top cio must possess he says or as mckeand puts it a cio has to be an allsinging alldancing individual but its hard to dance when rejections pile up and leads dwindle the average length of unemployment for an american worker is just over  weeks according to the latest data from the department of labor more than  percent or  million of the 0 million americans without jobs are considered longterm unemployedjobless for at least  weeks thats down from  percent in 0 and  but its still bad news the longterm unemployed have just a  percent chance of finding a fulltime job in any

and fears with other outofwork execs and updating your approach to jobhunting the way you target companies probably needs a revamp your view of the cio role may not match the jobs available some it executives are finding that positions that fulfill their desires and fill out their resumes arent necessarily called cio more give than take on the day in february 0 when mark stone was thrown into the job market as zale did away with his cio position he hadnt written a resume in  years he hadnt thought to build his peer network in almost as long stone floundered for the first two months scraping through an outdated rolodex for leads when he nabbed even an informal meeting he says he couldnt explain what he did best i was illprepared for interviewing the job market had changed he says i was clueless then stone who has degrees in accounting and divinity devised for himself a new approach to networking based on an economy of goodwill he decided to help as many people as he could through mentoring job tips and technology advice among other methods he met for breakfasts and lunches and attended local professional groups and conferences his payitforward idea is that once youve helped someone they may want to return the favor and actively look for ways to do it the conversations meanwhile helped him hone his professional pitch and revealed companies hidden opportunities and needs he wouldnt have known about otherwise he says six months later he was hired as cio of safetykleen an environmental cleanup company ever since he has sent a newsletter about this professional life to his contacts as well as maintained a vigorous mentoring schedule stone was at safetykleen for more than three years when it was acquired and the new owner installed its own senior executives in january  he told his network he was again out of a job and soon received lots of leads theyve now got the opportunity to help me back he says it was like lighting a match to a pile of dry kindling in april he started as cio for the texas am university system stones best jobseeker advice never ever disappear your best you seasoned cios will say that in targeting potential employers you want to match your skills to the job opening and to the overall corporate culture but you have to do it without losing yourself a big mistake stone made at first for example was trying to become what he thought the person across the table wanted rather than presenting what makes him unique whats crucial says viens a longtime cio is to create a statement about yourself that makes you stand out it can be hard to position yourself correctly in the short time you get with company executives as he has sought senior it leadership positions over the years he has struggled with how to get the right people to pay attention and hear what he wanted them to hear he says they make decisions based on a very partial view of you it takes stamina to maintain a grueling cycle of preparing interviewing and reinterviewing then being evaluated discussed and dissected throw in some psychometric testing where companies use a series of questions often administered by a psychologist to discern attitudes and personality traits and a jobseeker can feel drained says mckeand from harvey nash ive seen some candidates pull out of the process because of these methods he says gamechangers need not apply we hear a lot about how good cios should help set company strategy and spin new revenue out of customer data while you may want to do such work its not part of the typical cio job description says recruiter martha heller president of heller search associates rather it comes with power and status earned in the role over time usually a cio position is open because something is wrong in the companys it department and the ceo wants a new leader to fix it heller says for example projects may be failing or it may not get along well with the rest of the company she says having the cio put technology into core products and meet with external customers is far down on the priorities list michael iacona found as much during his search in  he had left the cio job at advertising firm tmp worldwide and wanted a spot where he could significantly influence a companys performance he says ceos arent asking that of cios a lot of times he says some ceos and boards of directors which influence cio hiring are skeptical of the it leader doing anything other than making technology run he says after making it to the final two candidates a few times but not getting the job iacona decided to branch out from the cio role mike clifford former cio of whole foods markets has been on a personal sabbatical since september  and now expects that his next gig will not be as a cio clifford left the  billion grocery chain after  years due to what he calls a mutual decision that it was time for a different voice to lead it there he had some exploratory talks about other cio and cto jobs but realized he wasnt committed to the role he was tired of answering technology questions he says my heart wasnt in it this yearplus of reflection has him contemplating operations jobs that contribute to growing a young company hes no longer driven to chase titles for personal accomplishment he says and given that there is a limited number of large companies in the austin area where he lives he doesnt foresee an enticing cio job opening soon i will find something i want rather than doing something someone just needs related careers it jobs skills and training it leadership        page  next new download
