bcx galidesivir is a viral rnadependent rna polymerase rdrp inhibitor discovered by biocryst scientists that has demonstrated broadspectrum activity in multiple viruses and a favorable preliminary

andor oral therapeutics for viruses that pose a threat to health and national security in september  niaid contracted with biocryst in september  for the development of bcx as a treatment for marburg virus disease and potentially for other filoviruses including ebola virus disease the total funding from niaid could be up to  million over five years if all contract options are exercisedin march  biocryst announced that the biomedical advanced research and development authority barda within the us department of health and human services’ office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response aspr has awarded biocryst a contract for the continued development of bcx as a potential treatment for diseases caused by rna pathogens including filoviruses this asprbarda contract includes a base contract of  million to support bcx drug manufacturing as well as  million in additional development options that can be exercised by the government bringing the potential value of the contract to  millionbiocryst intends to develop one or more smallmolecule antiviral drugs directed against viral ribonucleic acid rna polymerase a common and essential component of rna viruses this approach could allow a single drug to address gaps in the us government’s medical countermeasure plan such as treatments for viral hemorrhagic fevers and to possibly replace multiple pathogenspecific drugs for use in response to both natural outbreaks and bioterrorist threatsrna polymerase plays a crucial role in viral replication process transcription and replication of the virus genome nucleoside rna polymerase inhibitors such as bcx are metabolized to the active triphosphate nucleotide form by cellular kinases the drug nucleotide binds to the viral enzyme active site and becomes incorporated into the growing viral rna strand leading to premature chain termination interfering with the replication process is a wellestablished antiviral strategy that has been successfully exploited in developing such lifesaving drugs as the nucleoside inhibitors of hiv and acyclovir for herpes simplex complex bcx may be suitable for administration by intravenous iv intramuscular im and oral po routes biocryst
