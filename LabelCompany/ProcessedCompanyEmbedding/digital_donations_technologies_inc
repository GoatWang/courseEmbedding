important to making an investment decision a potential investor should read the following summary together with the more detailed information regarding the company and the common stock being sold in this offering including “risk factors” and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus   the company   history   digital donations technologies inc formerly known as fishing ridge acquisition corporation  “ ddti ” or the “ company ”  was incorporated in delaware on may   and filed a registration statement on form  with the securities and exchange commission on july   and became a public reporting company sixty days thereafter   in january  fishing ridge acquisition corporation changed its name to digital donations technologies inc pursuant to a change of control with the resignation of the then officers and directors redemption of  shares of the  outstanding shares of its common stock the appointment of new officers and directors and the issuance of  shares of common stock pro rata to the new shareholders of the company   on october   ddti effected the acquisition of digital donations inc a new york corporation  “ digital donations ”  the “ acquisition ”  as a whollyowned subsidiary with the issuance of shares of its common stock in exchange for the  outstanding shares of common stock of digital donations inc   prior to the acquisition the company had no business or operations pursuant to the acquisition the company acquired the business plan operations and contracts of its now whollyowned subsidiary digital donations inc  “ digital donations ”  throughout the disclosure contained herein reference to the company includes that information of its whollyowned subsidiary digital donations as appropriate particularly in regard to financial information and operations   business   ddti is an earlystage company formed to support the nonprofit industry with innovative and cost effective fundraising technologies providing alternative payment and fundraising solutions giving consumers the option to make a small donation as part of a financial transaction such as at a checkout or atm transaction the company is currently developing fundraising platforms which allow nonprofit organizations “npo” to present requests for contributions to potential donors at the time such possible donors pay for goods and services at the point of sale “pos” at participating merchants atm’s mobile devices or via the company’s online web site   risks and uncertainties facing the company   as a development stage company the company has no operating history and has experienced losses since its inception the company’s independent auditors have issued a report questioning the company’s ability to continue as a going concern that is the company needs to create a source of revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans as a development stage company management of the company has no prior experience in building and selling projects similar to that planned by the company and in marketing and distributing such projects on a broad scale   one of the biggest challenges facing the company is the ability to raise adequate capital to develop and execute project opportunities in the nonprofit fundraising technology industry   due to financial constraints the company has to date conducted limited operations if the company were unable to develop strong and reliable sources of funding for project opportunities it is unlikely that the company could develop its operations to return revenue sufficient to further develop its business plan moreover the above assumes that the company’s efforts are met with customer satisfaction in the marketplace and exhibit steady adoption of its solutions amongst the potential base of customers neither of which are currently known or guaranteed     –    –     trading market   currently there is no trading market for the securities of the company the company intends to initially apply for admission to quotation of its securities on the otc bulletin board as soon as possible which may be while this offering is still in process there can be no assurance that the company will qualify for quotation of its securities on the otc bulletin board   the offering   the maximum number of shares that can be sold pursuant to the terms of this offering is  the offering will terminate twentyfour  months from the date of this prospectus unless earlier terminated by the company   this prospectus relates to the offer and sale of  shares of common stock of digital donations technologies inc offered by the holders thereof who are deemed to be statutory underwriters the selling shareholders will offer their shares at a price of  until such time as the shares are quoted on the otc bulletin board and only thereafter at prevailing market or privately negotiated prices in one or more transactions that may take place by ordinary broker’s transactions privatelynegotiated transactions or through sales to one or more dealers for resale or at prevailing market if a market should develop   common stock outstanding before the offering                 common stock for sale by selling shareholders                  common stock outstanding after the offering                  offering price per share                 proceeds to the company          based on number of shares outstanding as of the date of this prospectus   in the future following the completion of this offering the company will most likely need to raise capital for the projects which it anticipates to develop the company anticipates that it may raise such capital by an offering of its shares of common stock if the company does effect equity offerings of its securities and if the price paid for shares offered in such an offering is less than paid by the purchasers of shares then such purchasers will suffer a dilution in the value of their shares furthermore the issuance of such additional shares may impact the ability of any investor to sell their shares once such shares are eligible for sale the company cannot anticipate that it will be able to effect such additional offerings of its securities and then failure of it to do so may severely impact its available capital to develop any transportation systems or further its business plan    risk factors   a purchase of any shares is an investment in the company’s common stock and involves a high degree of risk investors should consider carefully the following information about these risks together with the other information contained in the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part before the purchase of any shares if any of the following risks actually occur the business financial condition or results of operations of the company would likely suffer the market price of the common stock would likely decline and investors could lose all or a portion of their investment the company has listed the following risk factors which it believes to be those material to an investment decision in this offering     –    –     the company has limited operating history through its subsidiary   the company is a development stage company and has limited operating history the company is relying on management to actuate and develop its business plan through its operating subsidiary the company’s subsidiary has limited business history and an investor will be required to make an investment decision based largely on the management and the projected operations in light of the risks expenses and uncertainties that may be encountered by engaging in the technological development and marketing of platforms for use in charitable donations at the time of electronic transactions   the company’s independent auditors have issued a report questioning the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   the notes contained in the financial statements of the company’s wholly owned subsidiary digital donations for the year ended december   include a paragraph that explains that digital donations has incurred operating losses since inception and at december   had an accumulated deficit of  and incurred a net loss of  the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company’s ability to fund future operations through additional financing from investors andor lenders or through the sale of its securities or through development of its operations due to these and other factors the company ’ s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt of the company ’ s ability to continue as a going concern   as of june   the company has accumulated deficit of    as of june   the company had an accumulated deficit of  and in incurred a net loss of  during the six months ended june   this deficit may impact on the company in various ways including but not limited to making it more difficult to borrow money sell stock or to maintain a good market price   the company may not be able to meet its outstanding loan obligation   the company’s whollyowned subsidiary executed promissory notes totaling a principal amount of  payable  days from date of execution with interest at  per annum interest is payable quarterly without the influx of additional capital the company will not be able to meet the payment obligations for these loans when they become due if the company is not able to pay such obligations nor obtain a waiver or delay it may face serious dissolution demands   in order to continue operations the company has undertaken a private offering of its securities in order to raise necessary funds   in order to raise necessary funds to continue operations and meet its obligations the company is offering up to  shares of its common stock at a per share price of  the company has initially sold shares at  per share there is no assurance that the company can raise additional funds through its offering and without such influx of such capital or without capital from other sources such as loans or debt offering the company may not be able to continue operations   investors in the offering will experience immediate dilution of the value of their shares   purchasers of the shares will experience immediate dilution in the value of their shares dilution represents the difference between the price per share paid by investors  and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of the offering net tangible book value per share is the net tangible assets of the company total assets less total liabilities less intangible assets divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding at june   the company’s net tangible per share book value was  thus if at some other time shares had been sold by the company at a price less than the  paid by purchasers of the shares or had been issued by the company for services or as other noncash consideration then the value of such investor shares immediately after purchase would be less than the purchase price the company has issued shares prior to the date of this prospectus at a price less than  in addition the company is currently offering up to  shares of its common stock at a price of  per share and has sold approximately  shares at an average approximate price of  per share the issuance of any shares pursuant to such private offering will immediately dilute the value of the shares paid by investors pursuant to this prospectus the company anticipates issuing up to  shares of its common stock in an asset purchase if the value of those assets are such that the value of the  shares is less than  then investors will experience additional dilution     –    –     the offering price of the shares has been arbitrarily determined and such price should not be used by an investor as an indicator of the fair market value of the shares   currently there is no public market for the company’s common stock the offering price for the shares has been arbitrarily determined and does not necessarily bear any direct relationship to the assets operations book or other established criteria of value of the company thus an investor should be aware that the offering price does not reflect the fair market price of the shares   in order to actuate its business plan and further develop its technology the company will need additional capital   the company will not receive any funds from the sale of the shares offered herein and will require capital by loans joint ventures or sale of its securities in order to execute its current business plan namely to further develop the technology of its platforms for consumer donations at electronic transaction sites such as atms checkout machines and web sites if the company were unable to locate such financing on terms acceptable to the company it is unlikely that the company could develop its operations to return revenue sufficient to further develop its business plan   no assurance of commercial feasibility   even if the company’s plans and projects are successfully initiated there can be no assurance that such plans and projects will have any commercial success or advantage also there is no assurance that the company’s initiatives will perform as intended in the marketplace   the company’s developed software may experience unexpected “bugs” which may delay its release or impede its use   the company is developing its proprietary software and intends to effect beta and other testing to ensure efficient launch and usability however the company’s software may experience or develop unanticipated “bugs” that would either delay its release or impede its use once released such delays or problems could impact the company’s ability to generate revenue or could negatively affect any contractual relationships with users of the software   there has been no prior public market for the company’s common stock and the lack of such a market may make resale of the shares difficult   no prior public market has existed for the company’s securities and the company cannot assure any purchaser that a market will develop subsequent to this offering the company intends to apply for quotation of its common stock on the otc bulletin board when appropriate however the company does not know if it will be successful in such application how long such application will take or if successful that a market for the common stock will ever develop or continue on that or any other trading market if for any reason a trading market for the shares does not develop investors may have difficulty selling their common stock should they desire to do so   the company’s election not to opt out of jobs act extended accounting transition period may not make its financial statements easily comparable to other companies   pursuant to the jobs act of  as an emerging growth company the company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the pcaob or the sec the company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies the company as an emerging growth company can adopt the standard for the private company this may make comparison of the company’s financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used     –    –     the company’s stock may be considered a penny stock and any investment in the company’s stock will be considered a highrisk investment and subject to restrictions on marketability   if the shares commence trading the trading price of the company’s common stock may be below  per share if the price of the common stock is below such level trading in its common stock would be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended these rules require additional disclosure by brokerdealers in connection with any trades generally involving any nonnasdaq equity security that has a market price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions such rules require the delivery before any penny stock transaction of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith and impose various sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors generally institutions for these types of transactions the brokerdealer must determine the suitability of the penny stock for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transactions before sale the additional burdens imposed upon brokerdealers by such requirements may discourage brokerdealers from effecting transactions in the company’s common stock which could impact the liquidity of the company’s common stock   the board of directors could use the issuance or designation of preferred stock to impede or discourage an acquisition of the company that may otherwise be beneficial to some shareholders   the issuance of shares of preferred stock or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal for instance the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable the holder to block such a transaction or facilitate a business combination by including voting rights that would provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders in addition under certain circumstances the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the common stock although the company’s board of directors is required to make any determination to issue such preferred stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of the stockholders of the company the board of directors could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some or a majority of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such stock the board of directors does not intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently authorized stock unless otherwise required by law or otherwise   the company relies on only key managers whose absence or loss could adversely affect the business   the company relies on the services of its two key executives the loss of the services of either such manager could adversely affect the business   costs incurred because the company is a public company may affect the company’s profitability   as a public company the company incurs significant legal accounting and other expenses and the company is subject to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission relating to public disclosure that generally involve a substantial expenditure of financial resources in addition the sarbanesoxley act of  as well as rules subsequently implemented by the sec requires changes in corporate governance practices of public companies the company expects that full compliance with such rules and regulations will significantly increase the company’s legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more timeconsuming and costly which may negatively impact the company’s financial results to the extent the company’s earnings suffer as a result of the financial impact of the company’s sec reporting or compliance costs the company’s ability to develop an active trading market for the company’s securities could be harmed   the company has a small financial and accounting organization being a public company strains the company’s resources diverts management’s attention and affects its ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors   as a reporting company the company is already subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  however the requirements of these laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder entail significant accounting legal and financial compliance costs which are potentially prohibitive to the company as it develops its business plan products and scope these costs have made and will continue to make some activities more difficult time consuming or costly and may place significant strain on its personnel systems and resources     –    –     the securities exchange act requires among other things that companies maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in order to maintain the requisite disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting significant resources and management oversight are required as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could have a material adverse effect on the development of the company’s business financial condition and results of operations    forwardlooking statements   this

which the shares are being offered has been arbitrarily determined by the company   the shares offered by the selling shareholders may be offered and sold from time to time by the selling shareholders

company does not anticipate that it will declare dividends in the foreseeable future but rather intends to use any future earnings for the development of its business the company’s board of directors may determine at some future date to declare dividends based on results of operations financial condition contractual restrictions applicable law and other factors deemed relevant by the board such dividend declaration is not currently contemplated   dilution       if you invest in our common stock in this offering your ownership interest will be immediately diluted to the extent of the

the shares issued by our subsidiary are included in the share count noted above after adjusting for these cash proceeds and common stock and note issuances our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of june   is  or  per share   dilution per share to new investors is determined by subtracting pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering from the initial public offering price per share paid by new investors the following table illustrates this dilution                 assumed public offering price per share               as adjusted pro forma tangible book value per share               increase in net tangible book value per share attributable to this offering               as adjusted pro forma net tangible book value per share after this offering

dilution per share to new investors   the following table sets forth on an as adjusted basis the difference between the number of shares of common stock purchased from us the total consideration paid and the average price per share paid by our existing stockholders and the average price to be paid by new investors in this public offering before deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
