degree that few other firms can match  all of our money is invested alongside our clients source turtle creek asset management incunique value propositionour investment process starts by choosing the right companies the single most important decision we make is which of the companies among the thousands of public companies deserve our ongoing time and attention we strive to select good companies  sound businesses with strong management that drive their intrinsic value higher over time even in difficult periods such as the credit crisis of  during this crisis many companies went bankrupt and many more were forced to issue equity at very low prices in contrast we owned companies that had and continue to have strong balance sheets and that in many circumstances were able to take advantage of the financial crisis to build long term value either through reinvesting in their businesses or by making strategic acquisitions get to know the companies extremely well after choosing the right companies on which to focus we spend considerable time and effort formulating and maintaining a view of each company’s value our background skillset and approach  spending our time on the right things  differentiate us from other investment managers we enjoy the long and hard process of really understanding a company we believe that our discipline and the depth of our analysis is rare build and maintain an optimal portfolio having spent the time to understand each of our company’s value we then construct an optimal portfolio simplistically our optimal portfolio is diversified over approximately  companies in largely unrelated industries with the size of each holding determined by many factors the most important being how attractively priced it is changes to our portfolio over time are primarily driven by our response to changes in traded prices  the cheaper a company gets the more of it we own the more expensive a company gets the less we own source turtle creek asset

introduction the three partners for over  years andrew brenton jeffrey cole and jeffrey hebel have managed their personal wealth and that of a select group of clients  they have worked together continuously for over  years – prior to turtle creek they managed a  million private equity fund for a canadian bank  prior to their public and private equity investment experience they had collectively  years of experience in mergers and acquisitions and corporate finance  the partners have filled  positions as directors on the boards of  different public and private companies  their approach to investing is unique partly because of their backgrounds – they have the perspective that comes from having been for many years deeply involved with companies as controlling shareholders board members or as trusted advisors what we believe we believe that it is possible to outperform the market in the long term through a well considered consistent and flexible investment approach we believe that it is possible to both protect your capital and earn superior investment returns  at the same time  it is not an eitheror proposition we believe that properly selected equities should be the overwhelming portion of ones investments regardless of age we believe that investors over value and confuse current yield at the expense of capital growth and at the expense of their own wealth we believe that short term price fluctuations are irrelevant to the assessment of risk that investors in their pursuit of low volatility are constantly sub optimizing  risk is the prospect of a decline in the intrinsic value of an investment we believe that it is pointless to worry about what everyone else is doing in the market trying to guess where traded prices are going in the long run intrinsic value is all that matters how we have done   since turtle creek began on november   an investment of  has grown to over  which equals a compound annual increase of  this is in stark contrast to the broader market where the sptsx composite has increased from  to  which equals a compound annual increase of    a different way to look at turtle creeks results is to measure investment performance over a reasonable period of time at various entry points  we do this by calculating returns over three year rolling periods ie oct  to oct  nov  to nov      we chose three years because that is the point at which the market starts to cross over from being a voting machine to that of a weighing machine ie it is the minimum period by which to properly measure investment performance  turtle creek has outperformed the market as measured by the sptsx composite  of the time – often by a significant amount – and has had negative three year returns only  of the time in comparison the market has had negative three year returns  of the time distribution of annualized  year returnsfrom founding in  to present   turtle creeks performance is of turtle creek investment fund class a series  units tcif to november   and turtle creek equity fund class i series  units thereafter and is net of all fees carried interest and expenses  since turtle creek equity fund maintains an almost identical portfolio with that of tcif with the exception of tcif’s private company investments historical performance for tcif has been combined with that of turtle creek equity fund  there were no private investments in tcif before  and in aggregate the private investments had a negligible impact on tcifs returns to november    tcif’s carried interest structure is not the same as the structure used for turtle creek equity fund details available upon request  all data is in a common currency canadian dollars  sptsx composite is a total return index  comparisons to certain indices are provided for illustrative purposes only and are intended to indicate broad market performance  comparisons to indices are limited because indices are not managed and do not charge fees or expenses  the fund may underperform or outperform the indices for many reasons   past performance must never be construed as investment advice or a prediction of future performance source turtle creek asset management bloomberg  as at may   alignment turtle creek is where we are investing all of our wealth and it is where a number of investors who know us well have had all of their wealth for many years  turtle creek is not run by salaried money managers who will simply move on to a new job if their returns are poor  turtle creek is run by us – its founders and largest investors  we are investing all of our own wealth here to the best of our ability and it happens that the type of investments we make and the approach we follow allows us to manage much more than our own capital without impacting our investment returns  this strong alignment eliminates concerns as to conflicts of interest and lack of focus and attention from ones wealth manager  in essence it eliminates a number of the risks of choosing a manager and allows you to focus on a more limited set of criteria such as  is the manager capable experienced and hard working  rest assured we are six founding principles many years ago the partners struggled with the same issues that confront all investors  how to best protect and grow ones wealth  from many conversations we identified some fundamental investment truths that became our six founding principles   all of our money     we believe that an investment manager with a broad unconstrained mandate such as ourselves should place substantially all of their personal financial assets in the same investments as their clients  that is exactly what we have committed to do and as you know this is relatively rare       for a long time in making investment decisions for turtle creek we take a long term view   an extended time horizon is important because we have no control in the short term over the price that others will pay for our assets  as long as we are comfortable with our investments we really do not care what happens to the price in the shorter term  many times after we have made an initial investment the price of that investment has declined  so we have done what any rational investor should do  purchased more of the investment at ever lower prices confident in our belief that given enough time the traded price of the investment would ultimately recover to reflect intrinsic value and time and again this has proven to be the case  a long term view and the absence of shortterm pressure to maintain a certain unit value are very liberating  as odd as this sounds we actually welcome a decline in the price of an investment so long as it is not caused by a negative change in the underlying business because such a price decline affords us the opportunity to buy more   abhor lazy money this principle was one of the drivers toward the creation of turtle creek  it might be more accurately stated as “abhorring money that is periodically active but then neglected for long periods”  at various times before the creation of turtle creek the founding investors would find themselves with excess cash and would ‘look to invest it’  it struck us as a frighteningly inefficient way to invest  looking for a good investment only at that point in time simply because you have some cash  we determined that a far better vehicle for investing would be a continuously optimal portfolio to which each investor could periodically contribute or withdraw capital as their needs dictated perhaps the term lazy money is a little misleading  our goal is to ensure that turtle creek is always smart money inasmuch as it is striving to achieve a constantly optimal portfolio  even though an investor may make an excellent investment they often do not appreciate that the investment process is dynamic and neverending  over time the price and fundamentals of their investment will undoubtedly change as well as that of their other investments  unless rigorous and persistent analysis is brought to bear on these changing factors over time it becomes lazy money   abhor overdiversification one of the consequences of modern portfolio theory has been an obsessive pursuit of greater and greater diversification to the point where most investors attempt to have their financial assets spread over an exceptionally large base  simply put it is impossible to outperform the market when you are diversified to such an extent that you become the market obviously some degree of diversification is appropriate  but whats often missed in this discussion is that once you own  companies in industries unrelated to each other with each company facing its own unique opportunities and challenges you are substantially as diversified as portfolios containing hundreds of companies  and if you know these companies very well you can construct a higher quality portfolio with a larger discount to intrinsic value than the overall market  this is exactly what we do and it is this approach which lowers the overall level of risk for our portfolio   the only value is the present value of future cash flows during the depression in the early ’s a legendary investor bernard baruch became so disillusioned with the ever lower levels of the stock market that he ‘threw in the towel’ and argued that the only value of a stock is the price that someone else will pay for it  most investors believe this and spend their time and efforts attempting to divine the direction of the stock markets or individual stocks to ‘read the mind of the market’  john maynard keynes likened this phenomenon to being a judge at a beauty contest where you weren’t trying to pick the prettiest contestant but were trying to guess which contestant would win by guessing how every other judge would vote recognizing that every other judge was doing the same thing and with many of the judges taking this to a third fourth or fifth iteration it is the rare investor who approaches the market by recognizing that a common share is a direct ownership right to a specific proportion of all future cash flows of a corporation  approached in this way however the market can be seen for what it is  simply a place where you can buy or sell portions of companies   prices will fluctuate around value we acknowledge that this is not so much a principle as it is an observation but it is such an important observation that it forms one of the major tenets of our investment approach  if there is one thing that we can confidently predict it is that share prices of publicly traded companies will fluctuate  often these fluctuations are severe and abrupt we follow a simple approach  unless the price decline has been caused by a fundamentally negative event for the company which causes us to lower our view of its value we are happy to purchase more of the company at ever lower prices  a share price decline is one of the great tests for an investor  if you do not wish to buy more of the company are disappointed in the price decline and wonder if you should sell then you never should have owned it at the higher price level  we regularly ask ourselves  if the price of one of our investments was to drop would we be happy to buy more  if the answer is no then we should be reducing the position now  and just as we buy more when a stock declines we sell some when a stock increases in price  taking advantage of fluctuating share prices is a bonus above and beyond our core approach of owning good businesses for the long term copyright  turtle creek asset management all rights reserved turtle creek asset management  team introductionphilosophycommunicationsteamdocumentationcontact team investments andrew
