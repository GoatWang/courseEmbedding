the secret to your healthiest hair taylor bryantphoto matt baronbeimages rex usaa b c youve probably heard these numberandletter combos thrown around in the hair blogosphere lately but in the words of justin bieber what do they mean and you probably have that song stuck in your head now youre welcome on the most basic level it refers to a hairtyping system that helps you determine your texture to find the products and tools that are best for you the system — which is often imitated — was originally established by andre walker emmyaward winning celebrity hairstylist and the man behind oprah winfreys glorious curls in order to take care of your hair properly you need to identify it so i created the andre walker hairtyping system which at the time was just a way for me to categorize hair walker tells refinery you can check out an indepth breakdown on the typing system here but walkers method essentially divides hair types into four separate categories  refers to ladies with straight hair  for women with wavier patterns  for the curly girls and  for those with tighter coils those numbers are then broken down into subsets for example a is someone with straight and fine hair while b describes someone with corkscrew curls versus looser ones its important to recognize that the typing system isnt for everyone some women claim that its confusing divisive and creates an unnecessary sense of hierarchy — and yes those are valid arguments and to each their own but for anyone starting out whether youre going natural or just looking to understand your hair a little more walkers line and hairtyping system is an easy way to get your feet wet now almost  years after introducing the chart walker is coming out with a brandnew line of haircare products that serves as an extension of his typing system each hair type is different — there are certain products that you would use on straight hair that you probably wouldn’t use on kinky hair says walker that’s why i’ve broken it down into four categories and also recommend which products to use for each hair type”the newly improved collection which includes everything from sulfatefree shampoo to straightening creams all have one ingredient in common mongongo oil “mongongo oil is an oil that people in africa have been using on their skin and hair for over  years or more it’s really high in nutrition and very high in vitamin e which is great for skin and hairphoto courtesy of andre walker all of the products are moisturizing which walker says benefits all hair types not just women with type  or  hair which is notoriously dry some people with type  or  hair don’t condition because they think it makes their hair looks flat he says but i believe that even if it’s just a light conditioner you should condition after every wash this moisturizing process he says involves wetting the strands cleansing and following up with a hydrating conditioner rather than overloading on oils its a problem that he says even oprah herself struggles with who has a combination of a and b hair if you were wondering because i was speaking of oprah when it comes to styling the multihyphenated moguls hair walker doesnt like to play favorites in terms of dos but if he had to pick he loves the way shes been wearing it lately natural free and fresh i’ve seen over time that people don’t realize the damage that hot tools can do to the hair he says so i think women are becoming smarter about it now they’re not using heat on their hair as much and going with more natural styles the recent shift toward embracing ones natural hair goes along with walkers main objective to help people make peace with their hair learn what your hair does best and work with that rather than trying to manipulate it but above all he wants to help men women and children achieve healthy beautiful hair — so that we can all be oprah one day in our own way say it with us now and you get healthy hair and you get healthy hair and you get healthy hair

get your brand on oprah theres no pay for play per se its whether she and producers like you by jack neff published on june   most popular batavia ohio adagecom  shes the queen of commercial endorsement launch pad for four dozen books on the top of the new york times bestseller list fabled hawkerdonor of pontiacs and patron saint of everything from softrock sensation josh groban to boudreauxs butt paste best seller talkshow queen has launched four dozen books to the top of the new york times list credit george burns yet she doesnt do structured brandintegration deals or technically at least live commercials and her company harpo productions tightly controls advance and postpublicity about the praise that gets parceled out no one tells oprah what to say said one pr professional and indeed that may be much of the commercial appeal of oprah winfrey americas foremost arbiter of middlebrow taste she is  by the estimate of pr pros who besiege her producers for a chance to have their brands reflect the warm light of oprahs presence  the very pinnacle of product publicity and yet despite oprah winfreys and harpo productions dogged efforts to protect her brand and by extension the many smaller ones that draw energy from it oprah has taken some notable dings lately largely of her own making church and state her endorsement of barack obama clearly helped chicagos favorite son become a frontrunner but also raised ms winfreys unfavorable ratings allowing her to be overtaken by none other than daytimetalk rival ellen degeneres as the most popular celebrity in the us in a harris interactive poll earlier this year ms winfreys later endorsement of newage religion guru eckart tolle may seem a safer bet than her former pastor the rev jeremiah wright but it also angered some conservative christians and inspired the american family association to attack the onceunassailable ms winfrey all of this seems to leads to one question for marketers is it worth the trouble sliding approval ratings or no getting on oprah remains the gold standard as one pr person put it consider that a mere rerun of an oprah show in which dolly parton appeared in december  boosted sales of her cd  and pushed it up nine slots to no  on the billboard charts boudreauxs butt paste got mentions and features on a lot of shows in  including nbcs tonight show with jay leno and espn but it was an appearance by founder george boudreaux on a quirky ways people have gotten rich episode that crashed the brands website with  hits likeability an appearance on the same episode by buildabear workshop ceo maxine clark the year before the company went public produced fears among some analysts the following year about the difficult comparisons created by the consequent twoquarter sales bump since ms winfrey selected mr tolles a new earth for her book club earlier this year the club has gained more than  million members and oprahcom has logged more than  million streams and downloads of related webinar classes according harpo so how do you get your brand on oprah it helps a whole lot if oprah likes your brand or its ads it helps more still if oprahs producers like you and it possibly helps even more if oprah likes you or the person endorsing your brand oh and another murkier point some pr people believe it may help to do a sponsorship as one put it both harpo and marketers however deny quid pro quos and the successes of such smaller brands as kitchen aid and dolly parton indicate one need not pay to play on oprah free publicity yet harpo in a statement leaves things a tad vague on that point theres been a constant and unwavering stream of unsolicited product pitches for the show a spokeswoman said editorial and creative decisions drive mentions and product inclusions on the show if a brand gets mentioned it is as often serendipity as it is business when we do partner with brands it is usually because we have an editorial direction were pursuing and their partnership enhances the editorial content of the show tns media intelligence data appear to show little connection between being a big spender and getting a lot of free publicity few brands have had better luck on oprah than unilevers dove its had three major segments on the show in   and  respectively each handled by independent edelman new york all focused on ads from its campaign for real beauty by ogilvy  mather it just so happens that the campaign kicked off in late  with ads and other tieins with hearsts o the oprah magazine and oprahcom raising eyebrows in a wall street journal interview in october  silvia lagnado then unilevers global brand director on dove said just last week we started a relationship with oprah we are sponsoring her show she mentioned the dove products on the show and had the women in our ads in their underwear in the show im sure oprah really does like the ads author virginia postrel wrote on her dynamistcom blog but i doubt that the dove girls would be on the show without unilevers advertising checks dove also just happened to choose oprahs best friend and o editor at large gayle king to receive their first dove real beauty award oprahs roi dove and harpo however deny any direct adforpublicity deal doveunilever has been a partner with the oprah winfrey show oprahcom and o the oprah magazine for more than four years and their values and creative approach are very much in line with ours harpos spokeswoman said in fact tns data indicate that unilevers chief rivals have been spending far more on oprah properties without getting anywhere near the inprogram love true unilever spent  million on the syndicated tv show and  million on the magazine and website for a total of  million in the past four years its spending on the magazine and its website more than doubled to  million between  and  but unilevers rivals including procter  gamble co  million loréal  million and johnson  johnson  million have outspent the company in the period the june issue of the oprah magazine is either a testament to a sturdy chinese wall between editorial and advertising in the harpohearst alliance or the worlds subtlest brand integration borrowing strategy the cover story were starting a beauty revolution say byebye to feeling bad about your looks appears ripped from the campaign for real beauty education materials including photography that looks almost exactly like doves  ads only the women have clothes on over their underwear yet theres no reference to dove in the article nor a single ad from dove or unilever in the book then again its not out of the question that that award for ms king may have done some good yet serendipity lives another pr rep said despite being barraged by pitches oprahs people are very easy to deal with an appearance by one of the reps pitchwomen on the show led to an entirely impromptu if very much welcome onair endorsement of the product by ms winfrey with or without formal ad spending the direct cost of getting your brand on oprah and other shows appears to be rising as more brands struggle for free publicity oprahstyle big gives can help seal the deal demand from shows for free products for audience members is rising said the pr rep noting a request from the ellen degeneres show for free merchandise valued at more than a quartermillion dollars for one recent appearance giveaway details with the potential for serious money changing hands even in unpaid placements the rules for the oprah winfrey show about how an appearance can be marketed could get tougher to swallow oprah is determined to protect her brand credit lisa oconnor though pg executives were extremely pleased with an april appearance on oprah by salma hayek spokeswoman for pampers one pack equals one vaccine unicef promotion it had been a little tougher two nights before a story on adagecom about the appearance included a reference to giveaways of vaccines on behalf of audience members  a nono under harpo ground rules prohibiting release of details prompting hurried sundaynight requests to take the story down until the show aired the next morning harpo also wasnt pleased with a perceived implication that oprah was endorsing pampers or its program prompting an email from pg that said we were so happy that oprah provided us with an editorial platform upon which to launch this lifesaving program but oprah is in no way a spokesperson or endorser of our program harpo said brands selected for oprahs annual favorite things as well as oprahs book club selections may note those facts and link back to oprahcom other references such as the sorts of as seen on oprah claims used by boudreauxs butt paste arent approved oprah understands her brand and will push back on an advertiser if part of their proposals dont mesh with it said an adagency executive who has done several client deals with her tv show the word oprah is powerful so she has to protect it and it may be becoming harder no advance notice unlike appearances on some other shows such as the ellen degeneres show advance news of oprah appearances generally needs to be embargoed and publicity plans cleared through harpo according to pr reps by contrast when pgs tide coldwater ran a promotion providing money to turn on the holiday lights in new orleans in  ms degeneres flipped the switch at the event and details of the show in which it appeared were widely released in advance beyond that ms degeneres does live commercials and more elaborate structured deals her show in fact was the cornerstone of a december restage of pgs head  shoulders  including rollout of the brands first conditioner lineup  that included sampling online outdoor and tv advertising behind a mystery brand revealed on the dec  show while many other factors figure in the brands performance head  shoulders has fared considerably better since its december restage than pgs pantene backed by an appearance on oprah a month earlier head  shoulders sales were up in the high teens last quarter according to pg after the elaborate integrated program in december pantene which benefited from an appearance by hilary swank touting its beautiful lengths program to generate hair donations for wigs for cancer patients has lost share the past two quarters marina maher communications handles pr for head  shoulders devries handles pr for pantene saatchi  saatchi handles advertising for head  shoulders while grey group handles pantene limits to os powers clearly oprah has had a huge impact on small brands and highly fragmented markets such as books and music but its less clear she alone can move the needle for big brands her embrace of tarzhay in the early s helped give target cachet then again she also did an extensive  segment in which she refurbished a living room entirely with housewares from walmart which has remained one of the companys weakest departments for a decade interestingly walmart has outspent target more than to on oprah the past four years and outspent target  million to  million overall across oprahs tv print and web properties per tns an unscripted segment on oprah offers the element of surprise but some marketers prefer the predictability of morestructured deals such as those offered by abcs the view whose onair hosts participate in and help create elaborate clearly compensated brand integrations kimberlyclark corps multibrand roomaday giveaway program recently completed its second year on the view and while the company is still evaluating results it generated  million sweepstakes entries this year double the  million in year one said laura keely directorconsumer promotion marketing for kc this years program included considerable advertising buzz building and onlinewidget distribution in advance of the january launch there are probably some smaller efforts where a mention on a tv program is a great thing she said this was a fullscale promotion where we were replacing a multibrand national newspaper coupon insert and we needed to have performance that meant we had things hammered out and agreed to well in advance but oprahs spontaneity may do brands more good in the long run than the opportunity to integrate multiple elements and script the integration said marketing consultant al ries she communicates extremely well so the believability of what shes saying is just off the charts he said the more advance promotion that happens with a show the more people will think its fixed the minute you have posters telling people to watch oprah next week the more people will think the endorsement is paid for    contributing jean halliday    correction an earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that devries handles pr for

sunday it can be a simple stepping stone to get on the show sometimes a person gets on the show first and then is featured in the magazine and vice versa sometimes this happens over a period of a few months or years that part is a mystery what is not a mystery is the fact that getting into oprah’s magazine can mean publicity on a grand scale not only is the magazine read by  million people mostly

america their muchpublicized contest was the subject of enormous scrutiny time magazine wrote “ few people would have bet on oprah winfreys swift rise to host of the most popular talk show on tv in a field dominated by white males she is a black female of ample bulk as interviewers go she is no match for say phil donahue  what she lacks in journalistic toughness she makes up for in plainspoken curiosity robust humor and above all empathy guests with sad stories to tell are apt to rouse a tear in oprahs eye  they in turn often find themselves revealing things they would not imagine telling anyone much less a national tv audience it is the talk show as a group therapy session ” tv columnist howard rosenberg said shes a roundhouse a full course meal big brassy loud aggressive hyper laughable lovable soulful tender lowdown earthy and hungry and she may know the way to phil donahues jugular newsdays les payne observed oprah winfrey is sharper than donahue wittier more genuine and far better attuned to her audience if not the world and martha bayles of the wall street journal wrote its a relief to see a gabmonger with a fond but realistic assessment of her own cultural and religious roots in the early years of the oprah winfrey show the program was classified as a tabloid talk show in the mids winfrey adopted a less tabloidoriented format hosting shows on broader topics such as heart disease geopolitics spirituality and meditation interviewing celebrities on social issues they were directly involved with such as cancer charity work or substance abuse and hosting

that i might be able to work for some good white folks now i got some good white folks working for me some women have a weakness for shoes i can go barefoot if necessary i have a weakness for books my philosophy is that doing your best at this moment puts you in the best place for the next moment just want to say how deeply saddened i am we all are by the sudden passing of actress natasha richardson yesterday our thoughts and prayers are with her husband liam neeson their two sons the rest of their family and friends yet another reminder of how fleeting life can be and how precious we need to value every moment on natasha richardsons tragic death part of her  commencement speech at duke of all the wonderful things that have happened including getting a doctorate an honorary doctorate from duke what really makes me feel successful is being able to use my life in service to someone else and i will have to say it is a wonderful thing to have a beautiful home or homes a wonderful thing to have a beautiful home which just escaped the fire in santa barbara and it is really fantastic to have your own jet and anybody who says it isnt is lying to you the jet thing is really good but you havent completed the circle of success unless you can help somebody else move forward on personal power i have a lot of things to prove to myself one is that i can live my life fearlessly on strategy doing the best at this moment puts you in the best place for the next moment having the best things is no substitute for having the best life reaching your true potential is more than an ideal its the ultimate goal when the odds are against you and you have the depth of clarity to listen to your own instincts and follow what is true for you you may not become a jayz but

move forward not only with your own strength but with the strength of your entire ancestry i am the daughter of a maid and my grandmother was a maid and her mother was a maid and her mother was a slave i feel validated by the war that the butler and his entire generation fought in their own way and the fact that theres another generation of freedom writers and freedom fighters because of

what you want is someone who will take the bus with you when the limo breaks down all my life i have always known i was born to greatness the essential question is not how busy are you but what are you busy at are you doing what fulfills you what matters is how you feel inside because feeling beautiful on the inside is key to looking goodquoted in womans world  the expectation of my life was that i might be able to work for some good white folks now i got some good white folks working for me some women have a weakness for shoes i can go barefoot if necessary i have a weakness for books my philosophy is that doing your best at this moment puts you in the best place for the next moment just want to say how deeply saddened i am we all are by the sudden passing of actress natasha richardson yesterday our thoughts and prayers are with her husband liam neeson their two sons the rest of their family and friends yet another reminder of how fleeting life can be and how precious we need to value every moment on natasha richardsons tragic death part of her  commencement speech at duke of all the wonderful things that have happened including getting a doctorate an honorary doctorate from duke what really makes me feel successful is being able to use my life in service to someone else and i will have to say it is a wonderful thing to have a beautiful home or homes a wonderful thing to have a beautiful home which just escaped the fire in santa barbara and it is really fantastic to have your own jet and anybody who says it isnt is lying to you the jet thing is really good but you havent completed the circle of success unless you can help somebody else move forward on personal power i have a lot of things to prove to myself one is that i can live my life fearlessly on strategy doing the best at this moment puts you in the best place for the next moment having the best things is no substitute for having the best life reaching your true potential is more than an ideal its the ultimate goal when the odds are against you and you have the depth of clarity to listen to your own instincts and follow what is true for you you may not become a jayz but you will become the best thing that you can be im a firm believer that anyone can have a breakthrough right in her own backyard no matter where you are on your journey thats exactly where you need to

foibles and aspirations she understands that every dream is valuable and every identity deserves inspection through the lookingglass of television she knows the power of reflection and wields that power with grace and generosity on performing in lee daniels the butler im a historian of my own history  of african american history i believe that when you know who you are you have the ability to move forward not only with your own strength but with the strength of your entire ancestry i am the daughter of a maid and my grandmother was a maid and her mother was a maid and her mother was a slave i feel validated by the war that the butler and his entire generation fought in their own way and the fact that theres another generation of freedom writers and freedom fighters because of evolution and growth and change decided they werent going to do that anymore both wars were necessary for their time i feel i have made a living being myself ive made a career out of my own authenticity i dont have one face i present to the white world or to the black world i talk to my dogs the same way im speaking right now whatever your dreams ideas or rejects we plant a seed nurture
