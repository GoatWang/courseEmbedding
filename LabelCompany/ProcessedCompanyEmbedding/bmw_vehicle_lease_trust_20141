initial excess spread is  loss coverage remains adequate to support fitchs aaasf stressed assumptions strong credit and normalizing residual performance credit losses on bmw financial services bmw fs portfolio have decreased from the elevated levels seen in  and  due to strong obligor credit quality in addition the portfolio is displaying a decrease in residual gains from prior years due to the stabilization in the wholesale used vehicle market which has lowered residual realizations fitchs base case credit net loss proxy is  and adjusted residual value loss proxy is  evolving wholesale market the us wholesale vehicle market has remained strong in recent years however increasing offlease vehicle supply and pressure from increased production levels could lead to decreased residual realization during the life of the transaction legal structure integrity the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of bmw fs would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities stable originationunderwritingservicing bmw fs demonstrates adequate abilities as originator underwriter and servicer as evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency and loss experience and securitization performance rating sensitivity unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles andor increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and would likely result in declines of credit enhancement and loss coverage levels available to the notes hence fitch conducts sensitivity analyses by increasing the transactions initial base case rv and credit loss assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes the increases to the base case losses are applied such that they represent moderate x and severe x stresses respectively and are intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to unexpected deterioration of a

is one of the worlds most respected automakers renowned for crafting luxury cars and suvs that offer superior levels of driving enjoyment founded in munich the company began in the early s as an aircraft manufacturer bmws current logo designed to represent white propeller blades against a blue sky reflects these origins its blueandwhite color scheme also references bavarias blueandwhite checkered flag it wasnt until  that production began on the first bmw automobile the dixi the car proved tremendously popular and its success helped the manufacturer weather the depression bmws bestknown preworld war ii vehicle was the type  roadster a supple twoseater that racked up more than  victories on the motorsport circuit between  and  postwar bmw cars maintained this tradition with several racing rallying and hill climb victories the early s saw the launch of the bmw  a roomy voluptuous sedan that was resplendent with all of the hopefulness of that era it was soon followed by the  which was powered by the worlds first lightalloy v foreshadowing bmws ongoing commitment to developing new technology the bestselling bmw of that decade was the isetta a petite twoseat microcar typically powered by a  or horsepower engine the mids also saw the debut of the limited production and breathtakingly beautiful  sports car which had an alloy body and used the s v for propulsion in the s bmw sales strengthened significantly thanks in part to the immense popularity of the  a sporty family sedan by the s bmw was establishing itself as a fullfledged car company it was a pioneer for many emerging technologies including turbocharging and advanced vehicle electronics bmw of north america was established at that time and consumers who coveted both sports and luxury cars became loyal bimmer owners the s also saw the birth of bmws threetier sport sedan range consisting of the compact  series midsize  series and large  series cars and the creation of its performance m division though the  series could be had with fourcylinder power it was the companys inline engines that developed bmws reputation for spirited yet highly refined performance at decades end the limited production shortlived m supercar debuted throughout the s bmw became the unofficial poster car of yuppies as the brand ostensibly signified ones financial success as well as a passion for driving the elegant  series coupe debuted and the latter part of the decade saw the highperformance m division working its magic on various production models in the early s bmw replaced the  series with the powerful vpowered at first but heavy  series grand touring coupe a bit later bmw introduced its popular z roadster the company also opened its first us manufacturing plant in the latter half of the s the s brought a midsize suv the x as well as a compact suv the x as bmw joined the hotselling segment since then bmw has replaced the z with the z introduced the compact  series produced hybrid versions of a few models and debuted the x fastback crossover the company has also expanded its empire to include mini and rollsroyce and continues to build motorcycles something it has done since the s bmws famous advertising slogan describes each of its vehicles as the ultimate driving machine and its not mere hyperbole over the past couple of decades bmws have become the standard for performance and luxury in most of the over  segments with familyfriendly wagons crisp sedans distinctive coupes nimble sports cars and spacious suvs offered bmws model roster is diverse but its vehicles all share
