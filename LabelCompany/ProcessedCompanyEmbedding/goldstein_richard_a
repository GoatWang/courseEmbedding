more  what our clients say about us my first patented invention helped me grow a single product into a company with an entire line of hair accessories and other beauty products in the course of enforcing my patent rights against competitors other intellectual patent attorneys have complimented me on how broadly my patent application was written —mia minnelli kaminski “i want people to know that you really went to bat for me when it mattered most while most of the patents you got for me went through on the first shot for those that didn’t you fought hard to get them approved as a result my products sell around the world and generate millions in my book you are the best” —lou sardo goldstein took the time to understand my ideas and the application of these ideas the firm successfully submitted and secured five united states patents and one trademark and all with the first submittal to the united states patent office these patents still stand today and are unbeatable —steve ross after working with you for more than  years i would gladly recommend your firm to anyone considering the patent process the expertise and professional way you handled and expedited my patent cases has helped me create and protect the success i have today the skill used in wording my patents has even helped me defend and win a lawsuit —lt mike bishop i know of two instances where other companies were interested in duplicating my product and tried to break my patent but gave up after their patent attorneys told them it was pointless i now have my eyeglass locator on the market and its a dream come true —clarence mccurdy “my wife and i are highly impressed with the methods and support of your team through our efforts to patent our idea since we were not the first to identify our idea the evaluation process saved us a great deal of time and money even though we were not ultimately successful in our original goal i feel that we are in a better position now than if we had attempted a different course of action we have gained a great deal of valuable insights about the patent process and will use the goldstein evaluation option for our next idea” —don and gayle mcfadyen

patent is a process in this introductory video in this  part series patent attorney richard goldstein addresses the patent process for individual inventors with ideas and outlines the different kinds of patent protection that are available forms of protection and which one may be right for your idea so you had this great idea and the next thing that popped into your mind was “okay what do i do with this idea who do i talk to about it i don’t know who i can trust can i talk to my friends about this can i talk to my family about this can i go to a company about this” no don’t go to a company about it first but yeah that’s probably what you were thinking—”what now” and you may have started searching the internet looking for information about ideas and inventions and patents and through that research you ended up on this website—because you realize that patenting the idea might be an important step for you well maybe it is and maybe it isn’t in this series we’ll help you figure that out one thing many of our clients have in common is that they never intended to become inventors they just came up with an idea and found themselves in a position where they needed to learn what they needed to do in order to pursue that idea—and probably even figure out whether they should be pursuing the idea at all this series addresses the most common questions you may have about the patent process and what you can do next now that you have an idea the next question is what’s the appropriate way to go about protecting your particular idea under the law there are different ways of protecting different types of ideas you’ve probably heard of some of them—things like patents trademarks and copyrights all of those fit within an area of the law known as “intellectual property law” that’s the field of law that deals with the protection of ideas the ownership of ideas so what we need to figure out is what’s the right way for you to own the idea that you’ve come up with the first form of protection we should talk about is copyright law and we’ll talk about it quickly because copyright probably doesn’t apply to your situation but you should understand why you’ve probably heard people say “hey that’s a great idea you should copyright it” so we’ll explain why that probably doesn’t apply to your situation copyright does not protect ideas copyright protects artistic expression copyright protects things like books movies plays poetry and songs—and even in those things it doesn’t protect the underlying idea so if you have an idea for a book the idea itself is not protected with a copyright but the words you write for the book might be protected so even with the right subject matter—the book a copyright doesn’t protect the idea—just the way you wrote that particular book the second form of protection we’re going to talk about is trademark trademark law helps consumers not to be confused about where their product is coming from so when you go into a store to buy a can of cocacola® and you see a can that’s labeled “cocacola” you can count on the fact that it’s “the real thing®” as they put it because trademark law protects your expectation as a consumer that a product labeled “cocacola” is cocacola® trademark law protects anything that a company might use to identify their product or service in the marketplace it could be the name “cocacola” it could be the writing style on the can it could be the red and white color scheme on the can or that wavy line or even the slogan “the real thing®” those are all trademarks of cocacola because those are all things that if they were all put on a competitor’s product a consumer might be confused into thinking that the competitors product was cocacola®—or somehow affiliated with them the key thing for you to understand right now about trademark law is that it might apply to you if the thing that’s most important about what you have is the name of it—the name you come up with the slogan or other aspects that are distinct from the product idea itself or it might be something that you need to consider later on when you’re about to launch your product what you should know for now is that if what you have in mind is the idea for a product a service or something like a smart phone app that you believe is distinct from other things that already exist patent law is probably the area of law that pertains to protecting your idea patents protect new and useful inventions that fit certain specific criteria that the patent office looks for when deciding whether to grant a patent we’ll discuss these criteria in greater detail in this series part  of this series discusses the two most important criteria for determining whether you can patent what you have cocacola® is a registered trademark

often requires a nimble approach to product development sometimes development and execution are simultaneous in highly competitive fields with the goal of getting the product out in the market quickly  you may have heard of “agile software development” as a methodology for developing software apps developers begin writing code even while they are still working out the details of how the app works agile patenting® is a methodology created by rich goldstein that is a nimble approach to obtaining patent protection for ideas that moving quickly along the path from concept to market  the goal is to protect the core idea at an early stage and protect improvements and enhancements as the product is developed and launched like agile software development agile patenting® is responsive iterative  incremental evolutionary adaptive responsive agile patenting® has developed in response to changes in us patent law in  and to the expanding global marketplace for patented inventions us patent law now grants patent protection to the inventor who files first the “first to file system” waiting for the details to be worked out before filing in highly competitive markets may make you too late agile patenting® starts the patent application process as soon as your idea has sufficiently developed but not necessarily in full detail  we lock in an early priority date in the us your us filing date can also transfer abroad unlike the us most other countries require that a patent application be filed before any invention is introduced into the marketplace a requirement called “absolute novelty” in response to clients’ desire to obtain more global protection the early start of the patent application process preserves clients’ international rights before introducing the idea to the public iterative and incremental agile patenting begins with filing a us provisional patent application effectively “dropping an anchor” for you on that date in the first to file system and in the international patent treaty system as your product or ideas move along through development details are added iteratively in subsequent provisional patent applications each application adding incremental elements to the original concept   by the end of the year after the first application filing a nonprovisional utility application is filed referencing all the provisional patent applications establishing priority dates for all aspects to date evolutionary ideas never move linearly through the development process as your project moves forward new directions can be captured in subsequent filings  when protecting an idea or invention it is important to capture those branches into a patent application  what may seem to be a diversion or a dead end for the final product when added to the growing body of applications in the project actually becomes more complete protection working around your invention will be much harder for the competition if you have blocked most avenues in your applications adaptive most projects start with research to identify what if any patent protection may be available for your idea most projects start with research to identify what if any patent protection may be available some projects may start with a “cover letter” provisional to preserve us and foreign rights followed by research  some projects may require one or two provisional patent applications to capture and fully disclose the invention  others may require filing an application every month at goldstein patent law we customize our approach to your project similar to practice in agile software development only experienced patent attorneys are assigned to your case  with a thorough knowledge of us and international patent law our attorneys guide you
