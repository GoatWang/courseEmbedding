beyond beating market expectations the investment bank revealed some of its intentions on the forthcoming launch of its online lending platform later this fall the news that goldman sachs was moving into the online lending sector came over a year ago when quartz got a copy of an internal memo following the hire of  harit talwar following his departure from discover in april  earlier this year stephen scherr chief strategy office of goldman sachs clarified the banks strategy following the acquisition of  billion of deposits from ge bank stating the growing deposit base could support their peer to peer lending strategy during the earnings call goldman sachs cfo harvey schwartz updated on their online lending approach “we are taking a very deliberate and methodical approach to this effort we are looking to build a durable business so it will take time” asked specifically about the ge deposit acquisition gs bank and an update on the online lending progress schwartz explained “we view those as separate having said that the acquisition went well adding in excess of  billion of deposits to the firm …  we have had in excess of  consumers open up new accounts with us we have had very significant growth in a short period of time it really speaks to the brand strength” “in terms of the longerterm objectives we hired harit over a year ago and he has been a fantastic addition to the team he has built a very capable team over that period of time … we are keenly aware this is a new business opportunity for us and importantly a new client base one of the things we did was to reach out to thousands of consumers to really understand what they want and what are their borrowing priorities through that we learned some things that are probably not that surprising they want a product that is simple straightforward that provides a lot of value they also want a high quality user experience what we’ve attempted to do is to take all of this feedback and develop one product which we plan to launch later this fall so that is where we stand” asked to clarify what gs mean by one specific product schwartz pointed to unsecured consumer loans putting lending club and prosper right in their crosshairs slow build… an analyst from jmp asked the question “is there a case for buying something … so you get to a critical mass more quickly” schwartz qualified the query as a very good question “…we will just weight the costs and benefits of acquiring versus building in house this particular effort when we looked at it we  really felt like it was best designed from scratch the reason for that is we are kind of uniquely positioned it allows us to leverage our technology skills and our risk skills … if you look at the competitive landscape there are benefits that online lending platforms provide to consumers and there are benefits for large commercial providers of credit … we are really looking to bridge the gap between those strengths and offer consumers the best we can a really thoughtful differentiated product” we well learn more this coming fall sponsored links by dq promote you may also likegoldman sachs – gsbank may use deposits to support mosaic pp lending

share share  reddit pin emailshares  march     am by lao zhuo weiyangx the property prices in china’s major cities has surged in recent months first in shenzhen then shanghai and beijing the rapid appreciation of property is drawing people’s attention back to the concept of real estate crowdfunding four types of real estate crowdfunding real estate crowdfunding was first launched in us and then introduced to china in  by  there were about  real estate crowdfunding platforms in china eg fangbaobao and haofang crowdfunding in terms of fundraising purpose china’s real estate crowdfunding activities could fall into four major categories development  purchase compared with traditional a funding channel eg bank or trust crowdfunding helps reduce the total cost crowdfunding is used by developers that could not get easier access to capital but it also attracts certain groups of consumers before the construction starts individuals crowdfunding for this category of project have a rigid demand for housing they will get a  to  discount but usually have to pay the discounted price in full when they purchase the property it may be regarded as an innovation of real estate development yet it may risk violating the present regulations regarding the real estate approval process development  investment real estate products especially in major cities like beijing and shanghai are seen as highly profitable developers initiate reits crowdfunding campaigns to realize the value of realestate projects which is usually high in total price and raise the funds for developing the project crowdfunders treat this category of project as an investment opportunity asset management companies generate the profits for the crowdfunders from property rental or property management fees one example is the “wenzhuan no” from wanda group marketing  purchase in this circumstance consumers with rigid housing demand crowdfund for existing housing projects this model works typically well for certain developers who are under pressure to reduce inventory which is usually regarded as an innovative marketing method marketing  investment this is a typical type of reits product developers scarify some profits to deinventory and raise brand awareness while the crowdfunders invest with the hope to benefit from valueadded income one example is the crowdfunding projects coinitiated by fangbaobao and zhongxin palace garden regulators suspend pp down payment loans among the different sections of fintech crowdfunding and peer to peer lending are the most talked about in china since real estate has already got a connection with crowdfunding it is not strange to see related pp lending products emerge it is estimated that there are at least  pp lending platforms providing real estate lending services now most of which are down payment lending redemption lending and decoration lending down payment lending lowers the house purchasing threshold but it also raises the housepurchase leverage for instance speculators can buy real estate at a relative low price and sell it shortly to gain a profit of  thousand yuan that’s why the product is so popular yet for house buyers with rigid demand they will not only suffer from the present pressure but may be forced to give up or put off the purchasing plan due to the rocketing price driven by speculators in fact people cannot borrow for a down payment loan according to china’s present regulation the percentage of down payments for individual housing is set by pobc down payment lending goes against the real estate legislation and may introduce policy risk at present the risk is still under control however nobody knows whether a dramatic price would lead to a systematic crisis updated chinese government has already responded to and started investigating down payment loans shenzhen municipal financial services office took the first step requiring investigation towards all pp and microfinance companies involved in real estate crowdfunding down payment loan and other leveraged mortgages meanwhile beijing municipal bureau of financial work guided beijing pp association to go through an investigation among the member platforms according to an anonymous source beijing municipal commission of housing and urbanrural development has also held an urgent talk with some real estate agencies which have been involved in the down payment loan issues as the investigation goes on major agencies like homelink and ijcom have ceased down payment loans   weiyangx is the most

marketplace lending mutual funds sponsored by stone ridge asset management and rivernorth capital management were approved recently in the us by the sec with similar funds launched earlier in the uk “this is an exciting opportunity for rivernorth and our investors” said philip bartow coportfolio manager of the rivernorth fund “the benefit of being early to the retail market will give us the enhanced ability to purchase loans directly from quality online lending partners with whom rivernorth has negotiated loan acquisition and servicing relationships” more funds have filed to become ’ act funds for marketplace lending and are awaiting sec approval though anyone can invest directly on the marketplace lending platforms they are cumbersome compared to mutual funds a product investors and advisors know how to manage in order to invest in marketplace lending one needs to open a new account and learn a new set of analytical tools to aggregate and select loans that fit his risk preferences if an investor wants to invest in more than one platform this problem might become prohibitive alternatively hedge funds which comprise a big chunk of the capital in marketplace lending are only open to accredited investors launching these mutual funds will give retail investors easier access to consumer debt “by expanding marketplace loans to a broader investor base these new funds will transform the industry and could eventually move today’s platforms towards principal brokerdealer markets similar to other fixed income instruments” monja a marketplace lending analytics solution

have startups ignored the potential of the “internet of things” — the growing use of datacollecting devices in everyday items from cars using telematics systems to connected homes few startups have become full riskbearing insurers analysts say that the capital requirements regulatory burden and complexity required combined with the desire of investors for shortterm returns means that very few of

inclusion in rich countries lenders use credit scores to weigh risk but just  of africans and  of south asians are covered by private credit bureaus bailey klinger of the entrepreneurial finance lab efl which explores new kinds of credit data argues that psychometrics could scoop many more people into the financial system everyone has a personality after all some lenders are convinced grupo monge a retailer uses psychometrics to sell household goods on credit to lowincome peruvians “most of the time we are the first company to give them credit” says gabriel trelles its boss in peru the biggest market for psychometrics is for such consumer loans but microlenders and banks are catching on efl’s software has been used in  loan decisions in  countries creditinfo will use its psychometrics unit recently acquired from a marketing firm to expand in emerging markets the technique is still in its infancy and will not replace credit bureaus says miriam bruhn of the world bank the best way to tell if somebody will repay a loan in future is to see if they have repaid one in the past but bureaus improve more slowly than technology lenders looking for an edge will find ever more ways to peer into

£ off uk hosts earn an average of £ per year for renting their home for  nights which means borrowers would need to rent out their homes around  times over the course of a year to take full advantage of zopa’s offer while the partnership makes sense for zopa– it’s a focused way to help borrowers increase their income– i don’t envision banks making the same move zopa debuted at finovatespring
