creates a doubt whether we will continue as a going concern   as described in note  of our accompanying financial statements our auditors have issued a going concern opinion regarding the company this means there is substantial doubt we can continue as an ongoing business in the foreseeable future the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty regarding our ability to continue in business as such we may have to cease operations and investors could lose part or all of their investment in the company    our chief executive officer chief financial officer and principal accounting officer and sole director has no significant experience managing a public company and no meaningful financial reporting experience as it relates to public companies accordingly our ability to meet exchange act reporting requirements on a timely basis will be dependent to a significant degree upon others   our sole officer and director have no significant experience managing a public company and no meaningful financial reporting experience as it relates to public companies which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by the sarbanesoxley act of  such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis our management may not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately respond to increased legal regulatory and reporting requirements including the establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting any such deficiencies weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  which is necessary to maintain our public company status if we were to fail to fulfill obligations our ability to continue as a public company would be in jeopardy in which event you could lose your entire investment in our company   we are dependent on outside financing for continuation of our operations   because we have not generated revenues and currently operate at a loss we are completely dependent on the continued availability of financing in order to continue our business there can be no assurance that financing sufficient to enable us to continue our operations will be available to us in the future   we need the proceeds from this offering to expand our operations our offering has no minimum specifically there is no minimum number of shares that needs to be sold in this offering for us to access the funds given that the offering is a best effort selfunderwritten offering we cannot assure you that all or any shares will be sold we have no firm commitment from anyone to purchase all or any of the shares offered we may need additional funds to complete further development of our business plan to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues we anticipate that we must raise the minimum capital of  to commence operations for the month period and expenses for maintaining a reporting status with the sec   there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available on terms that will be acceptable to us we have not taken any steps to seek additional financing   our failure to obtain future financing or to produce levels of revenue to meet our financial needs could result in our inability to continue as a going concern and as a result our investors could lose their entire investment      table of contents       we have reported no revenue and there can be no assurance that we will ever generate significant revenue or net income   we were incorporated on march   and not generated any revenue and have minimal assets our operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the growth of a new business the scalingup of operations and the competitive environment in which we are operating from march   date of inception to march   we had a net loss and accumulated deficit of  no assurance can be given that we will ever generate significant revenue or have net income our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent among other things upon     · completion of this offering   · developing our operations   · creating market awareness through word of mouth advertising in newspapers and online advertising   we have a limited operating history making it difficult to evaluate whether we will operate profitably   we were incorporated on march   to design develop market distribute and sell subscriptions for fashion socks as a result we do not have a meaningful historical record of sales and revenues nor an established business track record while our management believes that we have an opportunity to be successful in the subscription business for the socks market there can be no assurance that we will be successful in accomplishing our business initiatives or that we will achieve any significant level of revenues or continue to recognize net income from the sale of our sock products   unanticipated problems expenses and delays are frequently encountered in increasing production and sales and developing new products especially in the current stage of our business our ability to continue to successfully develop produce and sell our products and to generate significant operating revenues will depend on our ability to among other matters   · successfully market distribute and sell our products or enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions on our behalf and   · obtain the financing required to implement our business plan   given our limited operating history and our lack of longterm sales history and other sources of revenue there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve any of our goals and develop a sufficiently large customer base to be profitable if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks our business will most likely fail         table of contents         the loss of rozh caroro would have an adverse effect on our future development and could significantly impair our ability to achieve our business objectives   our success is largely dependent upon the expertise and knowledge of our chairman chief executive officer and president rozh caroro and our ability to continue to hire and retain other key personnel the loss of ms caroro could have a material adverse effect on our business development financial condition and operating results we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our management or key personnel including ms caroro   our operating results may fluctuate significantly   management expects that we will experience substantial variations in our net sales and operating results from quarter to quarter we believe that the factors which influence this variability of quarterly results include   · the timing of our introduction of initial and  new product lines and designs · the level of consumer acceptance of each new product line and design   · general economic and industry conditions that affect consumer spending and retailer purchasing · the availability of manufacturing capacity   · the seasonality of the markets in which we participate · the timing of trade shows   · the product mix of customer orders · the timing of the placement or cancellation of customer orders   · the weather · transportation delays   · quotas and other regulatory matters · the occurrence of charge backs in excess of reserves   · the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales and actions of competitors and · the value of the dollar in relation to other currencies   as a result of fluctuations in our revenue and operating expenses that may occur management believes that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not a good indication of our future performance it is possible that in some future quarter or quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors      table of contents       our business is subject to risks associated with importing products   we may have to import our products and if so a portion of our import operations are subject to tariffs imposed on imported products and quotas imposed by trade agreements in addition the countries in which our products are imported may from time to time impose additional new duties tariffs or other restrictions on their respective imports or adversely modify existing restrictions adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions or our suppliers failure to comply with customs or similar laws could harm our business we cannot assure that future trade agreements will not provide our competitors with an advantage over us or increase our costs either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition   our operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization generally these trade agreements benefit our business by reducing or eliminating the duties assessed on products or other materials manufactured in a particular country however trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect our business such as limiting the countries from which we can purchase materials and setting duties or restrictions on products that may be imported into the united states from a particular country   our ability to import products in a timely and costeffective manner may also be affected by problems at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers such as labor disputes these problems could require us to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to our customers these alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition   our dependence on independent manufacturers and suppliers of products reduces our ability to control the manufacturing process which could harm our sales reputation and overall profitability   we will  depend on independent contract manufacturers and suppliers of products to secure a sufficient supply of products and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity in an environment characterized by declining prices labor shortages continuing cost pressure and increased demands for product innovation and speedtomarket this dependence could subject us to difficulty in obtaining timely delivery of products of acceptable quality in addition a contractors failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet the required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers the failure to make timely deliveries may cause our customers to cancel orders refuse to accept deliveries impose noncompliance charges through invoice deductions or other chargebacks demand reduced prices or reduce future orders any of which could harm our sales reputation and overall profitability   we do not have  any contracts with any independent suppliers while management believes that there exists an adequate supply of suppliers to provide products and services to us to the extent we are not able to secure or maintain relationships with independent suppliers that are able to fulfill our requirements our business would be harmed   we will initiate standards for our suppliers and monitor our independent contractors compliance with applicable labor laws but we  will not control our suppliers and contractors or their labor practices the violation of federal state or foreign labor laws by one of our suppliers and contractors could result in us being subject to fines and our goods that are manufactured in violation of such laws being seized or their sale in interstate commerce being prohibited to date we have not been subject to any sanctions that individually or in the aggregate have had a material adverse effect on our business and we are not aware of any facts on which any such sanctions could be based there can be no assurance however that in the future we will not be subject to sanctions as a result of violations of applicable labor laws by our contractors or that such sanctions will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations      table of contents       our business is growing more international and can be disrupted by factors beyond our control   if we reduce our reliance on domestic suppliers and contractors and expand our use of offshore manufacturers as a costeffective means to produce our products we are currently planning on sourcing a significant majority of our finished products from suppliers located outside the united states   if we commence international operations we face the possibility of greater losses from a number of risks inherent in doing business in international markets and from a number of factors which are beyond our control such factors that could harm our results of future operations and financial condition include among other things    · political instability or acts of terrorism which disrupt trade with the countries in which our contractors suppliers or customers are located · local business practices that do not conform to legal or ethical guidelines   · adoption of additional or revised quotas restrictions or regulations relating to imports or exports · additional or increased customs duties tariffs taxes and other charges on imports   · significant fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies · increased difficulty in protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions   · social legal or economic instability in the foreign markets in which we do business which could influence our ability to sell our products in these international markets and · restrictions on the transfer of funds between the united states and foreign jurisdictions   additional capital if needed may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and any additional financing may be on terms adverse to your interests   our business plan anticipates that the estimated  cost of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part may be paid from loans by our officers and not from this offering we do not have a formal agreement or commitment with our officers concerning this   we may need additional cash to fund our operations our capital needs will depend on numerous factors including market conditions and our profitability we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms if at all if additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to fund expansion successfully promote our brand name develop or enhance our services take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements any of which could seriously harm our business and reduce the value of your investment   if we are able to raise additional funds if and when needed by issuing additional equity securities you may experience significant dilution of your ownership interest and holders of these new securities may have rights senior to yours as a holder of our common stock if we obtain additional financing by issuing debt securities the terms of those securities could restrict or prevent us from declaring dividends and could limit our flexibility in making business decisions in this case the value of your investment could be reduced   there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding if it is needed or that such funding if available will be obtainable on terms and conditions favorable to or affordable by us if we cannot obtain needed funds we may be forced to curtail our activities      table of contents       some of our competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than do we and therefore vendors may not negotiate a similar or lower price to our company than to other competitors with significantly greater assets and a larger budget for advertising    barrier to entry in the industry is extremely low and there are many competitors we intend to establish the company as a supplier of sock subscriptions   some of our competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than do we there are no assurances that our efforts to compete in the marketplace will be successful also most competitors are nonpublic companies and because we are a small company with the added expense of being a reporting company we are at a serious disadvantage as margins are low   our controlling stockholder could have significant influence over the company   as of march   the companys sole officer and director owned  of the outstanding common stock which becomes  if all of the shares offered are sold depending on the number of share sold under this offering the shareholder could possess significant influence over our affairs their stock ownership and control of the board of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change in control impeding a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company which in turn could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock minority shareholders of the company will be unable to affect the outcome of stockholder voting as long as they retain a controlling interest   failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  could prevent us from producing reliable financial reports or identifying fraud in addition stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which could have an adverse effect on our stock price   effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and a lack of effective controls could preclude us from accomplishing these critical functions we are required to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of an issuers internal controls over financial reporting rozh caroro our president chief financial officer and treasurer is our only officer assigned to accounting issues at present which may be deemed to be inadequate although we intend to augment our internal controls procedures and expand our accounting staff there is no guarantee that this effort will be adequate   during the course of our testing we may identify deficiencies which we may not be able to remediate in addition if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal accounting controls as applicable standards are modified supplemented or amended from time to time we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section  failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to face regulatory action and also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information either of which could have an adverse effect on our stock price   as a smaller reporting company certain reduced disclosure and other requirements will be available to us after we are no longer an emerging growth company   we are a smaller reporting company pursuant to the securities exchange act of  some of the reduced disclosure and other requirements available to us as a result of the jobs act may continue to be available to us after we are no longer an emerging growth company pursuant to the jobs act but remain a smaller reporting company pursuant to the securities exchange act of  as a smaller reporting company we are not required to     · have an auditor report regarding our internal controls of financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act   · present more than two years audited financial statement in our registration statement and annual reports on form k and present selected financial data in such registration statements and annual reports      table of contents        · make risk factor disclosure in our annual reports of form k   · make certain otherwise required disclosures in our annual reports on form k and quarterly reports on form q   the financial statements included with the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part have been prepared on a going concern basis we may not be able to generate profitable operations in the future andor obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time these factors raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern we plan to continue to provide for our capital needs through related party advances our financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern   having only one executive officer and director limits our ability to establish effective independent corporate governance procedures   we have only one executive officer who is also our only director accordingly we cannot establish board committees comprised of independent members to oversee functions like compensation or audit issues unless and until we have a larger board of directors that would include one or more independent members and members with specific financial and audit experience there will be limited oversight of rozh caroros decisions and activities and little ability for our shareholders to challenge or reverse those activities and decisions even if they are not in your best interests   compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses   changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including the sarbanesoxley act of  and new sec regulations are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours these new or changed laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity and as a result their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure as a result we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice our reputation may be harmed   our business is highly competitive and depends on consumer spending patterns   the sock subscription business is highly competitive we face a variety of competitive challenges including   · anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands · developing innovative highquality products in sizes and styles that appeal to consumers   · competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value and · the need to provide strong and effective marketing support      table of contents      we must successfully gauge fashion trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed   our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies retail and customer demand in a timely manner the sock business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences dictated in part by fashion and season to the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise our sales may be adversely affected our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing fashion trends depends in part on our ability to attract in the future and retain key personnel in our design merchandising and marketing staff competition for these personnel is intense and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods   our business may be subject to seasonal trends resulting in fluctuations in our quarterly results which could cause uncertainty about our future performance and harm our results of operations   in the experience of our management the sock industry has been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis these trends are dependent on numerous factors including   · the markets in which we operate · holiday seasons   · consumer demand · climate   · economic conditions and · numerous other factors beyond our control   if we are unable to anticipate and react to new fashion and product demand trends our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected   we will  rely on a limited demographic customer base for a large percentage of our sales our brand image is dependent upon our ability to anticipate identify and provide fresh inventory reflecting current fashion trends   furthermore the continued difficult economic conditions make it increasingly difficult for us to accurately predict product demand trends if we fail to anticipate identify or react appropriately or in a timely manner to these fashion and product demand trends we could experience reduced consumer acceptance of our products a diminished brand image and higher markdowns these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations   if we decrease the price that we charge for our products or offer extensive continued promotions on our products we may earn lower gross margins and our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected   the prices that we  will be  able to charge for our products depend on among other things the type and quality of product offered the consumer response to the product and the prices charged by our competitors to the extent that we are forced to lower our prices our gross margins will be lower and our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected   we may suffer negative publicity and our business may be harmed if we need to recall any products we sell   we may in the future need to recall products that we determine may present quality issues if products we sell have quality problems of which we are not aware or if we or the consumer product safety commission recall a product sold on our online store we may suffer negative publicity and potentially product liability lawsuits which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation financial condition and results of operations or cash flows      table of contents       if we are unable to pass through increases in raw material labor and energy costs to our customers through price increases our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected   our product costs  may  rise from time to time due to increasing commodity prices primarily for cotton as well as due to higher production labor and energy costs we may not be able to or may elect not to pass these increases on to our customers through price increases which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations   our failure to effectively compete with other online retailers for sales could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows   the sock subscription industry is highly competitive with fashion quality price location and service being the principal competitive factors many of our competitors are large and have more experience that have substantially greater financial marketing and other resources than we do we face a variety of competitive challenges including   · anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands   · maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to consumers in narrowlydefined market segments   · sourcing innovative highquality products in sizes colors and styles that appeal to consumers in our target markets and maintaining a sufficient quantity of these items for which there is the greatest demand   · sourcing merchandise efficiently   · pricing our products competitively and achieving customer perception of value   · offering attractive promotional incentives while maintaining profit margins and   · withstanding periodic downturns in the sock industry   our industry has low barriers to entry that allow the introduction of new products or new competitors at a fast pace any of these factors could result in reductions in sales or the prices of our products which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows   a cybersecurity incident could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows   a cyberattack may bypass the security for our information systems causing an information system security breach and leading to a material disruption of our information systems the loss of business information andor the loss of ecommerce sales such a cyberattack could result in any of the following   · theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property   · operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of our information systems and subsequent cleanup and mitigation activities   · negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers partners or industry peers and   · loss of sales generated through our internet websites through which we sell merchandise to customers to the extent these websites are affected by a cyberattack   as a result our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected      table of contents       government regulation of the internet and ecommerce is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business   we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws

characteristics and quality of products and services it is not clear how certain existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and ecommerce unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our costs of doing business   if we fail to comply with payment card industry data security standards we may be subject to fines or penalties which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   we  will be  highly dependent on the use of credit cards to complete sale transactions in our stores and through our websites if we fail to comply with payment card industry data security standards we may become subject to fines or limitations on our ability to accept credit cards through our sale transactions loyalty programs and other methods we may obtain information about our customers which is subject to federal and state privacy laws these laws and the judicial interpretation of such laws are constantly evolving if we fail to comply with these laws we may be subject to fines or penalties which could impact our business financial condition and results of operations   we do not authenticate the license rights of our suppliers   we are looking at purchasing merchandise from a number of vendors who purport to hold manufacturing and distribution rights under the terms of license agreements or that assert that their products are not subject to any restrictions as to distribution we generally rely upon each vendors representation concerning those manufacturing and distribution rights and do not independently verify whether each vendor legally holds adequate rights to the licensed properties they are manufacturing or distributing if we acquire unlicensed merchandise or merchandise violating a registered trademark we could be obligated to remove it from our stores incur costs associated with destruction of the merchandise if the vendor is unwilling or unable to reimburse us and be subject to civil and criminal liability the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations andor cash flows   we are subject to risks associated with our procurement of products from nonus based vendors and us vendors that purchase products internationally any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   the majority of products that we intend to sell are manufactured outside the us and are primarily bought by us within the philippines china and from domestic importers as a result we are susceptible to greater losses as a result of a number of risks inherent in doing business in international markets and from a number of factors beyond our control any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows      table of contents       these factors include   · import or trade restrictions including increased tariffs customs duties taxes or quotas imposed by the us government in respect of the foreign countries in which our products are currently manufactured or any of the countries in which our products may be manufactured in the future   · political instability or acts of terrorism significant fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies restrictions on the transfer of funds between the us and foreign jurisdictions andor potential disruption of imports due to labor disputes at us ports any of which could adversely affect our merchandise flow and consequently cause our sales to decline and   · local business practices that do not conform to our legal or ethical guidelines   the us and the countries in which our products are produced or sold may also from time to time impose new quotas duties tariffs or other restrictions or adversely adjust prevailing quota duty or tariff levels in addition none of our international suppliers or international manufacturers supplies or manufactures our products exclusively as a result we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers and import quota capacity if we were unable to obtain our finished products from the countries where we wish to purchase them either because room under the necessary quotas was unavailable or for any other reason or if the cost of doing so should increase it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows   violation of labor laws and practices by our suppliers could harm our business and results of operations   our companys policy is to use only those sourcing agents and independent manufacturers who operate in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations the violation of laws particularly labor laws by an independent manufacturer or by one of the sourcing agents or the divergence of an independent manufacturers or sourcing agents labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the us or in the country in which the manufacturing facility is located and the public revelation of those illegal or unethical practices could cause significant damage to our companys reputation and could subject the company to legal proceedings andor prohibit the company from selling product received from an accused vendor although our manufacturer operating guidelines promote ethical business practices we do not control the business and operations of the manufacturers and cannot guarantee their legal and regulatory compliance   we are exposed to business risks as a result of our ecommerce operations   we plan on developing two ecommerce stores at wwwcaroholdingscom and wwwcarosockscom our ecommerce operations will be subject to numerous risks including unanticipated operating problems reliance on thirdparty computer hardware and software providers system failures and the need to invest in additional computer systems specific risks include i diversion of sales from our stores ii rapid technological change iii liability for ecommerce content and iv risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate the websites and their related support systems including computer viruses telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions in addition our future internet operations involve risks which are beyond our control that could have a direct material adverse effect on our operational results including i price competition involving the items we intend to sell ii the entry of our vendors into the internet business in direct competition with us iii the level of merchandise returns experienced by us iv governmental regulation v ecommerce security breaches involving unauthorized access to our andor customer information vi credit card fraud and vii competition and general economic conditions specific to the internet ecommerce and the apparel industry our inability to effectively address these risks and any other risks that we face in connection with our future internet operations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows      table of contents       economic conditions and unemployment rates may adversely affect consumer spending and may significantly harm our business    the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the level of consumer spending a number of factors may affect the level of consumer spending on merchandise that we offer including among other things   · general economic industry and weather conditions   · unemployment trends and salaries and wage rates   · energy costs which affect gasoline and home heating prices   · the level of consumer debt   · consumer credit availability   · real estate values and foreclosure rates   · consumer confidence in future economic conditions   · interest rates   · health care costs   · tax rates and policies and   · war terrorism other hostilities and security concerns   the products we plan on selling  generally would be deemed as discretionary items adverse economic conditions and unemployment rates and any related decrease in consumer confidence and spending may result in reduced consumer demand for discretionary items any decrease in consumer demand could reduce traffic in our planned  online stores limit the prices we can charge for our products and force us to take inventory markdowns which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition reduced demand may also require increased selling and promotional expenses   we face significant competition in our markets and we may be unable to compete favorably   the sock subscription market is highly competitive with few barriers to entry we will compete primarily with other sock subscription companies but we will also compete with department stores shoe stores sporting goods stores online retailers and mass merchandisers many of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do economic pressures on or bankruptcies of our competition could result in increased pricing pressures this competition could adversely affect our planned results of operations and financial condition in the future     failure to successfully manage and execute our marketing initiatives could have a negative impact on our business    our success and growth is partially dependent on generating customer traffic in order to gain sales momentum in our planned online stores and the ability to drive traffic to our websites successful marketing efforts require the ability to reach customers through their desired mode of communication utilizing various media outlets media placement decisions are generally made months in advance of the scheduled release date our inability to accurately predict our consumers preferences to utilize their desired mode of communication or to ensure availability of advertised products could adversely affect our future business and operating results      table of contents       our failure to identify fashion trends could result in lower sales higher markdowns and lower gross profits   our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and react to the fashion tastes of our customers and provide merchandise that satisfies consumer demand our failure to anticipate identify or react appropriately to changes in consumer fashion preferences may result in lower sales higher markdowns to reduce excess inventories and lower gross profits conversely if we fail to anticipate or react to consumer demand for our products we may experience inventory shortages which would result in lost sales and could negatively affect our customer goodwill our brand image and our profitability moreover our business relies on continuous changes in fashion preferences stagnating consumer preferences could also result in lower sales and would require us to take higher markdowns to reduce excess inventories     a failure to increase sales at our online store may adversely affect our results of operations    a number of factors have historically affected and could affect our comparable planned online store sales results including     · competition   · timing of holidays including sales tax holidays   · general regional and national economic conditions   · inclement weather andor unseasonable weather patterns   · consumer trends such as less disposable income due to the impact of higher prices on consumer goods   · fashion trends   · changes in our merchandise mix   · our ability to efficiently distribute merchandise   · timing and type of and customer response to sales events promotional activities or other advertising   · the effectiveness of our inventory management   · new merchandise introductions and   · our ability to execute our business strategy effectively   failure to protect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of our customers and employees could expose us to litigation and damage our reputation    we will receive and maintain certain personal sensitive and confidential information about our customers vendors and employees

   table of contents       we will  outsource certain business processes to thirdparty vendors and have certain business relationships that subject us to risks including disruptions in business and increased costs   we will  outsource some of our business processes to third party vendors we make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of these outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices however there are no guarantees that failures will not occur failure of third parties to provide adequate services or our inability to arrange for alternative providers on favorable terms in a timely manner could disrupt our business increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and our financial results   failure to maintain positive brand perception and recognition could have a negative impact on our business    maintaining a good reputation is critical to our business the considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has increased the risk that our reputation could be negatively impacted in a short amount of time if we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to any incidents negatively impacting our reputation we may suffer declines in customer loyalty and traffic and we may experience vendor relationship issues and other issues all of which could negatively affect our financial results    various risks associated with our ecommerce business may adversely affect our business and results of operations    we are planning on launching our ecommerce business during the companys first quarter of  selling sock subscriptions through our website at wwwcarholdingscom and wwwcarosockscom we will fulfill ecommerce orders from online orders although our ecommerce operations have not commenced  as we do not have any sales we anticipate that the percentage of our sales through our ecommerce site will grow and thus the risks associated with these operations could have an impact on our overall operations our planned ecommerce operations may not however achieve growing sales and profitability our planned ecommerce operations are subject to numerous risks including unanticipated operating problems reliance on third party computer hardware software and service providers and the need to invest in additional computer systems any significant interruptions in the operations of these third party providers over which we have no control could have a material adverse effect on our ecommerce business our planned ecommerce operations involve additional potential risks that could have an impact on our results of operations including hiring retaining and training personnel to conduct our ecommerce operations our ability to manage any upgrades or other technological changes exposure to potential liability for online content risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate our ecommerce site and its related support systems including computer viruses telecommunication failures and cyberattacks and breakins and similar disruptions and security risks related to our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information any breach involving our customer

operating results financial position and cash flows      table of contents       an increase in the cost or a disruption in the flow of imported goods may decrease our sales and profits   we will  rely on imported goods to sell in our online store substantially all of the socks we plan on selling are manufactured overseas including the merchandise we import directly from overseas manufacturers and the merchandise we purchase from domestic vendors the primary sock manufacturers are located in china and philippines a disruption in the flow of imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those goods may decrease our sales and profits in addition we do not control our vendors or their labor and business practices the violation of labor product safety or other laws by one of our vendors could have an adverse effect on our business   if imported merchandise becomes more expensive or unavailable the transition to alternative sources may not occur in time to meet our demands products from alternative sources may be of lesser quality and more expensive than those we currently import other risks associated with our use of imported goods include   · disruptions in the flow of imported goods because of factors such as electricity or raw material shortages work stoppages strikes political unrest and natural disasters   · problems with oceanic shipping including shipping container shortages and piracy   · port congestion at arrival ports causing delays   · additional oceanic shipping costs to reach noncongested ports   · inland transit costs and delays resulting from port congestion   · economic crises and international disputes   · currency exchange rate fluctuations   · increases in the cost of purchasing or shipping foreign merchandise resulting from the failure to maintain normal trade relations with source countries and   · import duties import quotas tariffs antidumping duties and other trade sanctions     we may not be able to successfully execute our growth strategy which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations     we intend to open multiple online stores selling different subscription products as a part of our growth strategy we may not be able to open all of the new online stores contemplated by our growth strategy and the new online stores that we open may not be as profitable   the complexity of our operations and management responsibilities will increase as we grow our growth strategy requires that we continue to expand and improve our operating and financial systems and expand train and manage our future employee base in addition as we open new online stores we may be unable to hire a sufficient number of qualified store personnel or successfully integrate the new online stores into our business   the success of our growth strategy will depend on a number of other factors many of which are out of our control including among other things   · our ability to provide adequate distribution to support growth   · our ability to source sufficient levels of quality products to meet the needs of new online stores   · the availability of financing for capital expenditures and working capital requirements   · our ability to improve costs and timing associated with opening new online stores and   · the impact of new online stores on sales or profitability of our first online store in the same market      table of contents      due to the risks involved we may be unable to open new online stores at the rates expected if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations    we will  depend on our key suppliers for merchandise and advertising support and the loss of key suppliers could adversely affect our business   our business depends upon our ability to purchase fashionable socks at competitive prices from our suppliers a loss of any of our key suppliers or our inability to obtain products at competitive prices could have a material adverse effect on our business as is common in the industry we do not have any longterm contracts with our suppliers   because our principal assets will be located in the philippines outside of the united states and rozh caroro our sole officer and director resides outside of the united states it may be difficult for investors to enforce any rights based on us securities laws against us andor mrs caroro or to enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the united states against us andor mr caroro    our principal operations and assets are located in the philippines outside of the united states and rozh caroro our sole officer and director is a nonresident of the united states he is a resident of the philippines therefore it may be difficult to effect service of process on mrs caroro in the united states and it may be difficult to enforce any judgment rendered against mrs caroro as a result it may be difficult or impossible for an investor to bring an action against mrs caroro in the event that an investor believes that such investors rights have been infringed under the us securities laws or otherwise even if an investor is successful in bringing an action of this kind the laws of the philippines may render that investor unable to enforce a judgment against the assets of mrs caroro as a result our shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management director or major shareholder compared to shareholders of a corporation doing business and whose officers and directors reside within the united states   additionally because of our assets are located outside of the united states they will be outside of the jurisdiction of united states courts to administer if we become subject of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding as a result if we declare bankruptcy or insolvency our shareholders may not receive the distributions on liquidation that they would otherwise be entitled to if our assets were to be located within the united states under united states bankruptcy laws   risks associated with our common stock and this

market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock and our ability to acquire other companies or assets by using shares of our common stock as consideration   our common stock price may be volatile and could fluctuate widely in price which could result in substantial losses for investors   the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile

our products and services   · the establishment of partnerships with other companies   · additions or departures of key personnel   · sales of our common stock   · our ability to integrate operations products and services   · our ability to execute our business plan   · operating results below expectations   · loss of any strategic relationship   · industry developments   · economic and other external factors and   · periodtoperiod fluctuations in our financial results   because we are a development stage company with no revenues to date you should consider any one of these factors to be material our stock price may fluctuate widely as a result of any of the above     in addition the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock   finra sales practice requirements may limit a stockholders ability to buy and sell our stock   finra has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer a brokerdealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer prior to recommending speculative lowpriced securities commonly referred to as a penny stock to their noninstitutional customers brokerdealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status tax status investment objectives and other information under interpretations of these rules finra believes that there is a high probability that speculative lowpriced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers finra requirements will make it more difficult for brokerdealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock when traded which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity and liquidity of our common stock in the future further many brokers charge higher fees for these speculative lowpriced securities transactions as a result fewer brokerdealers may be willing to make a market in our common stock reducing a stockholders ability to resell shares of our common stock      table of contents       our charter contains some antitakeover provisions that may inhibit a takeover that might benefit you   the provisions in our articles of incorporation relating to delegation to the board of directors of rights to determine the terms of preferred stock may have the effect not only of discouraging attempts by others to buy us but also of making it more difficult or impossible for stockholders to make management changes the ability of our board of directors to determine the terms of preferred stock while providing flexibility in connection with possible business purchases and other corporate purposes could make it more difficult for a third party to secure a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock   our common stock is considered penny stock and may be difficult to sell   the sec has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security that has a market or exercise price of less than  per share subject to specific exemptions the market price of our common stock may be below  per share and therefore may be designated as a penny stock according to sec rules this designation requires any broker or dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities these rules may restrict the ability of brokers or dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares in addition since we will attempt to have our shares of common stock quoted on the otcqb following this offering our stockholders may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations of our common stock and may find few buyers to purchase the stock or a lack of market makers to support the stock price   market for penny stock has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse

market for the security by one or a few brokerdealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer   · manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases   · boiler room practices involving highpressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced salespersons   · excessive and undisclosed bidask differential and markups by selling brokerdealers and   · the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and brokerdealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequential investor losses   our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of brokerdealers who participate in the market management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities the occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price      table of contents       volatility in our common share price may subject us to securities litigation   the market for our common stock if one develops may be characterized by significant price volatility and we expect that our share price may be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future in the past plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities we may in the future be the target of similar litigation securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert our managements attention and resources   certain provisions of nevada law provide for indemnification of our officers and directors at our expense and limit their liability which may result in a major cost to us and damage the interests of our shareholders because our resources may be expended for the benefit of our officers andor directors   applicable nevada law provides for the indemnification of our directors officers employees and agents under certain circumstances for attorneys fees and other expenses incurred by them in any litigation to which they become a party resulting from their association with us or activities on our behalf we will also pay the expenses of such litigation for any of our directors officers employees or agents upon such persons promise to repay us if it is ultimately determined that any such person shall not have been entitled to indemnification the indemnification policy could result in substantial expenditures by us which we will be unable to recover   we have been advised that in the opinion of the sec indemnification for liabilities occurring pursuant to federal securities laws is against public policy as expressed in the securities act of  and therefore unenforceable in the event that a claim for indemnification against these types of liabilities other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by a director officer or controlling person in the successful defense of any action lawsuit or proceeding is asserted by a director officer or controlling person in connection with our securities being registered we will unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the issue of whether such indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the securities act of  and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue the legal process relating to the matter if it were to occur probably will be very costly and may result in us receiving negative publicity either of which factors would probably materially reduce the market and price for our common stock if such a market ever develops   we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future you should not buy our stock if you expect dividends   we currently intend to retain our future earnings to support operations and to finance expansion and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future   we could issue blank check preferred stock without stockholder approval with the effect of diluting then current stockholder interests and impairing their voting rights and provisions in our charter documents and under nevada corporate law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable   our articles of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of blank check preferred stock with designations rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors our board of directors is empowered without stockholder approval to issue a series of preferred stock with dividend liquidation conversion voting or other rights which could dilute the interest of or impair the voting power of our common stockholders the issuance of a series of preferred stock could be used as a method of discouraging delaying or preventing a change in control for example it would be possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of the company       table of contents       we are selling the shares offered in this prospectus without an underwriter and may not be able to sell all of the shares   the shares of common stock are being offered on our behalf by our officers and directors on a selfunderwritten efforts basis no brokerdealer has been retained as an underwriter and no brokerdealer is under any obligation to purchase any shares there are no firm commitments to purchase any of the shares in this offering consequently there is no guarantee that we through our officers and directors are capable of selling all of the shares offered in this prospectus   since there is no minimum for this offering if only a few persons purchase shares they will lose their money immediately without us being even able to develop a market for our shares   since there is no minimum with respect to the number of shares to be sold directly by the company in its offering if only a few shares are sold we will be unable to even attempt to create a public market of any kind for our shares in such an event it is highly likely that the entire investment of the early share purchasers would be lost immediately   if the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part is declared effective we will be subject to reporting requirements and we currently do not have sufficient capital to maintain this reporting status with the sec   if the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part is declared effective we will have a reporting obligation to the sec as of the date of this prospectus the funds currently available to us will not be sufficient to meet our reporting obligations if we fail to meet our reporting obligations we will lose our reporting status with the sec our management believes that if we cannot maintain our reporting status with the sec we will have to cease all efforts directed towards developing our business in that event any investment in the company could be lost in its entirety   you may not revoke your subscription agreement once it is accepted by the company or receive a refund of any funds advanced in connection with your accepted subscription agreement and as a result you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock   once your subscription agreement is accepted by the company you may not revoke that subscription agreement or request a refund of any monies paid in connection with that subscription agreement even if you subsequently learn information about the company that you consider to be materially unfavorable the company reserves the right to begin using the proceeds from this offering as soon as the funds have been received and will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering the precise amounts and timing of the companys use of the proceeds will depend upon market conditions and the availability of other funds among other factors there can be no assurance that the company will receive sufficient funds to execute the companys business strategy and accomplish the companys objectives accordingly the companys business may fail and we will have to cease our operations additionally you may be unable to sell your shares of our common stock at a price equal to or greater than the subscription price you paid for such shares and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock   our management will have broad discretion over the use of the proceeds we receive in this offering and might not apply the proceeds in ways that increase the value of your investment   the offering has no escrow and investor funds may be used on receipt we intend to use the money raised in this offering as detailed in use of proceeds section of this prospectus however our management has the discretion to use the money as it sees fit and may diverge from using the proceeds of this offering as explained herein the use of proceeds may not be used to increase the value of your investment      table of contents       as a new investor you will experience substantial dilution as a result of future equity issuances   in the event we are required to raise additional capital we may do so by selling additional shares of common stock thereby diluting the shares and ownership interests of existing shareholders   our shares may not become eligible to be traded electronically which would result in brokerage firms being unwilling to trade them   if we become able to have our shares of common stock quoted on the otcqb or other otc markets tier we will then try through a brokerdealer and its clearing firm to become eligible with the depository trust company dtc to permit our shares to trade electronically if an issuer is not dtceligible then its shares cannot be electronically transferred between brokerage accounts which based on the realities of the marketplace as it exists today means that shares of a company will not be traded technically the shares can be traded manually between accounts but this takes days and is not a realistic option for companies relying on broker dealers for stock transactions – such as all companies on the otcqb what this boils down to is that while dtceligibility is not a requirement to trade on the otcqb it is a necessity to process trades on the otcqb if a companys stock is going to trade with any volume there are no assurances that our shares will ever become dtceligible or if they do how long it will take   state securities blue sky laws may limit secondary trading which may restrict the states in which and conditions under which you can sell the shares offered by this prospectus   there is no public market for our shares and there can be no assurance that any public market will develop in the foreseeable future secondary trading in the shares sold in this offering will not be possible in any state in the us unless and until our shares are qualified for sale under the applicable securities laws of the state or there is confirmation that an exemption such as listing in certain recognized securities manuals is available for secondary trading in such state there can be no assurance that we will be successful in registering or qualifying the shares for secondary trading or identifying an available exemption for secondary trading in our securities in every state if we fail to register or qualify or to obtain or verify an exemption for the secondary trading of the shares in any particular state the shares could not be offered or sold to or purchased by a resident of that state in the event that a significant number of states refuse to permit secondary trading in our shares the market for our shares could be adversely affected   if we have less than  record shareholders at the beginning of any fiscal year other than the fiscal year within which the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part becomes effective our reporting obligations under section d of the exchange act will be suspended   there is a significant risk that we will have less than  record shareholders at our next fiscal year end and at the conclusion of this offering if we have less than  record shareholders our reporting obligations under section d of the exchange act will be suspended and we would no longer be obligated to provide periodic reports following the form k for the fiscal year end immediately following this offering furthermore if at the beginning of any fiscal year we have fewer than  record shareholders for the class of securities being registered under that registration statement our reporting obligations under section d of the exchange act will be automatically suspended for that fiscal year if we were to cease reporting you will not have access to updated information regarding the companys business financial condition and results of operation   we are an emerging growth company under the jobs act of  and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors   we are an emerging growth company as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of  jobs act and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile      table of contents       in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards   we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period even if we no longer qualify for the exemptions for an emerging growth company we may still be in certain circumstances subject to scaled disclosure requirements as a smaller reporting company for example smaller reporting companies like emerging growth companies are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis under item b of regulation sk or auditor attestation of internal controls over financial reporting   until such time however we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile   we must raise at least  of the offering to pursue our business plan on a limited basis   we have no alternative plan of operation if at least  of the shares offered herein are not sold those investing in our common stock through this offering are taking substantial risk in that they may lose their entire investment if we do not sell at least  of the shares offered see use of proceeds   use of proceeds   the following table details the companys intended use of proceeds from this offering for the first twelve  months after successful completion of the offering none of the expenditures itemized are listed in any particular order of priority or importance since the company does not intend to pay any offering expenses from the proceeds from this offering and assuming that       or   of the offering is sold the gross aggregate proceeds will be allocated as follows   expenditure item                     professional fees current funds                          dtceligibility fees                              website design and development                              advertising and marketing                              working capital and office expenses                              product development                              total                           there is no minimum amount we are required to raise in this offering and any funds received will be immediately available to us   we plan prioritize our intended use of proceeds in the following order professional fees dtc eligibility fees  website design and development product development advertising and marketing and lastly working capital and office expenses    the above expenditures are defined as follows      table of contents      professional fees current funds  pertains to legal services and accounting fees that will be incurred by the company for maintaining fully reporting status with the sec  dtceligibility fees  pertains to the cost to apply for our shares to be eligible for trading with the depository trust corporation dtc please refer to the heading our shares may not become eligible to be traded electronically which would result in brokerage firms being unwilling to trade them under risks for our common stock for an explanation of the importance of dtceligibility  website design and development  pertains to the payments that will be made to design and develop our website this will be to develop our main branded wwwcarosockscom website and our main website at wwwcarholdingscom  advertising and marketing  pertains to the cost of advertising and marketing our products in our selected target markets  office and miscellaneous expenses  these are the costs of operating our office including telephone services mail stationery accounting office supplies bank service fees and charges and other miscellaneous expenses associated with running our office  working capital  pertains to the funds allocated to general working capital funds will be used to cover short falls in other areas if applicable during the next  months   there is no assurance that we will be able to raise the entire  with this offering therefore the following details how we will use the proceeds if we raise only   or  of this offering   if only   of this offering is sold  we estimate that this would still provide sufficient capital to develop and build out our website properly market our products and cover our office expenses we would also have a smaller amount working capital to utilize but still enough to capitalize on differing marketing opportunities when then they come up or cover deficiencies in other areas   if only   of this offering is sold  we will have to reduce our shortterm goals we will still be able to develop a website but it will not be as effective as what we would be able to create at the higher funding levels we will also still be able to market our products through our website platform but again it will not on the same scale our offices expenses will have to be curtailed as well as our ability to utilize working capital so while  funding is not ideal and will cause us to lower our interim business development it will suffice to cover our operations for the first  months   if   of this offering is sold  we would still incur expected professional legal and accounting fees of  which will have to be paid to maintain reporting status during the next  months this would substantially hinder the development of our business and our ability to generate sufficient revenues our website and marketing would be rudimentary our office expenses cut to a minimum and there will be insignificant working capital in short we would not be able to develop our business andor generate sufficient revenues in the first year without additional financing further we would not be able to pay for making our securities dtceligible and thus it is unlikely an investor in this offering would be able to trade his or her shares in a public market should a public market even be achieved      table of contents      if we do not raise sufficient funds to pay professional fees estimated to be  for the first  months we would not be able to remain reporting with the sec and therefore we would not be able to obtain an otcqb quotation   we feel that we need to raise a minimum of  in offering proceeds in order to implement our business plan and support our operations for the next  months   the allocation of the net proceeds of the offering set forth above represents our best estimates based upon our current plans and certain assumptions regarding industry and general economic conditions and our future revenues and expenditures if any of these factors change we may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate some of the proceeds within the abovedescribed categories working capital includes payroll office expenses and supplies insurance and other general expenses   determination of offering price   as of the date of this prospectus there is no public market for our common stock the offering price of  per share was determined arbitrarily by us and should not be considered an indication of the actual value of our company or our shares of common stock it was not based on any established criteria of value and bears no relation to our assets book value earnings or net worth in determining the offering price and the number of shares to be offered we considered such factors as the price paid by our initial investor our financial condition our potential for profit and the general condition of the securities market   we decided on the offering price of  per share because we believe that the price of  per share will be the easiest price at which to sell the shares the price of the common stock that will prevail in any market that develops after the offering if any may be higher or lower than the price you paid there is also no assurance that an active market will ever develop in our securities you may not be able to resell any shares you purchased in this offering our common stock has never been traded on any exchange or market prior to this offering   dilution   dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of shares of our common stock held by our existing stockholders   as of march   the net tangible book value of our shares of common stock was approximately  or approximately  per share based upon  shares outstanding paid by rozh caroro our sole officer and director      table of

prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the sec which specifies information about penny stocks and the nature and significance of risks of the penny stock market a brokerdealer must also provide the customer with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and sales person in the transaction and monthly account statements indicating the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for stock that becomes subject to

activities and to pay for the expenses associated with this offering if we are not able to raise the full  to implement our business plan as anticipated we will scale our business development in line with available capital our primary priority will be to retain our reporting status with the sec which means that we will first ensure that we have sufficient capital to cover our legal and accounting expenses once these costs are accounted for in accordance with how much financing we are able to secure we will focus on the development of our website product development and sales and marketing activities we will likely not expend funds on the remainder of our planned activities unless we have the required capital       table of contents       offering expenses   our offering expenses include the funds necessary to form the company and to pay our legal and accounting fees we estimate these expenses at  and will be funded through the money we have raised from the sale of common

that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business in the foreseeable future unless we obtain additional capital andor generate sufficient revenues to pay for our expenses accordingly we are attempting to raise sufficient capital from sources our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others and loans from our officers and directors we must raise cash or increase our revenues to stay in business in response to these problems management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings at this time however the company does not have plans or intentions to raise additional funds by way of the sale of additional securities other than pursuant to this offering   begin our ecommerce business   we have developed our preliminary website and are in the process of developing a more advanced site where we can provide more detailed information regarding our products and shopping cart this will cost us around   we intend to source this work to third party consultants and this project will be spearheaded by our officer and director we expect our advanced site to be ready by july of  we plan to establish an ecommerce business once we have raised sufficient funds from our current offering using the domains wwwcaroholdingscom and wwwcarosockscom     buying   our buying responsibilities will be to identify evolving fashion trends and develop themes to guide our merchandising strategy we will develop fashion themes and strategies by identifying trends and assessing how they best apply to our target customer shopping appropriate domestic and international markets using fashion services and gathering references from industry publications we then plan on working closely with vendors to use colors materials and designs that create images consistent with the themes for our product offerings   marketing advertising and promotion   we believe that our brand will become one of our most important assets our ability to successfully create brand awareness is dependent upon our ability to address the changing needs and priorities of each brands target customers to that end we plan to focus many of our marketing efforts to better understand our customers and their needs and ensure we align our brand messages in our marketing and the channels through which we deliver these messages to our target customers we intend to implement marketing strategies to build upon loyalty programs with our ecommerce customer relationship management efforts   our marketing strategy will include the following    marketing to family  friends   this might not be the most tech savvy method of getting those first customers to subscribe to our product but it is often the easiest way to start we communicate with our friends and family about the service with the intention to sign them up there are major benefits to this strategy     a we may receive our first orders through the door and these first customers will hopefully spread the word to their networks         b we will receive early feedback on our socks which we can use improve the product and service      table of contents       we will begin our social media campaign by setting up pages on facebook and twitter where we can invite our acquaintances to like our page here are the essentials we will do to set up our social media platform     a reach out to influencers getting a social endorsement from one of the leading players in our industry could the boost the awareness of our products and company         b become a curator of content the company will get involved in conversation with our followers make friends with them and give them something of value we also plan on sharing other peoples and particularly the influencers content as much as our own as well as sharing articles and our personal views on current affairs         c choose the right channel we will concentrate on choosing our social channels wisely and determine where do our customers hangout what do they want to see which channels convert the most this is a strategy that will be implemented we want to use social media to build audience relationships instead of constantly trying to sell our product         d using paid advertising we will implement a budget where we will allocate funds for payperclick marketing ppc including paid ads with google adwords and facebook we will set up some tests using various copy based around our targeted keywords to bring targeted traffic to our site and see which ads have the best conversion rates and keep testing eventually we might find that the cost per acquisition is far less than the lifetime value of a customer clv if this is the case we will scale our paid advertising up to generate hot leads and grow our subscription business substantially         e free giveaways since we will be new to the marketplace and want to gain maximum exposure we might need to throw our subscription box in the face of customers for free let them see how awesome it is a try before you buy promotion could be implemented in addition those influencers we found during our social media strategy will be sent promotional material for free and asked to promote it to their followers we may also have a landing page promoting a free trial of our sock subscriptions         f blog we will aim to create a blog that will appeal and resonate with our target audience sharing across our social media networks is how we will organically build a loyal community around our business once we have those followers on board we can aim to convert them into paying customers additionally blogging also works well in our seo and if we do it right we can rank high in googles search results for those targeted keywords thus we could be getting significant organic traffic and customers as a result         g buffer are a great example of a startup who have become thought leaders in their space as a result of their awesome buffer blog they now get close to  visitors per month to their blog alone because their content is of such high quality and so useful to their customer segment they attract qualified leads to their blog who are then more likely to go onto convert into paying customers remember the better the content the more shareable it will be on social media and the higher it will be ranked by google         h create video content video content is yet another channel we will aim to create a relationship with customers and a great way to increase engagement and interaction with our brand while video content has great seo benefits it is known that if the quality is good enough a video could go viral         i multichannel selling establishing a steady stream of visitors from scratch to our website can be difficult and time consuming leveraging the audiences of ebay and amazon marketplaces could put your subscription box in front of a mass audience to help boost our sales these marketplaces dont have a subscription payment option so instead we will provide customers with a coupon for  off a purchase from our online store this way we can create the hook to get these customers to make their second purchase on our site and become lifelong customers         j seo search engine optimisation seo is the process of making sure that search engines such as google can find our website and rank it in search results to give us free organic traffic we plan on maximizing use of this tool for our business         k offer coupon codes we are in the early stages of our subscription box business and we need every customer we can get our hands on thus creating a coupon code for customers will make them feel like they are winning we plan on using this tool to initially capture a customer and make them part of our recurring revenue         l building our email list we will aim at building our email marketing list as it is one of the most valuable channels targeting customers who have all shown an interest in our product which will allow us to contact them to promote our products    sourcing and vendor relationships   caro holdings inc has not established any supply agreements that will allow the company to fulfill subscription orders we will continue to source suitable vendors   we do not currently have any commitments or arrangements to purchase merchandise from any supplier and there are many vendors who could supply our merchandise      table of contents       building brand awareness   our goal is to communicate a consistent brand image across all aspects of our operations we will utilize a blend of advertising mediums and marketing methods to communicate who we are and the values we offer special emphasis is made to highlight brands as well as specific styles of product the use of social media will become an increasingly important medium in our digital marketing efforts allowing us to directly communicate with as well as advertise to our core customers     distribution   we do not currently have any distribution we plan to sell our products on our website once we have raised sufficient funds to do so   competition   the retail footwear business is highly competitive we believe the principal competitive factors in our industry are merchandise selection price fashion quality location shopping environment and service we will compete with department stores shoe stores sporting goods stores online retailers and mass merchandisers our specific competitors vary from market to market we will compete with most department stores and traditional shoe stores by offering competitive prices we will compete with offprice retailers mass merchandisers and discount stores by offering a wider and deeper selection of merchandise     many of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources however we believe that our online format in combination with our wide merchandise selection competitive prices and low operating costs will enable us to compete effectively   seasonality   our quarterly results of operations  will fluctuate primarily as a result of seasonal variances and the timing of sales and costs associated with opening new stores    we will  have three distinct peak selling periods easter backtoschool and christmas to prepare for our peak shopping seasons we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry during other parts of the year any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during these peak shopping seasons could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown which could reduce our net sales and gross margins and negatively affect our profitability our operating results depend significantly upon the sales generated during these periods   environmental   compliance with federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of material into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we believe the nature of our operations have little if any environmental impact we therefore anticipate no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for our current fiscal year or for the near future   status of publicly announced new products or services   caro holdings inc has now established a nonexclusive supply agreement which will allow the company to fulfill subscription orders in a timely and efficient manner      table of contents       employees   we have no employees initially our officer and director furnish their time to the development of the company at no cost we do not foresee hiring any employees in the near future we will engage independent contractors to help design and develop our website and marketing efforts   business strategy and operations   internet   we will advertise our products primarily through our direct marketing campaign on the internet we will also attempt to build brand awareness through social media marketing activities website promotions and payperclick advertising campaigns   moving with product trends   the global subscription business is continually evolving we will continue to focus our efforts on identifying shifting consumer preferences and responding to those shifts before our competitors we believe that it is paramount to quickly identify consumer and product trends in each geographic location analyze and adapt our business as needed and rapidly drive appropriate changes to our other planned markets we plan to continue to adapt to new technologies and new supplies of our products in order to increase our share of the market   distribution and sales   we will offer our sock subscriptions predominately through our primary online store at wwwcaroholdingscom and wwwcarosockscom    target market   our initial market which we will begin our sales strategy will be our local market of the country of the philippines  our knowledge and experience is in the philippines so it will be important that we target customers in country first and build our sales internally and then once we have finetuned our operations internally then we can begin marketing our subscription boxes to other markets  as we gain momentum in sales and revenue it will allow us to expand our sales and marketing efforts to other surrounding regions such as indonesia malaysia thailand vietnam and cambodia  however being an online business gives us the opportunity to offer our subscription boxes to customers internationally   manufacturing   we have no manufacturing capabilities and do not intend to develop any manufacturing capabilities we depend on third party manufacturers for our sock supplies any interruption in supply and or consistency of our products may harm our relationships and reputation with customers and have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition  however to safe guard this we hope to have in place agreements with more than one manufacturer to ensure we do not have any interruptions with our supply chain   the company will rely on third party manufacturers for the production of our products our products are manufactured on a purchaseorder basis with production being initiated following receipt of an initial order and payment from us on july   we entered into a nonexclusive supply agreement with a sock manufacturer based out of china   our first manufacturer we entered into a supply agreement is zhejiang figure import and export co ltd which was established in  with over  employees and is located in zhuji city of zhejiang province where one of the largest sock markets in china are located  they specialize in manufacturing and exporting socks and textiles  they can produce socks as per a customers design or customers can purchase socks from their existing designs and supply they currently sell their products to the usa europe australia canada and south america markets which enjoy great popularity and reputations in global market due to their high quality products and customer

measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures the three levels are defined as follows   level   inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets   level   inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instruments   level   inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value   the companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and accrued liabilities i t is managements opinion that the carrying values are a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and if applicable their stated interest rate approximates current rates available   management believes it is not practical to determine the fair value of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and note payable to related parties and lease and management arrangement with related parties if any because the transactions cannot be assumed to have been consummated at arms length the terms are not deemed to be market terms there are no quoted values available for these instruments and an independent valuation would not be practical due to the lack of data regarding similar instruments if any and the associated potential costs   transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an armslength basis as the requisite conditions of competitive freemarket dealings may not exist representations about transactions with related parties if made shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in armslength transactions unless such representations can be substantiated   net income loss per share   basic net income loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders by the weightedaverage number of common shares

distribution allowing us to target a wide range of customers and cater to their variety of specific needs and interests   we are a small early stage company to date our companys activities have been limited to the sourcing of our advertising channels initial branding efforts and in our formation and the raising of equity capital   we have not generated revenues and have limited cash on hand we have sustained losses since inception and have relied upon loans from directors and officers and the sale of our securities for funding we have never declared bankruptcy been in receivership or involved in any kind of legal proceeding   our current business   we are engaged in the subscription box business with our initial focus on offering sock subscriptions to our customers our

marketing strategy and a method of product distribution subscription boxes are used by subscription based ecommerce businesses referred to as subcom for short which follow a subscription business model the subcom aims to target a wide range of customers and cater to a variety of specific needs and interests the subscription box industry is nascent so there exists minimal data it is estimated that there are  to  different kinds of subscription boxes in the united states alone and more overseas subscriptions vary in both cost and frequency making them more accessible to a greater range of customers with different socioeconomic backgrounds subscription boxes tend to range from  to  the use of subscription boxes are rising in popularity among both consumers and businesses subscription commerce is suitable for a wide range of markets large scale retailers like walmart amazoncom cvs pharmacy freshpair and lancôme use subscription commerce small scale local groups also utilize subscription boxes products are limited only to what can be shipped and downloaded despite this some products such as smaller and lighter products are better suited for subscription boxes than others

retrieved  october         table of contents   status of any publicly announced new product or service   we have not developed any new or unique products or services that have not already been announced   sources and availability of raw materials   we do not currently have any commitments or arrangements to purchase merchandise from any supplier and there are many vendors who can supply our merchandise   buying   our buying responsibilities will be to identifying evolving fashion trends and developing themes to guide our merchandising strategy we will develop fashion themes and strategies by identifying trends and assessing how they best apply to our target customer shopping appropriate domestic and international markets using fashion services and gathering references from industry publications we then plan on working closely with vendors to use colors materials and designs that create images consistent with the themes for our product offerings   marketing advertising and promotion   we believe that our brand will become one of our most important assets our ability to successfully create brand awareness is dependent upon our ability to address the changing needs and priorities of each brands target customers to that end we plan to focus many of our marketing efforts to better understand our customers and their needs and ensure we align our brand messages in our marketing and the channels through which we deliver these messages to our target customers we intend to implement marketing strategies to build upon loyalty programs with our ecommerce customer relationship management efforts   building brand awareness   our goal is to communicate a consistent brand image across all aspects of our operations we will utilize a blend of advertising mediums and marketing methods to communicate who we are and the values we offer special emphasis is made to highlight brands as well as specific styles of product the use of social media will become an increasingly important medium in our digital marketing efforts allowing us to directly communicate with as well as advertise to our core customers   seasonality   our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future primarily as a result of seasonal variances and the timing of sales and costs associated with opening new stores noncapital expenditures such as advertising and payroll incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense as incurred therefore our results of operations may be adversely affected in any quarter in which we incur preopening expenses related to the opening of new stores   we have three distinct peak selling periods easter backtoschool and christmas to prepare for our peak shopping seasons we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry during other parts of the year any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during these peak shopping seasons could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown which could reduce our net sales and gross margins and negatively affect our profitability our operating results depend significantly upon the sales generated during these periods   dependence on limited customers   we are not dependent upon any specific customers at this time   our competition   the retail footwear business is highly competitive we believe the principal competitive factors in our industry are merchandise selection price fashion quality location shopping environment and service we compete with department stores shoe stores sporting goods stores online retailers and mass merchandisers our specific competitors vary from market to market we compete with most department stores and traditional shoe stores by offering competitive prices we compete with offprice retailers mass merchandisers and discount stores by offering a wider and deeper selection of merchandise        table of contents   many of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources however we believe that our online format in combination with our wide merchandise selection competitive prices and low operating costs will enable us to compete effectively   patents trademarks licenses franchises concessions royalty agreements or labor contracts   we do not own either legally or beneficially any patent or trademark   need for government approval of principal products or services   none of the services we offer require specific government approval local government rules may dictate the need for a business license   research and development during our last two fiscal years   we have not in the past two years conducted any research and development activities other than the development of our website we do not anticipate conducting such activities in the near future   government regulation   we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and ecommerce existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of our internet or ecommerce services these regulations and

international trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization we believe that we are in conformity with all applicable laws in the united states and the philippines   while we believe that our operations are in compliance with all applicable regulations there can be no assurances that from time to time unintentional violations of such regulations will not occur   cost and effects of compliance with environmental laws   compliance with federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of material into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position we believe the

the proceeds of the sale of common stock in the amount of  and repayment to related party of    cash requirements   during the year ended march   we raised  from financing activities and we had cash on hand of  as of march   as of the date of this report we have not generated any revenue from our business operations   we will require additional funds for our budgeted expenses over the next  months these funds may be raised through equity financing debt financing or other sources which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares there is still no assurance that we will be able to maintain operations at a level sufficient for an investor to obtain a return on his investment in our common stock further we may continue to be unprofitable we need to raise additional funds in the immediate future in order to proceed with our budgeted expenses   specifically based on nominal operations we estimate our operating expenses and working capital requirements for the next  months to be as follows   description   estimated expenses   general and administrative expenses        transfer agent fees        professional fees        total          we will require additional financing in order to enable us to proceed with our plan of operations as discussed above including approximately  over the next  months to pay for our ongoing expenses these expenses which will of course be higher in the event we enter into any transactions include legal accounting and audit fees as well as general and administrative expenses these cash requirements are in excess of our current cash and working capital resources accordingly we will require additional financing in order to continue operations and to repay our liabilities there is no assurance that any party will advance additional funds to us in order to enable us to sustain our plan of operations or to repay our liabilities   we anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders there is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities   we presently do not have any arrangements for additional financing for the expansion of our exploration operations and no potential lines of credit or sources of financing are currently available for the purpose of proceeding with our plan of operations        table of contents   contractual obligations   as a “smaller reporting company” we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations   going concern   our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations andor obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due we intend to finance operating costs over the next twelve months through continued financial support from our shareholders and private placements of common stock   offbalance sheet arrangements   we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or

principles used in the united states of america us gaap   use of estimates   in preparing financial statements in conformity with us gaap management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made however actual results could differ materially from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid shortterm deposits which are unrestricted as to withdrawal and use and which have maturities of three months or less when purchased   fair value of financial instruments   asc  fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value establishes a threelevel valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures the three levels are defined as follows   level   inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets   level   inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instruments   level   inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value        table of contents   our companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and accrued liabilities it is managements opinion that the carrying values are a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and if applicable their stated interest rate

should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   management believes that the current actions to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plans provide the opportunity for

ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the securities exchange act of  is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified

report on internal control over financial reporting   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule af under the securities exchange act of  management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of march   based on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission as a result of this assessment management concluded that as of march   our internal control over financial reporting was not effective our management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which are indicative of many small companies with small staff i inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment and ii insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both us gaap and sec guidelines   we plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this annual report on form k we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above to remediate such weaknesses we hope to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending april   i appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management and ii adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting the remediation efforts set out in i and ii are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required if we are unsuccessful in securing such funds remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner   this annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting

  limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls   our management including our president and our chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting are or will be capable of preventing or detecting all errors or all fraud any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns may occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk   item b other information
