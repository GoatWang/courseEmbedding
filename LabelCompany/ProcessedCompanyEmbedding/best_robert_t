password sign up invest in systems not products written by robert kiyosaki  tuesday april   read time three benefits of focusing on the bi triangle as an entrepreneur and investor many people come to me excited about a new product idea that they believe is truly innovative and worth investing in my response is that the world is full of great products many people also come to me thinking that their product is the best better than any other existing product on the market this they think also makes it worth investing in my response is that only those in the e employee and s selfemployed quadrant of the cashflow quadrant where being the best or highest quality is important for success think that having the best product is most important in the b big business and i investor quadrant however the most important thing is the system behind the product or idea case in point most of us can cook a better hamburger than mcdonald’s but few of us can build a better business system rich dad said “the product is the least important piece to inspect when evaluating a business” he believed that a truly successful business was built on systems and that the product didn’t have to be the best if the systems were world class it still had to be good just not the best that is why he always placed product in the smallest portion of the bi triangle his model for building the most successful businesses the bi triangle as a whole represents a strong system of systems supported by a team with a leader all working towards a common mission i would like to highlight three important points about why the bi triangle is important money always follows management if any of the management functions of the bi triangle’s five internal levels cash flow communications systems legal and product are weak the company will be weak if you are personally having financial difficulty or not having the excess cash flow you desire you can often find the weak spots by analyzing each level once you identify your weakness you may then want to consider turning it into your strength or hiring someone else with that strength some of the best investments and businesses are the ones you walk away from if any of the five levels in the bi triangle are weak and the management is not prepared to strengthen them it is best to walk away from the investment too many times i have discussed the five levels of the bi triangle with a management team with which i am considering investing and i hear arguments instead of discussion when business owners or business teams are weak in any of the five levels they will become defensive rather than receptive to questioning if they do become defensive rather than excited to identify and correct a weakness i usually walk away the digital age makes the bi triangle available to everyone it has never been easier to access great wealth than in today’s day and age in the industrial age you needed millions of dollars to build a car factory today with a used computer some brainpower a phone and a little education in each of the five aspects of the bi triangle the world can be yours if you want to build your own business there has never been a better time for success i recently met a young man who sold his small internet company to a major software maker for  million all he said to me was “i made  million at the age of  how much will i make when i am ” if you want to be a successful entrepreneur who builds successful businesses or invests in them the entire bi triangle must be strong and interdependent if it is the businesses will grow and flourish the good news is that if you are a team player you don’t have to be an expert at every level just become part of a winning team with a clear vision a strong mission and an iron stomach find that and you’ll be well on your way to success latest rich dad blog posts why you should encourage kids to be rule breakers posted on tuesday july    things every woman should know about starting a business
