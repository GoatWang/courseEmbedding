such issues were readily severable from challenge to agencys conduct of misleading discussions the only issue found to be clearly meritorious at government accountability office outcome prediction alternative dispute resolution conferencedecision odle management group llc omg requests that we recommend that it be reimbursed the costs associated with filing and pursuing its bid protest against the department of labors dol award of a contract to chp international under solicitation no doljua for outreach and admissions and career training services  we grant omgs request in part and deny it in part omg initially protested the agencys award of a contract to chp arguing that the agency misevaluated proposals and made an unreasonable best value source selection decision omg also asserted that the agency misled it during discussions specifically the agency advised omg during discussions that its proposed staffing appeared to be high in response to the agencys discussion question omg lowered its proposed staffing and the agency ultimately identified omgs proposed staffing as a weakness subsequent to the development of the record including the filing of an agency report and receipt of comments our office conducted an outcome prediction alternative dispute resolution adr conference in the course of that adr the cognizant government accountability office gao attorney advised the agency that gao likely would sustain omgs protest on the basis that the agency had misled omg during discussions the gao attorney recommended that the agency reopen discussions obtain and evaluate revised proposals and make a new source selection decision because our recommendation involved the agency reopening the acquisition we did not reach the merits of omgs other issues in response to the adr dol advised our office that it intended to take corrective action in particular the agency advised that it would reopen discussions with the competitive range offerors obtain and evaluate revised proposals and make a new source selection decision based on the agencys proposed corrective action we dismissed omgs protest as academic b may   in response to omgs request for reimbursement dol concedes that the protester is entitled to a recommendation that it be reimbursed its protest costs agency report at  the agency argues however that omgs recovery should be limited to those costs that were incurred in connection with its allegation relating to misleading discussions according to the agency although we found this aspect of the protest to be clearly meritorious as evidenced by the view expressed during the adr we did not find the remainder of omgs allegations clearly meritorious the agency further maintains that the facts and legal theories underpinning omgs misleading discussions argument are distinct from the facts and legal theories underpinning the remainder of its protest such that the costs incurred in connection with the former allegation are clearly severable from the costs incurred in connection with the latter allegations we agree with the agency that reimbursement of omgs protest costs should be confined to the costs incurred in connection with its misleading discussions issue as noted by the agency and as reflected in the views of the gao attorney expressed during the adr the only protest issue that we found clearly meritorious was that of misleading discussions although as a general rule we may recommend that a successful protester be reimbursed its incurred costs with respect to all issues pursued and not merely those upon which it prevails aar aircraft servscosts b may    cpd ¶  at  in appropriate cases we have limited our recommendation for the award of protest costs where a part of those costs is allocable to an unsuccessful protest issue that is so clearly severable from the successful issues as to essentially constitute a separate protest bae tech servs inccosts b aug    cpd ¶  at  interface flooring sys incclaim for attorneys fees b july    cpd ¶  at  in determining whether protest issues are so clearly severable as to essentially constitute separate protests we consider among other things the extent to which the issues are interrelated or intertwinedie the extent to which successful and unsuccessful arguments share a common core set of facts are based on related legal theories or are otherwise not readily severable see sodexho mgmt inccosts b aug    cpd ¶  at  here omgs technical evaluation and source selection issues were not clearly intertwined with its misleading discussions issue whether the agencys evaluation of proposals and source selection decision were reasonable concern legal theories and underlying facts that are distinct and severable from those relevant to omgs misleading discussions issue focused mgmt inccosts b oct    cpd ¶  at  under these circumstances we conclude that omgs reimbursement of protest costs should be limited to those costs incurred in connection with its misleading discussions protest basis recommendation we recommend that omg be reimbursed the costs associated with filing and pursuing its protest on the issue of misleading discussions including reasonable attorneys fees omg should submit its certified claim detailing the time spent and costs incurred directly to the agency within  days of its receipt of this decision bid protest regulations  cfr § f  the request is granted in part and denied in part lynn h gibsongeneral counsel in its initial submission omg also requested that we recommend that it be
