computer visionedit shutterstock has developed a number of tools utilizing a convolutional neural network that it created to help with reverse image search technology the network is essentially a computer system that is trained to recognize images  there are millions of specific items such as cats bicycles the night sky  and pull up the most relevant photos the network was dubbed computer vision by shutterstock and it breaks down the key components of a photo numerically drawing from its pixel data instead of metadata that is pulled from those tags and keywords so a lot of image databases fill in those gaps with user behavior if people searching the words bike and fence download a particular image more often that one probably contains those two things in it computer vision like shutterstocks can change all that by eliminating the need for keywords in the first place using a series of algorithms a model can progressively survey each pixel in an image to pick out different features in it—the color the shapes the sharpness of the angles each calculation is a layer of the deep learning network — popular science march   on march   shutterstock debuted its reverse image search tool according to entrepreneur with the tool users can upload an image either from shutterstock or another source and the tool will call up images that look like and have a similar feel to the original photo the reverse image search allows users to not just search by keywords but to also find images based on color schemes mood or shapes later that month shutterstock also debuted its similar search and discovery tools with the similar search option provided beneath photos on the shutterstock website see alsoedit photography portal new york portal list of stock footage libraries

of my credit card information so i called shutter stock to recieve my full refund for the two transactions that were processed   when i called shutter stock they told me they noticed that account was a fraudulent account and had suspicious activity so they flagged it and refunded the money back on to the card the following day which would have been  november  they refunded the money before i had called them about my complaint about the chargers that were made and now iv called them about  times and they keep asking me for my credit card information and on their automated call directory it says for billing department press  and i have spoken to the same person everytime which is weird to me and they wont send me a confirmation of the refund and when they say i will talk to my billion team to get his refund sorted out  they hang up on me and still no refund or confirmation that a refund was issued to my account im sure if i called and pressed the number four to be transferred to the billing department it would send me directly to them but it doesnt i speak to the same woman named  and two times iv spoken to someone named  and nothing has been done because iv called my bank  times to see if there was anything processing going in to my account and they said nothin has been processed  i am sick of the run around and they are being unprofessional and not giving me my money

has been resolved sincerely     mark as useful marked as useful  votes reply satisfaction rating  reviewer  review the shutterstockcom website has a glitch it says that i downloaded  clips when in reality i have only downloaded four i am asking for a substitute th clip to resolve this i spoke with two customer service reps  and  and one   who were unwilling to honor the fact that there was a glitch and i didnt download a th clip in a  clip purchase heres a little background on day one i purchased a license to download five clips i put then selected download for each of the five clips which put them into a sort of shopping cart next to each clip was a red download button at the top left of the page was the option to download all of the five clips i selected the download all button for these five clips up popped an option to place these  clips into a third party dropbox when this dialogue to place them in the dropbox appeared i declined none of the  clips at this point were downloaded they were placed into a download history folder on the same original screen with individual download buttons and the download all button i individually downloaded four of the five clips i never downloaded the th clip the reason i never downloaded the th clip is that i was unsure that my client would want this and i wanted to come back on day two and download a th clip either the original or another that i had downloaded a comp image to run by my client the license has a duration of one year so at this point i have downloaded  images in the  image package on day two the client indicated that he wanted the comp image i never showed him the original th clip that we were considering so i went back to shutterstock to get the th clip anticipating that since i had only downloaded four of the five clips that i could get a substitute th clip when i went to check out after having logged in the website says i needed to pay  for this th clip i stopped my edit and called shutterstock i talked with  about  pm eastern he informed me that because i had used the select all button that the  original clips were now in my download history and that i had all  clips reality is that i had only downloaded four clips i asked to speak to a  and was told that i would be put into a cue and a  would call me back i waited  minutes i called back at  pm eastern and spoke with  i told him that i had previously spoken to  and what had happened the glitch with the download all button specifically that i declined putting them into the third party dropbox and never downloaded them  stated that i had access to all five clips in the download history therefore i couldnt substitute a th clip even though i still have not downloaded the th clip i asked to speak to his   mentioned that all the s go home at  pm eastern and that i would receive a callback on friday morning this is day one or thursday i waited until  am friday to receive a call from  a  at shutterstock  had listened to one or both of my recordings and instructed me that since i had hit the download all button and that the  clips were in my download history regardless of whether i had possession of the downloads and regardless of the glitch that when declining to place all  images from the download all option into a third party dropbox i still dont have a th clip as of right now i do not have a th clip i am asking shutterstock to honor the download of a th clip when i spoke with the   and asked to speak to his  he denied assisting me he told me that there was no one higher to talk with so i am contacting the revdexcom and asking for resolutiondesired settlement i would like to have access to download a substitute th clip  value instead of the original clip that was never downloaded and since i have

contacted shutterstock three times over the course of the next two days i explained the problem and mentioned i was on a tight deadline the deadline came and passed before anyone got back to me finally on day three someone named   responded to tell me the company does not give refunds when photos have been downloaded i attempted to explain to   that i never received the photos as paid for in

complaint promptly upon receiving the complaint shutterstock investigated this matter  on or about november  the complainant created a shutterstock account and downloaded two images complainant contacted shutterstock that same day and stated that he could not access his downloaded images shutterstock responded the same day and advised the complainant that the images were available for redownload at his convenience unfortunately it appears the complainant did not redownload the images and used an alternative service due to what he perceived as a time delay on the part of shutterstock on november  shutterstock reviewed this matter and issued a full refund for  which is the total value of the two licensed images shutterstock sent the complainant an email to confirm the refund on november shutterstock believes this matter is fully resolved  please do not hesitate to contact me if you need any further information best  consumer response i have reviewed the response made by the business in reference to complaint id and have determined that my complaint has not been resolved because the account of events is entirely fictitious shutterstock absolutely did not respond the same day i even have another email from their company acknowledging this apparently its company policy to tell fibs in any event the company has finally refunded the fee i was charged for the product they did not deliver thank you       in order for the revdexcom to appropriately process your response you must answer the question above sincerely     business response dear   we are writing in further response to complaint no  the complaint shutterstock has endeavored to respond to complainants complaint quickly and amicably and is disappointed that complainant does not view this matter as resolved particularly as he received his desired settlement in full see complaint wherein the complainant stated im asking for a refund of the  i was charged for photos i didnt receive notwithstanding the complete resolution of this matter pursuant to complainants request the complainant remains dissatisfied by what the complainant claims is fibs told by shutterstock while shutterstock does not normally disclose its customer communications we are providing a copy of the complainants november  correspondence in order to corroborate shutterstocks initial response see attached exhibit a the complete chronology of complainants correspondence with shutterstock is as followsnovember complainant contacted shutterstock identifying his issue with downloading images and requesting assistancenovember shutterstock responded and informed the complainant that he may redownload his content for a period of time following the initial download this is the same day response to which shutterstock referred in its earlier response in this matter november complainant sent a second email and stated that he still could not access the content november complainant sent a third email and stated that he had not received assistancenovember shutterstock redownloaded the content and attempted to provide it to complainant directly november complainant responded and stated that due to the delay he used another service and would not be using the contentnovember shutterstock issued a refund to the complainant as requestedfollowing our further review of the correspondence we believe that the discrepancy may be due to a time zone issue as it appears that complainant sent his initial email late on november his time so it appears from shutterstock records that it was actually sent on november accordingly complainant believes that shutterstock is not being truthful when it states that shutterstock responded the same day notwithstanding that discrepancy complainant is correct that there was a delay in shutterstocks second response as noted shutterstock refunded the complainants purchase in full and believes that this matter is fully resolvedplease do not

service was cancelled on  my credit card was charged i have sent emails asking why and that they need to issue a credit to my credit card asap no reply i tried to call shutterstock for a phone number to be able to talk to someone shutterstock said they arent responsible and they would have to have a manager call me back they would not let me speak to a manager while i was on the phone the person taking my call did not speak english very well this company solicited me to try a service for free but that is not the case i want a credit applied to my credit card asapdesired settlement credit card refund asap as well as the phone number to contact the people responsible for skillfeed consumer response complaint id  after letting the company know that i had filed a complaint with the revdexcom i

response i am writing in response to the present complaint upon receiving the complaint shutterstock promptly investigated this matter the complainant has been an active customer of shutterstock since january  and has made a number of purchases for the complainants most recent subscription which was purchased on or about june   shutterstock issued a refund on june   immediately upon receiving the complainants request concerning the autorenewing subscriptionhowever complainants request for a second refund concerns a subscription that dates back to  and under which the complainant has downloaded approximately  images the complainant actively used the subscription and did not appear to dispute the charges or contact shutterstock concerning a potential issue moreover the complainant continued to download under that subscription as recently as june   if the complainant can demonstrate that he sought to cancel the subscription and did not continue to use it shutterstock would consider refunding the amount of the subscription in the event that shutterstock does provide a refund all licenses issued for content downloaded under that subscription will be invalid we are happy to investigate this matter further upon receiving additional information from the complainantbest regardsheidiassistant general counselshutterstock inc mark as useful marked as useful  votes reply

each video they have a comp download which is the video that they are selling but it has a watermark on it to prevent you from using it so its essentially a free sample i found a video that i liked and i downloaded the comp download and it was exactly what i was looking for the resolution was good there was no video flickering and the file size was only mb the file size for this is very important because many people are using these for web purposes and you cant have visitors trying to download a mb file each time they visit your website so i purchased the video labelled web this was a mb file version which is the smallest available for purchase logic would dictate that the mb file would be of better quality than the mb file right very very wrong it was unusable extremely distorted and heavy flickering on top of that while it was labeled as web it was in mov format which is not web compatible so i complained to shutterstock and they told me that the comp download was actually the hd version of the video which costs more and not the web version that would be fine except that the hd version is mb so not even their hd product matches the free sample the free sample is high res  low file size but the available products are only one or the other i felt very deceived by this i was offered a refund but thats not the point the point is that they are misleading people if they offer a free sample they need to sell the product they are handing out as it is not intentionally degraded itdesired settlement i want the comp download as it was but without the watermark thats it simple give me the product that you sold me on and that i paid for id gladly pay the full  for it i also want all comp downloads to match the product offered so that others are not deceived into purchasing a poor product like i was business response dear  shutterstock inc shutterstock is hereby responding to revdexcom complaint  the complaint promptly upon receiving the complaint shutterstock investigated this matter  we will first provide background about shutterstocks process for licensing clips of this nature including socalled comps when a customer elects to download a comp the resolution size is not listed on the download page because these sizes vary after the clip is downloaded the customer can see the resolution if the customer then elects to license the clip he must do so by selecting an option from the licensing page where the resolution is clearly set forth ie hd sd or web the customer can also see the resolution listed when the clip is downloaded in this instance the resolution of the comp clip is in between the sd and the web size when the complainant contacted shutterstock about this issue he was given a full refund for the purchase with which he was not satisfied in the event the complainant would be satisfied by licensing the sd version of the clip shutterstock could provide that but would not be able to provide it at the lower file size furthermore the comp clip at the size the complainant prefers is not available without a watermark and it is not technically feasible to provide it to the complainantin an effort to resolve this matter i reached out to the complainant on or about may   i left him a voicemail and requested that he call me so that we could discuss the best resolution shutterstock would like to work with the complainant to provide a satisfactory clip to the extent it is technically possible to date i have not heard back from the complainant but shutterstock remains open and available to resolving this
