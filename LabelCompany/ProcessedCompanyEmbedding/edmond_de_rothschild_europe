paris frankfurt vienna and naples during the th century the rothschild family possessed the largest private fortune in the world as well as the largest private fortune in modern world history the

german zum rothen schild with the old spelling th meaning with the red sign in reference to the house where the family lived for many generations at the time houses were designated by signs with different symbols or colours not numbers the familys ascent to international prominence began in  with the birth of mayer amschel rothschild in frankfurt am main germany he was the son of amschel moses rothschild born circa  a money changer who had traded with the prince of hesse born in the judengasse the ghetto of frankfurt mayer developed a finance house and spread his empire by installing each of his five sons in the five main european financial centres to conduct business the rothschild coat of arms contains a clenched fist with five arrows symbolising the five dynasties established by the five sons of mayer rothschild in a reference to psalm  like arrows in the hands of a warrior so are the children of ones youth the family motto appears below the shield concordia integritas industria unity integrity industry paul johnson writes the rothschilds are elusive there is no book about them that is both revealing and accurate libraries of nonsense have been written about them a woman who planned to write a book entitled lies about the rothschilds abandoned it saying ‘it was relatively easy to spot the lies but it proved impossible to find out the truth’ he writes that unlike the court jews of earlier centuries who had financed and managed european noble houses but often lost their wealth through violence or expropriation the new kind of international bank created by the rothschilds was impervious to local attacks their assets were held in financial instruments circulating through the world as stocks bonds and debts changes made by the rothschilds allowed them to insulate their property from local violence henceforth their real wealth was beyond the reach of the mob almost beyond the reach of greedy monarchs johnson argued that their fortune was generated to the greatest extent by nathan mayer rothschild in london however more recent research by niall ferguson indicates that greater and equal profits also were realised by the other rothschild dynasties including james mayer de rothschild in paris carl mayer von rothschild in naples and amschel mayer rothschild in frankfurt another essential part of mayer rothschilds strategy for success was to keep control of their banks in family hands allowing them to maintain full secrecy about the size of their fortunes in about  the jewish encyclopedia noted the practice initiated by the rothschilds of having several brothers of a firm establish branches in the different financial centres was followed by other jewish financiers like the bischoffsheims pereires seligmans lazards and others and these financiers by their integrity and financial skill obtained credit not alone with their jewish confrères but with the banking fraternity in general by this means jewish financiers obtained an increasing share of international finance during the middle and last quarter of the th century the head of the whole group was the rothschild family it also states of more recent years nonjewish financiers have learned the same cosmopolitan method and on the whole the control is now rather less than more in jewish hands than formerly mayer rothschild successfully kept the fortune in the family with carefully arranged marriages often between first or secondcousins similar to royal intermarriage by the late th century however almost all rothschilds had started to marry outside the family usually into the aristocracy or other financial dynasties his sons were amschel mayer rothschild – frankfurt died childless fortune passed to sons of salomon and calmann salomon mayer

during the second world war the brothers helped coordinate rothschild activities across the continent and the family developed a network of agents shippers and couriers to transport gold across wartorn europe the family network was also to provide nathan rothschild time and again with political and financial information ahead of his peers giving him an advantage in the markets and rendering the house of rothschild still more invaluable to the british government in one instance the family network enabled nathan to receive in london the news of wellingtons victory at the battle of waterloo a full day ahead of the governments official messengers rothschilds first concern on this occasion was not to the potential financial advantage on the market which the knowledge would have given him he and his courier immediately took the news to the government it was then repeated in later popular accounts such as that of morton the basis for the rothschilds most famously profitable move was made after the news of british victory had been made public nathan rothschild calculated that the future reduction in government borrowing brought about by the peace would create a bounce in british government bonds after a twoyear stabilisation which would finalise the postwar restructuring of the domestic economy in what has been described as one of the most audacious moves in financial history nathan immediately bought up the government bond market for what at the time seemed an excessively high price before waiting two years then selling the bonds on the crest of a short bounce in the market in  for a  profit given the sheer power of leverage the rothschild family had at their disposal this profit was an enormous sum nathan mayer rothschild started his business in manchester in

the neogothic castle de haar in the words of the daily telegraph this multinational banking family is a byword for wealth power – and discretion the rothschild name has become synonymous with money and power to a degree that perhaps no other family has ever matched the neogothic rothschildschloss waidhofen writing of the rockefeller and rothschild families harry mount writes that is what makes these two dynasties so exceptional – not just their dizzying wealth but the fact that they have held on to it for so long and not just the loot but also their family companies the story of the rothschild family has been featured in a number of films the  hollywood film titled the house of rothschild starring george arliss and loretta young recounted the life of mayer amschel rothschild and nathan mayer rothschild both played by arliss excerpts from this film were incorporated into the nazi propaganda film der ewige jude the eternal jew without the permission of the copyright holder

rothschild name is mentioned by aldous huxley in his novel brave new world among many names of historically affluent persons scientific innovators and others the character named morgana rothschild played a relatively minor role in the story the name rothschild used as a synonym for extreme wealth inspired the song if i were a rich man which is based on a song from the tevye the dairyman stories written in the yiddish as ven ikh bin rotshild meaning if i were a rothschild in france the word rothschild was throughout the th and th centuries a synonym for seemingly endless wealth neogothic styles and epicurean glamour the family also has lent its name to le goût rothschild a suffocatingly glamorous style of interior decoration whose elements include neorenaissance palaces extravagant use of velvet and gilding vast collections of armour and sculpture a sense of victorian horror vacui and the highest masterworks of art le goût rothschild has much influenced designers such as robert denning yves saint laurent vincent fourcade and others yes my dear fellow it all amounts to this in order to do something first you must be something we think dante great and he had a civilization of centuries behind him the house of rothschild is rich and it has required much more than one generation to attain such wealth such things all lie much deeper than one thinks — johann wolfgang goethe october  conspiracy theories see also list of conspiracy theories § antisemitic conspiracy theories and antisemitic canard § accusations of controlling the world financial system over more than two centuries the rothschild family has frequently been the subject of conspiracy theories these theories take differing forms such as claiming that the family controls the worlds wealth and financial institutions or encouraged or discouraged wars between governments discussing this and similar views the historian niall ferguson wrote as we have seen however wars tended to hit the price of existing bonds by increasing the risk that a debtor state would fail to meet its interest payments in the event of defeat and losses of territory by the middle of the th century the rothschilds had evolved from traders into fund managers carefully tending to their own vast portfolio of government bonds now having made their money they stood to lose more than they gained from conflict the rothschilds had decided the outcome of the napoleonic wars by putting their financial weight behind britain now they would sit on the sidelines these conspiracy theories about the rothschild family are not based on evidence but rather arise from antisemitic prejudice and various antisemitic canards prominent descendants of mayer amschel rothschild see also genealogy of the rothschild family prominent lineal

in peter knight conspiracy theories in american history an encyclopedia abcclio p  this new economic antisemitism issued in a variety of fullblown conspiracy theories in the s through the s in these conspiracy theories all the perceived evils of modern capitalism and industrialism were ascribed to jews  and on a more precise level because of the purported machinations of identifiable jewish

born in  the name is derived from the german zum rothen schild with the old spelling th meaning with the red sign in reference to the house where the family lived for many generations at the time houses were designated by signs with different symbols or colours not numbers the familys ascent to international prominence began in  with the birth of mayer amschel rothschild in frankfurt am main germany he was the son of amschel moses rothschild born circa  a money changer who had traded with the prince of hesse born in the judengasse the ghetto of frankfurt mayer developed a finance house and spread his empire by installing each of his five sons in the five main european financial centres to conduct business the rothschild coat of arms contains a clenched fist with five arrows symbolising the five dynasties established by the five sons of mayer rothschild in a reference to psalm  like arrows in the hands of a warrior so are the children of ones youth the family motto appears below the shield concordia integritas industria unity integrity industry paul johnson writes the rothschilds are elusive there is no book about them that is both revealing and accurate libraries of nonsense have been written about them a woman who planned to write a book entitled lies about the rothschilds abandoned it saying ‘it was relatively easy to spot the lies but it proved impossible to find out the truth’ he writes that unlike the court jews of earlier centuries who had financed and managed european noble houses but often lost their wealth through violence or expropriation the new kind of international bank created by the rothschilds was impervious to local attacks their assets were held in financial instruments circulating through the world as stocks bonds and debts changes made by the rothschilds allowed them to insulate their property from local violence henceforth their real wealth was beyond the reach of the mob almost beyond the reach of greedy monarchs johnson argued that their fortune was generated to the greatest extent by nathan mayer rothschild in london however more recent research by niall ferguson indicates that greater and equal profits also were realised by the other rothschild dynasties including james mayer de rothschild in paris carl mayer von rothschild in naples and amschel mayer rothschild in frankfurt another essential part of mayer rothschilds strategy for success was to keep control of their banks in family hands allowing them to maintain full secrecy about the size of their fortunes in about  the jewish encyclopedia noted the practice initiated by the rothschilds of having several brothers of a firm establish branches in the different financial centres was followed by other jewish financiers like the bischoffsheims pereires seligmans lazards and others and these financiers by their integrity and financial skill obtained credit not alone with their jewish confrères but with the banking fraternity in general by this means jewish financiers obtained an increasing share of international finance during the middle and last quarter of the th century the head of the whole group was the rothschild family it also states of more recent years nonjewish financiers have learned the same cosmopolitan method and on the whole the control is now rather less than more in jewish hands than formerly mayer rothschild successfully kept the fortune in the family with carefully arranged marriages often between first or secondcousins similar to royal intermarriage by the late th century however almost all rothschilds had started to marry outside the family usually into the aristocracy or other financial dynasties his sons were amschel mayer rothschild – frankfurt died childless fortune passed to sons of salomon and calmann salomon mayer rothschild – vienna nathan mayer rothschild – london calmann mayer rothschild – naples jakob mayer rothschild – paris the german family name rothschild is

palais rothschild were torn down during the second world war the brothers helped coordinate rothschild activities across the continent and the family developed a network of agents shippers and couriers to transport gold across wartorn europe the family network was also to provide nathan rothschild time and again with political and financial information ahead of his peers giving him an advantage in the markets and rendering the house of rothschild still more invaluable to the british government in one instance the family network enabled nathan to receive in london the news of wellingtons victory at the battle of waterloo a full day ahead of the governments official messengers rothschilds first concern on this occasion was not to the potential financial advantage on the market which the knowledge would have given him he and his courier immediately took the news to the government it was then repeated in later popular accounts such as that of morton the basis for the rothschilds most famously profitable move was made after the news of british victory had been made public nathan rothschild calculated that the future reduction in government borrowing brought about by the peace would create a bounce in british government bonds after a twoyear stabilisation which would finalise the postwar restructuring of the domestic economy in what has been described as one of the most audacious moves in financial history nathan immediately bought up the government bond market for what at the time seemed an excessively high price before waiting two years then selling the bonds on the crest of a short bounce in the market in  for a  profit given the sheer power of leverage the rothschild family had at their disposal this profit was an enormous sum nathan mayer

gallery of london cultural references the neogothic castle de haar in the words of the daily telegraph this multinational banking family is a byword for wealth power – and discretion the rothschild name has become synonymous with money and power to a degree that perhaps no other family has ever matched the neogothic rothschildschloss waidhofen writing of the rockefeller and rothschild families harry mount writes that is what makes these two dynasties so exceptional – not just their dizzying wealth but the fact that they have held on to it for so long and not just the loot but also their family companies the story of the rothschild family has been featured in a number of films the  hollywood film titled the house of rothschild starring george arliss and loretta young recounted the life of mayer amschel rothschild and nathan mayer rothschild both played by arliss excerpts from this film were incorporated into the nazi propaganda film der ewige jude the eternal jew without the

pears mayer rothschild is featured in diana gabaldons novel voyager as a coin seller summoned to le havre by jamie fraser to appraise coins prior to the establishment of the rothschild dynasty when mayer is in his early s the rothschild name is mentioned by aldous huxley in his novel brave new world among many names of historically affluent persons scientific innovators and others the character named morgana rothschild played a relatively minor role in the story the name rothschild used as a synonym for extreme wealth inspired the song if i were a rich man which is based on a song from the tevye the dairyman stories written in the yiddish as ven ikh bin rotshild meaning if i were a rothschild in france the word rothschild was throughout the th and th centuries a synonym for seemingly endless wealth neogothic styles and epicurean glamour the family also has lent its name to le goût rothschild a suffocatingly glamorous style of interior decoration whose elements include neorenaissance palaces extravagant use of velvet and gilding vast collections of armour and sculpture a sense of victorian horror vacui and the highest masterworks of art le goût rothschild has much influenced designers such as robert denning yves saint laurent vincent fourcade and others yes my dear fellow it all amounts to this in order to do something first you must be something we think dante great and he had a civilization of centuries behind him the house of rothschild is rich and it has required much more than one generation to attain such wealth such things all lie much deeper than one thinks — johann wolfgang goethe october  conspiracy theories see also list of conspiracy theories § antisemitic conspiracy theories and antisemitic canard § accusations of controlling the world financial system over more than two centuries the rothschild family has frequently been the subject of conspiracy theories these theories take differing forms such as claiming that the family controls the worlds wealth and financial institutions or encouraged or discouraged wars between governments discussing this and similar views the historian niall ferguson wrote as we have seen however wars tended to hit the price of existing bonds by increasing the risk that a debtor state would fail to meet its interest payments in the event of defeat and losses of territory by the middle of the th century the rothschilds had evolved from traders into fund managers carefully tending to their own vast portfolio of government bonds now having made their money they stood to lose more than they gained from conflict the rothschilds had decided the outcome of the napoleonic wars by putting their financial weight behind britain now they would sit on the sidelines these conspiracy theories about the rothschild family are not based on evidence but rather arise from antisemitic prejudice and various antisemitic canards prominent descendants of mayer amschel rothschild see also genealogy of the

banking family through his five sons who established themselves in london paris frankfurt vienna and naples during the th century the rothschild family possessed the largest private fortune in the world as well as the largest private fortune in modern world history the familys wealth was divided among various descendants and today their interests cover a diverse range of fields including

was izaak elchanan rothschild born in  the name is derived from the german zum rothen schild with the old spelling th meaning with the red sign in reference to the house where the family lived for many generations at the time houses were designated by signs with different symbols or colours not numbers the familys ascent to international prominence began in  with the birth of mayer amschel rothschild in frankfurt am main germany he was the son of amschel moses rothschild born circa  a money changer who had traded with the prince of hesse born in the judengasse the ghetto of frankfurt mayer developed a finance house and spread his empire by installing each of his five sons in the five main european financial centres to conduct business the rothschild coat of arms contains a clenched fist with five arrows symbolising the five dynasties established by the five sons of mayer rothschild in a reference to psalm  like arrows in the hands of a warrior so are the children of ones youth the family motto appears below the shield concordia integritas industria unity integrity industry paul johnson writes the rothschilds are elusive there is no book about them that is both revealing and accurate libraries of nonsense have been written about them a woman who planned to write a book entitled lies about the rothschilds abandoned it saying ‘it was relatively easy to spot the lies but it proved impossible to find out the truth’ he writes that unlike the court jews of earlier centuries who had financed and managed european noble houses but often lost their wealth through violence or expropriation the new kind of international bank created by the rothschilds was impervious to local attacks their assets were held in financial instruments circulating through the world as stocks bonds and debts changes made by the rothschilds allowed them to insulate their property from local violence henceforth their real wealth was beyond the reach of the mob almost beyond the reach of greedy monarchs johnson argued that their fortune was generated to the greatest extent by nathan mayer rothschild in london however more recent research by niall ferguson indicates that greater and equal profits also were realised by the other rothschild dynasties including james mayer de rothschild in paris carl mayer von rothschild in naples and amschel mayer rothschild in frankfurt another essential part of mayer rothschilds strategy for success was to keep control of their banks in family hands allowing them to maintain full secrecy about the size of their fortunes in about  the jewish encyclopedia noted the practice initiated by the rothschilds of having several brothers of a firm establish branches in the different financial centres was followed by other jewish financiers like the bischoffsheims pereires seligmans lazards and others and these financiers by their integrity and financial skill obtained credit not alone with their jewish confrères but with the banking fraternity in general by this means jewish financiers obtained an increasing share of international finance during the middle and last quarter of the th century the head of the whole group was the rothschild family it also states of more recent years nonjewish financiers have learned the same cosmopolitan method and on the whole the control is now rather less than more in jewish hands than formerly mayer rothschild successfully kept the fortune in the family with carefully arranged marriages often between first or secondcousins similar to royal intermarriage by the late th century however almost all rothschilds had started to marry outside the family usually into the aristocracy or other financial dynasties his sons were amschel mayer rothschild – frankfurt died childless fortune passed to sons of salomon and calmann salomon mayer rothschild – vienna nathan mayer rothschild – london calmann mayer rothschild – naples jakob mayer rothschild – paris the german family name

revealed that the rothschild family was one of the controller families of the east india company the napoleonic wars a landmark rothschild palace in frankfurt germany villa günthersburg photographed  the rothschilds already possessed a significant fortune before the start of the napoleonic wars – and the family had gained preeminence in the bullion trade by this time from london in  to  nathan mayer rothschild was instrumental in almost singlehandedly financing the british war effort organising the shipment of bullion to the duke of wellingtons armies across europe as well as arranging the payment of british financial subsidies to their continental allies in  alone the rothschilds provided £ million in  currency about £ million € million or us million today when using the retail price index and £ billion € billion or us billion when using average earnings in subsidy loans to britains continental allies one of the smaller city houses vienna a collection of far larger viennese palaces known as palais rothschild were torn down during the second world war the brothers helped coordinate rothschild activities across the continent and the family developed a network of agents shippers and couriers to transport gold across wartorn europe the family network was also to provide nathan rothschild time and again with political and financial information ahead of his peers giving him an advantage in the markets and rendering the house of rothschild still more invaluable to the british government in one instance the family network enabled nathan to receive in london the news of wellingtons victory at the battle of waterloo a full day ahead of the governments official messengers rothschilds first concern on this occasion was not to the potential financial advantage on the market which the knowledge would have given him he and his courier immediately took the news to the government it was then repeated in later popular accounts such as that of morton the basis for the rothschilds most famously profitable move was made after the news of british victory had been made public nathan rothschild calculated that the future reduction in government borrowing brought about by the peace would create a bounce in british government bonds after a twoyear stabilisation which would finalise the postwar restructuring of the domestic economy in what has been described as one of the most audacious moves in financial history nathan immediately bought up the government bond market for what at the time seemed an excessively high price before waiting two years then selling the bonds on the crest of a short bounce in the market in  for a  profit given the sheer power of leverage the rothschild family had at their disposal this profit was an enormous sum nathan mayer rothschild started his business in manchester in  and gradually moved it to london where in  he acquired the location at  new court in st swithins lane city of london where it operates today he established n m rothschild  sons in  in  he arranged a £ million equal to £ million in  loan to the prussian government and the issuing of bonds for government loans formed a mainstay of his bank’s

conspiracy theories in the s through the s in these conspiracy theories all the perceived evils of modern capitalism and industrialism were ascribed to jews  and on a more precise level because of the

the free city of frankfurt who established his banking business in the s unlike most previous court jews rothschild managed to bequeath his wealth and established an international banking family through his five sons who established themselves in london paris frankfurt vienna and naples during the th century the rothschild family possessed the largest private fortune in the world as well as the largest private fortune in modern world history the familys wealth was divided among various descendants and today their interests cover a diverse range of fields including financial services real

born in  the name is derived from the german zum rothen schild with the old spelling th meaning with the red sign in reference to the house where the family lived for many generations at the time houses were designated by signs with different symbols or colours not numbers the familys ascent to international prominence began in  with the birth of mayer amschel rothschild in frankfurt am main germany he was the son of amschel moses rothschild born circa  a money changer who had traded with the prince of hesse born in the judengasse the ghetto of frankfurt mayer developed a finance house and spread his empire by installing each of his five sons in the five main european financial centres to conduct business the rothschild coat of arms contains a clenched fist with five arrows symbolising the five dynasties established by the five sons of mayer rothschild in a reference to psalm  like arrows in the hands of a warrior so are the children of ones youth the family motto appears below the shield concordia integritas industria unity integrity industry paul johnson writes the rothschilds are elusive there is no book about them that is both revealing and accurate libraries of nonsense have been written about them a woman who planned to write a book entitled lies about the rothschilds abandoned it saying ‘it was relatively easy to spot the lies but it proved impossible to find out the truth’ he writes that unlike the court jews of earlier centuries who had financed and managed european noble houses but often lost their wealth through violence or expropriation the new kind of international bank created by the rothschilds was impervious to local attacks their assets were held in financial instruments circulating through the world as stocks bonds and debts changes made by the rothschilds allowed them to insulate their property from local violence henceforth their real wealth was beyond the reach of the mob almost beyond the reach of greedy monarchs johnson argued that their fortune was generated to the greatest extent by nathan mayer rothschild in london however more recent research by niall ferguson indicates that greater and equal profits also were realised by the other rothschild dynasties including james mayer de rothschild in paris carl mayer von rothschild in naples and amschel mayer rothschild in frankfurt another essential part of mayer rothschilds strategy for success was to keep control of their banks in family hands allowing them to maintain full secrecy about the size of their fortunes in about  the jewish encyclopedia noted the practice initiated by the rothschilds of having several brothers of a firm establish branches in the different financial centres was followed by other jewish financiers like the bischoffsheims pereires seligmans lazards and others and these financiers by their integrity and financial skill obtained credit not alone with their jewish confrères but with the banking fraternity in general by this means jewish financiers obtained an increasing share of international finance during the middle and last quarter of the th century the head of the whole group was the rothschild family it also states of more recent years nonjewish financiers have learned the same cosmopolitan method and on the whole the control is now rather less than more in jewish hands than formerly mayer rothschild successfully kept the fortune in the family with carefully arranged marriages often between first or secondcousins similar to royal intermarriage by the late th century however almost all rothschilds had started to marry outside the family usually into the aristocracy or other financial dynasties his sons were amschel mayer rothschild – frankfurt died childless fortune passed to sons

rothschild family was one of the controller families of the east india company the napoleonic wars a landmark rothschild palace in frankfurt germany villa günthersburg photographed  the rothschilds already possessed a significant fortune before the start of the napoleonic wars – and the family had gained preeminence in the bullion trade by this time from london in  to  nathan mayer rothschild was instrumental in almost singlehandedly financing the british war effort organising the shipment of bullion to the duke of wellingtons armies across europe as well as arranging the payment of british financial subsidies to their continental allies in  alone the rothschilds provided £ million in  currency about £ million € million or us million today when using the retail price index and £ billion € billion or us billion when using average earnings in subsidy loans to britains continental allies one of the smaller city houses vienna a collection of far larger viennese palaces known as palais rothschild were torn down during the second world war the brothers helped coordinate rothschild activities across the continent and the family developed a network of agents shippers and couriers to transport gold across wartorn europe the family network was also to provide nathan rothschild time and again with political and financial information ahead of his peers giving him an advantage in the markets and rendering the house of rothschild still more invaluable to the british government in one instance the family network enabled nathan to receive in london the news of wellingtons victory at the battle of waterloo a full day ahead of the governments official messengers rothschilds first concern on this occasion was not to the potential financial advantage on the market which the knowledge would have given him he and his courier immediately took the news to the government it was then repeated in later popular accounts such as that of morton the basis for the rothschilds most famously profitable move was made after the news of british victory had been made public nathan rothschild calculated that the future reduction in government borrowing brought about by the peace would create a bounce in british government bonds after a twoyear stabilisation which would finalise the postwar restructuring of the domestic economy in what has been described as one of the most audacious moves in financial history nathan immediately bought up the government bond market for what at the time seemed an excessively high price before waiting two years then selling the bonds on the crest of a short bounce in the market in  for a  profit given the sheer power of leverage the rothschild family had at their disposal this profit was an enormous sum nathan mayer rothschild started his business in manchester in  and gradually moved it to london where in  he acquired the location at  new court in st swithins lane city of london where it operates today he established n m rothschild  sons in  in  he arranged a £ million equal to £ million in  loan to the prussian government and the issuing of bonds for government loans formed a mainstay of his bank’s

financial system over more than two centuries the rothschild family has frequently been the subject of conspiracy theories these theories take differing forms such as claiming that the family controls

century the rothschilds had evolved from traders into fund managers carefully tending to their own vast portfolio of government bonds now having made their money they stood to lose more than they gained from conflict the rothschilds had decided the outcome of the napoleonic wars by putting their financial weight behind britain now they would sit on the sidelines these conspiracy theories about

through his five sons who established themselves in london paris frankfurt vienna and naples during the th century the rothschild family possessed the largest private fortune in the world as well as the largest private fortune in modern world history the familys wealth was divided among various descendants and today their interests cover a diverse range of fields including financial services real

born in  the name is derived from the german zum rothen schild with the old spelling th meaning with the red sign in reference to the house where the family lived for many generations at the time houses were designated by signs with different symbols or colours not numbers the familys ascent to international prominence began in  with the birth of mayer amschel rothschild in frankfurt am main germany he was the son of amschel moses rothschild born circa  a money changer who had traded with the prince of hesse born in the judengasse the ghetto of frankfurt mayer developed a finance house and spread his empire by installing each of his five sons in the five main european financial centres to conduct business the rothschild coat of arms contains a clenched fist with five arrows symbolising the five dynasties established by the five sons of mayer rothschild in a reference to psalm  like arrows in the hands of a warrior so are the children of ones youth the family motto appears below the shield concordia integritas industria unity integrity industry paul johnson writes the rothschilds are elusive there is no book about them that is both revealing and accurate libraries of nonsense have been written about them a woman who planned to write a book entitled lies about the rothschilds abandoned it saying ‘it was relatively easy to spot the lies but it proved impossible to find out the truth’ he writes that unlike the court jews of earlier centuries who had financed and managed european noble houses but often lost their wealth through violence or expropriation the new kind of international bank created by the rothschilds was impervious to local attacks their assets were held in financial instruments circulating through the world as stocks bonds and debts changes made by the rothschilds allowed them to insulate their property from local violence henceforth their real wealth was beyond the reach of the mob almost beyond the reach of greedy monarchs johnson argued that their fortune was generated to the greatest extent by nathan mayer rothschild in london however more recent research by niall ferguson indicates that greater and equal profits also were realised by the other rothschild dynasties including james mayer de rothschild in paris carl mayer von rothschild in naples and amschel mayer rothschild in frankfurt another essential part of mayer rothschilds strategy for success was to keep control of their banks in family hands allowing them to maintain full secrecy about the size of their fortunes in about  the jewish encyclopedia noted the practice initiated by the rothschilds of having several brothers of a firm establish branches in the different financial centres was followed by other jewish financiers like the bischoffsheims pereires seligmans lazards and others and these financiers by their integrity and financial skill obtained credit not alone with their jewish confrères but with the banking fraternity in general by this means jewish financiers obtained an increasing share of international finance during the middle and last quarter of the th century the head of the whole group was the rothschild family it also states of more recent years nonjewish financiers have learned the same cosmopolitan method and on the whole the control is now rather less than more in jewish hands than formerly mayer rothschild successfully kept the fortune in the family with carefully arranged marriages often between first or secondcousins similar to royal intermarriage by the late th century however almost all rothschilds had started to marry outside the family usually into the aristocracy or other financial dynasties his sons were amschel mayer rothschild – frankfurt died childless fortune passed to sons

palais rothschild were torn down during the second world war the brothers helped coordinate rothschild activities across the continent and the family developed a network of agents shippers and couriers to transport gold across wartorn europe the family network was also to provide nathan rothschild time and again with political and financial information ahead of his peers giving him an advantage in the markets and rendering the house of rothschild still more invaluable to the british government in one instance the family network enabled nathan to receive in london the news of wellingtons victory at the battle of waterloo a full day ahead of the governments official messengers rothschilds first concern on this occasion was not to the potential financial advantage on the market which the knowledge would have given him he and his courier immediately took the news to the government it was then repeated in later popular accounts such as that of morton the basis for the rothschilds most famously profitable move was made after the news of british victory had been made public nathan rothschild calculated that the future reduction in government borrowing brought about by the peace would create a bounce in british government bonds after a twoyear stabilisation which would finalise the postwar restructuring of the domestic economy in what has been described as one of the most audacious moves in financial history nathan immediately bought up the government bond market for what at the time seemed an excessively high price before waiting two years then selling the bonds on the crest of a short bounce in the market in  for a  profit given the sheer power of leverage the rothschild family had at their disposal this profit was an enormous sum nathan mayer rothschild started his business in manchester in  and gradually moved it to london where in  he acquired the location at  new court in st swithins lane city of london where it operates today he

named morgana rothschild played a relatively minor role in the story the name rothschild used as a synonym for extreme wealth inspired the song if i were a rich man which is based on a song from the

neorenaissance palaces extravagant use of velvet and gilding vast collections of armour and sculpture a sense of victorian horror vacui and the highest masterworks of art le goût rothschild has much influenced designers such as robert denning yves saint laurent vincent fourcade and others yes my dear fellow it all amounts to this in order to do something first you must be something we think dante

financial system over more than two centuries the rothschild family has frequently been the subject of conspiracy theories these theories take differing forms such as claiming that the family controls the worlds wealth and financial institutions or encouraged or discouraged wars between governments discussing this and similar views the historian niall ferguson wrote as we have seen however wars tended to hit the price of existing bonds by increasing the risk that a debtor state would fail to meet its interest payments in the event of defeat and losses of territory by the middle of the th century the rothschilds had evolved from traders into fund managers carefully tending to their own vast portfolio of government bonds now having made their money they stood to lose more than they gained from conflict the rothschilds had decided the outcome of the napoleonic wars by putting their financial weight behind britain now they would sit on the sidelines these conspiracy theories about

antisemitic apparent in the treatment of the rothschild family ever since the nineteenth century the rothchilds who combined jewishness financial wealth and international connections have been the epitome of the international jewish conspiracy barkun  the family name continues to feature in conspiratorial narratives to the present day although writers of the post era have tended to play down their importance   markku ruotsila  antisemitism in peter knight conspiracy theories in american history an encyclopedia abcclio p  this new economic antisemitism issued in a variety of fullblown conspiracy theories in the s through the s in these conspiracy theories all the perceived evils of modern capitalism and industrialism were ascribed to jews  and on a more precise level because of the purported machinations of identifiable jewish financiers the latter type of theories tended to center around the supposed power of the rothschild banking family and those of its us agents that were central in various reconstruction and public debt refinancing schemes after the civil war   richard allen landes and steven t katz  the paranoid apocalypse a hundredyear retrospective on the protocols of the elders of zion nyu press p   there are antisemitic claims of a vast conspiracy by jews that structurally replicate the protocols without mentioning the hoax document another way conspiracy theories try to avoid the label of antisemitic is to argue that there is a vast conspiracy by the rothschild family or the khazars or some other entity   david norman smith  antisemitism in carl skutsch encyclopedia of the worlds minorities  af routledge p  the great banking barons of the rothschild family became in antisemitic fantasy living emblems of jews everywhere  for antisemites socialism and bank capitalism are just two sides of the jewish conspiracy against order and tradition   michael streeter  behind closed doors the power and influence of secret societies new holland publishers p  when it comes to conspiracy theories and the secret societies that supposedly run out world  the finger of suspicion often points to bankers and jews  and often to jewish bankers  as the moneymen behind this world plot chief among the suspects are the rothschilds the jewish banking dynasty  yet there is little or nothing that the rothschild bankers have done that is not perfectly explicable by normal banking practices  he fact that the rothschilds feature at the centre of so many conspiracy theories is perhaps no coincidence for it is sadly the case that many claims alleging secret societies have contained more than a tinge of antisemitism   nicholas goodrickclarke  black sun aryan cults esoteric nazism and the politics of identity nyu press p  conspiracy theorist jan van helsings dubious sources his constant repetition of jewish names as members of private and public organizations and above all his emphasis on the assets and powerbroking influence of the rothschilds
