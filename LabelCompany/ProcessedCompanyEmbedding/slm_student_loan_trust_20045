takes various rating actions on slm student loan trust  notes june    pm eastern daylight time new yorkbusiness wirefitch ratings takes the following rating actions on slm student loan trust series  slm  senior and subordinate notes class a notes affirmed at aaasf outlook stable class a notes affirmed at aaasf outlook stable class a notes at aaasf rating watch negative maintained class b notes affirmed at bbbsf outlook stable the rating watch negative action on the class a notes of the slm  trust is due to their inability to pass cash flow stresses necessary to maintain their current ratings of aaasf on dec   fitch released its exposure draft which delineates revisions it plans to make to the rating us federal family education loan program student loan abs criteria dated june   this transaction was reviewed under both the existing criteria and exposure draft fitch expects to resolve the rating watch negative status once its revised ffelp criteria report is published key rating drivers collateral quality the trust collateral consists of  of federal family education loan program ffelp loans the credit quality of the trust collateral is high in fitchs opinion based on the guarantees provided by the transactions eligible guarantors and reinsurance provided by the us department of education ed for at least  of principal and accrued interest fitch currently rates the us aaa with a stable outlook credit enhancement credit enhancement ce is provided by overcollateralization oc the excess of trusts asset balance over bond balance excess spread and for the senior notes subordination is provided by the subordinate notes as of march  senior and subordinate parities are   ce and  respectively the trust may release cash as long as the total parity of  is maintained liquidity support liquidity support is provided by a debt service reserve account sized at the greater of  of the pool balance and  as of march  the debt service reserve account is sized at  servicing capabilities navient solutions inc formerly sallie mae inc as servicer will be responsible for the day to day servicing of the portfolio fitch believes navient solutions to be an acceptable servicer of ffelp student loans in certain libordown interest rate stress scenarios the basis spread may be compressed as fitch would apply a floor to month libor at a negative rate level in accordance with fitchs criteria for interest rate stresses in structured finance transactions and covered bonds dated may  since the updated interest rate stresses are not addressed yet in existing ffelp criteria this represents a criteria variation use of the criteria variation did not have a measurable impact upon the ratings assigned under fitchs counterparty criteria for structured finance and covered bonds dated may   fitch looks to its own ratings in analysing counterparty risk and assessing a counterpartys creditworthiness the definition of permitted investments for this deal allows possibility of using investments not rated by fitch which represents a criteria variation since the only available funds to invest in are those held in the collection account and the funds can only be invested for a short duration of three months given the payment frequency of the notes fitch doesnt believe such variation has a measurable impact upon the ratings assigned rating sensitivities since ffelp student loan abs rely on the us government to reimburse defaults aaasf ffelp abs ratings will likely move in tandem with the aaa us sovereign rating aside from the us sovereign rating defaults basis risk and loan extension risk account for the majority of the risk embedded in ffelp student loan transactions additional defaults basis shock beyond fitchs published stresses lower than expected payment speed and other factors could result in future downgrades likewise a buildup of ce driven by positive excess spread given favorable basis factor conditions could lead to future upgrades due
