conversation research can help discover new product linesone of the first case studies of conversation research i can remember is when listerine used social listening tools to find out what their customers said about their product they discovered that many talked about the taste and burn in using it but also that people sometimes use it to fight toenail fungus while that may sound funny it’s no joke when you’re a brand manager and seeking to create new revenue streams for your company could listerine have repackaged the formula as an application to help fight toenail fungus perhaps whether or not they did isn’t the point the point is are you looking at your customer’s conversations online to discover insights like use cases which can help your product team develop better or even different products we took a close look at dirt devil recently not because they’re a client but we wanted to run some tests on a consumer product that wasn’t difficult to distinguish from similarly named products we easily weeded out references to the weather anomaly and offroad race course and race truck by the same name these are the use cases we discovered pet hair hair college dorms and hardwood floors were expected but look some of the others an air pump for blacksmithing that might be a new product idea sticker removal that’s interesting beekeeping okay maybe a little weird but what if you dive into the conversation and discover that the lower power handheld vacs are able to remove bees from honeycombs without harming them and beekeepers everywhere would pay for one with larger receptacles if you’re only looking at word clouds and pie graphs of themes sentiments and genders you’re not seeing the fullness of the conversation from a product innovation and feature enhancement standpoint conversation research can be a treasure trove of opportunity and eventually treasure itself and as an aside none of this type of conversation research is available using just software these conversations about dirt devil were filtered and coded by hand okay by hands on a computer but you don’t get use cases for products as an output of automatic or algorithmic topic surfacing are you ready to do some product innovation research with cri drop us a line we’d be glad to chat categories case studies conversation research events social technology uncategorized
