an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk investors should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this annual report before making an investment decision if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could suffer in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment investors should read the section entitled “cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements” above for a discussion of what types of statements are forwardlooking statements as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this annual report   risks related to our business and financial condition   there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern   historically we had limited historical related party revenues have suffered recurring losses from operations and have working capital deficiency of  as of december   further losses are anticipated in the development of our business therefore our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our completion of a future financing however there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing such a financing if we are unable to fund future operations by way of financing including public or private offerings of equity or debt securities our business financial condition and exploration activities will be adversely impacted as a result there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern   the audit opinion and notes that accompany our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   refer to the substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty we do not have sufficient cash to fund planned operations or meet our obligations for the next  months without raising additional funds   because we have a very limited operating history investors have little basis to evaluate our ability to operate    our activities to date have been focused on raising capital funds and we have not generated any revenues from our business consequently we face all of the risks commonly encountered by businesses that lack an established operating history including the need for additional capital personnel and intense competition there is no assurance that our business plan will be successful   if the company does not manage growth effectively the company’s business could be harmed   resource infrastructure and a significant sales plan will be required to realize the company’s growth strategy operations growth will place significant demands on the management and other resources of the company which demands are likely to continue to manage future growth the company will need to continue to attract hire and retain highly skilled and motivated officers managers and employees for sales marketing business development and customer service and operational and financial management the company may not be successful in selecting managing or expanding its operations and markets or maintaining adequate management financial and operating systems and controls the company may not be able to achieve desired geographic expansion without additional investment        table of contents   experience of management may not be adequate to achieve projections   while the company’s officers have history in working with growth companies there is no guarantee that such experience will ensure that the company will reach its projections success in this industry has many factors that our management team cannot control the general economy rapid deployment of competitor offerings ability to protect our intellectual property and other macroeconomic factors   risks related to our common stock   there currently is only a minimal public market for our common stock failure to develop or maintain a trading market could negatively affect the value of our common stock and make it difficult or impossible for investors to sell shares   there currently is only a minimal public market for shares of our common stock and an active market may never develop our common stock is quoted on the otcqb tier of the otc markets group inc under the symbol “ughl” we may not ever be able to satisfy the listing requirements for our common stock to be listed on a national exchange which are often a more widelytraded and liquid market some but not all of the factors that may delay or prevent the listing of our common stock on a more widelytraded and liquid market includes the following   · our stockholders’ equity may be insufficient   · the market value of our outstanding securities may be too low   · our net income from operations may be too low   · our common stock may not be sufficiently widely held   · our inability to secure market makers for our common stock and   · our inability to meet the rules and requirements mandated by the several exchanges and markets   if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting we may not be able to accurately report our financial results which could lead to a restatement of our financial statements as a result current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which would harm our business   our management determined that we did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting as a result of identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting while we have taken steps to remediate these control deficiencies there are no assurances that any future deficiencies will not result in errors in our financial statements in future periods if we are required to restate our financial statements we will incur additional costs and could be subject to litigation   we cannot assure investors that the common stock will become liquid or that it will be listed on a national securities exchange   until our common stock is listed on a national securities exchange such as the new york stock exchange or the nasdaq stock market we expect our common stock to remain eligible for quotation on the otcqb or other overthecounter quotation systems in such venues however an investor may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock in addition if we fail to meet the criteria set forth in sec regulations various requirements would be imposed by law on brokers or dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors consequently such regulations may deter brokers or dealers from recommending or selling our common stock which may further affect the liquidity of the common stock this would also make it more difficult for us to raise capital   the application of the “penny stock” rules could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and increase transaction costs to sell those such stock   the sec has adopted rule a that establishes the definition of a “penny stock” for the purposes relevant to us as any equity security that has a market price of less than  per share or with an exercise price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions for any transaction involving a penny stock unless exempt rule g requires that a broker or dealer needs to   · approve a person’s account for transactions in penny stocks and   · receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased        table of contents   in order to approve a person’s account for transactions in penny stocks the broker or dealer must   · obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and   · make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks   the broker or dealer must also deliver prior to any transaction in a penny stock a disclosure schedule prescribed by the sec relating to the penny stock market which in highlight form   · sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination and   · declares that the broker or dealer received a signed written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction   generally brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the “penny stock” rules this may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our common stock   the market price for our common stock is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively unknown company with a small and thinly traded public float limited operating history and lack of profits investors may be unable to sell our common stock at or above the original purchase price which may result in substantial losses   the market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers and we expect that our stock price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future the volatility in our stock price is attributable to a number of factors first as noted above our common stock is sporadically and thinly traded as a consequence of this lack of liquidity the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our shareholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction the price for our stock could for example decline precipitously in the event that a large number of our common shares are sold on the market without commensurate demand as compared to a seasoned issuer which could better absorb those sales without adverse impact on its share price secondly we are a speculative or “risky” investment due to our limited operating history and lack of profits to date and uncertainty of future market acceptance for our potential products and services as a consequence of this enhanced risk more riskadverse investors may under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress be more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a seasoned issuer many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance we cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common stock will be at any time including as to whether our common stock will sustain their current market prices or as to what effect that the sale of shares or the availability of common stock for sale at any time will have on the prevailing market price   we do not pay dividends on our common stock   we have not paid any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future we plan to retain earnings if any to finance the development and expansion of our business in the absence of dividends investors will only see a return on their investment if the value of our common shares appreciates   rule  related risk   the sec adopted amendments to rule  which became effective on february   that apply to securities acquired both before and after that date under these amendments a person who has beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock for at least six months would be entitled to sell their securities provided that i such person is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of or at any time during the year preceding a sale ii we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” for at least  days before the sale and iii if the sale occurs prior to satisfaction of a oneyear holding period we provide current information at the time of sale   persons who have beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock for at least six months but who are our affiliates at the time of or at any time during the year preceding a sale would be subject to additional restrictions by which such person would be

outstanding or   · the average weekly trading volume of such securities during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on form  with respect to the sale   provided in each case that

notice provisions of rule         table of contents   restrictions on the reliance of rule  by shell companies or former shell companies   historically the sec staff has taken the position that rule  is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by companies that are or previously were blank check companies like us the sec has codified and expanded this position in the amendments discussed above by prohibiting the use of rule  for resale of securities issued by any shell companies other than business combination related shell companies or any issuer that has been at any time previously a shell company the sec has provided an important exception to this prohibition however if the following conditions are met   · the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company   · the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of section  or d of the exchange act    · the issuer of the securities has filed all exchange act reports and material required to be filed as applicable during the preceding  months or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials other than

commonwealth of independent states which include kyrgyzstan kazakhstan armenia azerbaijan belarus moldova tajikistan uzbekistan and the ukraine   many manufacturers transfer their production

we have incurred recurring losses to date our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and accordingly do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation we expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements we expect to raise additional capital through among other things the sale of equity or debt securities   the following comparative analysis on results of operations was based on the comparative financial statements footnotes and related information for the year ended december   and the fiscal year ended november   as a result of our change in our fiscal year end from november  to december  effective as of december   we do not believe that an analysis of the one month period ended december   is meaningful to investors and in some cases have omitted that disclosure this analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report   year ended december   compared to the year ended november   and the one month ended december     revenue   during the year ended december   and november   and the one month ended december   we did not generate any revenue   operating expenses   total operating expenses for the year ended december   increased by  to  compared to the year ended november   the increases were primarily a result of an increase in professional fees related to financial and administrative contracted services such as legal and accounting fees to remain a reporting company with the sec we are unable to predict the level of our operating expenses as we continue to develop our business   operating expenses for the one month ended december   was comprised of professional fees of    net loss   the net loss for the year ended december   was  an

liquidity and capital resources   liquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements as of december   we had a working capital deficit of  an increase of  from working capital of  at november   the increase in the deficit is primarily a result of the increases in due to related parties discussed below as of december   our

working capital requirements will continue to be funded through further issuances of our securities and loans from our principal shareholders our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business   existing working capital further advances and debt instruments and anticipated cash flow are not expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next year we have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements generally we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments in connection with our business plan management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to i acquisition of inventory ii developmental expenses associated with a startup business and iii marketing expenses we intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities and debt issuances thereafter we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet longterm operating requirements additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders further such securities might have rights preferences or privileges senior to our common stock additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms or at all if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations

immediate future management will continue to monitor inflation and evaluate the possible future effects of inflation on our business and operations   offbalance sheet arrangements   as of the date of

revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors   going concern   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates continuity of operations realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business   as reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the company had an accumulated deficit at december   of  a net loss for the year ended december   of  and net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december   of  these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern        table of contents   the company is attempting to produce sufficient revenue however the companys cash position is not sufficient to support its daily operations while the company believes in the viability of its strategy to produce sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds there can be no assurances to that effect the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds   the unaudited financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   the independent auditors audit report accompanying our november   financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business   critical accounting policies   we have identified the following policies below as critical to our business and results of operations our reported results are impacted by the application of the following accounting policies certain of which require management to make subjective or complex judgments these judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact quarterly or annual results of operations for all of these policies management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as expected and the best estimates routinely require adjustment specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from these estimates   item a

specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december   based on that evaluation our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december   for the reasons discussed below   management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting   management is responsible for the preparation of our financial statements and related information management uses its best judgment to ensure that the financial statements present fairly in material respects our financial position and results of operations in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles        table of contents   management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in the exchange act these internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the reported financial information is presented fairly that disclosures are adequate and that the judgments inherent in the preparation of financial statements are reasonable there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls including the possibility of human error and overriding of controls consequently an ineffective internal control system can only provide reasonable not absolute assurance with respect to reporting financial information   our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that i pertain to maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with our management and directors authorization and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention of or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements   under the supervision of management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission  framework and subsequent guidance prepared by the commission specifically for smaller public companies based on that evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december   because it identified the following material weakness and significant deficiencies     · material weakness  the company did not maintain effective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting process because we lacked a sufficient complement of personnel with a level of accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure that is commensurate with our financial reporting requirements         · significant deficiencies  inadequate segregation of duties     a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis   we expect to be materially dependent upon third parties to provide us with accounting consulting services for the foreseeable future which we believe mitigates the impact of the material weaknesses discussed above until such time as we have a chief financial officer with the requisite expertise in us gaap and establish an audit committee and implement internal controls and procedures there are no assurances that the material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures will not result in errors in our financial statements which could lead to a restatement of those financial statements   our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs due to the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected   this annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting management’s report was not subject to attestation by the company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to sec rules that permit us to provide only management’s report on internal control over financial reporting in this annual report on form k   changes in

directors executive officers significant employees or control persons has been involved in any legal proceeding listed in item f of regulation sk in the past  years   corporate governance   our board of directors has not established any committees including an audit committee a compensation committee or a nominating committee or any committee performing a similar function the functions of those committees are being undertaken by our board because we do not have any independent directors our board believes that the establishment of committees of our board would not provide any benefits to our company and could be considered more form than substance   we do not have a policy regarding the consideration of any director candidates that may be recommended by our stockholders including the minimum qualifications for director candidates nor has our officers and directors established a process for identifying and evaluating director nominees we have not adopted a policy regarding the handling of any potential recommendation of director candidates by our stockholders including the procedures to be followed our officers and directors have not considered or adopted any of these policies as we have never received a recommendation from any stockholder for any candidate to serve on our board of directors        table of contents   given our relative size and lack of directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage we do not anticipate that any of our stockholders will make such a recommendation in the near future while there have been no nominations of additional directors proposed in the event such a proposal is made all current members of our board will participate in the consideration of director nominees   as with most small early stage companies until such time as we further develop our business achieve a stronger revenue base and have sufficient working capital to purchase directors’ and officers’ insurance we do not have any immediate prospects to attract independent directors when we are able to expand our board to include one or more independent directors we intend to establish an audit committee of our board of directors it is our intention that one or more of these independent directors will also qualify as an audit committee financial expert our securities are not quoted on an exchange that has requirements that a majority of our board members be independent and we are not currently otherwise subject to any law rule or regulation requiring that all or any portion of our board of directors include “independent” directors nor are we required to establish or maintain an audit committee or other committee of our board   code of ethics   we expect that we will adopt a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to all of our employees officers and directors including those officers responsible for financial reporting once adopted we will make the code of business conduct and ethics available on our website at wwwunionbeamcom  we intend to post any amendments to the code or any waivers of its requirements on our website   board structure   our board has not chosen to separate the positions of chief executive officer and chairman of the board in recognition of the fact that our operations are sufficiently limited that such separation would not serve any useful purpose   role of board in risk oversight process   management is responsible for the daytoday management of risk and for identifying our risk exposures and communicating such exposures to our board our board is responsible for designing implementing and overseeing our risk management processes the board does not have a standing risk management committee but administers this function directly through the board as a whole the whole board considers strategic risks and opportunities and receives reports from its officers regarding risk oversight in their areas of responsibility as necessary we believe our board’s leadership structure facilitates the division of risk management oversight responsibilities and enhances the board’s efficiency in fulfilling its oversight function with respect to different areas of our business risks and our risk mitigation practices   communications with the board of directors   stockholders with questions about the company are encouraged to contact the company by sending communications to the attention of the chief executive officer at rm  f harcourt house  gloucester road wanchai hong kong if stockholders feel that their questions have not been sufficiently addressed through communications with the chief executive officer they may communicate with the board of directors by sending their communications to the board of directors co the chief executive officer at the same address   director compensation   historically our nonemployee directors have not received compensation for their service outside the compensation set forth in the summary compensation table below but we may compensate our directors for their service in the future we reimburse our nonemployee directors for reasonable travel expenses incurred in attending board and committee meetings we also intend to allow our nonemployee directors to participate in any equity compensation plans that we adopt in the future   procedures for nominating directors   there have been no material changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to the board during the quarter ended december          table of contents   section a beneficial ownership reporting compliance   section a of the exchange act

statements include the accounts of the company and the whollyowned subsidiaries first channel limited and union beam investment limited all material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated   use of estimates and assumptions   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents the company had   and  in cash and cash equivalents as of december   december   and november   respectively   fair value of financial instruments   as required by the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification “fasb asc” fair value is measured based on a threetier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level  observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level  inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and level  unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions   the companys financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents prepaid expenses and accounts payable the carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate their respective estimated fair value due to the shortterm maturities and approximate market interest rates of these instruments   concentrations of credit risks   the company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and cash equivalents the company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high credit worthiness the company’s management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds and as such it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited   related parties   the company follows asc  “ related party disclosures” for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions see note      f   table of contents   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with asc  “accounting for income taxes” the asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized as at december   december   and november   the company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions see note    basic and diluted net loss per share   the company computes loss per share in accordance with asc  “earnings per share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period during the year ended december   and november   and the one month ended december   the company had no potential dilutive instruments and accordingly basic loss and diluted loss per share are the same   recently issued accounting pronouncements   in january  the fasb has issued accounting standards update asu no  “intangibles  goodwill and other topic  simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” these amendments eliminate step  from the goodwill impairment test the annual or interim goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount an impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value however the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit in addition income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit should be considered when measuring the goodwill impairment loss if applicable the amendments also eliminate the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and if it fails that qualitative test to perform step  of the goodwill impairment test an entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary effective for public business entities that are a sec filers for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after december   early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after january   asu  should be adopted on a prospective
