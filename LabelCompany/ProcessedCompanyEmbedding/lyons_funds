policy jlfmi investment philosophy home about us philosophy service newsletter contact investment philosophy the ultimate quest in investing should be to outperform the overall market over a complete market cycle  with less risk active management managedrisk investing for the real world at j lyons fund management inc our goal is simple generate longterm marketbeating investment returns for our clients while protecting them from any large losses to accomplish our goal we utilize an investment approach referred to as active management this does not mean we are constantly moving in and out of the market or constantly shifting investments within our portfolio rather active management means we employ a more active approach in reducing our clients investment risk as opposed to the buyandhold approach espoused by the wall street establishment and most investment advisors and financial planners unlike the buyandhold crowd we do not feel it is inevitable to suffer large periodic losses in the stock market in fact it is the ability to avoid large losses that provides investors with the best chance to achieve longterm investment success the only way to accomplish that is to utilize an investment approach that includes both a buy strategy to enable growth and a sell strategy to control risk its not necessary nor do we attempt to catch every little move in the stock market we simply strive to have our clients assets invested during the greater part of significant market advances and to avoid or at times even profit from the greater portion of significant declines this approach can provide for more consistent returns that are less dependent on the existence of a bull market to succeed this is an especially good thing considering the recent difficult market environment for investing that unfortunately is likely to persist for several more years as a result we feel strongly that not only is the j lyons fund management inc approach the optimum investing alternative for most individuals but it also may be one of the few possibilities that really makes sense over the long term read more about the active management philosophy and why it is so critical to investment success in our report below a battle for investment survival a battle for investment survival the jlfmi investment approach combats the deficiencies of traditional investment methods and myths and counters the harmful forces of human nature for most investors professionals included achieving successful investment performance with consistency is a very difficult task those with experience in various investment markets know this reality all too well while the vast majority of individuals with less experience probably have the same sobering lesson in front of them in our years in the investment business we have observed certain fundamental and almost universal investing problems specifically few individuals have the resources or the time available to enable them to undertake a wellconceived investment program fewer still even those with a real aptitude for investing have the hardened discipline that is an absolute prerequisite for it to make matters worse much of the advice directed at investors contains investment myths that ultimately end up being more harmful than helpful the myth of buyandhold the most often repeated and probably most egregious of the investment myths is the idea of buyandhold the buyand hold approach rests upon the conviction that the stock market moves only upward over time proponents of that philosophy state that one cannot determine the level of risk in the stock market at any given time and therefore it is best not even to try their default advice to investors is to simply rely on that longterm direction first off investors should be aware of the various ulterior motives of the proponents of buyandhold its not to say that these motives are necessarily devious just that they are not necessarily in the best interest of the investor for one many managers or advisors are compensated only if the investors money remains in the fund or investment they put it in therefore the advisor has an obvious interest in keeping or advising the investor to keep the money in that particular investment regardless of its performance another motive behind the promotion of buyandhold is quite simply that it is easy it takes very little effort to implement the strategy since as the name implies after the buying is done all thats left is the holding and again holding an investment no matter what it does is not necessarily whats in the best interest of the investor it may be forgivable for an amateur to adopt such a strategy as they cannot be expected to find the time and expertise needed to effectively perform such a complicated task as investing however for an advisor manager or broker to follow buyandhold with their paying clients assets simply because it is easy is intolerable not to mention it does not serve the client well investors deserve much better than that from their advisor particularly since by definition it is a guarantee that on a regular basis that investment approach cannot be the best interest of investors the deficiencies of buyandhold are simply too obvious and damaging for that to be the case the buyandhold approach again is predicated on the theory that the stock market moves only upward over time there are distinct fallacies with that approach to which anyone invested in the stock market during the tech stock implosion of the early s or the subsequent subprime credit crunch induced bear market can attest the fact is bear markets are a reality and not an uncommon one historically bear markets occur every five years lose an average of  and take an average of three and a half years to recoup the losses buyandhold proponents will argue that these are simply shortterm market fluctuations however shortterm or not losing  of ones assets is not an insignificant event that can easily be dismissed particularly for someone nearing retirement who is going to be dependent upon that money and the notion that such a painful loss is not the fault of the investment strategy but simply an unavoidable result of the market declining is little solace to the person taking the loss at times it is true that if investors could but wait it out they may come through unscathed however there have historically been numerous extended periods which we refer to as secular bear markets when the stock market has gone sideways to downwards over a period of many years furthermore not only have these secular bear markets occurred in the past but as shown in the chart below  they are a regular event in the repeating market cycle the  high in the dow jones was not exceeded until  and the  top was not surpassed until the summer of  and most relevant now the nasdaq composite which topped out at over  in the year  was still more than  below that mark nearly a decade later for those investors without the luxury of a  or even year investing horizon sometimes waiting to recover serious losses is not an option even with a longer time horizon the psychological damage and loss of objectivity suffered by an investor often distorts future investment decisions as we discuss below human nature is the bane of most investorsand their advisors after taking all of its deficiencies into account if an investor still chose the buyandhold approach it is unrealistic to expect that he or she would even be able to implement it in a disciplined manner thats because without an objective program like jlfmis it is difficult for investors and advisors alike to avoid the ill effects of human nature the consistent forces of human nature cause us to react to circumstances in a similar and predictable fashion unfortunately when it comes to investing these human natural reactions more often than not illicit the wrong response the two most influential human natural traits that most often lead investors astray are fear and greed yet as easy as it is to be aware of these influences it is equally difficult to avoid them that is why at junctures of buying opportunity in the stock market people are too frightened and too focused on potential risk to be totally objective conversely at market tops the lure of yet higher highs and of missing out on more profits clouds the perspective of investors the following charts illustrate this point due to fear of a stock market that had gone sideways since  households had an alltime low of  of their assets invested in stocks during the nd quarter of  just as the stock market embarked on an year bull market conversely greed consumed households in the st quarter of  as they had an alltime high  of their assets invested in stocks right at the onset of the current bear market this means that investors failed to capture much of the gains of the ss bull market and incurred much of the loss associated with the bear market since  a similar pattern is seen in a study by hewitt  associates into the investment behavior of k participants according to their survey k investors allocation to stock funds peaked in march of  and april of  right near the market peaks on the flip side participants pulled the greatest amount of money out of stock funds in february  and october  right near bottoms these reactions are natural first of all we are greatly influenced by the environment of our recent past secondly at these junctures our hopes and fears are constantly being reinforced by what we are reading hearing and observing in other words the pressures on investors at both significant market tops and bottoms are the greatest to take what eventually will prove to be the wrong course of action other traditional investment methods fall short over the years other various traditional investment strategies have been used in attempt to overcome the challenge of investing and counter the forces of human nature these methods have had decidedly mixed results and when it comes down to real world investing like buyandhold they are arguably more myth than they are reliable myth  seeking conservative investments many frustrated investors for example decide to become conservative but just what is a conservative investment approach investors who sought the protection of many socalled conservative investments have not always gotten what they bargained for to the detriment or at times devastation of their investments highly rated bonds or bond funds have shocked investors at times as their investments declined as much as  in recent years   and  for example once hallowed blue chip stocks like continental illinois bank enron general motors aig and others were once labeled prudent man investments hindsight has obviously told another story revealing how these companies resulted in extinction or perilously close to it targetdate retirement or lifecycle funds have become popular in recent years as they shift their asset allocation for investors to supposedly become more conservative as they approach retirement age investors in such funds earmarked for  retirees would likely challenge the effectiveness of the conservative shift as they lost as much as  of their value from  to  investors who purchased aaarated cdos and other similar instruments in recent years were lucky to get back pennies on the dollar for their investments as the subprime housing market underlying the instruments collapsed almost bringing down the entire financial system as we know it while its true that these horror stories dont always represent the behavior of these conservative investments the fact is that these events do occur and will occur again repeatedly in the future regardless of the normal behavior of the investments failing to account for the possibility of such damaging losses can be devastating to a portfolio particularly for an investor nearing retirement age and it only takes one such abnormal event to bring devastation myth  diversification more recently asset allocation and diversification become the buzz words as approaches to controlling risk the idea behind these popular techniques is that spreading investments across all market segments will bring more consistent returns and reduce risk on the theory that the declining segments will be offset by rising ones unfortunately we have found that all diversification ends up doing is diluting returns in up markets and providing too little risk protection in down markets witness the losses in a broad array of market segments in   diversification sure didnt do much to reduce risk index loss from  high dow jones industrials  sp   nasdaq  large cap growth  large cap value  mid cap growth  mid cap value  small cap growth  small cap value  dow jones utilities  goldsilver index  japan  europe  emerging markets  the problem with these socalled traditional investment methods is that they fail to account for the existence of bear markets and thus do not address the most important question should one be invested at all  the jlfmi investment approach addresses this problem j lyons fund management inc has a different philosophy regarding what it takes to reduce risk we feel that it is not what you invest in that necessarily renders an approach conservative unless you want to settle for treasury bill rates only the use of adequate controls on when you invest in whatever you invest in can reduce your investment risk to a conservative level around this concept is built our investment strategy fundamentally our investment philosophy focuses on two observable truths some of the best investment returns have historically come from equity investments there are times to be in equities and times to be out  completely out a quick glance at a chart of a major stock market index will confirm this look at the chart of the sp  once again for example from  to  the sp  about doubled in value however by  it had lost the entire gain the next six years saw the index repeat the same cycle again being out of the market for even a portion of those declines would have considerably enhanced the returns referred to in  above the jlfmi risk management system wellaccepted studies have shown that some  of the reason that a stock or stock fund moves up or down can be attributed to the direction of the overall market because of that fact and because the guidance from wall street firms regarding what stocks to buy and sell has been so ineffective we long ago decided to concentrate our efforts in determining which direction the overall market was moving and likely to move or put another way what is the level of risk present in the market our objective naturally is to invest more aggressively when risk is low ie the overall market is moving up conversely when market risk is high our focus is on preserving capital ie reducing exposure to the market by employing this approach we aim to lower the potential risk of investing while still capturing the growth of capital necessary for a retirement plan or any type of investment account for that matter the jlfmi risk model central in our strategy to identify risk is the jlfmi stock market risk model it was developed in the mids and has been in use now since  the risk model consists of various proprietary individual indicators comprised of data inputs taken directly from the stock market these indicators represent different measures of market strength with a focus on breadth how many stocks are rising versus falling and momentum of breadth how strongly is the breath improving or worsening collectively these indicators quantify the strength and by extension risk of the overall market and orient our investment posture for the forthcoming period the risk model was devised and refined over many years encompassing both bull and bear market cycles and indeed was designed to function in all types of market environments as a result the model has helped us to successfully navigate the stock market over the course of the past  years through the roaring bull market of the s and s and the subsequent decadelong to date secular bear market we are confident that it will be as relevant for future markets as it has been for those of the past one of the salient features of the risk model is the objectivity that it lends to our decisionmaking there is only a minimal amount of interpretation involved in arriving at our buy and sell signals that objectivity aids us in combating those harmful forces of human nature by allowing us to largely avoid emotionally charged situations which can often induce incorrect investment moves is the risk model pinpoint accurate no certainly not the model will be a bit late at times in signaling turns in the market and early at others however pinpoint accuracy is not required to produce exceptional rates of return the ability to be correctly positioned for most of the significant trends in the stock market and to avoid large losses is what is necessary and since the components of the risk model are direct measurements of what the overall market is actually doing by definition it cannot stay out of sync with the market for long therefore we are confident that it will continue to aid in keeping us correctly positioned for the major moves in the market furthermore most investment alternatives like buyandhold have serious and obvious deficiencies in declining markets exposing one to damaging losses those deficiencies are potentially much more harmful and more difficult to overcome summary the j lyons fund management inc investment approach aims to take advantage of the attractive returns historically available in equity markets while reducing the risk of incurring substantial losses during declining markets thus our active management strategy has allowed us to meet our objective to outperform the market over a complete bull and bear market cycle  with substantially less risk and versus other investment approaches that we have scrutinized not only do we believe our to be conceptually much sounder for “all seasons” but it may be the only approach that stands a chance to succeed in the secular bear market environment that is likely to persist for the better part of the next decade our success in developing and utilizing our investment techniques has depended upon objectivity and thoughtful planning your success in deploying your investable funds will depend upon the same factors we are very willing to discuss our services at length

they don’t know when to sell anyway unfortunately as investors have recently learned the hard way an investment approach which does not reduce risk by occasionally selling at appropriate times guarantees big losses any time the market declines significantly i began my investment career at a major wall street firm in the late s and quickly learned that sell is a fourletter word in the industry after suffering through two bear markets right off the bat i knew there had to be an alternative to my clients suffering large losses every time the stock market took a hit so in the mids with no help from my firm  i embarked on a mission to determine when to be invested in the market and when to get out the result was an investment approach i helped pioneer known now as “active management the goal of which is to provide consistent longterm returns and protection from substantial losses the same principles i developed then continue to guide the way jlfmi manages our clients assets today these principles have helped us protect our clients from big losses during every significant market decline since  including the aftermath of the tech bubble in  and the crash of  if you

provides discretionary management of investment accounts that simply means that we remove for you the burden of managing your own investments and implement the entire process for you  from the decisionmaking to the implementation of the investment strategy you can rest assured that as we provide this service your assets are securely held by an independent trust company we have no access to your funds whatsoever only the ability to manage the funds additionally arrangements can be made to manage your k or other retirement plan where it exists in cases where it is still active and cannot be moved allowing us to assume the responsibility of managing your investments will allow you to focus your time and energy on the other important things in your life jlfmis investment objective is to outperform the market over a complete bull and bear market cycle  and to do it with substantially less risk to accomplish that objective we use proprietary models to identify favorable times to invest in the market as well as the best areas in which to invest at any given time importantly  and the characteristic that sets us apart from most advisors  is that we actively and continuously monitor the level of risk in the market and will take decisive steps to protect our clients assets when that risk gets too high for example on september   we placed our clients assets in a  cash position protecting them during one of the worst stock market declines in history the j lyons fund management inc investment approach combined with discipline and  years of investment experience has allowed jlfmi to meet its objective even through the harshest investment climates learn more about jlfmis management system and service investment approach how do you manage your clients money custody of assets how do i know my money is safe eligibility can jlfmi manage my investment account fees what does your management service cost investment approach how do you manage your clients money the goal of jlfmis investment apporach is simple invest our clients assets for the greater part of significant stock market advances  and protect their assets during the greater part of significant declines conversely the typical advice from wall street and the rest of the investment establishment is simply “buy and hold” unfortunately that advice is often selfserving designed to prevent assets from going elsewhere moreover an examination of the past  years will clearly show how ineffectual it is in fact a look at the history of investing in general will only reinforce the conclusion that buying and holding eventually will lead to a disastrous conclusion moreover that danger is compounded should you begin that holding at a high in the market which unfortunately is when the average investor becomes most bullish the most important objective in investing according to warren buffet is not to lose money we have to imagine that most investment professionals offering advice to clients feel the same way about their own money and at least attempt to take steps to avoid damaging losses of their own we dont believe that individual investors should be treated any differently we do believe that the greatest potential investment returns historically come from the stock market and there are times to be invested in the stock market and there are times to not be invested eg    and    as our clients have witnessed for decades we do not believe it is inevitable to take big investment losses in fact we believe that the ability to avoid such large losses is the biggest key in achieving longterm investment success therefore we long ago developed two proprietary tools a risk model and a fund selection model to help us take advantage of the profit potential that stock markets can offer while also protecting our clients assets during the rough times specifically these two models help us to answer the two necessary question in investing when to be invested and what to invest in the jlfmi risk model  when to be invested central in our strategy is the proprietary j lyons fund management inc risk model which aids us in being on the right side of significant stock market moves it was developed in the mids by jlfmi founder and president john s lyons and has been in use now since  the model consists of several data sets derived directly from the stock market itself which represent various measures of risk and momentum in the market collectively they provide us with a reading on the overall level of risk present in the market and dictate our investment posture when the model is in a buy mode it is indicating that the market risk is low enough that significant investment exposure is warranted conversely when the model is in a sell mode it is a warning that the risk present in the market is high enough that our focus should be on protecting our capital meaning little or no investment exposure learn more about the jlfmi risk model the jlfmi fund selection model  what to invest in if the risk model indicates that it is appropriate to be invested the next decision is what to invest in at any given time some areas of the market are performing well while others are doing little or nothing therefore it is neither productive nor even conservative to simply diversify across all segments of the market this type of diversification only dilutes returns during up trends while often providing inadequate protection in down trends our philosophy on investment selection is to concentrate on the best performing areas of the market including the various market caps sectors foreign markets commodities etc our revolutionary fund selection model identifies those mutual funds and exchange traded funds that currently have the potential for the best future performance relative to other available funds learn more about the jlfmi fund selection model our success in developing and utilizing our investment techniques has depended upon objectivity discipline and thoughtful planning your success in deploying your investable funds will depend upon the same factors we are very willing to discuss our services at length with you so that you will be better prepared to make the correct decision when considering the great number of investment alternatives available to you for more insight into our unique investment approach and why we believe it is imperative for investors to adopt at least a variation of the approach see our investment philosophy custody of assets how do i know my money is safe j lyons fund management inc never has possession of our clients assets we receive authorization from clients only to manage the investments within their account client funds are primarily held at millennium trust company in oak brook il which serves as the custodian for the assets at no time do we or anyone else have access to withdraw funds from your account except for fees as disclosed in our clientadvisor agreement the only one authorized to withdraw funds is the account owner and the only place funds can be sent is to the address of record on the account clients can elect to have online access to their portfolio status and millennium furnishes quarterly statements and annual  forms where applicable all uninvested funds at millennium enjoy the full fdic insurance coverage as allowed by law more information about millennium trust can be found here   eligibility can jlfmi manage my particular investment account because of our investment approach we feel jlfmis management service can help almost any type of investor with almost any investment account we do have a focus on retirement account management because  we have considerable experience and expertise in that area and with the types of investments typically associated with it and  a great percentage of the investable assets in this country are in retirement accounts because the growth of retirement accounts is so essential to their owners and because so little practical investment assistance is available to existing k plan participants and ira owners it has long been a commitment of j lyons fund management to serve these “forgotten investors” however whether you are a highnet worth investor or a retirement account investor whether you have taxable money you want to invest or an ira k plan or other type of retirement plan we believe our focus on targeting growth opportunities when they exist while actively reducing risk can help provide the longterm growth that is the objective of all investors jlfmi does have a minimum required investment amount of  however even if your account does not qualify for that amount please contact us there is such a lack of quality investment assistance available that we would still like to help you find an effective solution and we have some ideas for you fees what does your management service cost j lyons fund management inc is a feeonly investment advisor our management fee is based on a percentage of the clients assets we feel this is the most appropriate structure as it keeps our objectives in line with your objectives as a client  our compensation rises only if the value of your account rises jlfmi is independent of any affiliation with any other firm and as such the decisions we make are not influenced by any selfserving interests whatsoever but are solely based on the best interest of the client importantly

spiral in commodities including oil and gold hit bottom is the us dollar embarking on another major leg higher is the euro on its way to parity  and beyond will the trump rally in industrial metals construction and infrastructure signify a sustainable development will the inexorable bull market in us equities continue to greater heights does the fact that the cubs won the world series mean we

specific methodologies  charts of the year in mostly chronological order  click on the titles to visit the respective posts what’s next for stocks after record new year week  hangover  january  with nearly a year gone by investors may forget that  actually saw the weakest start to a year in the history of the dow jones industrial average  with a loss of more than  during the first week the fact that stocks rebounded strongly from their tough start and avoided the fate of many previous poorstarting years has likely also helped investors to forget breaking the bull market  january  the early thumping on top of the late weakness had stocks threatening critical levels eg trendlines fibonacci retracements etc related to the potential survival of the post bull market on january  several key indices including the value line geometric composite and the global dow index convincingly broke such levels this break had us wondering if it was the final blow to the bull market it also based on our work opened up a further immediate  of downside in the indices updatejust  weeks after breakdown key index hits ground floor  january  well it took just  weeks for the value line geometric composite to achieve that further  drop on january  the index reached the next level of major fibonacci retracements that we had earmarked as it turns out that day would mark the low for the year in the value line geometric composite key global equity index takes elevator down to support  january  similarly it took just  weeks for the global dow to fulfill its  of immediate risk to the downside as with the value line the global dow would form its low for the year on january along with a midfebruary retest new lows hit ‘washout’ territory  january  this was the most viewed postchart on our blog in  as beleaguered investors wondered when the bloodletting in the stock market would stop signs of capitulation began to pile up in late january included among them was the preponderance of new lows on the nyse which soared to over  of all issues on january  while not perfect this level has very reliably signaled truly washedout conditions in the past and as with past incidents this marked the very low for the decline and for the year gold stocks hit lowest levels  ever  january  coming into  no one was more depressed than gold bugs the phlx goldsilver index xau began the year mired in a year slump that saw it lose over  of its value on january  the xau would close at its lowest level in the over year history of the index enough said gold stocks at key juncture  january  after a further swift plunge the xau would bounce back to challenge its january  breakdown level in one of our most popular posts of the year we wondered if the breakdown level would send gold stocks on a fresh leg down  or if the xau would reclaim the level creating a potentially explosive false breakdown it turned out to be the latter as prior to some yearend weakness the xau went on to nearly triple its value by august jamie dimon banking on financial stocks bouncing here  february  us stocks tested their january lows in midfebruary as many sectors reached key chart support included among them was the kbw bank index bkx coinciding with jamie dimons high profile purchase of jp morgan stock the bkx tested its post up trendline and other key levels it would end up being a very welltimed purchase as both the bkx and jpm stock formed their low for the year on february  preceding rallies of over  in each of them brazil’s bovespa is once again…the most interesting chart in the world  march  our vote for international stock market of the year goes to brazil representative of the woeful performance in emerging market equities in recent years brazil came into  in the midst of a year bear market in early january it would break below major year support tumbling to year lows however like the xau the brazilian bovespa would bounce back to test its breakdown area in early march and like the xau the bovespa would reclaim that level creating a false breakdown and launching it on an eventual  rally low to high the line in the oil sand  march  another beleaguered area of the market coming into  was the oil complex both the commodity and the oil stocks were victims of the devastating deflationary spiral gripping commodities for the past  years in early  the nyse oil  gas index xoi actually broke below its year trendline stemming back to its  lows in a key development the xoi would go on to recover that trendline and has fought to remain above it all year did this just breathe new life into the bull market  april  one reason we surmised that the  stock market top might have marked the end of the post bull market was the divergence of the nyse advancedecline line at the may high in the sp  failures of the ad line to confirm new highs have been present at every cyclical market top in the last  years for that reason we noted that bulls should breathe a little easier upon the ad line reaching a new high in april of this year that suggested that the sp  would go on to make at least one more new high before the bull market was over  which of course it has will the falling buck stop here  may  one of the biggest developments of the year in the financial markets was the postelection breakout to year highs by the us dollar back in the spring however folks werent so positive on the dollar as it had been stuck in the mud for  months in our view the yearlong consolidation was a healthy digestion of its furious  rally the question was where would the dollar bounce to us the test of the intersection of its broken post and post down trendlines that we noted on may  was as good a place as any as it turns out that was the low day of the year in the dollar and preceded its eventual breakout has everyone moved to the bullish side of the bond boat  june  another potentially huge development this year was the possible reversal of the year secular downtrend in yields as we noted in this june post while yields continued to fall it seemed that investor psychology regarding rates was changing as the nearrecord netshort position in bond futures by the smart money commercial hedgers suggested the investment community no longer seemed to view rising rates as an inevitable path as they had for over a decade and perhaps we surmised it would be just that widespread shift in expectations to the bullish side of the bond boat that might allow for the longawaited bottom in interest rates…eventually  weeks after that post bond yields would hit an alltime low before jumping  into the end of the year a wake up call for international stocks  june  one trend that did not reverse this year was the underperformance by international equities versus their us counterparts in fact it accelerated as noted by this chart showing the ratio of the international msci eafe index to the sp  hitting an alltime low eventually this will reverse as well  just not this year not your everyday pounding  june  one of s defining exogenous events that had the biggest impact on markets was brexit the surprising vote by britain to leave the european union sent shock waves through the markets some shortterm and some more meaningful one of the more meaningful reactions was the drop in the british pound below major support down to year lows europe’s bull market hanging in the balance  june  like the eafe european equity markets have been a perpetual underperformer for years or even decades in the brexit aftermath the broadbased dow jones stoxx europe  plunged lower to test its post bull market up trendline as well as some key fibonacci levels the level would hold for now as the stoxx  bottomed the day after our post however it still has not invalidated a potentially ominouslooking pattern that proved to be the indexs undoing in  and will epic line of resistance turn support for japanese stocks  june  one international market that had been a perpetual underperformer for decades is japan however in the past few years its nikkei  index has attempted to finally reverse its bear market that had defined it since its  top in  the index broke its multidecade down trendline in both february and june of this year the nikkei came back down to test the broken trendline holding both times could this be the onset of a major shift higher in japanese equities was the week high worth the wait  july  after topping out in may  the sp  would not hit a week high again until this past july as the chart shows prior precedents suggest the new high was worth the wait since  all  similar long waits resulted in gains over the next  and  years investor complacency is smashing records  august  as investors waited for stocks to finally break out to new highs sentiment remained consistently depressed in fact one of the factors we thought argued for eventual new highs in the indices was the still somewhat fearful investor sentiment only when new highs were achieved we theorized would sentiment finally improve upon julys breakout sentiment did indeed improve  and then some by august not only were investors no longer fearful they were complacent to historic extremes at least that was the signal being sent by looking at the term structure of the sp  volatility indices by mid to lateaugust the month volatility expectations vix relative to the month vxv had dropped lower and stayed lower than any point in the datas history this was a red flag for stocks here comes the rising rate ruckus again  august  the longawaited rising rates theme applied to shortterm rates as well like the year treasury yield obviously more influenced by the feds ultralow fed funds rate the year yield had been trudging along rockbottom ever since the massive fed intervention began in  every twitch higher since had been summarily beaten down in august we felt the year yield might actually get some traction to the upside if it could surmount the down trendlines stemming from both early in the year  and  in doing so the year yield could also create a false breakdown following its postbrexit plunge it took until after the election but the year yield was indeed successful in breaking above that key area when all was said and done the year yield had doubled off of its postbrexit low  and had finally given the rising rates crowd some evidence to back up their mantra stock market levitation hits historic heights  august  in between bouts of extreme volatility eg early postbrexit postelection the stock market also experienced historic stretches of calm during  we noted one remarkable such stretch in late august whereby the sp  closed  consecutive days within  of its week high this was the nd longest such streak in  years  and took the term dog days of august to a new level stocks’ trading range now beyond compare  september  another remarkable measure of stocks periodic bouts of inactivity during the year occurred during the same time frame as the previous chart specifically from midjuly to earlyaugust the dow jones industrial average saw a day stretch in which its entire highlow range was a mere  if you think thats tight youre right in fact it was the tightest in at least  years from periods of calm come volatility surges they say and the rest of the year would certainly see an uptick in volatility as the next chart demonstrates     september  on september  the dow broke out of its tight day range  with a vengeance in one of the more incredible statistical anomalies of the year the september  loss of  was greater than the entire day range preceding it this was just the th such example we could find of such an explosive range break as the chart shows however similar historical events showed a consistent tendency to bounce back the bric’s are rebuilding  september  as mentioned regarding brazil most emerging market equity markets have been dead money for at least half a decade this includes the socalled brics ie brazil russia india and china a grouping made popular due to their simultaneous strong performance in the mid to lates the group as a whole began to come to life again this year so we constructed a composite of the  countries in order to track the collective performance as it turns out in late summer the bric composite moved to alltime highs finally surpassing the highs of  and  of course these markets have benefited from the effects of their weak local currencies however this was a reemergence nearly a decade in the waiting that bears watching brexit disaster propels british stocks to record highs  october  if there is any group of people that had a worse  than bears in almost any noncurrency asset it would have to be prognosticators pundits and pollsters thats because they got pretty much all of the major events wrong in  whether it was the us presidential election brexit etc brexit was a particularly stunning misfire as it seems nobody correctly predicted the result of the referendum to make matters worse the forecasters badly erred in their predictions as to how markets would react in a brexit scenario far from the disaster that had been predicted for british markets the uk ftse reversed its initial postbrexit plunge and was actually higher within a week furthermore by  months later it had rallied some  off of its initial postbrexit low  and touched a new alltime high obviously some of that move was due to the pound getting er pounded but brexit was far from the financial armageddon for great britain that it was predicted to be  can biotech stocks stay “trendy”  october  the hottest sector the planet for  and a half years before topping popping in mid the biotechs spent  in straight up survival mode in february the nyse biotech index btk had dropped as low as  off of its  peak it finally found a bottom precisely on its post up trendline line it has spent the rest of the year right up to the bitter end repeatedly testing that trendline you know what we say about the more times and more frequent a trendline gets tested  the more likely it is to break additionally given the shallow trajectory of the btk bounce especially compared to its rapid descent and given its steep discount to its alltime high even while many sectors are at new highs and the future looks dicey for the biotechs that said if this oncetrendy sector can somehow manage to reignite its former ascent it could be a boon to the market traders breathe unprecedented sigh of relief following election  november  well like brexit the forecasters missed badly with the us presidential election as well they missed badly with the market reaction too while it was supposedly common thought that a donald trump victory would result in a substantial stock market correction it didnt work out that way instead stocks embarked on a blistering rally and relative nearterm volatility expectations collapsed at an unprecedented rate market   forecasters  market insanity ensues postelection  november  it wasnt just that markets reactions to the election were unexpected  many of them were also just plain strange in fact the week following the election will probably go down as the most bizarre trading week we have ever witnessed commodities and currencies were moving at hyper speed in all directions most of the bond market was crashing and depending on the sector stocks were either soaring or plunging and while we did not write a post on it the chart above perhaps best sums up the craziness following the election as it shows november   days after the election will go down as one of the most bizarre data days in stock market history thats because the dow closed the day higher by more than  yet there was negative breadth on the nyse at the same time the nasdaq  closed down more than  yet the breadth on the nasdaq was actually positive that is a combination that may never occur on the same day again rising rates really reaching resistance  november  as mentioned among the reactions following the election was one of the largest and swiftest jumps in bond yields in history yields sliced through any and all perceived resistance for the duration of the month by late november the year treasury yield tnx arrived at what we surmised would be the spot to at least slow down the interest rate advance around the  the tnx encountered the post down trendline which contained the entirety of the central bankinduced extraordinary low rate environment also in the vicinity were fibonacci retracement lines from all the key points since the  high even this level was unable to slow down the newfound veritable rising rates trend in breaking the resistance related to the post regime it places yields back within the confines of the post secular bear market regime thus it likely sets up another date with the most notorious trendline still in effect in all of the financial markets  the post down trendline in yields is industrial metals surge a sign of growth in economy market  november  another beneficiary of the postelection trump trade was anything related to construction and infrastructure resources including industrial metals this was a big topic since industrial metals are said to be a barometer of economic demand and as weve discovered in past studies there appears to be some validity to that notion as it applies to both the economy and the stock market shown here as the ratio of industrial metals to precious metals the industrial metals skyrocketed on a relative basis following the election this was following a key hold of support for the th time since  earlier in the year the ratio did find resistance at the post down trendline however which has since put a halt to the rally in industrial metals if the ratio cant surmount the trendline it could potentially serve as a warning sign for the growth in stocks and the economy if on the other hand the sharp rally in industrial metals is for real and durable then perhaps the ratio will break out – and take stocks and the economy along for the ride forget k – this is the stock market level to watch december  with all of the stock index breakouts following the election it may be difficult to imagine that one index  perhaps the most important  has not yet broken to new high ground the value line geometric composite vlg which tracks the median stock performance among a universe of  stocks formed a tridecadal triple top near the  level in   and  just recently the vlg again approached that level but was repelled despite that recent failure the fact that the vlg has clawed its way from a seemingly irrecoverable drop back to its former highs should be a source of optimism for bulls like the nonconfirmation in the advancedecline line the vlgs  divergence and subsequent rout was another piece of evidence that led us to believe that a cyclical market top was at hand that evidence is now immaterial with the vlg back at its former highs and should the vlg succeed in breaking decisively above its former peaks its significance probably cannot be overstated this would be an extremely broad market gauge breaking out above year triple top peaks to new alltime highs the shortterm and quite possibly longterm ramifications could be exceedingly bullish euro going to parity like it’s   december  this one wins our inhouse award for headline of the year the flip side of the us dollar breakout is the euros recent break of support and drop to year lows near  in the process the currency broke its post up trendline that had held it in  and twice in  with sentiment that is not overly bearish including euro futures positioning a drop to parity versus the dollar would not seem like too tall of a task at this point such an event would mark the only time other than  that saw the euro drop down to parity from above the  chart of the year investors overprepared for election volatility  november  looking back upon the year in the financial markets over all of the research and the s of posts and charts we published our  market theme for  was btbtd ie back to buying the dip after a rocky  this year saw behavior more reminiscent of the  vbottom days and our chart of the year helps explain why it goes back to the term structure of the volatility indicesit seemed that in  volatility instruments were the vehicle du jour for equity market hedging purposes when investors got nervous they bid up the nearterm volatility expectations relative to those further out and they did it regardless of how much weakness had already transpired in the equity market  of the highest readings ever recorded in the ratio of the day volatility index vxst to the month vix occurred in  the first occurred understandably into the market rout in january the other  representing the nd and rd highest readings ever occurred prior to brexit and the us election the odd thing about these readings is that they were registered despite very little stock market weakness to speak ofobviously traders were nervous about the  exogenous events and their potential impact on the markets now normally our inclination upon seeing a sentiment reading at an extreme would be to fade it after all the crowd is notoriously wrong at extremes however the funny thing about this vxstvix indicator and much of the volatility trade in general is that the extremes are often warranted at least in the shortterm that is these traders are often correct at least briefly so too were they briefly correct following the brexit vote and the us election however they would have had to cash in quickly in order for any payoff within days following brexit the market had turned around and started shooting higher and even quicker following a wicked us election night selloff stocks began to scream higher by the open of the following daywhy did the weakness fail to hold following these events probably partially because of the overpreparedness of the volatility traders as we stated their substantial hedging going into the events significantly cushioned the damage incurred in their aftermath without the pain being felt there was little reason for stocks to continue to sell off then it became a mad rush for the volatility exits as btbtd took over thank you again to everyone for reading heres to another interesting and prosperous year in  dana lyons partner the
