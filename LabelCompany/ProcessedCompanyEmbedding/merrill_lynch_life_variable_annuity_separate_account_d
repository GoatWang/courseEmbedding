elect one of the gmdb options available under the contract once you elect a gmdb option you cannot change or cancel it if you purchase a gmdb under the b class l class or c class contracts the death benefit equals the greater of the account value less uncollected charges or the gmdb base however if you purchase a gmdb under the xc class contract the death benefit equals the greater of the account

on or after the date the gmwb rider becomes effective if a withdrawal causes total withdrawals for that contract year to exceed the guaranteed lifetime amount the gmdb base equals the lesser of the account value after the excess withdrawal or the gmdb base reduced by the withdrawal amount the gmdb base is not permitted to exceed the gmwb base therefore if the resulting gmdb base is higher than

then the gmdb base will be reset to equal the current contract value if lower please note that the return of premium gmdb gmwb version differs from the standard return of premium gmdb in the following ways  the gmdb base is reduced dollarfordollar for withdrawals in any contract year up to the current guaranteed lifetime amount whereas all withdrawals under the standard return of premium gmdb reduce the gmdb base proportionately  if a withdrawal causes total withdrawals for that contract year to exceed the guaranteed lifetime amount the gmdb base equals the lesser of the account value after the excess withdrawal or the gmdb base reduced by the withdrawal amount  the gmdb base is not permitted to exceed the gmwb base therefore if the resulting gmdb base is higher than your gmwb base

management investment companies the “funds” the companies may also make fixed account options available under the contracts in the future  the contracts are individual flexible premium deferred variable annuity contracts issued by the companies through the separate accounts the contracts provide for the accumulation of values on a variable basis during the accumulation period and provide for a variety of annuity settlement options certain contracts may be purchased on a nonqualified tax basis certain contracts also may be purchased and used in connection with start printed page plans qualifying for favorable federal income tax treatment the contracts currently offer four different charge structures each referred to as a “class” each class including an xc class described in more detail below imposes different surrender charges and assetbased insurance charges  the owner determines at the time of application for a contract how premium payments will be allocated among the subaccounts of the applicable separate account the owner generally may allocate premium payments to up to  of any of the available subaccounts the contract value which is the total value of an owners interest in the contract will vary with the investment performance of the subaccounts selected and the owner bears the entire risk for amounts allocated to the subaccounts  during the free look period an owner has the right to return his or her contract within ten days or longer if required by state law if the contract is returned during the free look period the amount refunded will equal the contract value as of the date mllic or mlny receives the returned contract however in those states that require a return of premium payments in the event of contract cancellation the companies will instead return the greater of all premium payments paid into the contract less any withdrawals or the contract value as of the date mllic or mlny receives the returned contract in states that require a return of premium payments the companies will allocate all premium payments to a money market subaccount during the first fourteen days following the contract date in those states the companies bear any investment risk associated with the premium payments during the free look period otherwise the owner will bear any investment risk associated with the premium payments during the free look period the companies will not assess surrender charges against a contract returned during the free look period the companies will generally pay the refund within seven days after they receive the returned contract the contract will then be considered void as described in more detail below the companies intend to recapture bonus amounts added to the contract value if the owner returns the contract during the free look period  the owner may surrender the contract or make a partial withdrawal from contract value during the accumulation period the minimum amount that may be withdrawn is  and at least  must remain in the contract after a partial withdrawal and any associated surrender charge is made if an owner surrenders a contract or takes a partial withdrawal the companies may deduct a surrender charge to compensate them for expenses relating to the sale of the contracts such as commissions preparation of sales literature and other promotional activity upon partial withdrawal the companies also may deduct any applicable premium taxes upon surrender the companies also will deduct any applicable contract fee accrued but uncollected rider charges and premium taxes the surrender charge will be reduced using the “free withdrawal amount” provided for in the contract the free withdrawal amount is the portion of any partial withdrawal or surrender that is not subject to a surrender charge the free withdrawal amount is the greater of a  of the amount of each premium subject to a surrender charge not to exceed the amount of each premium that had not been previously withdrawn as of the beginning of the contract year less any prior withdrawals during that contract year and b the “gain” in the contract plus premiums remaining in the contract that are no longer subject to a surrender charge any amount previously withdrawn from the contract during that contract year will be taken into account in determining the “free withdrawal amount” available as of the date of the withdrawal request for the purpose of calculating the surrender charge the companies make withdrawals as if gain is withdrawn first followed by premiums premium payments are assumed to be withdrawn on a firstin firstout “fifo” basis the surrender charge equals a percentage of each premium withdrawn with regard to the xc class offered under the contracts each premium is subject to the charge for the applicable period specified below from the date it is received and accepted by mllic or mlny as follows complete years elapsed since payment of premiumsurrender charge percentage as a percentage of the premium payment as described in more detail below the companies may recapture all or a portion of the bonus amounts added to the contract value if the owner surrenders the contract or makes a partial withdrawal within three years of mllics or mlnys receipt and acceptance of a premium payment  under certain circumstances the contract may be terminated due to inactivity if no premiums have been received during the prior  months the total of all premiums paid less any partial withdrawals is less than  and the contract value is less than  then the contract may be terminated no contract will be terminated solely due to negative investment performance termination for inactivity is treated as a surrender for purposes of bonus recapture  during the accumulation period the companies will pay a death benefit upon the owners death upon the death of the first owner to die if there are coowners or upon the death of the first annuitant if any owner is not a natural person unless the owner selects an optional guaranteed minimum death benefit “gmdb” the death benefit will equal the contract value  the contracts provide four gmdb options that an owner may select to purchase for an additional charge if the owner or the older owner if the contract has coowners or the annuitant if the owner is a nonnatural person is age  or under if the owner dies within  days of the contract date or within one year of the date of a change of owner any gmdb will equal the contract value some gmdb options may not be available in every state if the owner purchases a gmdb the death benefit equals the greater of the contract value or the gmdb base the current calculation for each gmdb base is described below  in addition to the above death benefits and for an additional charge an owner may elect the additional death benefit rider if the owner or the older owner if the contract has coowners or the older annuitant if the owner is a nonnatural person is age  or under this rider is designed to help offset expenses including income taxes attributable to payment of death benefit proceeds the additional death benefit rider may not be available in all states upon payment of the death benefit the companies may deduct any applicable premium taxes  as described in more detail below the companies will recapture any bonus amounts added to the contract value if the owner the first owner to die if there are coowners or the first annuitant if any owner is not a natural start printed page person dies within six months of mllics or mlnys receipt and acceptance of the corresponding premium payment however if an owner dies and the contract is continued under the spousal benefit continuation option any bonus amounts not previously recaptured will no longer be subject to recapture as of the spousal continuation date  if an owner elects the xc class under the contracts then the companies will add a bonus amount to the contract value each time the owner makes a premium payment with regard to an initial premium payment the companies will apply the corresponding bonus amount to an owners contract value on the contract date with regard to each additional premium payment the companies will apply a corresponding bonus amount to an owners contract value at the end of the valuation period during which that premium payment is received and accepted at mllics or mlnys service center  to calculate each bonus amount the companies will allocate the corresponding premium payment to one or more bonus tiers based on the amount of cumulative premium payments made under the contract as follows if cumulative premium payments arethen maximum bonus amount percentage isthen current bonus percentage isthen minimum guaranteed bonus percentage isless than or equal to greater than  but less than or equal to greater than  but less than or equal to greater than  but less than or equal to greater than  thus the companies may apply different bonus percentages to each premium payment unless cumulative premium payments are less than or equal to  by breaking out the payment according to the ranges in the above table and multiplying the portion of the payment allocated to each tier by that tiers current bonus amount percentage however a premium payment will only be allocated to the first tier if cumulative premium payments are less than or equal to  if the initial premium payment exceeds  the first tier will not apply and the second tier will apply to all cumulative premiums less than or equal to  for example an initial premium payment of  would receive a maximum bonus amount of   ×  tier  if the initial premium payment is  the maximum bonus amount would be   ×  tier  however an initial premium payment of  would receive a maximum bonus amount of   ×  tier    ×  tier    ×  tier  no bonus amount or subsequent recapture thereof as discussed below will be based on a percentage that exceeds the maximum bonus amount percentages shown in the above table when calculating each bonus amount “cumulative premium payments” do not include bonus amounts previously added to contract value the bonus amount is allocated among the subaccounts in the same manner as the corresponding premium payment the companies may change the current bonus amount percentage but it will never be less than the minimum guaranteed bonus amount percentage listed in the table from time to time the companies may offer promotional programs with promotional rates for xc class contracts issued within specified periods of time each a “promotional period” such promotional programs may apply to initial andor subsequent premium payments received during the promotional period initial andor subsequent premium payments received after the promotional period will receive the current bonus amount percentage in effect at that time the promotional period will never exceed the maximum bonus amount the companies may terminate any promotional programs or offer other promotional programs at any time in their sole discretion  if the owner returns the contract during the free look period then the owner will not receive any portion of the bonus amounts ie the companies will “recapture” the full amount of each bonus in the event of the death of the owner or upon the death of the first owner to die if there are coowners or upon the death of the first annuitant if any owner is not a natural person the companies will recapture any bonus amounts corresponding to premium payments received and accepted within the previous six months of death thus under the xc class if an optional guaranteed minimum death benefit “gmdb” is not chosen the death benefit equals the contract value less any bonus amounts credited in the prior six months if a gmdb is chosen the death benefit equals the greater of the contract value less any bonus amounts credited in the prior six months or the gmdb base as defined above however in the event the contract is continued under the spousal benefit continuation option any bonus amounts not previously recaptured will no longer be subject to recapture as of the spousal continuation date in the event of partial withdrawal or surrender within three years of mllics or mlnys receipt and acceptance of a premium payment the companies may recapture all or a portion of the corresponding bonus amount based on the bonus recapture percentages presented in the following schedule completed years since receipt and acceptance of premium paymentbonus recapture percentage for surrenders and partial withdrawals  the companies will recapture any bonus amounts subject to recapture from the owners contract value at the end of the valuation period during which the transaction request is received and accepted at mllics or mlnys service center for each premium payment the bonus amount subject to recapture is equal to the applicable bonus recapture percentage multiplied by a minus b where a is the bonus amount attributable to that premium and b is the sum of each start printed page previously recaptured bonus amount attributable to that premium payment divided by the bonus recapture percentage on the date such amount was recaptured  the companies will deduct bonus amounts subject to recapture based on the associated premiums withdrawn from the contract which are determined on a “firstin first out” or “fifo” basis currently the companies do not recapture any bonus amounts on withdrawals that are within the “free withdrawal amount” the companies reserve the right to recapture bonus amounts on withdrawals that are within the “free withdrawal amount” in the future the amount actually recaptured is based on the bonus amount subject to recapture multiplied by the ratio of i the associated premium payment withdrawn that was subject to a surrender charge to ii the total amount of that premium payment remaining in the contract immediately prior to the withdrawal that was subject to a surrender charge the companies will deduct any recaptured bonus amounts on a pro rata basis from among the subaccounts the owner is invested in based on the ratio of the owners subaccount value to his or her total subaccount value before the partial withdrawal  if the companies recapture a bonus amount they will take back the bonus amount as if it had never been applied however the accumulated gain or loss on bonus amounts is never subject to recapture thus an owner bears any investment loss and retains any investment gain attributable to bonus amounts the companies will not recredit any charges including assetbased insurance charges imposed on bonus amounts subsequently recaptured  although not currently permitted in the future the companies may permit an owner to partially annuitize the contract partial annuitizations would be considered to be partial withdrawals for purposes of calculations under the contract including bonus recaptures  in addition to the fees and charges discussed above the companies deduct various other fees and charges these currently include an assetbased insurance charge that varies by subaccount under the xc class contract this charge currently ranges from  to  of subaccount assets guaranteed not to exceed  a current annual contract fee of  guaranteed not to exceed  which will apply if the greater of contract value or premiums less withdrawals is less than  transfer fee of  guaranteed not to exceed  for each transfer above  per contract year premium taxes or other taxes by any governmental entity and fees for optional benefits or riders applicants legal analysis  the applicants respectfully request that the commission pursuant to section c of the act grant the exemptions set forth below to permit the applicants to recapture all or a portion of bonus amounts attributable to premium payments under the contracts xc class when an owner  returns the contract during the free look period  dies within six months of receipt and acceptance by mllic or mlny of a premium payment unless the contract is continued under the spousal benefit continuation option or  surrenders the contract in full or in part or the surrender value is paid to the owner because the contract has been terminated for inactivity within three years of receipt and acceptance by mllic or mlny of a premium payment pursuant to a bonus recapture schedule  because the provisions described below may be inconsistent with a recapture of bonus amounts the applicants request exemptions for the contracts described herein and for future contracts from sections a and ia of the act and rule c thereunder pursuant to section c to the extent necessary to recapture the bonus amounts as described above the applicants seek exemptions therefrom in order to avoid any questions concerning the contracts compliance with the act and rules thereunder for the reasons discussed below the exemptions requested herein are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act  to the extent that the bonus amount recapture might be seen as a discount from the net asset value or might be viewed as resulting in the payment to an owner of less than the proportionate share of the issuers net assets the bonus amount recapture would trigger the need for relief absent some exemption from the act rule c provides in relevant part that a registered separate account and any depositor of such account shall be exempt from sections a c c c and d of the act and rule c thereunder to the extent necessary to permit them to impose a deferred sales load on any variable annuity contract participating in such account however the bonus amount recapture is not a sales load but a recapture of bonus amounts mllic or mlny previously attributed to an owners premium payments the companies provide the bonus amounts from their general accounts on a guaranteed basis the contracts are designed to be longterm investment vehicles in undertaking this financial obligation the companies contemplate that an owner will retain a contract over an extended period consistent with the longterm nature of the contracts the companies designed the product so that they would recover their costs including the bonus amounts over an anticipated duration while a contract is in force if an owner withdraws his money during the free look period or a death benefit is paid or a withdrawal or surrender is made before this anticipated period the companies must recapture the bonus amounts subject to recapture in order to avoid a loss  the recapture of bonus amounts does not violate section a of the act the bonus amount recapture provision pursuant to the contracts xc class does not deprive the owner of his or her proportionate share of the issuers current net assets in the case of death of the owner an owner will have the full right to any bonus amounts not previously recaptured six months following mllics or mlnys receipt and acceptance of the corresponding premium payment in the case of partial or full surrender an owners right to a portion of a bonus amount not previously recaptured will begin one year following mllics or mlnys receipt and acceptance of the corresponding premium payment and an owner will have the full right to any such remaining bonus amount three years following mllics or mlnys receipt and acceptance of the corresponding premium payment until that time the companies retain the right and interest in the dollar amount of any bonus amounts subject to recapture thus when the companies recapture all or a portion of a bonus amount they are only retrieving their own assets and because an owner does not have an interest in the bonus amount such owner would not be deprived of a proportionate share of the applicable separate accounts assets the issuers current net assets in violation of section a therefore such recapture does not reduce the amount of the applicable separate accounts current net assets an owner would otherwise be entitled to receive however to avoid uncertainty as to full compliance with the act the applicants request an exemption from the start printed page provisions of sections a and ia to the extent deemed necessary to permit them to recapture all or a portion of the bonus amounts under the contracts and future contracts  as a result of the bonus amounts available under the contracts xc class an owner who made an initial premium payment of  in the first contract year could be viewed as having a contract value of  before any earnings accrued the companies addition of bonus amounts might arguably be viewed as resulting in an owner purchasing a redeemable security for a price below the current net asset value further by recapturing the bonus amounts the companies might arguably be redeeming a redeemable security for a price other than one based on the current net asset value of the applicable separate account  an owners interest in his or her contract value would always be offered at a price based on the net asset value next calculated after receipt of the order the granting of bonus amounts does not reflect a reduction of that price instead the companies will purchase with their own general account assets an interest in the applicable separate account equal to the bonus amounts because the bonus amounts will be paid out of mllics or mlnys assets not the applicable separate accounts assets no dilution will occur as a result of the bonus amounts  the recapture of bonus amounts does not involve either of the two harms that the commission intended to eliminate or reduce with rule c the commissions stated purposes in adopting rule c were to avoid or minimize  dilution of the interests of other security holders and  speculative trading practices that are unfair to such holders these two concerns were the result of backward pricing the practice of basing the price of a mutual fund share on the net asset value per share determined as of the close of the market on the previous day backward pricing allowed investors to take advantage of increases or decreases in net asset value that were not yet reflected in the price and thereby the values of outstanding mutual fund shares were diluted  the proposed recapture of bonus amounts under the contracts does not pose such threat of dilution the bonus amount recapture will not alter an owners net asset value the companies will determine an owners surrender value an amount equal to the contract value reduced by any charges including the surrender charge and increased by any credits applied upon surrender under a contract in accordance with rule c on a basis next computed after receipt of an owners request for surrender likewise the calculation of death benefits and annuity payment amounts will be in full compliance with the forward pricing requirement of rule c the amount recaptured will equal all or a portion of bonus amounts that mllic or mlny paid out of its general account assets it is not administratively feasible to track the bonus amount in the separate accounts after the companies apply the bonus as a result the assetbased charges applicable to the separate accounts will be assessed against the entire amount held in the separate accounts including the bonus amount during the time the bonus amount is subject to recapture during this time the aggregate assetbased charges assessed against an owners contract value will be higher than those that would be charged if the owners contract value did not include the bonus amount but the increment will obviously be only a small percentage of the bonus amount on the other hand an owner will retain any investment benefit from the bonus amount although an owner will retain any investment gain attributable to the bonus amounts the companies will determine the amount of such gain on the basis of the current net asset value of the subaccount thus no dilution will occur upon the recapture of bonus amounts  further the other harm that rule c was designed to address speculative trading practices calculated to take advantage of backward pricing will not occur as a result of mllics or mlnys recapture of a bonus amount variable annuities are designed for longterm investment and by their nature do not lend themselves to the kind of speculative shortterm trading that rule c was designed to prevent more to the point the bonus recapture simply does not create the opportunity for speculative trading  rule c should have no application to a bonus amount as neither of the harms that rule c was designed to address are present in the recapture of bonus amounts however to avoid uncertainty as to full compliance with the act the applicants request an exemption from the provisions of rule c to the extent deemed necessary to permit them to recapture bonus amounts available through the xc class under the contracts and future contracts  the commission should grant the exemptions requested in this application even if the bonus amounts described herein arguably conflicts with sections a or ia of the act or rule c thereunder the bonus amount provisions are generally beneficial to owners the recapture provisions temper this benefit somewhat but only if an owner redeems his or her money under the circumstances described herein while there would be a small downside in a declining market where an owner would bear any losses attributable to the bonus amounts it is the converse of the benefits an owner would receive on the bonus amounts in a rising market as any earnings on bonus amounts applied would not be subject to recapture and thus would be immediately available to an owner likewise any losses on bonus amounts would also not be subject to recapture and thus would be immediately available to an owner the bonus amount recapture provision does not diminish the overall value of the bonus amounts  mllics or mlnys recapture of bonus amounts is designed to prevent antiselection against it the risk of antiselection would be that an owner could make significant premium payments into the contract solely in order to receive a quick profit from the bonus amounts by recapturing the bonus amounts the companies protect themselves against the risk that an owner will make such large premium payments receive the bonus amounts and then withdraw his or her money from the contract the companies generally protect themselves from this kind of antiselection and recover their costs in situations where an owner withdraws his or her money early in the life of a contract by imposing a surrender charge however where an owner withdraws his money during the free look period or a death benefit is paid the companies do not apply this charge  the applicants seek relief herein not only for themselves with respect to the support of the contracts but also with respect to future accounts or future contracts described herein the applicants represent that the terms of the relief requested with respect to any contracts or future contracts funded by the separate accounts or future accounts are consistent with the standards set forth in section c of the act and commission precedent the commission has previously granted class relief from certain specified provisions of the act for separate accounts that support variable annuity contracts that is materially similar to the relief described in this application start printed page   in addition the applicants seek relief herein with respect to future underwriters ie a class consisting of nasd member brokerdealers that may also act as principal underwriter of the contracts and future contracts the commission has regularly granted relief to “future underwriters” that are not named and are not affiliates of the applicants the applicants represent that the terms of the relief requested with respect to any future underwriters are consistent with the standards set forth in section c of the act and commission precedent  without the requested class relief exemptive relief for any future account future contract or future underwriter would have to be requested and obtained separately these additional requests for exemptive relief would present no issues under the act not already addressed herein if the applicants were to repeatedly seek exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed herein investors would not receive additional protection or benefit and investors and the applicants could be disadvantaged by increased costs from preparing such additional requests for relief the requested class relief is appropriate in the public interest because the relief will promote competitiveness in the variable annuity market by eliminating the need for the companies to file redundant exemptive applications thereby reducing administrative expenses and maximizing efficient use of resources elimination of the delay and the expense of repeatedly seeking exemptive relief would enhance the applicants ability to effectively take advantage of business opportunities as such opportunities arise the applicants request for class exemptions is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act and that an order of the commission including such class relief should therefore be granted any entity that currently intends to rely on the requested exemptive order is named as an applicant any entity that relies upon the requested order in the future will comply with the terms and conditions contained in this application start signature for the commission by the division of investment management under

companies obligations under the contracts be altered in any way the companies or their affiliates will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the substitutions including brokerage legal accounting and other fees and expenses the substitutions will not cause the contract fees and charges currently being paid by affected contract owners to be greater after the substitutions than before the

approving the substitutions section c requires the depositor of a registered unit investment trust holding the securities of a single issuer to obtain commission approval before substituting the securities held by the trust section c requires the commission to issue such an order if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act  applicants submit that the terms and conditions of the substitutions meet the standards set forth in section c and assert that the replacement of an existing fund with the corresponding replacement fund is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the l act as described in the application for a period of two years following the effective date the companies or their affiliates will reimburse any contract owner affected by the proposed substitutions involving transamerica series trust replacement funds and whose subaccount invests in the replacement fund to the extent a replacement funds net annual operating expenses exceeds the net annual operating expenses of the

administered and managed more efficiently and one that is more competitive with other variable products the rights of affected contract owners and the obligations of the companies under the contracts will not be altered by the substitutions affected contract owners will not incur any additional tax liability or any additional fees and expenses as a result of the substitutions  each of the prospectuses for the contracts discloses that the issuing company reserves the right subject to compliance with applicable law to substitute shares of another registered openend management investment company for shares of an openend management investment company held by a subaccount of an account  applicants also assert that none of the proposed substitutions is of the type that section c was designed to prevent unlike a traditional unit investment trust where a depositor could only substitute an investment start printed page security in a manner which permanently affected all the investors in the trust the contracts provide each contract owner with the right to exercise his or her own judgment and transfer account values into other subaccounts moreover the contracts will offer affected contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts into any of the remaining subaccounts without cost or other disadvantage the substitution therefore will not result in the type of costly forced redemptions that section c was designed to prevent applicants also maintain that the substitutions are unlike the type of substitutions which section c was designed to prevent in that by purchasing a contract contract owners select much more than a particular registered management openend investment company in which to invest their account values they also select the specific type of insurance coverage offered by the companies under their contracts as well as other rights and privileges set forth in the contracts applicants conditions applicants

shares in conformity with section c of the  act and rule c thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by applicants the substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any contracts held by affected contract owners  the proposed substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected contract owners in connection with their contracts and no tax liability will arise for affected contract owners as a result of the substitutions  the rights or obligations of the companies under the contracts of affected contract owners will not be altered in any way  affected contract owners will be permitted to make at least one transfer of contract value from the subaccount investing in the existing fund before the effective date or the replacement fund after the effective date to any other available investment option under the contract without charge for a period beginning at least  days before the effective date through at least
