purchaseedit on september   kraft made a hostile £ billion takeover bid for the british confectionery group cadbury makers of dairy milk and bournville chocolate on november  the companys bid then £ billion was rejected by cadbury which called it a derisory offer kraft renewed the offer on december  it had significant political and public opposition in the united kingdom and abroad leading to a call for the government to implement economic protectionism in largecompany takeovers on january   cadbury approved a revised offer from kraft which valued the company at £ billion  billion some funds for the takeover were provided by the royal bank of scotland the british partially stateowned bank the cadbury purchase was part of the longterm strategy of irene rosenfeld ceo and kraft chairman since march  who developed a threeyear turnaround plan to increase kraft foods profits rosenfeld wanted to develop new markets and expand krafts product range when she became chairman it was assumed that the purchase of cadbury would help kraft products in new markets such as brazil and india because of cadbury’s presence in those markets india is one of its most resilient markets with percent sales growth and a percent increase in profits kraft believed the cadbury purchase was necessary because of the likelihood of a nestlehershey merger and it could generate annual savings of at least  million by the end of the third year rosenfeld saw the kraftcadbury merger as the logical next step in our transformation toward a highgrowth highermargin company to build a global powerhouse in snacks confectionery and quick meals the cadbury purchase gave kraft  percent of the global candy and gum market and the company wanted to avail itself of cadbury distribution in the developing markets of india brazil and mexico as incomes rose in those developing countries kraft hoped that products such as oreos would become impulse buys for children mars was second in the confectionery market with percent share followed by nestle with  percent at the time of the purchase the chocolate and sugar industry had been growing at a percent annual pace for the previous three years and was valued at  billion although its cadbury purchase was considered odd because kraft did not have a foothold in the confectionery market the company noted its production of confectionery foods such as toblerones and baked snacks such as oreos cadbury also owned chewinggum brands such as stride trident dentyne and chiclets cadbury chairman roger carr explained his approval of the takeover we believe the offer represents good value for cadbury shareholders and are pleased with the commitment that kraft foods has made to our heritage values and people throughout the world cadbury sales were flat after kraft’s acquisition despite the cadbury takeovers helping to boost sales by  percent krafts net profit for the fourth quarter fell  percent to  million due to costs associated with integrating the uk business after the acquisition kraft spent  billion on integration to achieve an estimated  million in annual savings by the end of  kraft increased prices to offset rising commodity costs for corn sugar and cocoa in north america and europe according to rosenfeld we expect it will remain weak for the foreseeable future taking into account integration costs the acquisition reduced krafts earnings per share by about  immediately after the cadbury purchase on march   kraft foods said it was truly sorry for its closure of cadburys somerdale factory senior kraft executive marc firestone made the public apology to mps at a parliamentary select committee hearing in march  kraft closed the plant listing the site for £ million and outsourcing production which the company had promised not

controversiesedit transfat litigationedit in  a california lawyer sued kraft for using trans fat in oreo cookies when kraft foods announced a transfatfree reformulation of oreos after the lawsuit was filed it was dropped the company denied that the change was made in response to the lawsuit noting that the reformulation had been planned long before the lawsuit in  two california residents evangeline red and rachel whitt filed a class action lawsuit against kraft foods for claiming that certain products are healthy when they contain trans fat kraft denied any wrongdoing saying that all packaging claims are true and legal after the plaintiffs claimed that kraft mislabeled vegetable thin and ritz crackers as made with real vegetables teddy grahams varieties of ritz crackers honey maid grahams premium saltines ginger snaps and vegetable thins contained trans fats with kraft presenting the products as healthy with phrases such as wholesome choice sensible snacking and made with real vegetables the plaintiffs argued that the claims violated the california unfair competition law consumer legal remedies act and false advertising law the lawsuit cited scientific consensus on the health effects of trans fats which cause coronary heart disease and has been linked to type  diabetes and some types of cancer according to the american heart association there is no safe level of trans fats in the diet based on trans fats and other unhealthy ingredients in kraft products the lawsuit argued that health claims such as a wholesome choice on teddy grahams and sensible snacking on several products are false no cholesterol claims are misleading because they imply that the snack is good for cholesterol levels when trans fats are worse for cholesterol health than dietary cholesterol claims such as made with real vegetables or real ginger and molasses are misleading because the products contain less of those ingredients than trans fats although teddy grahams packaging claimed to be a good source of calcium iron and zinc to support kids growth and development the claim was deceptive because its transfat content outweighed the minerals benefit phrases such as whole wheat and graham implied health benefits the products do not possess on each package some individual claims may be true but add to the deceptive message of overall healthfulness kraft denied any wrongdoing and its response briefs emphasized that its claims were technically true vegetable thins were made with real vegetables and the company argued that the statement could not be considered misleading kraft used a similar argument for claims such as good source of calcium iron and zinc to support kids growth and development and whole wheat about several packaging claims kraft argued that the statements could not be proven true or false for example the word wholesome is subjective promotional statements too vague to prove or disprove known as puffery are not actionable under law kraft argued that wholesome sensible and smart are puffery and could not be found misleading or deceitful the class action received  of its requested  million political campaignedit in  kraft contributed  to a  million political campaign known as the coalition against the costly food labeling proposition sponsored by farmers and food producers the organization was founded to oppose proposition  a california citizens initiative mandating the labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients as a result there were calls for a boycott of kraft products environmental recordedit for

pricefixing allegationedit the us commodity and futures commission ctfc alleged that mondelez international and its former subsidiary mondelez global bought  million £ million of wheat futures with no intention of taking delivery according to the ctfc the purchase raised the price of the commodity and earned the company  million recallsedit main article starlink corn recall in september  up to

the british confectionery group cadbury makers of dairy milk and bournville chocolate on november  the companys bid then £ billion was rejected by cadbury which called it a derisory offer kraft renewed the offer on december  it had significant political and public opposition in the united kingdom and abroad leading to a call for the government to implement economic protectionism in largecompany takeovers on january   cadbury approved a revised offer from kraft which valued the company at £ billion  billion some funds for the takeover were provided by the royal bank of scotland the british partially stateowned bank the cadbury purchase was part of the longterm strategy of irene rosenfeld ceo and kraft chairman since march  who developed a threeyear turnaround plan to increase kraft foods profits rosenfeld wanted to develop new markets and expand krafts product range when she became chairman it was assumed that the purchase of cadbury would help kraft products in new markets such as brazil and india because of cadbury’s presence in those markets india is one of its most resilient markets with percent sales growth and a percent increase in profits kraft believed the cadbury purchase was necessary because of the likelihood of a nestlehershey merger and it could generate annual savings of at least  million by the end of the third year rosenfeld saw the kraftcadbury merger as the logical next step in our transformation toward a highgrowth highermargin company to build a global powerhouse in snacks confectionery and quick meals the cadbury purchase gave kraft  percent of the global candy and gum market and the company wanted to avail itself of cadbury distribution in the developing markets of india brazil and mexico as incomes rose in those developing countries kraft hoped that products such as oreos would become impulse buys for children mars was second in the confectionery market with percent share followed by nestle with  percent at the time of the purchase the chocolate and sugar industry had been growing at a percent annual pace for the previous three years and was valued at  billion although its cadbury purchase was considered odd because kraft did not have a foothold in the confectionery market the company noted its production of confectionery foods such as toblerones and baked snacks such as oreos cadbury also owned chewinggum brands such as stride trident dentyne and chiclets cadbury chairman roger carr explained his approval of the takeover we believe the offer represents good value for cadbury shareholders and are pleased with the commitment that kraft foods has made to our heritage values and people throughout the world cadbury sales were flat after kraft’s acquisition despite the cadbury takeovers helping to boost sales by  percent krafts net profit for the fourth quarter fell  percent to  million due to costs associated with integrating the uk business after the acquisition kraft spent  billion on integration to achieve an estimated  million in annual savings by the end of  kraft increased prices to offset rising commodity costs for corn sugar and cocoa in north america and europe according to rosenfeld we expect it will remain weak for the foreseeable future taking into account integration costs the acquisition reduced krafts earnings per share by about  immediately after the cadbury purchase on march   kraft foods said it was truly sorry for its closure of cadburys somerdale factory senior kraft executive marc firestone made the public apology to mps at a parliamentary select committee hearing in march  kraft closed the plant listing the site for £ million and outsourcing production which the company had promised not to do to poland although former cadbury workers demanded

smaller rival hershey the halfcash halfstock deal valued hershey stock at  a share hersheys board however unanimously rejected the offer controversiesedit transfat litigationedit in  a california lawyer sued kraft for using trans fat in oreo cookies when kraft foods announced a transfatfree reformulation of oreos after the lawsuit was filed it was dropped the company denied that the change was made in response to the lawsuit noting that the reformulation had been planned long before the lawsuit in  two california residents evangeline red and rachel whitt filed a class action lawsuit against kraft foods for claiming that certain products are healthy when they contain trans fat kraft denied any wrongdoing saying that all packaging claims are true and legal after the plaintiffs claimed that kraft mislabeled vegetable thin and ritz crackers as made with real vegetables teddy grahams varieties of ritz crackers honey maid grahams premium saltines ginger snaps and vegetable thins contained trans fats with kraft presenting the products as healthy with phrases such as wholesome choice sensible snacking and made with real vegetables the plaintiffs argued that the claims violated the california unfair competition law consumer legal remedies act and false advertising law the lawsuit cited scientific consensus on the health effects of trans fats which cause coronary heart disease and has been linked to type  diabetes and some types of cancer according to the american heart association there is no safe level of trans fats in the diet based on trans fats and other unhealthy ingredients in kraft products the lawsuit argued that health claims such as a wholesome choice on teddy grahams and sensible snacking on several products are false no cholesterol claims are misleading because they imply that the snack is good for cholesterol levels when trans fats are worse for cholesterol health than dietary cholesterol claims such as made with real vegetables or real ginger and molasses are misleading because the products contain less of those ingredients than trans fats although teddy grahams packaging claimed to be a good source of calcium iron and zinc to support kids growth and development the claim was deceptive because its transfat content outweighed the minerals benefit phrases such as whole wheat and graham implied health benefits the products do not possess on each package some individual claims may be true but add to the deceptive message of overall healthfulness kraft denied any wrongdoing and its response briefs emphasized that its claims were technically true vegetable thins were made with real vegetables and the company argued that the statement could not be considered misleading kraft used a similar argument for claims such as good source of calcium iron and zinc to support kids growth and development and whole wheat about several packaging claims kraft argued that the statements could not be proven true or false for example the word wholesome is subjective promotional statements too vague to prove or disprove known as puffery are not actionable under law kraft argued that wholesome sensible and smart are puffery and could not be found misleading or deceitful the class action received  of its requested  million political campaignedit in  kraft contributed  to a  million political campaign known as the coalition against the costly food labeling proposition sponsored by farmers and food producers the organization was founded to oppose proposition  a california citizens initiative mandating the labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients as a result there were calls for a boycott of kraft products environmental recordedit for years kraft purchased paper for its packaging from asia pulp  paper the thirdlargest paper producer in the world which was called a forest criminal for destroying precious habitat in indonesia’s rain forest in  when kraft cancelled its contract with asia pulp

ctfc alleged that mondelez international and its former subsidiary mondelez global bought  million £ million of wheat futures with no intention of taking delivery according to the ctfc the purchase

the british confectionery group cadbury makers of dairy milk and bournville chocolate on november  the companys bid then £ billion was rejected by cadbury which called it a derisory offer kraft renewed the offer on december  it had significant political and public opposition in the united kingdom and abroad leading to a call for the government to implement economic protectionism in largecompany takeovers on january   cadbury approved a revised offer from kraft which valued the company at £ billion  billion some funds for the takeover were provided by the royal bank of scotland the british partially stateowned bank the cadbury purchase was part of the longterm strategy of irene rosenfeld ceo and kraft chairman since march  who developed a threeyear turnaround plan to increase kraft foods profits rosenfeld wanted to develop new markets and expand krafts product range when she became chairman it was assumed that the purchase of cadbury would help kraft products in new markets such as brazil and india because of cadbury’s presence in those markets india is one of its most resilient markets with percent sales growth and a percent increase in profits kraft believed the cadbury purchase was necessary because of the likelihood of a nestlehershey merger and it could generate annual savings of at least  million by the end of the third year rosenfeld saw the kraftcadbury merger as the logical next step in our transformation toward a highgrowth highermargin company to build a global powerhouse in snacks confectionery and quick meals the cadbury purchase gave kraft  percent of the global candy and gum market and the company wanted to avail itself of cadbury distribution in the developing markets of india brazil and mexico as incomes rose in those developing countries kraft hoped that products such as oreos would become impulse buys for children mars was second in the confectionery market with percent share followed by nestle with  percent at the time of the purchase the chocolate and sugar industry had been growing at a percent annual pace for the previous three years and was valued at  billion although its cadbury purchase was considered odd because kraft did not have a foothold in the confectionery market the company noted its production of confectionery foods such as toblerones and baked snacks such as oreos cadbury also owned chewinggum brands such as stride trident dentyne and chiclets cadbury chairman roger carr explained his approval of the takeover we believe the offer represents good value for cadbury shareholders and are pleased with the commitment that kraft foods has made to our heritage values and people throughout the world cadbury sales were flat after kraft’s acquisition despite the cadbury takeovers helping to boost sales by  percent krafts net profit for the fourth quarter fell  percent to  million due to costs associated with integrating the uk business after the acquisition kraft spent  billion on integration to achieve an estimated  million in annual savings by the end of  kraft increased prices to offset rising commodity costs for corn sugar and cocoa in north america and europe according to rosenfeld we expect it will remain weak for the foreseeable future taking into account integration costs the acquisition reduced krafts earnings per share by about  immediately after the cadbury purchase on march   kraft foods said it was truly sorry for its closure of cadburys somerdale factory senior kraft executive marc firestone made the public apology to mps at a parliamentary select committee hearing in march  kraft closed the plant listing the site for £ million and outsourcing production which the company had promised not to do to poland although former cadbury workers demanded

smaller rival hershey the halfcash halfstock deal valued hershey stock at  a share hersheys board however unanimously rejected the offer controversiesedit transfat litigationedit in  a california lawyer sued kraft for using trans fat in oreo cookies when kraft foods announced a transfatfree reformulation of oreos after the lawsuit was filed it was dropped the company denied that the change was made in response to the lawsuit noting that the reformulation had been planned long before the lawsuit in  two california residents evangeline red and rachel whitt filed a class action lawsuit against kraft foods for claiming that certain products are healthy when they contain trans fat kraft denied any wrongdoing saying that all packaging claims are true and legal after the plaintiffs claimed that kraft mislabeled vegetable thin and ritz crackers as made with real vegetables teddy grahams varieties of ritz crackers honey maid grahams premium saltines ginger snaps and vegetable thins contained trans fats with kraft presenting the products as healthy with phrases such as wholesome choice sensible snacking and made with real vegetables the plaintiffs argued that the claims violated the california unfair competition law consumer legal remedies act and false advertising law the lawsuit cited scientific consensus on the health effects of trans fats which cause coronary heart disease and has been linked to type  diabetes and some types of cancer according to the american heart association there is no safe level of trans fats in the diet based on trans fats and other unhealthy ingredients in kraft products the lawsuit argued that health claims such as a wholesome choice on teddy grahams and sensible snacking on several products are false no cholesterol claims are misleading because they imply that the snack is good for cholesterol levels when trans fats are worse for cholesterol health than dietary cholesterol claims such as made with real vegetables or real ginger and molasses are misleading because the products contain less of those ingredients than trans fats although teddy grahams packaging claimed to be a good source of calcium iron and zinc to support kids growth and development the claim was deceptive because its transfat content outweighed the minerals benefit phrases such as whole wheat and graham implied health benefits the products do not possess on each package some individual claims may be true but add to the deceptive message of overall healthfulness kraft denied any wrongdoing and its response briefs emphasized that its claims were technically true vegetable thins were made with real vegetables and the company argued that the statement could not be considered misleading kraft used a similar argument for claims such as good source of calcium iron and zinc to support kids growth and development and whole wheat about several packaging claims kraft argued that the statements could not be proven true or false for example the word wholesome is subjective promotional statements too vague to prove or disprove known as puffery are not actionable under law kraft argued that wholesome sensible and smart are puffery and could not be found misleading or deceitful the class action received  of its requested  million political campaignedit in  kraft contributed  to a  million political campaign known as the coalition against the costly food labeling proposition sponsored by farmers and food producers the organization was founded to oppose proposition  a california citizens initiative mandating the labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients as a result there were calls for a boycott of kraft products environmental recordedit for years kraft purchased paper for its packaging from asia pulp

the british confectionery group cadbury makers of dairy milk and bournville chocolate on november  the companys bid then £ billion was rejected by cadbury which called it a derisory offer kraft renewed the offer on december  it had significant political and public opposition in the united kingdom and abroad leading to a call for the government to implement economic protectionism in largecompany takeovers on january   cadbury approved a revised offer from kraft which valued the company at £ billion  billion some funds for the takeover were provided by the royal bank of scotland the british partially stateowned bank the cadbury purchase was part of the longterm strategy of irene rosenfeld ceo and kraft chairman since march  who developed a threeyear turnaround plan to increase kraft foods profits rosenfeld wanted to develop new markets and expand krafts product range when she became chairman it was assumed that the purchase of cadbury would help kraft products in new markets such as brazil and india because of cadbury’s presence in those markets india is one of its most resilient markets with percent sales growth and a percent increase in profits kraft believed the cadbury purchase was necessary because of the likelihood of a nestlehershey merger and it could generate annual savings of at least  million by the end of the third year rosenfeld saw the kraftcadbury merger as the logical next step in our transformation toward a highgrowth highermargin company to build a global powerhouse in snacks confectionery and quick meals the cadbury purchase gave kraft  percent of the global candy and gum market and the company wanted to avail itself of cadbury distribution in the developing markets of india brazil and mexico as incomes rose in those developing countries kraft hoped that products such as oreos would become impulse buys for children mars was second in the confectionery market with percent share followed by nestle with  percent at the time of the purchase the chocolate and sugar industry had been growing at a percent annual pace for the previous three years and was valued at  billion although its cadbury purchase was considered odd because kraft did not have a foothold in the confectionery market the company noted its production of confectionery foods such as toblerones and baked snacks such as oreos cadbury also owned chewinggum brands such as stride trident dentyne and chiclets cadbury chairman roger carr explained his approval of the takeover we believe the offer represents good value for cadbury shareholders and are pleased with the commitment that kraft foods has made to our heritage values and people throughout the world cadbury sales were flat after kraft’s acquisition despite the cadbury takeovers helping to boost sales by  percent krafts net profit for the fourth quarter fell  percent to  million due to costs associated with integrating the uk business after the acquisition kraft spent  billion on integration to achieve an estimated  million in annual savings by the end of  kraft increased prices to offset rising commodity costs for corn sugar and cocoa in north america and europe according to rosenfeld we expect it will remain weak for the foreseeable future taking into account integration costs the acquisition reduced krafts earnings per share by about  immediately after the cadbury purchase on march   kraft foods said it was truly sorry for its closure of cadburys somerdale factory senior kraft executive marc firestone made the public apology to mps at a parliamentary select committee hearing in march  kraft closed the plant listing the site for £ million and outsourcing production which the company had promised not to do to poland although former cadbury workers demanded

smaller rival hershey the halfcash halfstock deal valued hershey stock at  a share hersheys board however unanimously rejected the offer controversiesedit transfat litigationedit in  a california lawyer sued kraft for using trans fat in oreo cookies when kraft foods announced a transfatfree reformulation of oreos after the lawsuit was filed it was dropped the company denied that the change was made in response to the lawsuit noting that the reformulation had been planned long before the lawsuit in  two california residents evangeline red and rachel whitt filed a class action lawsuit against kraft foods for claiming that certain products are healthy when they contain trans fat kraft denied any wrongdoing saying that all packaging claims are true and legal after the plaintiffs claimed that kraft mislabeled vegetable thin and ritz crackers as made with real vegetables teddy grahams varieties of ritz crackers honey maid grahams premium saltines ginger snaps and vegetable thins contained trans fats with kraft presenting the products as healthy with phrases such as wholesome choice sensible snacking and made with real vegetables the plaintiffs argued that the claims violated the california unfair competition law consumer legal remedies act and false advertising law the lawsuit cited scientific consensus on the health effects of trans fats which cause coronary heart disease and has been linked to type  diabetes and some types of cancer according to the american heart association there is no safe level of trans fats in the diet based on trans fats and other unhealthy ingredients in kraft products the lawsuit argued that health claims such as a wholesome choice on teddy grahams and sensible snacking on several products are false no cholesterol claims are misleading because they imply that the snack is good for cholesterol levels when trans fats are worse for cholesterol health than dietary cholesterol claims such as made with real vegetables or real ginger and molasses are misleading because the products contain less of those ingredients than trans fats although teddy grahams packaging claimed to be a good source of calcium iron and zinc to support kids growth and development the claim was deceptive because its transfat content outweighed the minerals benefit phrases such as whole wheat and graham implied health benefits the products do not possess on each package some individual claims may be true but add to the deceptive message of overall healthfulness kraft denied any wrongdoing and its response briefs emphasized that its claims were technically true vegetable thins were made with real vegetables and the company argued that the statement could not be considered misleading kraft used a similar argument for claims such as good source of calcium iron and zinc to support kids growth and development and whole wheat about several packaging claims kraft argued that the statements could not be proven true or false for example the word wholesome is subjective promotional statements too vague to prove or disprove known as puffery are not actionable under law kraft argued that wholesome sensible and smart are puffery and could not be found misleading or deceitful the class action received  of its requested  million political campaignedit in  kraft contributed  to a  million political campaign known as the coalition against the costly food labeling proposition sponsored by farmers and food producers the organization was founded to oppose proposition  a california citizens initiative mandating the labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients as a result there were calls for a boycott of kraft products environmental recordedit for years kraft purchased paper for its packaging from asia pulp

years earlier had sparked protest krafts announcement was received differently in part because kraft agreed not to close french factories and to keep the merged divisions headquarters near paris for at least three years in february  berkshire hathaway run by investor warren buffett announced that it had acquired an eightpercent stake in kraft then worth over  billion buffetts business partner charlie munger had also invested over  million in kraft according to the holding companys  annual report berkshire hathaway owned  percent of kraft foods outstanding stock on september   kraft replaced american international group on the dow jones industrial average in march  the company introduced mio a sugarfree noncaloric liquid flavoring product although it had no artificial flavors unlike its competitors it had artificial colors sweeteners and preservatives following trade liberalization in  india allowed imports of international brands and kraft decided to expand into the country currently it is represented in india by amit lohani owned max foods inc and has a pancountry distribution cadbury purchaseedit on september   kraft made a hostile £ billion takeover bid for the british confectionery group cadbury makers of dairy milk and bournville chocolate on november  the companys bid then £ billion was rejected by cadbury which called it a derisory offer kraft renewed the offer on december  it had significant political and public opposition in the united kingdom and abroad leading to a call for the government to implement economic protectionism in largecompany takeovers on january   cadbury approved a revised offer from kraft which valued the company at £ billion  billion some funds for the takeover were provided by the royal bank of scotland the british partially stateowned bank the cadbury purchase was part of the longterm strategy of irene rosenfeld ceo and kraft chairman since march  who developed a threeyear turnaround plan to increase kraft foods profits rosenfeld wanted to develop new markets and expand krafts product range when she became chairman it was assumed that the purchase of cadbury would help kraft products in new markets such as brazil and india because of cadbury’s presence in those markets india is one of its most resilient markets with percent sales growth and a percent increase in profits kraft believed the cadbury purchase was necessary because of the likelihood of a nestlehershey merger and it could generate annual savings of at least  million by the end of the third year rosenfeld saw the kraftcadbury merger as the logical next step in our transformation toward a highgrowth highermargin company to build a global powerhouse in snacks confectionery and quick meals the cadbury purchase gave kraft  percent of the global candy and gum market and the company wanted to avail itself of cadbury distribution in the developing markets of india brazil and mexico as incomes rose in those developing countries kraft hoped that products such as oreos would become impulse buys for children mars was second in the confectionery market with percent share followed by nestle with  percent at the time of the purchase the chocolate and sugar industry had been growing at a percent annual pace for the previous three years and was valued at  billion although its cadbury purchase was considered odd because kraft did not have a foothold in the confectionery market the company noted its production of confectionery foods such as toblerones and baked snacks such as oreos cadbury also owned chewinggum brands such as stride trident dentyne and chiclets cadbury chairman roger carr explained his approval of the takeover we believe the offer represents good value for cadbury shareholders and are pleased with the commitment that kraft foods has made to our heritage values and people throughout the world cadbury sales were flat after kraft’s acquisition despite the cadbury takeovers helping to boost sales by  percent krafts net profit for the fourth quarter fell  percent to  million due to costs associated with integrating the uk business after the acquisition kraft spent  billion on integration to achieve an estimated  million in annual savings by the end of  kraft increased prices to offset rising commodity costs for corn sugar and cocoa in north america and europe according to rosenfeld we expect it will remain weak for the foreseeable future taking into account integration costs the acquisition reduced krafts earnings per share by about  immediately after the cadbury purchase on march   kraft foods said it was truly sorry for its closure of cadburys somerdale factory senior kraft executive marc firestone made the public apology to mps at a parliamentary select committee hearing in march  kraft closed the plant listing the site for £ million and outsourcing production which the company had promised not to do to poland although former cadbury workers demanded an apology for the plants abrupt sale kraft ceo irene rosenfeld did not explain the companys action kraft uses the cadbury brand in emerging markets to expand its product range planning to invest  million in south african manufacturing plants over three years in april  president sanjay khosla said south africa is a priority market for us where we focus on power brands like cadbury chocolate sale of frozenpizza divisionedit on march   nestlé purchased krafts north american frozenpizza division for  billion although kraft stipulated a one to threeyear buyback option it did not exercise the option the sale included the digiorno tombstone and jacks brands in the united states the delissio brand in canada the california pizza kitchen license and manufacturing facilities in medford and little chute wisconsin in  the business with  employees had a net revenue of  billion kraft foods group and douwe egbertsedit former kraft foods logo in august  kraft foods announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies one snackfood and the other grocery the company changed its name to mondelez international specializing in snack foods in october  and a second company kraft foods group specializing in grocery items was split off kraft foods group later merged with heinz to become kraft heinz in  the company announced a merger of its coffee business with the dutch firm douwe egberts the company would be named jacobs douwe egberts the merger was confirmed on may   and completed on july   attempted hershey acquisitionedit on june   mondelez made a  billion offer to buy its smaller rival hershey the halfcash halfstock deal valued hershey stock at  a share hersheys board however unanimously rejected the offer controversiesedit transfat litigationedit in  a california lawyer sued kraft for using trans fat in oreo cookies when kraft foods announced a transfatfree reformulation of oreos after the lawsuit was filed it was dropped the company denied that the change was made in response to the lawsuit noting that the reformulation had been planned long before the lawsuit in  two california residents evangeline red and rachel whitt filed a class action lawsuit against kraft foods for claiming that certain products are healthy when they contain trans fat kraft denied any wrongdoing saying that all packaging claims are true and legal after the plaintiffs claimed that kraft mislabeled vegetable thin and ritz crackers as made with real vegetables teddy grahams varieties of ritz crackers honey maid grahams premium saltines ginger snaps and vegetable thins contained trans fats with kraft presenting the products as healthy with phrases such as wholesome choice sensible snacking and made with real vegetables the plaintiffs argued that the claims violated the california unfair competition law consumer legal remedies act and false advertising law the lawsuit cited scientific consensus on the health effects of trans fats which cause coronary heart disease and has been linked to type  diabetes and some types of cancer according to the american heart association there is no safe level of trans fats in the diet based on trans fats and other unhealthy ingredients in kraft products the lawsuit argued that health claims such as a wholesome choice on teddy grahams and sensible snacking on several products are false no cholesterol claims are misleading because they imply that the snack is good for cholesterol levels when trans fats are worse for cholesterol health than dietary cholesterol claims such as made with real vegetables or real ginger and molasses are misleading because the products contain less of those ingredients than trans fats although teddy grahams packaging claimed to be a good source of calcium iron and zinc to support kids growth and development the claim was deceptive because its transfat content outweighed the minerals benefit phrases such as whole wheat and graham implied health benefits the products do not possess on each package some individual claims may be true but add to the deceptive message of overall healthfulness kraft denied any wrongdoing and its response briefs emphasized that its claims were technically true vegetable thins were made with real vegetables and the company argued that the statement could not be considered misleading kraft used a similar argument for claims such as good source of calcium iron and zinc to support kids growth and development and whole wheat about several packaging claims kraft argued that the statements could not be proven true or false for example the word wholesome is subjective promotional statements too vague to prove or disprove known as puffery are not actionable under law kraft argued that wholesome sensible and smart are puffery and could not be found misleading or deceitful the class action received  of its requested  million political campaignedit in  kraft contributed  to a  million political campaign known as the coalition against the costly food labeling proposition sponsored by farmers and food producers the organization was founded to oppose proposition  a california citizens initiative mandating the labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients as a result there were calls for a boycott of kraft products environmental recordedit for years kraft purchased paper for its packaging from asia pulp  paper the thirdlargest paper producer in the world which was called a forest criminal for destroying precious habitat in indonesia’s rain forest in  when kraft cancelled its contract with asia pulp  paper greenpeace executive director phil radford commended the company for taking rainforest conservation seriously wheat futures pricefixing allegationedit the us commodity and futures commission ctfc alleged that mondelez international and its former subsidiary mondelez global bought  million £ million of wheat futures with no intention of taking delivery according to the ctfc the purchase raised the price of the commodity and earned the company  million recallsedit main article starlink corn recall in september  up to  million worth of taco shells were recalled by kraft from supermarkets and taco bell restaurants the shells contained genetically modified corn which was not approved for human consumption by the food and drug administration the recall was the first of a genetically modified food the corn was supplied to a plant from which kraft bought the shells in april  kraft foods recalled products containing pistachios after the discovery of salmonella at one of

wednesday overwhelmingly approved mondelez international as the name of the  billion snack foods company that will be created when the company finally splits sometime later this year coined by two of kraft’s employees the name is meant to evoke the global ambitions of the new snack business which will take on the titan fritolay and pique the palate as well with its nod to the words for “world” and “delicious” in a variety of romance languages kraft announced plans in august to split itself into two companies one will be a north american grocery business made up of brands like velveeta kraft macaroni  cheese and oscar mayer that earn a lot of cash and profit despite low growth the other will be the bigger sexier snack foods company with more than  percent of its business in fastgrowing markets abroad photo the logo for mondelez international a combination of the words for “world” and “delicious” in romance languages  kraft decided the grocery business would retain the kraft name and rather than hiring an ad agency or marketing firm to come up with a new name for the snack foods company it held a contest among its employees that attracted some  entries “curiously two different employees came up with essentially the same suggestion for the name though with a slightly different spelling” said michael mitchell a spokesman for kraft continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story  mr mitchell said the employees both men had arrived at the notion of a name connoting “delicious world” johannes schmidt an information systems employee in the company’s vienna office had looked for something with the cadences of a waltz he said marc firestone the general counsel based in the company’s headquarters in northfield ill had come to the name on a drive from brussels to frankfurt on business advertisement continue reading the main story  there was no prize “other than our undying love and the honor of having named the new company” mr mitchell said consumers will see the name only in small print — mondelez will allow its famous brand names which will include oreo cadbury milka trident gum tang and ritz to do their work “it’s not intended to be a consumer brand” mr mitchell said photo the name will be in small print on snacks once a part of kraft credit daniel ackerbloomberg news marc e babej a partner at reason a marketing and strategic innovation firm said that was a good thing “its saving grace is that it’s just a name for a corporate entity” mr babej saidhe said as the name for a global company mondelez would have little meaning to consumers outside countries like italy spain france and portugal “i doubt that its connotations are going to be so obvious to english german japanese or chinese speakers” he saidallen p adamson managing director at landor associates a brand design firm avoided expressing an opinion about the name instead he applauded kraft for having managed to find a name in relatively short order that apparently overcame all the potential trademark and legal hurdles such things face these days“their lawyers will have immediately eliminated  percent of the names they came up with because they were already taken” mr adamson said “find a name is no longer a creative exercise which is why most names today sound like they were created by a computer program this one in fact almost sounds real”
