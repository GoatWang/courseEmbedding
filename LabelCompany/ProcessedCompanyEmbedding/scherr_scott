customers continue to support us generously with feedback collaboration and partnership our commitment to building innovative people focused products and service solutions remains as strong as it has been since our inception our strategy is simple focus on people first this approach has been the basis of our success and will continue to guide our future directions this is mitch and my th conference call together we want to thank you for taking this journey with us over the years and look forward to your continuing support lets go to the qa questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and well take our first question from michael nemeroff with credit suisse please go ahead michael nemeroff thanks for taking my questions hey scott was there any notable change to the win rates against the competition in the quarter and then also can you give us an update on when some of the new products youve been developing we’ll go ga whether its later this year or early  and then for mitch im just kind of curious can you help us with what the revenue and margin linearity should look like for qq so that the suite expectations more closely match your model and then also one more for mitch i see that the allowance for doubtful accounts was up i am curious do you account for that as a contra revenue or in your cogs thanks scott scherr you got four questions and… mitchell k dauerman five… michael nemeroff i did my best scott scherr i didnt see anything noticeable in the competition and i was around the country with a midmarket and strategic and i’ve talked to swick on enterprise but i havent noticed anything different what was the other sales question mitchell k dauerman new products and timing… scott scherr yeah like we said last quarter we rolled out – do you want to call a generalist learning and perception to the sales force at the february meeting so theyre selling it right now so i think we’d mentioned we have over  learning sold and im not sure on perception but i think its in the s or s on perception but… michael nemeroff got it what is left in rd are there big chunky contracts still left in rd that would force you to capitalized software thats where i’m – i was getting at on that one mitchell k dauerman not for perception or learning scott scherr mike are you asking in general about capitalized software or specifically about perception and learning michael nemeroff generally are there any large products that are still in development that would keep the capitalization go on longer than expected scott scherr well i dont think it will go longer than expected but i think as we spoke about in particular last quarter there are – as we are – it’s a terrible work replatforming or redoing the entire product suite and we’ve rolled out recruiting onboarding we still will go through workforce management we’ll still go through modifications to the core hr and that will follow the pattern that was expected that will have this higher level of capitalization through  probably peaking i am guessing this year but all of this is very consistent with the conversation we had before and just as a reminder we did start calling out the as expensed operating margin so that people if they wanted to look at our operating margins irrespective of the requirements to capitalize under the accounting rules they could do that and again that was added fourth quarter i did it again here and we’ll continue to do that with respect to revenue and linearity i think the – what we’re seeing is what we had expected to happen when we gave our guidance a quarter ago typically we’ll ramp up towards the end of the year and that revenue linearity on recurring revenue is based on expected live dates which is the information we get and then service revenues for the most part our function of the implementation revenues that go along with those clients going live or additional business there is some minor stuff if you remember we talked about last quarter we sell some time clocks on a onetime basis if people shift to per device for month that number could be off we sell forums that number is hard to predict but i hope i gave you some color to help you with the balance of the year and as far as the allowance for doubtful accounts that did not change i suspect what you wanted to ask about was the increase in the provision and in fact that did go up a little bit i would say there’s anything unusual there other than it does go along with the growth and the size of the business but… michael nemeroff is that provision a contra revenue account or is that accounted for in cogs scott scherr its ga expense because its a bad debt michael nemeroff thanks for taking my questions scott scherr okay operator and well take our next question from justin furby with william blair  company please go ahead justin furby thanks scott i guess could you give us a sense for you call it some big wins in the enterprise can you just give a broader view on what you saw in bookings in q in the enterprise and then strategic and then market versus sort of what you thought going into q and then just color on pipeline strength i guess looking out for the balance of the year in terms of the different sales origin ive got one followup scott scherr the pipeline is strong i think were going to have really good first half of the year i mean i wanted to stop talking about every time like q was you know the best q we ever had because in a way we expect that but it was the best q we ever had i think both teams are strong pipeline is just strong we had our clubs in q q is always our latest quarter so yeah i think theres a lot of trust and confidence that sales team could hit where we need them to hit this year justin furby got it thanks and then mitch in terms of acceleration in revenue in the second half just more color in terms of what drives that and then same thing on the margin guide for the second quarter you always i think see a step up there but it seems to be bigger than normal so what drives the q margin guidance thanks mitchell k dauerman if you’re saying q versus the second half of the year q is just a function essentially of the timing of expected expenses i think you wanted to ask about the second half of the year and i would just say its the same – at this point it’s the same thing as what we did when we gave the guidance a quarter ago and its our plan for the year and it factors in the input we get in terms of go lives on the particular set of customers and you know trying to look at the trends weve seen with you cant chase every single customer contract down as we do some trending and you try to estimate the impact of customer decisions to move those states around but thats how the plan gets built in terms of the revenue line the cost will follow again the same methodology we do each year which is mostly driven by labor costs when we think heads will come onboard what do we think medical expenses will be there are particular meetings like in q obviously i think everyone knows we had connection that was a very large expense in our q operating margin we – people also know that we advanced hired labor into the back half of last year because of strong sales so were seeing that impact during the first half of this year on the margins but were expecting to see that leverage in the back end of the year as a result of those people now being more seasoned again you know that we have the fourth quarter everyone gets very productive at that point and the amount of headcount increase were expecting in that back half will be significantly lower than the comparable basis in the prior year justin furby right i was just asking the  in q versus the  margin guide in q that seems to be a bigger step up i mean is there anything unusual this year between q versus q on the operating margin side scott scherr no i dont think it was i mean just in connections did cost us a bunch of more money this year it’s great to have a lot more people justin furby okay scott scherr we also did have more – these large group meetings in q not only just your normal national sales meetings or clubs but we also did some leadership training in qq and then you have just kind of the incremental headcount of what hits you at some of their costs that go along with it i think were starting to work our way out of that over higher hit on the margins that just saw in the back half of last year and in the first quarter so… justin furby got it thank you thats helpful operator and well take our next question from richard baldry with roth capital please go ahead richard baldry thanks when you’re talking about the expense side on the quarter being a little better than you said than you thought does labor benefits were maybe a little bit below your expectations was there some sort of catch up from the over hires in q so it would be something we expect to be continuous or were there some onetime benefit that factored into that scott scherr well theres – if you get into the weeds its the benefits for example medical we’re a self funding company we take out  of benefits for all our employees so we try to estimate what that costs are going to be fortunately our medical costs came in lower than what we had forecasted we do estimates with respect to payroll taxes you cant do it by the person for  employees or whatever number we’re exactly at so theres an estimate there same thing with estimating the  k contribution i think for some people probably listening will say well isnt that the opposite of what happened in q of last year where we kind of missed at the other way but again in the scheme of things those impacts are relatively small so i just would ask everybody put these differences a little bit in perspective if were talking about a  million revenue base and the variance in expenses are a net a million – two million we dont manage the business that closely on a quarter to quarter basis we try to look at where do we think we need to get to for the year and where do we need to – how are we going to get to longterm goals which again everyone heard  and getting to  billion so it’s all about that so apologize if i didnt completely answered your question richard baldry no that helps maybe just keep focusing on tiny minutiae a little bit one more if we think about the  billion in float where short term rates coming up can you talk about how or when you think that might actually impact the pl whether that sooner or later and then maybe a talk for scott about any changes or evolution in the netsuite relationship under new ownership thanks mitchell k dauerman okay i will do the float scott you get the netsuite on the float in march the rate came up we did see minor benefit to it there is an anticipation of one two or three more rate increases during the course of the year you know that  billion youre focusing on the right item which is the average daily balance not the balance sheet amount but once we get to the whole year because balance is typically start out higher in the beginning because employee withholdings are higher then so i would say we probably end up with a billion dollars average daily balance for the year and if interest rates come up depending on when they come up we probably see a decent amount of that increase on the short end again were predominantly in if you will overnight type stuff very shortterm treasury government agencies so you see a little bit of impact scott scherr yeah rich on netsuite we should stop talking about and there’s very little there anymore oracle made a decision with them which we talked about i think they released a press release today on some low end product that theyre trying to sell as a suite under  i think theyre getting pushed on the higher deals to go with the oracle product so i think theres still salespeople to salespeople that benefits them but i think as far as their direction as a company is not ultimate software with that so we didnt count on it when we gave our numbers in october and i think what happened is what we thought would happen and so i just then think were just not going to talk about it anymore operator and well take our next question from scott berg with needham please go ahead scott berg hi scott and mitch congrats on the good quarter i guess i got one and one here on the first question scott can you talk a little bit more about the xander platform maybe how you’re going to leverage it here and your first product set and may be how it leverages your technology of the future products going forward scott scherr well i think what were selling is the product that kanjoya was and they develop for ten years which was a survey product and im not a technical person but for me its like surveys on steroids and we use it ourselves for survey we did and the survey responses came we had a  increase in the amount of surveys we got back by putting that into the ultimate software how we used to do business and how we do it now so i think that that is going to roll through every other product especially if you think about talent management to start looking at emotions or the written word and how that after ten years of figuring out what a word means if you start putting that in onboarding or in performance or in recruitment so i think thats where its going its going to – that team is working its going to be the base of all our talent management products and then who knows where it goes from there but it’s – i mean mitch and i have both seen it’s very exciting stuff and response i was at connections i saw the response from  of our clients’ people and ive seen the responses my head of hr has been with me since the beginning and i see the response of our sales people going around the country and watching them getting trained on it so yeah i think its exciting stuff scott berg in that i guess the one followup that i have is didnt hear in the prepared remarks you talked much about the  to  employee segment just wanted to see if you can give us an update maybe on what the timeline has been and opportunities look like there today scott scherr yeah i think i tried to communicate last time that the team i have the strategic team sells under  they focus on  to  but they sell deals in  to  we are not going to put in the near future a dedicated team  to  were going to penetrate the strategic team and add that which i’ve said last call were going to add a number of salespeople in  and that whole team is going to sell  to  and thats how we’ll go after it scott berg got it thanks for taking my questions scott scherr okay t hank you operator well take our next question from mark murphy with jpmorgan please go ahead mark murphy yes thank you very much scott so were trying to understand what adp is doing with its various platforms and im wondering to the extent that they are causing their customers to move to the cloud in the nearterm do you see any signs that that will cause more disruption and create additional opportunities for ultimate for instance i think your number of responders looking to buy in  months i think you said was a record and im wondering if it is boosting that at all scott scherr id be guessing on that if i said yes i’ve been there eleven years and ultimate has been twenty seven years so there’s always something going on around that i think we get about  of our business from there so i dont see it going down and i hear all the buzz about that but i think we have to concentrate on and keep making our product better keep making support and services better add new products and so when we do get into competitive situations with anyone out there that we have a good chance to win mark murphy and as a quick follow up im wondering are you able to tell us where does your quota capacity stand as compared to a year ago in other words not the number of quota carrying reps but the underlying quota capacity across all of them and does the trajectory of that tie in pretty well with the overall trajectory of the business here scott scherr well yeah of course the trajectory ties in with the business otherwise we couldnt guide to what we guided yeah we quote up plus  so as i mentioned in the past you have a lot of people who are freshman quota carriers normally especially in the mid and strategic we go from freshman to a sophomore quota to a senior quota we bumped all of them and did so well we got running at a highlevel so fast that we bumped them from a freshman quota to a senior quota that gave us the ability to get our quota to what we needed it with the same headcount that next year we’d said we’ll add between fifteen – well increase our headcount between  and  thatll give us the ability to keep on the trajectory that we want to be on which gets us to become a  billion company in  it’s worked to get us to indiscernible it’s worked to get us to a billion because were already there were going to be at a billion next year it’s locked so were going to get on some trajectory that we believe in thats the best way to do this thing to get to  billion in  mark murphy thank you operator well take our next question from alex zukin with piper jaffray please go ahead alex zukin hey guys thanks for taking my questions scott i wanted to ask how bookings are trending yeartodate between new clients versus upsell and specifically when you look at onboarding and recruitment do you expect those attach rates to be higher as we go through the year given the recent replatforming and then i have one followup for mitch scott scherr well just onboarding and midmarket and strategic was  so i would have never thought in a million years it could be  so i dont know where it would trend from there recruiting was  so i dont know  in enterprise – onboarding was  which two thirds is pretty good for the enterprise and recruiting was  so i think maybe there is a little room in recruiting but those are attach rates for new business so i think if i heard it right i consider that new business because it’s tied to a new deal we sell about  to  of our bookings are new new business that have – obviously a lot of it has those attach rates with which brings up the average sales quota credit on each deal but selling back into our base or selling someone you know a client represents between  and  of our total bookings is that right did i answer that alex zukin yeah that’s helpful i’m wondering – how does that look like versus last year has a trending kind of in the way that youre expected when you gave that commentary in the fourth quarter call scott scherr i think its pretty much the same as what we said like i think weve always said it would might have to  to  or  to  but somewhere between  and  comes from selling back to our client base and  to  comes from new new business new units alex zukin got it got it and then mitch if we think about that  billion target in  whats the right way to start thinking about the free cash flow margin at that size and at what point do you think we start to see a narrowing between the free cash flow margin and the operating margin mitchell k dauerman yeah alex i got to tell you i have not prepared to answer your question specifically just because i havent run models out like that i would think the same type of trends you see in the way our working capital goes if we keep growing at this type of growth rate over – over  you see similar pattern and i think when you get down to free cash flow i think the last time i said i would expect it to increase i just dont know what that – how much it will increase at each time and fortunately i have not looked at it close enough for free cash flow versus operating cash flow to answer you alex zukin got it thank you guys operator and well take our next question from trevor upton with pacific crest securities please go ahead trevor upton hi thanks so much for taking my question with respect to the q expenses being indiscernible the back half of last year in the connections conference can you maybe walk us through how much that was connections that we should be modeling before and the out year that sounds like it was a little bit more expensive than it had been previously scott scherr trevor connections in q mitchell k dauerman yeah trevor upton just as we think about the model obviously q margins were lower than it had been previously and some of that was event hiring and some of that was connections how much of that should we expect to recur in q going forward scott scherr well again q mostly was due to the additional labor and related benefits connections let’s say connections was higher by others in the year before i dont think thats going to drive it in and off itself tighter piece of why the operating margin in q was lower labor again that we – half of the year we began hiring more which followed the different than in the past so therefore we’re carrying those additional labor and related benefit costs we expect to flip around in the back half of the year as we’re hiring less people on a yearoveryear basis so obviously staying obvious in this kind of business cost will proceed – i don’t know if i answered your question for how does specifically model i don’t have a – if you’re asking me for an operating margin for q of next year i dont have that trevor upton no thats helpful it sounds like it’s mostly the over hiring and connections with the smaller piece of the higher expenses in q of this year and then just i guess quickly the retention drop from  to  obviously that’s a small change but its the first time weve seen that since kind of the back half of  is there anything to read under that scott scherr i dont think so i think it’s – as we’re selling more and more midmarket and strategic deals to get them they’re a little over  and maybe thats just the way it is i hope to not – i hate losing any client but – and then i think enterprise made pretty flat i think they were between   but now the mid and strategic makes up about  of our client base mitchell k dauerman but as we move forward i think mid and strategic is going to be somewhere between  and  i think is going to be mid strategic   something like that it’s going to be enterprise and i think midstrategic and middle have a lower retention rates still high retention rate but i think it took it down a few basis points trevor upton that makes sense and then my last question just as we think about xander and how you you’ll sell that perceptions i assume will be sold separately and have a separate pepm will xander increase the kind of the value of the core product and leave the increases do the core ultipro pepm going up or will it be a separate cost associated with that and that’s all i have thanks mitchell k dauerman i think our goal is that it increases the value of everything it touches in the product it did create an additional pepm for the first thing were rolling out which is a survey piece which were calling perception so yeah we think it can increase products we already have by making them more valuable to our customers trevor upton thank you mitchell k dauerman thank you operator and well take our next question from patrick walravens with jmp securities please go ahead patrick walravens oh great thank you scott i was wondering if you could just tell us how the learning product is differentiated from some of the older solutions that are out there scott scherr i mean what im told and that were employee focused approach to development of people its around the people first thing like you use learning to as opposed to saying what courses they took is to try and see how they – again using all the stuff that were using like who can go up in the organization whos promotable get more kind of a emotions and how people feel about those people how they manage people and things like that im told that they’re shifting away from training employees to developing talent in an organization emphasis on selfdirected learning social collaboration community building and things like that so im told its a little different than the normal learning and again it was well received by our sales organization by our hr people and everyone within ultimate and then before we released it to ourselves it seems we sold over s of them so we have – im hoping that we could attain a  attach rate on it going forward after the initial rollout and after everyone gets familiar with that and all the benefits of it patrick walravens thats really helpful thanks scott scott scherr i dont have much else on it patrick walravens no that’s great operator and well take our next question from abhey lamba with mizuho securities please go ahead abhey lamba yeah thank you mitch thanks for that additional color on the retention rates now given that strategics are going to be bigger mix of your business should we expect that retention rate to kind of settle around here or is there going to be continuous movement toward that  rate scott scherr this is scott when we went to sas in  we thought if we could keep – our recurring revenue growing at  keep our retention rate at about  then we would have a good business weve never been really below  in our history quite frankly i would hate to be below  but i would say that i certainly dont see us ever well i see us north of  id like to say north of  so i don’t think it would go below that with what we have and as we get bigger so… abhey lamba got it scott scherr say – we jump to  for the first time over the last like i guess  months something like that and then we were obviously excited about it and then we had a new high bar and then now were probably  again but i guess i go around  abhey lamba got it thank you and scott you mentioned about the number of respondents who plan to purchase during the next twelve months i would think at around  now what was the mix of enterprise versus strategics in that and how did that mix compare with a year ago scott scherr i dont have that abhey lamba all right scott scherr i wasnt given that im sure i could get it but i dont have that in front of me but both teams have good pipelines yeah it would be hard for me to tell you right now abhey lamba got it thank you scott scherr well mitch he’ll get it for you operator and well take our next question from jesse hulsing with goldman sachs please go ahead jesse hulsing yes thank you mitch i had a question for you about subscription gross margins they were down a little bit yearoveryear and you guys have been on an upward trend line for a while im wondering are we settling at a level around  and well be here for a while or do you see room for incremental subscription gross margin expansion over the next couple of years mitchell k dauerman hey jesse it’s interesting when we talked last quarter its growth we actually thought it would be down a little bit lower because we do pick the amortization of onboarding thats flowing through and we also picked up some of that labor costs coming in so this quarter we ended up a little bit higher than we expected in return gross margin for the reason i mentioned earlier i guess the short answer is im hoping we stay around this range i know i said on last call im hopeful we could get  basis points of growth from last year so this puts us around – at around let’s say  to  but again its small numbers in that scheme jesse hulsing yeah mitchell k dauerman im kind of looking at some of the models we have i dont think were quite yet ready to say  is the rate for the full year jesse hulsing so does that mean you expect it to – you dont know if its going to be higher or lower or you dont think its not going to go higher mitchell k dauerman so i think it will dip a little bit but it will be decimal points jesse hulsing gotcha so… mitchell k dauerman so id be comfortable going back to what i said last quarter which was when i get – somebody asked and we finished last year at – hang on one second i’ve got a number with – i’ve got a – yes i’m… jesse hulsing … mitchell k dauerman right i thought it said  okay jesse yes  to  jesse hulsing gotcha mitchell k dauerman sorry for that convoluted answer i was looking at that number jesse hulsing and then scott where are you guys on reps if you can disclose and is the plan still to be flat for the year versus what you ended  with mitchell k dauerman yeah we’re right around  and my plan is to put on like i said you that i mean in the perfect world we would add between  and  in january of  but were going to  this year jesse hulsing great thanks guys operator and well take our next question from mark marcon with r w baird please go ahead mark marcon good afternoon thanks for taking my question i was wondering can you give us a little bit more color with regard to source of the wins you said adp was coming in at  any changes or can you just talk about the next two three sources of the wins and then i have a followup scott scherr well i think that – someone asked me something about adps i just said that was kind of like our win rate forever but i mean its been pretty consistent we got about  of our business from service bureaus and we get about  from erps that are homegrown inhouse system and it hasn’t moved much as far back as i can remember so i don’t really want to start naming people we get our business from but i think  service bureau  erps and inhouse mark marcon okay and then with regards to your largest competitor in terms of your biggest source of wins have you seen any sort of change in their behavior with regards to pricing or the amount of effort to retain clients and to stop them from potentially switching mitchell k dauerman no i see a lot of the same – the competitive practices that theyve used against us twenty years ago theyre using the same competitive practices today and as far as what they’re doing to keep their clients i dont you know mark marcon okay and then lastly with regards to just the revenue guidance and it implies basically a sequential uptick in the second half that’s greater than what you’ve historically done is that related to a couple of big clients that might be coming on this year or is there anything along those lines thats being anticipated scott scherr no i wouldnt attribute it to any one or two or three large clients i think there is a combination of a lot of business that we have to try to estimate the time to live and again i go back to the comments i made earlier just when we gave our guidance in february this is following the same plan as of now for that – for them and then i think mark if you probably go back to something like  youll see a similar type of pattern as well i think to  was a little bit – might have been a little bit different pattern mark marcon yeah i went back to like    it’s seems like a little bit more of a ramp but maybe not that much but a little bit more scott scherr yeah okay i wouldnt have any other comments to add mark marcon okay great thank you scott scherr you’re welcome operator and well take our next question from ross macmillan with rbc capital markets please go ahead ross macmillan thanks so much for taking my questions i have two i was just curious whether you saw any change in the employment base across your customers in the quarter relative to your expectation and then second mitch i think you said  should be the peak in capitalized rd any sense for roughly how big that number will be and what you think total capex will be this year thanks scott scherr yeah i mean in employment change the way we do it insignificant from what ive seen so far this quarter – this past quarter in terms of total capitalized cost on the last – on the guidance we gave i think i said we think it will be approximately  million so it’s probably in that range as far as how it will play out during the quarters i’m guessing somewhere around this number each quarter i do think this  million or so should be the peak obviously i’ll get more color on that as we go deeper into the year but again i just want to remind you and everybody else we watch it to look at the margins both as presented and as expense so that we kind of take out of the equation as much as we can the conversation about what is required to be capitalized and what really reflects cash flow is real economics ross macmillan and is it too early to say what that rate of capitalize rd would fade at after this year is it the premature or do you have any thoughts on that scott scherr i think im comfortable saying that until i can sit down with adam and his team and work through it and again thats why i keep trying to reemphasize looking all the way to the bottom line as if we were required to expense because that’s something we can kind of manage which is that our total rd expense probably stays in the  range so maybe it will start to dip down a little in gross how would get split out not a  sure at this point and to be honest with you my guess is i probably wont know until the third quarter as we look at these things and we give our preliminary guidance but if we have any better color soon i’ll let you know ross macmillan all right thank you operator and well take our next question from kirk materne with evercore isi please go ahead kirk materne thanks very much mitch i realize you went through this at indiscernible last quarter in terms of just the seasonality but it seems like based on the guidance for q youre going to getting about  of your ebit in the first half or  in the back half which is a little bit more pronounced versus prior years i realize a lot of this has to do with the earlier hiring in the fourth quarter but i guess i had two questions around that one is this a pattern we should think about going forward just having a little bit more seasonality in terms of just your operating profits in the back half of the year just based on trying to get people in the door earlier and in the calendar year it sounds like youre not really thinking about that for calendar  but im just trying to get a sense on that and then secondly within your opex your total opex are there things in the first half of the year that just simply roll off in terms of absolute dollars so that you know there is some flexibility in terms of rd in sales marketing meaning you can take those up i am just trying to think theres anything in ga in particular that would roll off a little bit in the back half of the year thanks mitchell k dauerman kirk i think both questions are actually tied together the pattern were seeing in you call it ebit – nongaap operating margin or the as expensed this year is a function of the changing pattern at the end of  which was hiring more people in the back half so therefore were carrying more of what we internally call that grow over labor and related costs into the beginning of this year right now we still dont expect – or i should say affirmatively we expect the labor increases to go down in terms of new heads so if that – so that  could very well follow the normal patterns of adding labor which could bring us back to more usual trends we should go back to  now to remind you and everyone else about when we look at  compared to  compared to  we know that we had some of the uptick in recurring revenue because of aca we began selling the enhanced tool kit in the fourth quarter of  and unlike other products that we sell this one the revenue was recognized almost immediately and so that has raised – optically its raised not only the growth rates it also has raised a little bit of operating income right away and that flow through  in that channels so now were in that point of lapping it i hope i gave you enough color on that in terms of other expenses that may happen in q versus q q q they can’t be that significant if you’re talking about a couple of million dollars here and there it’s that most of what drives our model when it gets to expenses is labor costs and the related benefits and how they play out during the course of the years kirk materne okay thanks mitch that was very helpful operator and well take our next question from steve koenig with wedbush securities please go ahead steve koenig hi gentlemen thanks for squeezing me in scott scherr sure steve koenig and happy seventieth birthday and i bet youre glad that’s quarters not years just two for you so there was an interesting statistic on lead flow for inside sales i think it was  yearonyear that looks pretty solid maybe it looks like there isnt much impact on qualified leads from the downgrade of the netsuite partnership and scott forgive me for asking maybe one – one more question on netsuite but help us to understand lead flow just as solid as ever theres plenty of opportunities to work on maybe reconcile that with maybe not as many netsuite leads scott scherr yes there is indiscernible we gave a lot of leads to them as well and deals we were working so not something we werent prepared for once the announcement was made last year so yeah plenty of business out there for us steve koenig okay and then my last question so remind me what you assumed about aca in terms of potentially a headwind to services or i think there was even recurring revenue component and given that that theres been no change to aca have you changed your assumption that all mitchell k dauerman steve so what we said on the last quarter is that aca revenue in  should be approximately  of our total revenue with most of that being recorded in recurring about probably about  million in print revenues that are included in services we havent changed anything in our guidance because nothing has changed so i wouldnt even know what to change it to i think at this point people cover us and other companies who provide similar services have some orders of magnitude as our revenue base gets bigger the percentage that aca is to it will get smaller and if aca were to go away or change it to something else you have to evaluate what other compliance requirements might be there so the presumption that it could go away entirely might be to extreme the other consideration would be let’s say it is going away or the compliance effort is less would it not be reasonable to go to the customers who are already spending that money and perhaps substitute a different product for that but those budget dollars already spending as opposed to just assuming they would be lost and so i think there are a number of factors there steve koenig yeah got it okay great well thank you again scott scherr youre welcome operator well take our next question from samad samana with stephens incorporated please go ahead samad samana hi can you hear me mitch there is a  million software services agreement thats highlighted in the cash flow statement what is that mitchell k dauerman it comes out of rd its part of a multiyear agreement that we signed that according to accounting rules we need to record upfront but it is on its an installment basis we have done other things like this for example you know with how we purchase software from microsoft or ibm cognos and other things samad samana and then maybe one question on kanjoya can you help me understand the decision to sell that on a standalone basis so i think most of all these other products you can only buy if youre also apparel customer and maybe what the ambition there is mitchell k dauerman were not selling a standalone only above  employee standalone and we thought that there was a market up there that made sense but we are not selling it standalone under  and none of our sales rep none of the  can sell kanjoya we have someone from kanjoya just looking at opportunities in the over  market which is something he was working on when he was at kanjoya so we are not selling it through our  quota carrying sales reps we are not selling it under  employees standalone and we are looking – if there are opportunities above  standalone that gets us in the door on one of those accounts were going to take it samad samana thanks thats helpful operator and well take our next question from kevin buttigieg with mkm partners please go ahead kevin buttigieg thank you just quickly scott you mentioned obviously the  service bureau and  erp competition rates if you see more of your mix shift towards the mid market and strategic group would that mix shift in any way i mean i would imagine you probably see the service bureau competition much more in the mid market and then to clarify your competition versus the erp vendors this period it sounds like it hadnt changed in terms of win rates or frequency of competition and im assuming that thats a statement about oracle as well as workday just to clarify that mitchell k dauerman yeah we see oracle very little as we see sap very little i think as mentioned we see workday  – maybe a little more than  of the time kevin buttigieg but it hasnt changed mitchell k dauerman no and i think on the others no i think enterprise spends a lot of time on the highend service bureaus a lot of their business comes from service bureaus kevin buttigieg so you wouldnt expect to see the mix shift even as your business shifted more to the midmarket and strategic the frequency of competition against those vendors would put probably remain the same mitchell k dauerman i think so kevin buttigieg okay thank you operator and we will take one more question that question comes from nate cunningham with guggenheim securities please go ahead nate cunningham hey guys thanks for taking my question based on what youre seeing how much more aggressive has workday been in terms of getting their implementation costs closer to yours scott scherr i dont know ive been – i was just around the country with our midmarket and strategic teams and i didnt hear one person say that to me or that they worried about what you just said so the enterprises having their all key meetings because im here im not there but havent heard anything about that so… nate cunningham okay thank you scott scherr okay operator and that concludes todays questionandanswer session id like to turn the conference back over for any additional or closing remarks scott scherr now i just say thanks for all your time tonight see you next question have a good quarter bye copyright policy all transcripts on this site are the copyright

human resources software possible he thought it would be a better life not to focus just on processing that is where the fulcrum lay for him to found the company much later these were precious insights so very early into his professionthe adp experience“i was the vice president of sales in miami but i didn’t like the culture which was growth by numbers” that is how he describes his exit as well as gives us a glimpse into what he thought was the culture at adp automatic data processing inc well whatever be the circumstances at the time of his separation from adp he did learn a great deal of things there through the course of a decadelong career during which he rose through the ranks and became the vicepresident of sales that was to be his last role at adpwhile the idea for a business in the people’s business germinated when scherr was working for his father’s company what really reinforced his view was the experience at adp being in the industry for so long scherr strongly felt that businesses should have more choices for their human resource and payroll management—especially providers that could deliver great service and a great product with a dedicated focus on the hr industry and the people in ithis goal really was to create a company with a sole focus on people management that truly takes care of its employees so they would in turn take care of the customersit is
