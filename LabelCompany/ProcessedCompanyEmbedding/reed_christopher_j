columbia sc nelson mullins grier  scarborough columbia sc on brief for appellants robert a patterson charleston sc thomas j wills iv m dawes cooke jr barnwell whaley stevenson  patterson charleston sc on brief for appellee before haynsworth senior circuit judge and sprouse and chapman circuit judges chapman circuit judge  this appeal is from a jury verdict against appellants christopher j reed john christopher reed and dorothy reed their three cases were consolidated and tried in the district court for the district of south carolina solely upon the theory of strict liability in tort the jury returned a verdict for the appellee tiffin motor homes inc the court denied appellants motion for new trial  appellants seek reversal of the judgment below on the grounds that  the district court erred by admitting evidence regarding state of the art into a case sounding solely in strict tort liability  the courts instruction to the jury was in error because it allowed the jury to consider state of the art and industry standards when deciding if the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous  it was an abuse of discretion for the judge to admit into evidence photographs offered by the defendant and also to refuse to admit a photograph offered by plaintiffs and  the district court was in error when it refused to allow cross examination of an expert witness as to the contents of a police accident report for the reasons stated below we affirm the district courti  in august of  christopher j reed leased from ft myers motor homes one  allegro motor home which was designed manufactured and assembled by tiffin motor homes inc herein tiffin an alabama corporation the purpose for leasing the motor home was to allow mr reed his wife dorothy and son john christopher to travel roundtrip from their home in ft myers florida to west virginia and connecticut on august   while returning to their home in florida the motor home in which they were traveling was struck in the rear by a lincoln continental this collision occurred on interstate  near st george south carolina upon impact the motor home was damaged and burst into flames as a result of this accident the appellants suffered personal injuries  the appellants brought suit in the charleston division of the district court of south carolina on june   the three complaints were each based upon three theoriesnegligent design and manufacture breach of implied warranties and strict liabilityand each sought actual and punitive damages the cases were tried solely upon the theory of strict liability appellees motion to strike punitive damages was denied  during the trial appellants offered certain evidence in an attempt to prove that the motor home was designed and manufactured with a defective and unreasonably dangerous fuel system the appellants maintain they offered this evidence for the limited purposes of qualifying an expert witness showing the feasibility of alternate locations of the auxiliary tank discrediting one of the defendants expert witnesses and establishing grounds for punitive damages the appellee offered evidence consisting of testimony and brochures to show the state of the art custom and industry standards concerning the location of the auxiliary gas tank the purpose for offering this evidence was to show that the design was not defective or unreasonably dangerous that it met reasonable consumer expectation and that the defendant exercised due care in selecting the location the appellants made proper objection ii  as this is a diversity case the law of the state in which the tort occurred must be applied by the federal court erie rr co v tompkins  us   s ct   l ed   the primary issue is whether it is proper to admit into evidence and then to charge the jury on the state of the art as a defense in a strict liability case it is important to note at the outset that this is a defect in design case not defect in manufacturing because the south carolina supreme court has not passed on this issue we must predict how it would decide the issue  south carolina adopted the law of strict liability in tort by enacting sec a of the restatement second of torts  sccode ann sec   under the theory of strict liability the exercise of due care by the defendant will not relieve him of liability see eg werner v upjohn co inc  fd   th cir thus the plaintiff need not prove that the defendant was negligent only that the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous when it was placed in the stream of commerce see eg welch v outboard marine corp  fd  th cir because the plaintiff need not show negligence the focus of the trier of fact is upon the product itself not the conduct of the manufacturer singleton v international harvester co  fd   th cir this is because  public policy demands that the burden of accidental injuries caused by products intended for consumption be placed upon those who market them and be treated as a cost of production against which liability insurance can be obtained and that the consumer of such products is entitled to the maximum protection at the hands of someone and the proper persons to afford it are those who market the products  restatement second sec a comment c incorporated by reference into the south carolina code of laws sccode ann sec    in manufacturing defect cases courts have excluded evidence of the state of the art because the plaintiff need only show the product does not conform to the manufacturers specifications to prove it is defective singleton  fd at  when the issue is a defect in design however the jurisdictions are divided upon the issue of whether state of the art evidence is admissible see j beasley products liability and the unreasonably dangerous   because the majority rule is that state of the art evidence is admissible in design defect cases singleton  fd at  bruce v martinmarietta corp  fd  th cir raney v honeywell inc  fd  th cir hoppe v midwest conveyor co inc  fd  th cir welch  fd at  see also j beasley at  and because the south carolina supreme court has adopted a balancing test for use in design defect cases when determining if a product is unreasonably dangerous claytor v general motors corp sc  sed    we hold that south carolina would admit testimony on state of the art in design defect cases tried under the theory of strict liability  section a and the south carolina courts require the plaintiff to show both that the product is defective and that it is unreasonably dangerous to the consumer or user given the conditions and circumstances that foreseeably attend use of the product claytor sct  sed at  the majority of courts have found in design defect cases as opposed to manufacturing defect cases that state of the art and industry standards are relevant to show both the reasonableness of the design raney  fd at  hoppe  fd at  welch  fd at  and that the product was dangerous beyond the expectations of the ordinary consumer bruce  fd at  this is because in a design defect case the standard of defectiveness under sec a involving as it does the element of unreasonable danger still requires the weighing of the utility of risks inherent in the design against the magnitude of the risk singleton  fd at  in design cases south carolina has held that while any product can be made more safe the fact that it is not does not automatically make the product unreasonably dangerous rather in the final analysis we have another of the laws balancing acts and numerous factors must be considered including the usefulness and desirability of the product the cost involved for added safety the likelihood and potential seriousness of injury and the obviousness of danger claytor sc  sed at  holding evidence insufficient for strict tort liability therefore it follows implied warranty and negligence actions must fail  this balancing approach finds its roots in comment i to sec a where it is stated that the article sold must be dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it with the ordinary knowledge common of the community as to its characteristics therefore the comment does require a determination of what consumers expect when they purchase a particular product  we find that the state of the art and trade customs are relevant in helping the jury make a determination of whether the product is unreasonably dangerous when used in a manner expected by the ordinary consumer in the community while only one element in that determination it is a necessary aid to assist the trier of fact in determining the reasonableness of the manufacturers design further the south carolina court has explicitly set forth the requirement that a product must be unreasonably dangerous to a consumer with the ordinary knowledge of the community and has held products not to be unreasonably dangerous if the design failed to provide a safety feature outside what that consumer might expect young v tidecraft inc  sc    sed     moreover it is clear that south carolina does balance the utility of the risk inherent in the design of the product with the magnitude of the risk claytor sc  sed at  to determine the reasonableness of the manufacturers actions in designing the product this balancing act necessarily is relevant to the determination that the product as designed is unreasonably dangerous in its failure to conform to the ordinary consumers expectations young  sc at   sed at   in this light we are compelled to hold that south carolina would find that a design defect case is an exception to the usual strict liability manufacturing case therefore the admission of state of the art evidence while only a factor to consider is both necessary and probative on the issue of unreasonably dangerous  the appellants present the argument that state of the art evidence is not relevant in strict liability cases and urge that south carolina should and would adopt the pennsylvania and illinois rule that such evidence has no place in a strict liability case whether it is a manufacturing or design defect case holloway v jb systems ltd  fd  rd cir walker v trico manufacturing co inc  fd  th cir because pennsylvania and illinois state law is substantively different from that of south carolina these cases are easily distinguishable see j beasley    in pennsylvania it is error to use even the term unreasonably dangerous while instructing the jury in a design defect case azzarello v black brothers co inc  pa   ad    and unlike south carolina claytor sc  sed at  pennsylvania has made the manufacturer a guarantor of his products safety salvador v atlantic steel boiler co  pa    ad    by eliminating proof and consideration of the unreasonably dangerous element and by requiring the manufacturer to provide with the product every element necessary to make a product safe for its use the pennsylvania courts have extended strict liability to a frontier not yet approached by south carolina  in illinois the courts of appeals have held that state of the art evidence is inadmissible in design defect cases see eg stanfield v medalist industries inc  illappd   ned   j beasley at  this is in direct contrast to south carolina where the trier of fact is required to balance several factors when determining the liability in a design defect case claytor sc  sed at  therefore in the walker case the seventh circuit was assisted in its decision by state case law contra to the law we must apply here  because of the distinguishing features of pennsylvania and illinois law we are convinced south carolina would follow the majority rule this is not an easy conclusion to reach since the law of strict tort liability and state of the art evidence is mired in much confusion and controversy however in light of claytor and young we feel it is a proper application of both south carolina law and the majority rule to allow the trier of fact to consider state of the art evidence when determining liability in a design defect case  also there is another reason to consider such evidence in this case the appellants were seeking to recover punitive damages in a strict tort liability action in south carolina punitive damages are allowed when a plaintiff proves the wanton willful or malicious violation of his rights gilbert v duke power company  sc    sed    clearly whether or not tiffin followed industry standards and complied with the state of the art while designing the motor home is probative on the issue of the wantonness willfulness and maliciousness of their acts including the placement of the auxiliary gas tank it must be remembered that plaintiffs resisted defendants effort to have punitive damages stricken from the case iii  the appellants have also argued that the trial judge committed error by charging the jury on compliance or noncompliance with industry standards during his instructions the judge told the jury they could consider such compliance or noncompliance as one factor when determining whether or not the motor home was defective and unreasonably dangerous the court did not require the jury to consider this evidence rather charged that it could be used as one factor in their deliberations further the court instructed the jury that if it found the motor home as designed to be defective and unreasonably dangerous the manufacturer was liable no matter how careful he was during the manufacturing process because of our holding above that state of the art evidence is properly admissible to assist the trier of fact in determining whether or not a product is unreasonably dangerous we find that the jury charge was a correct statement of the law the charge to the jury must when taken as a whole fairly present the case to the jury  new amsterdam cas co v novick transfer co inc  fd   th cir this charge did fairly present the case to the jury therefore it was not in error iv  the appellants have presented two other exceptions the first of these is the admissibility into evidence of certain photographs  at trial tiffin presented into evidence photographs of certain vehicles that had been crash tested at  mph in a controlled barrier test these photographs were introduced for the purpose of  comparison of the deformation of similar vehicles to the lincoln involved in the accident and  because the deformation existent at the speeds of the test was used in a mathematical calculation under accepted reconstruction techniques to estimate the closing speed of the car involved in the accident objection to the admission of these photographs was overruled  appellants offered a photograph of a lincoln similar in size weight type and amount of damage to the one involved in the accident the purpose was to show that the damage sustained by the automobile in the accident could have been the result of a low speed impact the court sustained tiffins objection to the admission of this photograph  on the issue of the court allowing the appellees photographs into evidence the appellants argued that the vehicles and the type of collisions involved were substantially different from the vehicle and collision in question here therefore they submit that the admission of these photographs into evidence was more prejudicial than probative in regard to their own photograph they argue that the automobiles involved were similar in size weight and the damage sustained further they maintain their expert used this photograph as part of the basis in forming his opinion to exclude this photograph they submit was also prejudicial to their case  tiffin laid the proper foundation for admission of its photographs into evidence any difference in the testing and the collision in question goes to the weight of the evidence and not its admissibility renfro hosiery mills co v national cash register company  fd  th cir it is also clear that admissibility of photographs is a matter resting in the sound discretion of the trial judge his decision will not be reversed without a showing that he abused his discretion virginia ry co v armentrout  fd  th cir ramseyer v general motors corp  fd  th cir the trial judge heard all of the testimony knew the circumstances under which the photographs were offered and had the opportunity of viewing the photographs when they were submitted there was no abuse of his discretion in either ruling v  the final exception is that the lower court refused to allow the appellees expert to be cross examined about the speeds of the vehicles as recorded in the accident report by the investigating highway patrolman the contention is that this was error because tiffin pled the intervening negligence of the lincolns driver as a primary defense and that their expert used the speed listed in the report as one factor for the basis of his expert opinion because the expert relied upon this report to form his opinion they submit that cross examination was proper to explain to the jury the information he used exclusion of this evidence they argue was prejudicial  tiffins expert testified he used the report only to locate the scene of the accident to find the physical evidence for a scene inspection and to determine the year of the car which he later verified through other means appellants attorney then asked the expert if he discounted the speed as stated in the report the court properly sustained an objection to this testimony because the expert had testified he did not use the report to calculate speed at which the vehicles were traveling once he made clear that he had made no such use of this report there was no reason to pursue the matter further  by statute south carolina excludes from evidence in an action at law for damages any police accident report required to be filed by certain statutes sccode ann sec   the report in question is just such a report while this statute is not binding upon a federal court we note the statute and its spirit as a buttress to our conclusion that the trial judge was correct to exclude this hearsay from evidence the appellants wanted to get the patrolmans report of speed into evidence this is not admissible under the south carolina statute and is simply hearsay the trial court was correct in excluding this testimony from evidence  the judgment of the district court is affirmed  affirmed  it is undecided in south carolina whether punitive damages are recoverable in an action sounding only in strict liability because that issue is not before this court the opinion in no way intimates how we think the state supreme court will decide the issue it is worth noting however there is a split in authority on the issue see eg j beasley products liability and the unreasonably dangerous requirement at   and annot  alr th    the reeds through the testimony of their experts offered evidence of the industry standards and state of the art concerning fuel systems and the placement of fuel tanks in motor homes essentially this testimony compared different designs used and assessments of the fire hazards involved with the placement of the tanks in each design their experts testified that as early as  it had been published and was known that placement between the frame rails provided the maximum protection this evidence also showed the defendant did not place its auxiliary tank between the rails moreover the jury could infer tiffin had not followed industry standards and the state of the art designs therefore it had designed a defective and unreasonably dangerous product  see singleton v international harvester co  fd  th cir  sec  liability of seller for defective product  one who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm caused to the ultimate user or consumer or to his property if a the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product and b it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold  the rule stated in subsection  shall apply although a the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product and b the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller  sccode ann sec a   incorporated by reference in sccode ann sec    while the practice of considering the ordinary consumers expectation has been met with criticism from both wade and keeton it is the law in south carolina see j beasley  wade advocated a balancing approach for all products liability but particularly in the area of design defect id see wade strict tort liability of manufacturers  swlj    the most obvious criticism of this rule is that it allows concepts of negligence to reenter a strict liability action through the back door this would be improper in light of the fact the section a explicitly states that liability arises despite the fact a manufacturer has used all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product the fact remains however that design and manufacturing cases are different if the manufacturer fails to follow his own specification he is liable despite the state of the art that is a much simpler case finding a design defective and unreasonably dangerous is more difficult the trier of fact must have some guidance in deciding whether a product design is unreasonably dangerous moreover the majority of courts allow the evidence to help determine consumer expectation and the reasonableness of the design once allowed in the evidence is only an element in the determination of the dangerous characteristic of the defect it is not conclusive for a thorough discussion of this issue see j beasley at  to   in footnote  we noted that this case would not decide whether punitive damages are
