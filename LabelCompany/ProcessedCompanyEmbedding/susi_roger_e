“nonmagnetic medical infusion device” filed on oct   by r susi which claims priority from and is a continuationinpart of pending application ser no  entitled “nonmagnetic medical infusion device” filed on jun   by r susi which applications are incorporated herein in the entireties by this referenced theretofield of the invention this invention relates to apparatus for refusing liquid into a patient and more particularly to such apparatus suitable for operation in a magnetic resonance image mri environment of high magnetic fields and required low radiofrequency interference background of the invention it is desirable to carefully control the intravenous iv administration of liquids to a patient conventional gravity iv solution delivery via commonlyavailable iv administration sets is typically not sufficiently accurate for the delivery of many types of fluids and drugs various positive displacement pumping devices have been developed for carefully controlling such iv administration some types of iv pumps control flow within a standard iv administration set via peristaltic either linear or rotary pumping schemes directly on the tubing of a conventional iv infusion set other types may incorporate a proprietary volumetric cassette and still other types utilize a syringelike device however there currently exists no iv controller capable of completely safe operation within a mri suite wherein a considerable need exists for the controlled delivery of medicinal liquids frequently patients scheduled for mri examination arrive at the mri suite with iv solutions being administered and controlled by devices which must be disconnected as the patient is moved into the suite where high magnetic fields are present and no outside rf interference can be tolerated the basic characteristics of an infusion pump involve the delivery of medicinal or nutritional liquids over time into the venous system of a living subject certain physical limitations regarding the delivery rate and pressure are elemental in iv liquidinfusion control iv fluids are pumped at pressures typically in the range of  to  psi the infusion device should include detection of overpressure and operational limits at not more than about  psi flow ranges typical of iv pumps are from  to  mlhr such specifications for conventional iv infusion apparatus are quite different from the specifications for injector devices which are often used in radiologic settings including mri for purposes of very rapid bolus injection of imageenhancing contrast agents such devices ‘push’ contrast agents at pressures up to  psi and in very short periods of time in contrast to iv drug delivery systems contrast agents are solely for image enhancement and have no medicinal value in a patient and are commonly delivered using piston or syringetype pumps that provide the requisite high fluid pressures and rapid deliveries the high magnetic field surrounding mri systems can negatively affect the operation of various devices including conventional iv control devices especially those devices that are constructed with magnetic materials and can seriously jeopardize a patients safety as a result of devices utilizing magnetic materials that can be attracted at high velocity into the magnetic field of the mri system where patient or attendant personnel are located conventional devices for infusing liquids into a patient are typically small portable units often attached to an iv pole holding both the infusion device and associated liquids to be infused such devices utilize either steppertype motors or simple dc motors which include magnetic materials for providing the mechanical power required to drive the pumping unit further some form of electronic control unit receives the manual inputs of prescribed infusion rate settings and controls the pumping unit to deliver the desired quantity of liquid over time such control unit may emit spurious radio frequency signals as a result of poor electrical design or insufficient shielding and are therefore commonly installed outside an mri environment and outside the shielding therefor with the advent of mri procedures for the imaging of internal body structures very special requirements must be satisfied in the design of medical devices intended to be used within the mri environment mri systems exploit the physical phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance nmr by which rf stimulation of atomic nuclei within an associated magnetic field results in the emission of a small rf ‘spin echo’ from the nucleus so stimulated in the case of patient imaging hydrogen nuclei bound with water are the usual targets for magnetic resonance at selected frequencies other molecules and compounds can also be selected for study as in nuclear magnetic spectroscopy by choosing resonance specific magnetic field strengths and associated radio frequencies for simplicity the typical hydrogen atombased mri imageacquisition process is referred to herein but it should be recognized that the subject invention is equally useful in mri spectrographic studies at a plurality of field strengths and frequencies the typical mri system includes several components as shown in fig  for example the operators console   and various processing  display   and radio frequency and magnetic gradient amplifying equipment   are all located outside of the environment of the mri scanning suite which must be configured to eliminate imagedegrading radio frequency interference and field effects of metallic structures that can introduce field distortions and become safety hazards the mri scanning unit produces large magnetic and rf fields and must be capable of receiving the extremely small rf nuclear ‘echoes’ and is therefore typically located within a shielded room  such rooms greatly attenuate outside rf noise and may also provide some containment of the scanners magnetic fields that include both fixed high b field and dynamic fields due to highfield ramping gradients however certain devices are required to be placed in the scan room either to assist with care of the patient being imaged or for the use of attending staff of particular interest are those devices which must be placed in the scan room during the time of image acquisition when the patient is present and the magnetic fields are ‘up’ and rf reception of the tiny nuclear ‘echoes’ must be cleanly acquired electrically passive metallic items such as oxygen bottles or ‘crash carts’ present safety hazards to the patient due to their potential to be strongly attracted by the magnetic field of the scanner such items can be ‘pulled’ into the imaging volume where the patient is located creating potential for serious injury or death additionally great effort is made during the manufacture and installation of the scannermagnet to assure that the lines of flux within the imaging volume are highly homogenous to assure that acquired images have minimal spatial distortion thus devices formed of magnetic material that are positioned within the magnetic field of the scanner can introduce distortions into this homogeneous field and the resultant images the level of hazard and the degree of fieldimage distortion due to magnetic materials depends upon the composition and location with respect to the imaging volume the hazards due to ‘flying’ objects can be controlled to some degree by the use of nonferrous devices such as the aluminum oxygen bottle additionally the gravitational weight of some devices or their rigid fixation in the scanning room may be sufficient to overcome the force of magnetic attraction on the ferrous mass of such devices toward the imaging volume however such devices with some ferrous mass though inhibited from being pulled into the magnetic field may nevertheless introduce inhomogeneity in the magnetic field distortions in the homogeneity of the magnetic field within the imaging volume must be kept at such a level as to be of minimal consequence to the operator reading the resultant image or data and the possibility of field distortion is proportionally increased as devices with metallic materials are positioned closer to the imaging volume with the most critical position being near the center of the imaging volume essentially where the patient is positioned additionally because of the extremely low levels of rf signals produced by the target image nuclei great care must be taken to assure that devices with active electronic circuits do not emit spurious rf signals as forms of electronic noise such noise can so degrade the signaltonoise ratio of signals received by the mri sensor coils and receivers that image resolution is reduced or rendered completely unreadable active circuits must be carefully shielded to assure that their rf emissions are extremely low at the specific frequencies of the imaging process conversely it is possible through careful design to place a source of rf energy for signal transmission therapy or the like within the mri environment but such signals must be chosen to avoid the discreet lamar frequencies unique to the particular magnetic field strength of a given mri scanner and must be of such high spectral purity as to coexist with the mri without causing any deleterious effects the intense magnetic fields produced by the mri scanner can cause detrimental effects on the performance of common dc and stepper motors in devices needed within the mri scanning room to the point of making their control difficult or causing their complete failure the gradient or timevarying magnetic fields can induce changing ac currents in motors and associated circuitry which may also cause false motor operation for example injectors of imageenhancing contrast agents are commonly required to inject such contrast agent during actual imaging acquisition and such devices include motors that contain magnetic material and that must therefore be located at a sufficient distance to reduce interactive effects with the magnet of the mri scanner for proper operation and safety controllers and consoles of electronics and displays that generate spurious rf signals are therefore located outside the mri scan room to avoid interference with the sensitive rf receivers of the rf scanner accordingly it is desirable to provide a selfcontained mricompatible infusion pump for the relatively long term control and delivery of the various infusion solutions and drugs routinely delivered to a patient within the mri environment during image acquisition such devices must not emit any significant rf emissions that might adversely affect image acquisition operation from within the mri scan room and must not interact with the magnetic fields therein either to cause distortion of the field or to be influenced by these fields sufficiently to jeopardize reliable operation of such devices for various reasons including cost safety convenience and performance it may be desirable to use the mricompatible pump only for short durations while the patient is in the mri in this case the patient must be disconnected from a nonmricompatible pump and connected to the mrisafe pump prior to the mri and later switched back switching a patients iv set involves a health risk due to sterility concerns and a cost in medical personnels time additionally fluid may be wasted from a prescribed volume during the ivswitch procedure therefore it is also desirable to provide a method for substituting an mricompatible pump for a priorconnected nonmricompatible pump for a short duration without removing the patient from the original iv set the mricompatible pump may be connected in substitution for the original pump after the original pump is removed the original pump may be similarly reconnected and the mricompatible pump removed after the mri is complete by easily interchanging pumps on the same iv set installed on a patient the time and expense of interchanging pumps are minimized and compromises of the sterility of an iv installation on a patient are minimized an iv set commonly includes a length of tubing to extend from a fluid connector at a source of a liquid to be infused into a patient to a fluid connector disposed at a distal end of the tubing for connecting to an intravascular needle it is desirable to be able to rapidly transfer a patient that is begin infused with liquid via a pump that is nonmri compatible to a pump that is mri compatible in preparation of the patent for mri procedures without disconnecting the tubing or removing the needle from its intravascular function or other actions which may compromise sterility or inconvenience the patient summary of the invention in accordance with the illustrated embodiment of the present invention a safe and effective infusion device for use within the mri scan room achieves reduction of magnetic material and accurate pumping control as well as reduction of rf emissions in one embodiment the infusion device includes an ultrasonic motor that eliminates magnetic materials and that does not produce any detrimental magnetic fields and that is not affected by external magnetic fields the ultrasonic us motor drives a peristaltic or other suitable fluid pumping mechanism and is driven by a multiphasic electronic signal specifically designed to produce very little rf harmonic noise in the spectral range of about  or  mhz to about  mhz in which mri receivers are most sensitive the drive power for the us motor is generated via circuitry which produces multiphasic drive signals of at least sine and cosine wareforms at related ultrasonic frequencies these drive signals are produced as a sinusoidal wave to reduce high frequency harmonic components which may disturb the mris rfsensitive responsiveness one scheme for producing these multiphasic signals uses coreless or “air core” transformers constructed with inherent leakage inductance that interacts with the complex impedance of the us motor to convert lower voltage square wave signals at the primary winding into sinusoidal high voltage signals at the secondary windings suitable for powering the us motor and producing little harmonic rf interference alternatively dc voltages of opposite polarities can be alternately switched to supply alternating voltages the switched signals can be filtered into sinusoidal signals and applied to the inputs of high voltage linear amplifiers that are set for such gain as needed to produce resultant outputs of sufficient voltage and sinusoidal shape to drive the us motor control electronics receive commands through an input keypad for setting prescribed fluid flow rates to be delivered and such inputs are translated into signals to control the us motor and pumping mechanism various safety devices feed back operational information to the control electronics including detection of motor speed and motion of pump elements air bubbles in the fluid path drip rate high pressure low fluid lowno flow overtime and the like the present infusion device includes battery power for portability and is housed in one rfshielded nonmagnetic housing for convenient location anywhere within the mri scan room without introducing image degrading rf interference or producing distortions of the homogeneous magnetic field and without being affected by the strong magnetic fields or rf energy produced by the mri system such unrestricted placement of the device is of great importance to the safety and convenience of the attending mri staff and imaging patient further in the case of a linear peristaltic pump mechanism the particular position of pump elements along with the speed of motion of these elements must be known to the controller the degree to which the controller may modulate speed and control exact positions of the pump elements directly affects the resolution and accuracy of the fluid delivery system to provide a high degree of speed and position accuracy an optical encoder   is installed along the main pump shaft the encoder disk  has many small graticule marks about the circumference and a single index mark the optical sensor  detects the marks and produces output signals indicative of both the index and individual graticule marks the index occurs only once each  degrees of rotation to facilitate the controller sensing an index to know the position of the pumping elements the rate at which the graticule marks are sensed indicates the speed of the pump shaft as well as its fine position relative to the index mark the controller responds to the optical encoder to modulate the speed of motion of the pump elements at specific positions of the pump shaft in order to reduce inherent nonlinearities in fluid delivery of the lineartype peristaltic pump in this way highly accurate and linear fluid flow may be achieved in an additional embodiment a method is employed to substitute an mricompatible pumping device for a priorconnected nonmricompatible pumping device while preserving the patients connection to a priorconnected primary intravenous iv infusion set the patient is commonly connected to a primary iv set through a primary nonmricompatible pump upon arrival at the mri suite a secondary mricompatible pump attached to a secondary iv set connects to the primary iv set to continue activelypumped iv fluid delivery the primary pump is disengaged from the patients installed primary iv set and a flow preventer to shut off flow that is standard on most iv sets is activated to inhibit liquid flow through a segment of the primary iv set the fluidreceiving or proximal end of the secondary iv set is connected to the upstream end of the primary iv set near the source of the iv fluid the upstream connection may be conveniently formed by puncturing a conventional “y” connector on the primary iv set with a hollow needle on the secondary iv set or via a luertype “y” site connector air is flushed from the secondary iv set by flowing fluid from the upstream connection and the fluiddelivery or distal end of the secondary iv set is then connected in similar manner at a downstream connection in the primary iv set pumping of the liquid may then be resumed using the mricompatible pump operating on the secondary iv set without having dislodged the intravascular needle or actually opening the primary iv circuit the patient and mricompatible pump may then be moved close to the mri scanner while maintaining the controlled iv therapy the secondary iv set so employed may simply be disconnected and discarded after the mri procedure again without opening the original primary iv circuit and the original primary iv set may be reinstalled into the original nonmricompatible pump while preserving the patients connection to the primary iv set by not opening the fluid circuit of the primary set minimal risk to the patient and sterile iv path are achieved as well as reducing medical waste and cost of replacing the primary iv set after the mri procedure to facilitate rapid transitions between primary and secondary pumps and infusion sets one embodiment of the present invention includes an infusion device that receives a liquid conduit for delivering liquid to a patient at volumetric rates that are controllable by the device peristaltic pumping of liquid through the conduit installed within the device is enabled only upon proper registration of a flow valve within a receptacle of the device for actuation upon closing of a safety door flow of liquid through the conduit is inhibited upon opening the safety door and various sensors are incorporated into the device along the path of the conduit to detect inflow and outflow liquid

highpressure liquidinjection device  commonly resides within the scanning room  to administer iv injection into the patient  of liquid compositions for example that enhance image acquisition eg contrast medium or that otherwise provide diagnostic or therapeutic benefits to the patient  being scanned such conventional injection device  should desirably be positioned close to the patient  to

parameters or other data and to actuate the motor drive circuit  for energizing the ultrasonic motor  for rotation at a controlled speed a power supply  is connected to the controller  and drive circuit  to supply electrical power thereto and is connected to a battery  to receive electrical power therefrom during standalone operation or to receive line voltage via plug  as required in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention no magnetic material is used in any of the components of the infusion device  including the ultrasonic motor  pump  power supply  controller  and associated components additionally none of such components is adversely affected during operation by a strong magnetic field and any rf energy that may be generated by electronic signals within the ultrasonic motor  drive circuit  controller  power supply  or associated components is specifically shielded by conductive structures   disposed around such components to inhibit radiation of rfi additionally radiofrequency interference filters  are disposed about all throughshield conductors to inhibit radiation of rfi through such portals referring now to fig  in an additional embodiment of the present invention a method is employed to substitute an mricompatible pumping device  for a priorconnected nonmricompatible pumping device  while preserving the patients  connection to a priorconnected primary iv infusion set  the patient is initially connected  to the primary iv infusion set  which is installed in a nonmricompatible primary pump  the primary pump  controls the pumping action in response to information entered into the unit and in response to a sensor  that monitors liquid flow fluid connectors are disposed in the primary iv set upstream  and downstream  of the primary pump  compatible fluid connectors are also disposed in the secondary iv set upstream  and downstream  of the secondary pump  referring now to the flowchart of fig  a method is illustrated for substituting an mricompatible pumping device  for a priorconnected nonmricompatible pumping device  while preserving the connection  of a priorconnected primary iv infusion set  to a patient initially the patient is connected  to the primary iv set  and primary pump  and liquid is infused  into the patient through the primary iv set  and primary pump  before entry of the patient into the mri environment the primary pump  is disabled from pumping liquid and the flow of liquid through the primary iv set  is inhibited via a shutoff mechanism within the primary iv set the secondary mricompatible pump  is configured to operatively receive a secondary iv set  the secondary pump  may include a sensor for monitoring liquid flow to control the pumping action to transition a patient from a nonmricompatible pump  to an mricompatible pump  without altering the primary iv set  as installed on a patient the upstream fluid connector  of the secondary iv set  is connected  to the upstream fluid connector  of the primary iv set  after purging the tubing of air the downstream fluid connector  of the secondary iv set  is connected  to the downstream fluid connector  of the primary iv set  the secondary iv set is operatively installed  into the secondary mricomptabile iv pump  in one embodiment a sensor  may be connected  to the pump  for measuring the liquid pumped from the liquid source liquid is infused  into the patient through the connection a of the primary iv set  to the patient and through the secondary iv set  and secondary pump  because the secondary pump  is mricompatible the infusion may continue via the secondary pump  within the mri environment the primary iv set  remains installed on a patient who therefore does not have to be directly connected at a to the secondary iv set  but rather the secondary iv set  “bypasses” the section of the primary iv set  that remains occluded between connectors   in an additional embodiment the secondary pump  is connected to the primary iv set  before the primary pump  is operatively disengaged and removed from the primary iv set  referring now to the flowchart of fig  a method is illustrated for removing the secondary pump  and reconnecting the primary pump  after the patient is removed from the mri environment the fluid connectors  and  of the secondary iv set  are disconnected  from the fluid connectors  and  of the primary iv set  this prevents flow of liquid through the secondary iv set  in one embodiment the flow through the primary iv set  is prevented by a shutoff mechanism disposed in the primary iv set  between connectors  and  such shutoff mechanism may manually cut off fluid via handoperated slide or roller clamp or the like the secondary iv set  is operatively reinstalled removed  from the secondary pump  and is discarded the primary pump  is operatively reinstalled on the primary iv set  to which the patient remains connected  the flow sensor  may be reconnected to control the rate of liquid infusion through the primary iv set  liquid is again infused  into the patient via the primary iv set  the primary pump  and the original connection  of the primary iv set to the patient referring now to figs  and  there are shown perspective and side views respectively of operational aspects of the liquiddelivery systems in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention specifically a liquid conduit  includes a fluid connector  at an input or proximal end and includes a flanged connector  that couples the proximal segment of the liquid conduit  to an intermediate segment including a length of precision tubing  as later described herein that terminates in flow valve  a distal segment of the fluid conduit includes a fluid connector  at the distal end thereof and is coupled at its proximal end to the flow valve  the entire assembly including proximal and distal segments of the fluid conduit  fluid connectors   flanged connector  precision tubing  and flow valve  is prepared and sterilized and packaged in an hermeticallysealed envelope in a conventional manner for immediate installation in the pumping device  as needed to infuse liquid into a patient conveniently during an mri procedure the precision tubing  may be formed as a thinwalled extrusion of a flexible elastic material such as silicone rubber or other biocompatible polymer that confines a selected liquid volume per unit length within the bore of selected crosssectional dimension between the flanged connector  and the flow valve  in this way progressive peristaltic pumping by successive pinching and advancing of the pinch point along the tubing  toward the flow valve  administers a known volume of liquid to a patient the length of tubing  between flanged coupling  and flow valve  may be slightly stretched into position within the pumping device  to provide resilient engagement of the flanged connector  and flow valve  within their respective mating receptacles   disposed at opposite ends of the active peristaltic pumping mechanism of the device  the flow valve  as illustrated in the exploded top view of fig  includes an outer housing  within which the precision tubing  passes the mating receptacle  in the pumping device  for the housing  includes a complementary recess that receives the housing  in only one orientation and secures the properlyinstalled housing in place with the aid of slight tension exerted thereon by tubing  a slide or shuttle element  is disposed within the housing  to slide laterally relative to the elongated axis of the tubing  with the tubing  passing through a tapered aperture in the shuttle element  thus with the shuttle element  fully depressed within the housing  the tubing  passes through the portion of the aperture of maximum cross sectional dimension leaving the bore of the tubing  fully open for unimpeded flow of liquid therethrough in alternate position of the shuttle element  maximally protruding from the housing  the tubing  is pinched within a portion of minimal crosssectional dimension of the aperture as shown to inhibit liquid flow through the tubing  thus as initially installed within the pumping device  the flow valve  is configured to inhibit flow through the liquid conduit  to ensure no inadvertent dosing of a patient until the pumping device  is rendered fully operational in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention the device  is inhibited from administering liquid to a patient until a liquid conduit  is properly installed and an access door  is fully closed and safely latched shut the access door  carries passive components of interlocking elements that properly engage and interface with active components of the device  for proper operation only with the access door  fully closed and safely latched shut the region of the device  that is accessed through the opened access door  includes a generally vertical channel for receiving the flanged connector  in a complementary receptacle  that is positioned above the peristaltic pumping mechanism  a sensor may be disposed above the receptacle for the flanged connector to optically sense presence of liquid in the proximal portion of the conduit  and operate to inhibit the pumping device  from further pumping activity in response to sensing an empty conduit the access door  carries an upper platen  that cooperates with a pressure sensor  disposed behind a flexible membrane  and intermediate the receptacle  for the flanged connector  and the peristaltic pumping mechanism  to position an initial length of installed tubing  between spaced platen  and pressure sensor  in this way the pressure at which liquid is supplied to the device can be tonometrically determined within the precision tubing  or otherwise measured for use in correcting calculation of pumping activity required to deliver a selected volumetric infusion rate of liquid to a patient similarly a platen  is carried on the access door  at a location aligned with another pressure sensor  disposed intermediate the pumping mechanism  and the flow valve  in the manner similar to operation of pressure sensor  the pressure sensor  and platen  confine the precision tubing  to provide tonometric measurement or other measurement of outlet pressure an upper limit of outlet pressure may be selected to trigger an alarm condition if such liquid outlet pressure exceeds the set limit as an indication of a clogged outlet conduit the access door  also carries a platen  positioned in alignment with the peristaltic pumping mechanism  to confine the precision tubing  therebetween to effect linear peristaltic pumping activity in the generally downward direction from inlet pressure sensor  toward outlet pressure sensor  neither pressure sensing nor pumping activity may proceed until the access door  is fully closed to position the associated platens about the precision tubing  for proper sensing and pumping operations the access door  also carries a detent element  that mates with a resilient clamp  carried on the shuttle element  of flow valve  specifically these mating elements effect sliding movement of the shuttle element  from initially protruding position ie tubing  pinched toward fully open position ie tubing  not pinched as the access door is closed as illustrated in fig  additionally the engaged detent element  and resilient clamp  remain engaged as the access door  is initially opened thereby to pull the shuttle element  toward maximum protrusion from the housing  to pinch tubing  and inhibit further liquid flow therethrough as illustrated in fig  the attachment of the resilient clamp  carried on the shuttle element  of flow valve  and the detent element  carried on the access door  is overridden and resiliently released following maximum protrusion of the shuttle element  and further opening of the access door  of course detent element  may be carried on the shuttle element  and a resilient clamp  may be carried on the access door  to effect similar interaction and safety operation an ultrasonic or optical sensor may be disposed within the device  at a location thereon below the flow valve  and about the distal segment of the liquid conduit  to detect the presence of air bubbles in the outlet conduit that is formed of ultrasonically or opticallytransmissive material this sensor may include a protruding ushaped receptacle for receiving the conduit therein and for supporting optical elements in the protruding arms of the receptable to sense bubbles in liquid passing therebetween in the outlet flow of liquid within the conduit a mating ushaped element  is supported on the access door  in alignment with the ushaped receptacle of the bubble detector to capture the liquid conduit  fully recessed therein in order to fully close the access door  referring to the partial side view of fig  there is shown a partial side view of the components of fig  assembled into operational configuration specifically the access door  disposed in closed configuration positions the platens    on one side of the intermediate length of precision tubing  against the respective sensors   and pumping mechanism  the flow valve  is configured to open condition and liquid is pumped through the conduit   in response to rotation of the cam shaft  of the peristaltic pumping device  in this manner pinch points along the precision tubing  progress downwardly as successive pump elements  of the pumping device  are manipulated by the rotating cam shaft  to provide the peristaltic pumping action in known manner referring now to fig  there is shown a block schematic diagram of the operational components of the fluid delivery system according to one embodiment of the present invention the peristaltic pump includes pumping elements or fingers  that are manipulated in a pumping sequence in response to rotation of the shaft  the output shaft of ultrasonic us motor  is coupled to the pump shaft  that carries an optical encoder disk  the optical sensing element  detects peripheral marks and an index mark for producing outputs indicative of disk position and speed of rotation these outputs are supplied to the controller  that also receives control signals from manualentry keyboard  and from pressure sensors   bubble detector  and access door safety switch  the controller  generates multiphasic drive signals via drive circuit  and among other functions also controls the display  alarm indicators and the like for proper operation the linear peristaltic pump mechanism requires a high degree of control in order to assure accuracy and linearity of fluid flow rate the operating speed of the pump shaft is modulated to overcome flowrate nonlinearities or discontinuities commonly experienced within a peristaltic pumping cycle as illustrated in the chart of fig a of fluid flow rate over time at constant shaft speed for this reason the controller  requires signal information indicative of the exact location of pump elements during the interval of a pumping cycle in order to determine requisite speed modulation and when to apply the speed modulation during a pumping cycle fig a shows the uncompensated flow output of the peristaltic pump according to one embodiment operating at a very slow rpm rate over slightly more than one revolution one cycle of  pump fingers that takes about  minutes and delivers about  ml of fluid it should be noted that there exists a noflow “dead band” of approximately  minutes in the  minute cycle including a small discontinuity the discontinuity is dependent on very small mechanical tolerances such as the lengths of the fingers the perpendicularity of the platen to the fingers and the likes which vary pump to pump however the long minute dead band is very similar pump to pump in accordance with the present invention very fine control of pumpflow characteristics is established utilizing modulation of the rotational speed during each cycle of the peristaltic mechanism the resultant flow as illustrated in the graph of fig b resembles the smoothness and linearity of syringefine pumps a desirable characteristic when infusing potent drugs or infusing small patients ie babies specifically fig b shows the flow output of the pump resulting from speed ‘modulation’ applied to each rotation in accordance with the present invention the rotational speed modulation is accomplished using for example  discrete different speeds of the motor and pump during the dead band interval to accomplish such speed modulation for flow correction the drive motor  must be able to start and stop very quickly and in very small angular displacement typically in the range from about  to about  milliseconds and within about  to about  degrees of arc the encoder   outputs of index and  pulses per revolution indicate to the controller  the starting position of the dead band index plus mechanical offset by number of pulses counted for compensation and the exact ie the rotational distance as pulses counted to control timing and application of the discrete speeds after compensation is applied in this way according to the present invention the flow output of the linear peristaltic pump is very linear in delivering very precise amounts of fluid of about  mlhr the lowest pump rate  mlhr is a basis for compensation as at high speeds the dead band is inherently shorter and less consequential the optical encoder   provides both fine and coarse output indications of the disk position and speed of rotation specifically one index mark is sensed to identify the exact angular position of the pump shaft  and numerous peripheral graticule marks eg  about the periphery provide fine indication of angular repositioning of the shaft relative to the index mark of course the frequency of recurrence of sensed graticule marks also indicates rotational or angular speed of shaft  thus the controller  receives control signals from the optical encoder   that facilitate modulation of motor speed in the manner as described above to overcome discontinuities or anomalies in a selected flow rate of fluid through the peristaltic pump as illustrated in fig b during portions of the pump cycle driven by the ultrasonic motor  in order to accomplish fine resolution of fluid flow rates through the peristaltic pump the drive motor  must be able to start and stop very rapidly typically within the range of about  to  milliseconds the driving ultrasonic signals are generated by the drive circuit  at about  khz with very low harmonic content in the range of about  or  mhz to about  mhz within which mr scanners are sensitive to rf signals this is accomplished on the drive circuit  as shown in the schematic diagram of fig  using a shiftregister type of counter  that receives input from voltagecontrolled oscillator  to generate highvoltage ultrasonic frequencies in sine and cosine relationship   coreless or air core transformers   are driven pushpull through fieldeffect power transistors that receive paired outputs from the register  the primary inductance through the turns ratio and the leakage inductance of these transformers   coact with the characteristic input capacitance   of the ultrasonic motor  to produce substantially sinusoidal highvoltage drive signals   of low harmonic content these sinusoidal drive signals also pass efficiently through the filters  from the electrically shielded controller section  to the electrically shielded motor section  and exhibit concomitant low to negligible rf interference attributable to drive signal harmonics it should be noted that the ultrasonic motor  provides an ac signal  representative of the composite sine and cosine drive signals this ac signal  is rectified and integrated or lowpass filtered to produce a dc voltage level  that is indicative of motor speed and is distinguishable from the position and rotational speed indications digitally derived from the optical encoder   the analog dc voltage level  is applied via the operational amplifier  to the voltagecontrolled osullator  in order to control the frequency of the motor drive signals specifically the rotational speed of the ultrasonic motor  varies inversely with frequency of the drive signals accordingly an applied ‘motor run’ signal  in combination with the dc feedback voltage  and the time constant of the r and c filter  cause the drive circuit  to generate drive signals   that sweep in frequency from a slightly higher initial frequency that is useful for starting the motor  from standstill to an appropriate running frequency that establishes a steadystate motor speed alternatively the drive signals   for the ultrasonic motor  may be generated from combined signals qq and qq through suitable filtering to generate low voltage sinusoidal sine and cosine signals these signals may then be amplified to sufficient level typically about  volts rms to drive the ultrasonic motor  referring now to fig  there is shown an exploded perspective view of one embodiment of the pump unit  of the present invention in which a gasket  is disposed between mating segments   of the housing the gasket  is formed of a flexible and electrically conductive material to form a fluidtight seal between the housing segments   as shown in the sectional view of fig  the conductive gasket  also inhibits internallygenerated rf noise signals from radiating out of the conductive housing segments   the conductive housing segments   thus form an integral shield that prevents radiative electronic signals from emanating from internal circuitry for example as illustrated in fig  and additionally protects such internal circuitry from fluid spills that might be detrimental to reliable operation referring now to the sectional view of fig  there is shown one light source such as lightemitting diode  of a plurality of such light sources and different colors that are lineally disposed within the housing segment  near a top edge thereof these light sources are positioned behind the door  of conductive material that is hinged  along an outer edge of the housing segment  to facilitate easy access to the peristaltic pumping structure that is supported therein the door  includes a locking lever  for securely closing the door  in operational position against a length of tubing  as illustrated and previously described herein with reference to fig  the door  also includes a clear or translucent window  as illustrated in figs   in alignment with the light sources  to provide largearea illumination for easy visualization from a distant location of the light from a source  a lightscattering element or light pipe  may be disposed intermediate the light sources  and the window  to provide more uniform illumination over the area of the window  in known manner thus a light source  of green color may pulse on and off recurring during normal pumping operation and a light source of red color may pulse on and off recurring to indicate an alarm condition all for convenient visualization from a distant location and the light sources  are sufficiently recessed within the conductive housing segment  to inhibit radiative rf noise signals from emanating from the housing therefore the liquid infusion apparatus of the present invention promotes easy replacement or substitution of pumping devices without interrupting patient connection or otherwise comprising sterility of an installed infusion system an infusion set includes integral segments of a liquid conduit and operable components for interaction and operational engagement with associated components of a pumping device that is compatible with an mri environment ultrasonic motor drive signals are generated with low harmonic content using efficient stepup transformer that coact with the characteristic input impedance of the ultrasonic motor to shape signals as sinusoidal waveforms of low harmonic content   previous patent syringe assembly having disabling mechanismnext patent intravenous catheter
