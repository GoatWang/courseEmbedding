typically formed in aqueous environments at acidic ph it decomposes to ferric oxohyroxides in humid climate this gives rise to the question under which conditions jarosite was formed on mars and what it can tell us about the climatic cycles and the former presence of water on mars we are looking at the phases of jarosite at elevated temperature and pressure and were able to show the stability of jarosite up to  gpa at room temperature and up to  gpa at  oc using neutron powder diffraction furthermore we used inelastic incoherent neutron scattering to look at the vibrational modes of the
