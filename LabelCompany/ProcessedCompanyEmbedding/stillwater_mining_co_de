nongaap financial measures as indicators in assessing the performance of its mining and processing operations during any period because of the processing time required to complete the extraction of finished pgm products there are typically lags of one to three months between ore production and sale of the finished product costs of metals sold  mine production the companys most directly comparable gaap financial measure in any period includes some portion of material mined and processed from prior periods as the process is completed consequently while costs of metals sold  mine production a gaap measure included in the company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss appropriately reflects the expense associated with the materials sold in any period the company has developed certain nongaap financial measures to assess the costs associated with its producing and processing activities in a particular period and to compare those costs between periods while the company believes that these nongaap financial measures may also be of value to outside readers both as general indicators of the company’s mining efficiency from period to period and as insight into how the company internally measures its operating performance these nongaap financial measures are not standardized across the mining industry and in most cases will not be directly comparable to similar measures that may be provided by other companies these nongaap financial measures are only useful as indicators of relative operational performance in any period and because they do not take into account the inventory timing differences that are included in costs of metals sold  mine production they cannot meaningfully be used to develop measures of earnings or profitability a reconciliation of these measures to costs of metals sold  mine production the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for each period shown is provided as part of the following tables and a description of each nongaap financial measure is provided below costs of metals sold  mine production  for the company as a whole this measure is equal to total costs of metals sold  mine production as reported in the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss for the stillwater mine and the east boulder mine the company segregates the expenses within total costs of metals sold  mine production that are directly associated with each of these activities and then allocates the remaining facility costs included in total cost of revenues in proportion to the monthly volumes from each activity the resulting total costs of metals sold  mine production measures for the stillwater mine and the east boulder mine are equal in the aggregate to total consolidated costs of metals sold  mine production as reported in the company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss when divided by the total pgm mined ounces sold in the respective period costs of metals sold  mine production measured for each mine or combined provides an indication of the level of combined cash costs incurred per pgm mined ounce sold in that period consequently total combined cash costs per pgm mined ounce sold nongaap is a general measure of operating efficiency and is affected both by the level of total combined cash costs nongaap and by the total of pgm mined ounces sold total combined cash costs nongaap  this nongaap financial measure is calculated as total costs of metals sold  mine production adjusted for the change in mined inventories to calculate total combined cash costs before byproduct and recycling income credits nongaap from this calculation the company deducts byproduct and recycling income credits to arrive at total combined cash costs net of byproduct and recycling income credits total combined cash costs is a measure of extraction efficiency the company uses this measure as a comparative indication of the cash costs related to production and processing in its mining operations in any period when divided by pgm ounces produced in the respective period total combined cash costs net of byproducts and recycling income credits nongaap measured for each mine or combined provides an indication of the level of combined cash costs incurred per pgm ounce produced in that period when divided by the total ore tons milled in the respective period total combined cash costs per pgm mined ounce net of byproduct and recycling income credits nongaap measured for each mine or combined provides an indication of the level of combined cash costs incurred per ton milled in that period because of variability of ore grade in the company’s mining operations production efficiency underground is frequently measured against ore tons produced rather than contained pgm ounces because ore tons are first weighed as they are fed into the mill mill feed is the first point at which production tons are measured precisely consequently total combined cash costs per ore ton milled nongaap is a general measure of production efficiency and is affected both by the level of total combined cash costs nongaap and by the volume of tons produced and fed to the

analysis of financial condition and results of operations the commentary that follows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this quarterly report on form q and with the information provided in the companys  annual report on form k overview stillwater mining company the company is a delaware corporation and is listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol swc the company extracts and processes ores containing palladium and platinum along with byproduct metals from two underground mines situated within the jm reef a geological formation of platinum group metal pgm mineralization located in stillwater and sweet grass counties in southcentral montana ore produced from the mines is crushed and concentrated in mills located at each mine site mine concentrates are then trucked to the companys processing complex in columbus montana where they are smelted and partially refined in addition to the mine concentrates the company also recycles spent automotive catalyst and other materials containing pgms it receives from third parties at the processing complex a portion of this recycling activity is material the company purchases for its own account while the remainder is toll processed on behalf of others for a fee after being processed through the companys processing facilities in columbus the final product a pgmrich filter cake is shipped to johnson matthey jm in new jersey for final refining and then delivered as finished metal into the companys account first quarter  summary results for the first quarter of  the company reported a consolidated net loss attributable to common stockholders of  million or  per diluted share as compared to consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of  million or  per diluted share for the first quarter of  this was driven by a significant reduction in average combined realized price per mined ounce which fell from  per ounce in the first quarter of  to  per ounce in the first quarter of  offset in part by a reduction in unit costs the  first quarter earnings also reflected a discrete tax benefit of approximately  million related to the companys sales and trading activities segment earnings from the companys mining operations totaled  million before income taxes for the first quarter of  compared to  million before income taxes for the same period in  volumes of mined palladium and platinum sold in the first quarter of  decreased to  ounces from  ounces in the first quarter of  the average combined realized price per ounce on sales of mined palladium and platinum in the first quarter was  lower than that realized in the first quarter of  consolidated total cash costs net of credits per mined ounce for the companys mining operations averaged  per ounce in the first quarter of  which was  lower than the  per ounce in the first quarter of  mostly resulting from higher production rates at the east boulder mine labor reductions at the stillwater mine and a number of cost improvement initiatives at both mines total cash costs net of credits per mined ounce is a nongaap financial measure further defined below in reconciliation of costs of revenues to nongaap financial measures segment earnings from the companys recycling activities before income taxes were  million in the first quarter of  down from  million in the first quarter of  earnings in the recycling segment typically lag corresponding volumes processed by approximately two to three months the share of total recycling ounces toll processed on behalf of others continued to increase relative to recycling ounces purchased for the companys own account in the first quarter of  total recycling ounces of palladium platinum and rhodium fed to the smelter including both purchased ounces and ounces processed on a toll basis increased  to  ounces in the first quarter of  from  ounces in the first quarter of  recycling volumes sold decreased  during the first quarter of  totaling  ounces including palladium platinum and rhodium at an average realization of  per ounce as compared to  ounces sold during the first quarter of  at an average

dated october   exhibit  stillwater mining company reports third quarter  results littleton colo oct   globe newswire  stillwater mining company nyseswc today reported financial results for the quarter ended september   third quarter  highlights allin sustaining costs aisc of  per mined ounce of palladium and platinum down  from  per mined ounce for the third quarter of  mined palladium and platinum production of  ounces a  increase over  ounces mined during the third quarter of  processed  ounces of recycled palladium platinum and rhodium an increase of  over  ounces recycled during the third quarter of  consolidated net loss attributable to common stockholders of  million or  per diluted share reflecting the decrease in average sales price per mined ounce palladium and platinum to  a  decrease from  realized for the third quarter of  and a  million beforetax net loss on the repurchase of the  and  convertible debentures repurchased  million of outstanding  and  convertible debentures for a total cash consideration of  million cash and cash equivalents plus highly liquid investments of  million at quarter end for the third quarter of  the company reported a consolidated net loss attributable to common stockholders of  million or  per diluted share compared to consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of  million or  per diluted share for the third quarter of  the decrease was primarily due to significantly lower realized metal prices and lower sales volumes partially offset by lower costs in addition the company recognized a noncash net loss of  million beforetax related to the repurchase of a portion of its convertible debentures and reorganization costs of  million beforetax during the third quarter of  commenting on the  third quarter results mick mcmullen the companys president and chief executive officer stated the results for the quarter clearly demonstrate progress we have made in many areas of the business total mined production was on target the recycling business continues to grow we eliminated a meaningful portion of our outstanding convertible debt while maintaining an enviable cash balance and most importantly we reduced aisc to  per mined ounce for the quarter unfortunately as we delivered on our initiatives metal prices moved significantly lower our realized basket price of  per mined ounce for the third quarter was down from the  per ounce we received in the last quarter and was the lowest quarter in the last five years we did see an inventory build of mined ounces which meant that sales were  ounces lower than production for the quarter we expect to see this metal sold in the fourth quarter of  to weather these storms in the pgm markets we continue to focus on costs and make improvements to gain additional efficiencies throughout the operations during the third quarter of  we executed the previously announced reorganization strategy which involved a staff reduction and modifying our mine plan to focus on the most profitable areas within the stillwater mine while maximizing production from the east boulder mine through our planned workforce reduction and natural attrition the employee count decreased by  during the third quarter of  to a total of  employees at the end of the period we are already experiencing improved efficiencies as a result of these changes following the rollout of the strategic direction for the company at the beginning of last year we introduced a goal to achieve aisc in the low  per mined ounce range i am pleased to report based on recent performance we are achieving that goal the current platinum group metals pgm market demonstrates we must strengthen the business to ensure longterm sustainability as part of that effort today we are instituting a new target of aisc in the mid  per mined ounce range over the medium term as we continue to decrease costs in conjunction with gains in operational efficiencies stillwater will be best positioned for all stakeholders in any market environment concluded mr mcmullen  fullyear guidance guidance for the fullyear  remains unchanged from the guidance released on july   which is detailed below    guidance

of approximately  million  million of  convertible debentures and approximately  million for a capital lease and financing for a small installment land purchase the change in debt balance is a result of the companys repurchase of a portion of its convertible debentures during the third quarter partially offset by the accretion of the discount on the companys outstanding  convertible debentures

from the base metal refinery  ounces sold and average realized price per ounce from other relate to ounces acquired periodically in the open market and simultaneously resold to third parties reconciliation of costs of revenues to nongaap financial measures the company utilizes certain nongaap financial measures as indicators in assessing the performance of its mining and processing operations during any period because of the processing time required to complete the extraction of finished pgm products there are typically lags of one to three months between ore production and sale of the finished product sales in any period include some portion of material mined and processed from prior periods as the revenue recognition process is completed consequently while costs of revenues a gaap financial measure included in the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive loss income appropriately reflects the expense associated with the materials sold in any period the company has developed certain nongaap financial measures to assess the costs associated with its producing and processing activities in a particular period and to compare those costs between periods while the company believes that these nongaap financial measures may also be of value to outside readers both as general indicators of the companys mining efficiency from period to period and as insight into how the company internally measures its operating performance these nongaap financial measures are not standardized across the mining industry and in most cases will not be directly comparable to similar measures that may be provided by other companies these nongaap financial measures are only useful as indicators of relative operational performance in any period and because they do not take into account the inventory timing differences that are included in costs of revenues they cannot meaningfully be used to develop measures of earnings or profitability a reconciliation of these measures to costs of revenues the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for each period shown is provided as part of the following tables and a description of each nongaap financial measure is provided below total consolidated costs of revenues  for the company as a whole this measure is equal to total costs of revenues as reported in the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive loss income for the stillwater mine the east boulder mine and pgm recycling and other the company segregates the expenses within total costs of revenues that are directly associated with each of these activities and then allocates the remaining facility costs included in total cost of revenues in proportion to the monthly volumes from each activity the resulting total costs of revenues measures for the stillwater mine the east boulder mine and pgm recycling and other are equal in the aggregate to total consolidated costs of revenues as reported in the companys consolidated statements of comprehensive loss income total cash costs nongaap  this nongaap financial measure is calculated as total costs of revenues adjusted to exclude costs of metals sold from pgm recycling and other depletion and depreciation and amortization for mine production and pgm recycling and other asset retirement costs and timing differences resulting from changes in product inventories to arrive at total cash costs before byproduct and recycling credits from this calculation the company deducts byproduct and recycling income credits to arrive at total cash costs net of byproduct and recycling credits total cash costs is a measure of extraction efficiency the company uses this measure as a comparative indication of the cash costs related to production and processing in its mining operations in any period when divided by the total tons milled in the respective period total cash costs per ton milled nongaap measured for each mine or combined provides an indication of the level of cash costs incurred per ton milled in that period because of variability of ore grade in the companys mining operations mine production efficiency underground is frequently measured against ore tons produced rather than contained pgm ounces because ore tons are first weighed as they are fed into the mill mill feed is the first point at which mine production tons are measured precisely consequently total cash costs per ton milled nongaap is a general measure of production efficiency and is affected both by the level of total cash costs nongaap and by the volume of tons produced and fed to the mill when divided by the total recoverable pgm ounces from production in the respective period total cash costs per ounce nongaap measured for each mine or combined provides an indication of the level of cash costs incurred per pgm ounce produced in that period recoverable pgm ounces from production are an indication of the amount of pgm product extracted through mining in any period because ultimately extracting pgm material is the objective of mining the cash cost per ounce of extracting and processing pgm ounces in a period is a useful measure for comparing extraction efficiency between periods and between the companys mines consequently total cash costs per ounce nongaap in any period is a general measure of extraction efficiency and is affected by the level of total cash costs nongaap by the grade of the ore produced and by the volume of ore produced in the period with respect to  guidance regarding total cash costs per mined ounce net of byproduct and recycling credits and allin sustaining costs per mined ounce the company cannot provide a quantitative reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure without unreasonable effort however

analysis of financial condition and results of operations the commentary that follows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this quarterly report on form q and with the information provided in the companys  annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission on february   form k overview stillwater mining company the company is a delaware corporation that has its shares of common stock listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol swc the company extracts and processes ores containing palladium and platinum along with byproduct metals from two underground mines situated within the jm reef a geological formation of platinum group metal pgm mineralization which is located in stillwater and sweet grass counties in southcentral montana ore produced from the mines is crushed and concentrated in mills located at each mine site mine concentrates are then trucked to the companys processing complex in columbus montana where they are smelted and partially refined in addition to the mine concentrates the company also recycles spent automotive catalyst and other materials containing pgms it receives from third parties at the processing complex a portion of this recycling activity is material the company purchases for its own account while the remainder is toll processed on behalf of others for a fee after being processed through the companys processing facilities in columbus the final product a pgmrich filter cake is shipped to johnson matthey jm in new jersey for final refining before it is then delivered as finished metal second quarter  summary results for the second quarter of  the company reported a consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of  million or  per diluted share as compared to the consolidated net loss attributable to common stockholders of  million or  per diluted share for the second quarter of  the lower operating results in the second quarter of  were driven by a significant reduction in average combined realized price per mined ounce which fell from  per ounce in the second quarter of  to  per ounce in the second quarter of  which was offset in part by a reduction in unit costs the second quarter of  included an impairment charge of  million beforetax segment earnings from the companys mining operations totaled  million before income taxes for the second quarter of  compared to  million before income taxes for the same period in  volumes of mined palladium and platinum sold in the second quarter of  increased to  ounces from  ounces in the second quarter of  reflecting both increased production and drawdown of mine ounce inventory the average combined realized price per ounce on sales of mined palladium and platinum in the second quarter of  was  lower than that realized in the second quarter of  costs of metals sold per pgm mined ounce is the companys most directly comparable gaap financial measure to total cash costs net of credits per pgm mined ounce a nongaap financial measure the companys consolidated costs of metals sold per mined ounce of palladium and platinum was  per ounce in the second quarter of  as compared to  per ounce in the second quarter of  a  decrease consolidated total cash costs net of credits per pgm mined ounce for the companys mining operations averaged  per ounce in the second quarter of  which was  lower than the  per ounce in the second quarter of  mostly resulting from higher production rates at the east boulder mine labor reductions at the stillwater mine and a number of cost improvement initiatives at both mines see reconciliation of gaap financial measures to nongaap financial measures segment earnings from the companys recycling activities before income taxes were  million in the second quarter of  an increase over the  million in the second quarter of  earnings in the recycling segment typically lag corresponding volumes processed by approximately two to three months total recycling ounces of palladium platinum and rhodium fed to the smelter including both purchased ounces and ounces processed on a toll basis increased  to  ounces in the second quarter of  from  ounces in the second quarter of  recycling volumes sold increased  during the second quarter of  totaling  ounces including palladium

metric is an indication of the total cash capital and operating costs per pgm mined ounce including corporate general and administrative costs required to sustain the companys current level of mining activities for the second quarter of  aisc averaged  per pgm mined ounce a  decrease from the first quarter of  and  lower than the aisc of  per pgm mined ounce achieved in the second quarter of  this was driven by lower total cash costs and lower capital spending incurred to sustain operations and higher production volumes during the second quarter of  for a more complete discussion of this measure refer to  reconciliation of gaap financial measures to nongaap financial measures stillwater mine at the stillwater mine combined palladium and platinum production increased  in the second

stillwater mine totaled  million for the second quarter of  including  million for blitz development this compares to the  million of capital expenditures at the stillwater mine during the second quarter of  of which  million was for blitz development the reduction in capital expenditures was primarily due to lower infrastructure activity in the mine along with higher development productivity that reduced unit rates primary and secondary development footages excluding blitz development for the second quarter of  decreased relative to the comparable footages for the second quarter of  with

before income taxes from its pgm recycling operations on revenues of  million for the second quarter of  the recycling operations earned  million in income before income taxes on revenues of  million for the second quarter of  pgm recycling revenues decreased by  compared to the same period in  due to lower realized selling prices as a result of the fall in palladium and platinum market prices which was partially offset by an increase in ounces sold the cost of metals sold from the pgm recycling segment was  million in the second quarter of  as compared to  million in the second quarter of  a decrease of  a majority of the cost of metals sold from recycling in each period is attributable to the acquisition cost of purchasing recyclable materials for the companys own account therefore the aggregate cost of metals sold from the pgm recycling segment is driven mostly by the volume and the value of the pgms in the materials purchased by the company tolling revenues increased by
