picture view is that asset classes across the board have delivered strong returns through june this is despite interest rate hikes by the federal reserve’s federal open market committee fomc in fact treasury yields have actually fallen in the face of two interest rate increases this year pushing bond prices higher international stocks and bonds have also risen in  boosted by stabilizing global growth rates depressed yields worldwide and improving corporate earnings looking a little more closely at the us stocks continued their upward trajectory early in the year following the postpresidential election results in november while the new administration has not made much traction in passing new legislation relatively healthy economic data – including good jobs growth higher wages and a strong housing market – have supported stocks at the time of this writing june   the sp  index is up  on a pricebasis and up  on a total return basis which includes dividends technology stocks have led us equity markets this year within the sp  index the sector is up over  yeartodate given healthy earnings growth expectations for the group the more techheavy nasdaq index is up a whopping  this year almost  ahead of the sp  index however we’ve started to see some signs of weakness among tech stalwarts recently and are watching the group closely on the flip side energy and telecom stocks have lagged the index with price declines of  and  respectively of note energy and telecom stocks were two of the three bestperforming sectors in the sp  index last year with prices returns of  and  respectively this marked turnaround in performance provides a cautionary tale on the pitfalls of market timing last year’s leaders may well become this year’s laggards in general we’ve found that it’s difficult if not impossible to predict which sectors or industries will outperform in any given year as a result we recommend maintaining a diversified portfolio through all market cycles and rebalancing regularly another wide disparity arose among growth and value stocks yeartodate growth stocks as measured by the russell  growth index are up almost  on a price return basis versus a  return for value stocks as measured by the russell  value index much of the outperformance by growth stocks stems from strong returns among technology stocks – many of which are growthoriented and trade at higher valuation levels after years of underperforming us stocks international equities have outperformed yeartodate in aggregate developed stocks from japan europe and australia are up  on a price return basis through june while this group has lagged us stocks over the past four consecutive years improving economies in most of these regions positive consumer sentiment and accommodative central banks are starting to turn the tide likewise emerging markets stocks are up over  on a price return basis so far this year the marked turnaround comes as corporate earnings growth for many of these countries is starting to improve and global growth is stabilizing other interesting observations for  include recordlow stock volatility levels lower yields despite higher interest rates by the fomc and an eventful if unproductive sixmonths in washington looking forward we see risks and opportunities the federal reserve is set to reduce its bloated balance sheet later this year which could pose a risk to aboveaverage stock valuation levels despite the potential for unintended consequences we view the move as a vote of confidence in the us economy and as a much needed step towards more normalized monetary policy while a more restrictive federal reserve is a headwind to asset prices interest rates remain very low with no signs of rising and the us economy remains on stable footing these factors along with improving us corporate earnings growth bode well for continued stock gains over the longterm share this congratulations parsec prize

parsec prize in  the prize will be considered for nonprofits in any region where parsec has a physical office thank you the parsec team share this the fiduciary rule and you if you keep up with current events and what is happening in washington it is likely that you have heard about the department of labor’s fiduciary rule some of you may be curious about what exactly it is and how it could possibly affect you before we talk about that let’s take a quick look at the spectrum of financial advice and where parsec lands on that spectrum rias and bds these two acronyms stand for registered investment advisors and broker dealers these are two different types of providers of financial advice in  registered investment advisors were separated from broker dealers under the investment advisors act of  consider that the united states had just emerged from one of the biggest stock market crashes on record a year or two prior the goal of this new legislation was to eliminate potential conflicts of interest when a financial professional might consciously or unconsciously provide advice not in the best interest of the client however these new rules did not apply to everyone they only applied to a group of advisors that were registered investment advisors or rias to make things even more complicated someone could be a registered investment advisor at the same time they were associated with a bd now if an advisor is associated with a bd they are essentially an agent for that company very simply think about your local home or auto insurance agent they work for the insurance company and you know their job is to sell you an insurance product this is the relationship that all advisors who work for large banks and brokerage firms maintain their first priority is to sell the products of their employer cue the independent broker dealer as mentioned previously there are some advisors who are associated with both an ria and a bd these advisory firms typically associate with an independent broker dealer which means that they are still able to sell products and receive a commission or they can provide advice through the ria and receive a fee at the end of the day these advisors are stuck with a decision whether to sell the client a product or to provide objective advice doesn’t it seem like it would be very difficult for an advisor to provide advice then sell them a product based on that advice it is like asking your barber whether or not you need a haircut this is why it is extremely difficult if not impossible for an advisor to be a fiduciary if they maintain an association with a bd so what is parsec since our founding in  parsec has only been a registered investment advisor we have never been associated with a bd nor have we ever received any commissions or revenue sharing from our recommendations to our clients one of our core beliefs is that our clients should have complete transparency on our fees and that there is never any question of what the total cost to work with us is this means that we are a feeonly fiduciary that always seeks to serve our clients’ best interests as well as eliminate any conflicts of interest that could arise how does the dol’s fiduciary rule affect rias and bds the current fiduciary rule proposal affects retirement accounts including ks and iras if the rule is adopted it will require anyone working with these types of accounts to show that their advice is in the best interest of the client not just a “suitable” recommendation which is the current requirement for bds we believe this is a step in the right direction for consumers but must point out that if an advisor is a representative of a bd they still are still considered an “agent” of their firm and this rule only requires they act in the clients’ best interest with iras and ks we believe the best outcomes occur when an advisor is able to guide a client in a feeonly advisory relationship the proposed regulation if it eventually goes through will require very small changes to some of our processes for documentation purposes but no changes to how we work with our clients we hope this post leaves you more informed about why being a fiduciary is so important to us thank you the parsec team share this march update – trading trading is an important albeit often underappreciated part of investment management  in this email we’ll share with you our investment philosophy and how it drives our trading approach  while parsec uses both funds and individual securities across client accounts this blog applies more to those portfolios with individual stock holdings  in general we use funds for smallersized accounts because of the immediate diversity it provides at a relatively low cost  we generally use individual securities for larger client portfolios as these portfolios offer economies of scale that can overcome trading costs  over the years we have finetuned our trading approach with an eye towards minimizing costs and maximizing efficiency as you’ve heard us say timeandagain parsec does not engage in market timing  instead of trying to determine when one asset class will underperform and another outperform we select our securities using a bottomup fundamental research approach   using individual equities as an example this means that we first screen any new stock ideas for attractive financial characteristics and then perform additional due diligence to determine its total return potential over the next several years  once a stock is added to a parsec portfolio we monitor the company regularly for changes in its competitive environment its growth drivers and valuation levels  however we do all of this in light of our longterm thesis on the stock as opposed to the market’s nearterm noise taking a longterm investment approach in which we focus on a security’s total return potential often allows us to buy and hold securities for many years  this keeps our portfolio turnover – a measure of how frequently assets are bought and sold – low and in turn keeps our trading costs low  when we do trade we use block trades whenever possible  by aggregating all of our trades into one large transaction we can better assure that clients receive the same price when a given security is bought or sold in addition our focus on a security’s longterm potential largely circumvents the need for specialized trade orders  typically shortterm traders and not longterm investors utilize limit orders stop orders or other types of nonmarket orders  these specialized trades often come with additional costs including higher transaction fees for retail investors and various opportunity costs one such opportunity cost can arise when setting shortterm price targets  for example using a limit order to purchase a security requires an investor to set a price target  however without thoroughly researching a security using fundamental analysis price targets are often based on “a gut feel” or are kneejerk reactions to an investor’s past experience with an asset  in effect unconscious emotions can drive the trading decision and lead to even higher costs  these can come in the form of missed opportunities as when a stock declines but doesn’t quite reach an investor’s price target to buy  in this case if the stock then continues higher an investor may have missedout on significant upside potential another opportunity cost is possible when a security pays a dividend but because an investor was waiting for a slightly lower price before buying he or she inadvertently forfeited the added income  in some cases the dividend payout might have amounted to more than the savings associated with buying at a lower price while there are many types of trades and some that do add value in general we’ve found that specialized trade orders often come with more costs than benefits  this is why parsec identifies assets using fundamental research and takes the longterm view on a security’s total return potential  doing so inherently reduces security turnover in a portfolio and thus trading costs  it also avoids incurring hidden opportunity costs and we believe increases the likelihood of reaching your longerterm financial goals thank you the parsec team share this time to update your estate plan now that we have started a new year it’s a good time for many of us to stop putting off getting an estate plan created or updated under current tax law most people do not have a concern with estate tax  the current federal estate tax exemption is  million per person if properly elected any unused exemption is portable between spouses  therefore a married couple with an estate of  million or below could pass their entire estate to heirs without any federal estate tax liability while much attention is focused on the tax aspects estate planning is more a matter of organizing and simplifying your affairs so that your heirs are not burdened with additional stress at the same time they are grieving for the loss of a loved one we recommend that you engage the services of a qualified attorney to guide you and create the appropriate documents your estate plan should include a will and possibly living or revocable trusts advanced directives and incapacity planning are other items that are typically addressed as part of your estate plan this includes having documents prepared such as a durable power of attorney health care power of attorney and living will as part of your estate plan you should review your beneficiary designations by filling out a beneficiary designation form individuals can bypass the probate process and pass specific assets upon their death directly to their heirs many types of assets such as iras qualified retirement plans life insurance policies and commercial annuities pass via beneficiary designation rather than through your will in addition beneficiary designations can be added to taxable investment accounts known as transfer on death or “tod” and bank accounts known as payable on death or “pod” note that while the assets passing by beneficiary designation bypass the probate process they are still included as part of the decedent’s estate for calculating any potential estate tax liability there is talk that the estate tax may be changed or even eliminated this year for most people that shouldn’t be a deterrent to getting their estate plan done since few are affected by the estate tax in the first place having an updated estate plan gives you peace of mind and helps prevent additional stress on your heirs once you have a plan in place it can always be modified as tax laws and your personal circumstances change william s hansen cfa president chief investment officer share this what’s ahead for fixed income after more than thirty years of falling interest rates and thus rising bond prices yields may be moving higher  while trends are often shortlived this new trajectory could persist into  and beyond given recent changes in the political landscape as well as a less accommodative federal reserve fed  we’ll take a look at what this new monetary and political environment may mean for bonds and how to bestposition your fixed income portfolio for the longterm a proxy for the bond market the year treasury note yield hit an historical low of  in july  only to jump  basis points or  by the end of november  the move came as investors responded favorably to the surprise us presidential and congressional election results in anticipation of higher growth levels in the years to come part of the optimism stemmed from the new administration’s promise to cut consumer and corporate taxes and spend on infrastructure projects  this picture presents a mixed bag for bonds however  increased fiscal spending and lower taxes are positive for economic growth and a healthy economy is generally good for lending and credit activity  but stronger economic growth would push yields higher and thus bond prices lower  on the other hand higher yields would provide investors with higher current income acting as a partial offset to lower bond prices  rising interest rates or yields would also allow investors to reinvest into higheryielding bonds duration is an important characteristic to consider when reinvesting at higher yields  a bond’s duration is the length of time it takes an investor to recoup his or her investment  it also determines how much a bond’s price will fall when yields rise  longer duration bonds such as treasury or corporate bonds with long maturities experience sharper price declines when yields rise  likewise shorter duration bonds are less volatile and will exhibit smaller price declines all else being equal  because we can’t predict the exact direction or speed of interest rate changes it’s important to have exposure to bonds with a mix of durations  in this way an investor is able to respond to any given environment  for example when yields are rising an investor can sell her shorterduration bonds which are less susceptible to prices changes and reinvest into longerduration bonds with higher rates another factor that affects bond prices is inflation  inflation expectations have started to heat up in light of low unemployment wage growth and expectations for increased government stimulus  higher inflation could also put upward pressure on interest rates and thus downward pressure on bond prices  while inflation can erode the real returns of many bonds some bonds such as treasury inflationprotected securities tips stand to benefit  tips are indexed to inflation and backed by the us government  whenever inflation rises the principal amount of tips gets adjusted higher  this in turn leads to a higher interest payment because a tips coupon is calculated based on the principal amount finally the federal reserve’s shift away from accommodative monetary policy will have an impact on bond prices  although higher interest rates from the fed will likely pressure fixed income prices overall we view this change favorably  this is because a return to more normal interest rate levels is critical to the functioning of large institutions like insurance companies and banks which play a key role in our society  likewise higher interest rates will provide more income to the millions of baby boomers starting to retire and would help stabilize struggling pension plans at many companies taken altogether and in light of an uncertain environment we believe a diversified bond portfolio targeted to meet your specific fixed income needs is the best way to weather this changing yield environment  in addition to considering your specific income objectives our investment policy committee meets regularly to assess the current economic fiscal and monetary environment  we adjust our asset allocation targets in order to take advantage of attractive opportunities or reduce exposure to higherrisk overvalued areas  while we may overweight some areas or underweight others in the longrun we continue to believe that a welldiversified portfolio is the best way to weather any market environment

qualify harli palme cfa cfp® partner share this  year in review while the year hasn’t officially wrapped up as of this writing we’re close enough to be able to form some opinions and offer some perspective on   if nothing else this year could be characterized as unexpected  despite a steep stock selloff in january which weighed on investors’ outlooks early in  us stock returns are poised to close up over  percent through december  on the other hand bond returns while on target to gain about  percent for the year are finally starting to come under pressure after a bull market of over  years looking back the sp  index fell over  percent in january after us gdp growth came in below expectations corporate earnings continued to fall and recession fears spiked  despite investor concerns most economic data at home were relatively healthy driven primarily by steady gains in employment and disposable personal income  additionally many investors were concerned that slowing global growth would ultimately weigh on a resilient us economy  specifically the international monetary fund imf lowered its global growth rate predictions several times china delivered gdp growth below expectations and commodity prices remained depressed stocks turned a corner in march however surging almost  percent at home and over  percent in developing countries  the stateside rally came amid falling us corporate earnings that were driven by lower energy prices depressed commodity prices and a strong dollar  although declining earnings growth usually leads to lower stock prices the federal open market committee’s fomc announcement that it would reduce the number of interest rate hikes for the year buoyed stock valuations  as a result stock pricetoearnings multiples a common valuation metric expanded while underlying fundamentals remained weak after several years of underperformance emerging markets stocks and bonds reversed course in  as depressed commodity prices started to recover  the fomc’s plan for fewer interest rate hikes was also a boost for emerging markets countries many of which owe significant amounts of us dollardenominated debt  likewise economic data out of china were better than expected although growing debt levels and excessive government stimulus there could prove to be longerterm risks in another unexpected development lowgrowth telecom and utilities sectors led us stocks in the first half of the year  utilities and telecom stocks typically carry higher debt levels and the fomc’s move to keep interest rates lower for longer was viewed favorably by the markets  both sectors were up over  percent through june although they have since given back almost half of those gains in between tragic terrorist attacks the uk shocked the world in june when it voted to exit the european union a development known as “brexit”  markets tumbled on the news but quickly bounced back and reached new highs  while shocking headlines dominated the popular press global economic growth was quietly stabilizing around the globe and accelerating at home the summer brought a muchneeded reprieve from the barrage of grim headlines earlier in the year  it also ushered in new confidence in the us expansion as jobs growth continued wage growth perked up and housing data improved  as the presidential election drew near corporate spending started to pick up oil prices rallied and company earnings improved following a relatively calm summer the us surprised the world in november with the election of donald trump to the presidency while republicans maintained their majorities in the house and senate  despite concerns of a global shift towards populism markets soared on hopes of tax cuts and better growth at home  after the election and following months of healthy economic data – – including a meaningful pickup in rd quarter us gdp growth and signs that inflation was heating up – – the fomc raised rates in december as expected clearly  was an eventful year for markets governments and citizens alike  while several unknowns have become known many of this year’s developments have sowed the seeds for more uncertainty ahead  in terms of markets although a divide still exists between stock valuation levels and underlying fundamentals we’re encouraged by improving corporate earnings growth  on the other hand bonds have benefited from over thirty years of falling yields and thus rising prices  a steeper fomc rate hike trajectory is clearly a headwind for fixed income but the central bank’s stance is supported by strong economic growth and signs of inflation  the end result may mean stagnant fixed income returns but a healthy economy – a tradeoff we’re willing to take overall we view stocks as most likely to outpace growing inflation expectations over the long term  while equity prices may be due for a pullback in the near term evidence suggests that the longerterm secular bull market remains intact thank you the parsec team share this the perfect gift ideas…from a planning perspective december is here and  is drawing to a close  as we enter the holiday season we scramble to pick the perfect gift for our family members our friends teachers… the list goes on at parsec we work with clients to create gifting strategies that fit into their overall financial plan this december we encourage you to think about giving and its potential longer term impact on both your family children and grandchildren and your taxes  let’s first review a powerful gifting strategy to younger family members the custodial roth ira as long as there is earned income which can come from mowing lawns housework babysitting etc contributions to a custodial roth ira can be made up to the amount of the earned income but not over   for example your  year old grandchild earned  over the summer through his lawn mowing business  you can open a custodial roth ira for him and deposit a matching gift of  let’s say he continues to mow lawns each summer for the next  years and you continue to match his earnings with a  holiday gift  assuming a  return each year your gifts will grow to over  at the end of  years  remember this is only the beginning the approximate  earnings in this example will continue to compound over time and all earnings are tax free upon withdrawal later in life  rewarding your grandchild’s hard work through roth contributions is a holiday gift that offers valuable lessons on many levels let’s switch gears to philanthropy  each year parsec’s client service team processes hundreds of charitable gift requests from our clients  these gifts of course offer tax advantages in various forms  for many of our clients the qualified charitable distribution or qcd brings the most formidable tax savings  how does it work  if you are over   up to  of your required minimum distribution rmd can be given directly to charity through a qcd  the result your agi will be reduced dollar for dollar by the amount of the qcd  a simple yet impactful strategy  on not only your charity of choice but also on your tax dollar as we enter this holiday season we hope that you reach out to your financial advisor to talk about gifting strategies that may be appropriate for you and your family  happy holidays betsy cunagin cfp® senior financial advisor  is the ira contribution limit for  and    share
