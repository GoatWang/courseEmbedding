information in this k before deciding to invest in our company if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations for growth could be seriously harmed as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment     risks related to our business   if we do not continue to provide competitive travel products and services we may not be able to attract new customers or to retain existing customers and our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer our success depends on our ability to attract new customers or to retain existing customers which in turn requires our continuous provision of a wide array of competitive travel products and services participants in the travel industry are continuously developing new travel products and services we strive to stay abreast of emerging and rapidly changing customer preferences and be able to anticipate trends that will appeal to existing and potential customers we will also continue to invest in research and development in order to continuously improve the speed accuracy and comprehensiveness of our online platform and offline sales if we fail to continuously improve our travel products and services and platform at a competitive pace we may lose customers to our competitors and may not attract new customers in addition to asia tours we provide other travelrelated services such as sales of tourist attraction tickets and visa processing services we intend to further broaden our product selection by extending our coverage of departing cities and travel destinations as well as offering more departure time selections if we fail to continue to design quality travel products and services tailored to accommodate our customers’ changing needs and preferences we may not be able to sell additional products and services to our current customers retain our current customers or attract new customers and our business financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected   we may not be able to compete against companies with substantially greater resources the travel industry is intensely competitive and we expect competition to intensify further in the future companies with greater resources may have advantages that make our model weaker in comparison   we have operated at a loss and we may not be profitable in the near future we have not achieved profitability we may not be able to achieve profitability or avoid net losses in the future although our revenues have grown significantly in recent periods such growth rates may not be sustainable and may decrease in the future in addition our ability to become profitable depends on various factors including our ability to control our costs and expenses which we expect will increase as we expand our business and invest more in product developments and sales and marketing if our revenues fail to increase at the rate we anticipate or if our costs and expenses increase at a more rapid rate than our revenues we may not be able to achieve profitability and may incur greater losses   we cannot assure that we will earn a profit or that our products will be accepted by consumers our business is speculative and reliant on acceptance of our brand name by local communities travelers and advertisers our operating performance is also heavily dependent on our ability to earn a profit from our services we cannot assure as to whether we will be successful or earn any revenue or profit or that investors will not lose their entire investment   we may incur cost overruns in the distribution of our various services we may incur substantial cost overruns in the distribution of our services unanticipated costs may force us to obtain additional capital or financing from other sources or may cause us to lose our entire investment if we are unable to obtain the additional funds necessary to implement our business plan we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain sufficient capital to successfully continue the implementation of our business plan if a greater investment in the business is required due to cost overruns the probability of earning a profit or a return of the shareholders’ investment in us diminishes   if our estimates related to future expenditures are erroneous or inaccurate our business will fail and you could lose your entire investment our success is dependent in part upon the accuracy of our management’s estimates of our future cost expenditures for legal and accounting services including those we expect to incur as a publicly reporting company for research and development construction marketing and for administrative expenses if such estimates are erroneous or inaccurate or if we encounter unforeseen costs we may not be able to carry out our business plan which could result in the failure of our business and the loss of your entire investment   the loss of the services of any of our officers or our failure to timely identify and retain competent personnel could negatively impact our ability to develop our products and sales the development of our business will continue to place a significant strain on our limited personnel management and other resources our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers qian hong our chairman and director jing wenjia our chief executive officer and director zhao hongxi our chief financial officer and director they are developing our business and our ability to identify and retain competent employees with the skills required to execute our business objectives the loss of the services of any of our officers or our failure to timely identify and retain competent personnel could negatively impact our ability to develop our products and sales which could adversely affect our financial results and impair our growth          our chief executive officer beneficially owns and controls a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock which may limit your ability and the ability of our other stockholders whether acting alone or together to propose or direct the management or overall direction of our company ms jing wenjia acts as our chief executive officer and director and through her control of approximately  of our outstanding common stock controls the company and important matters relating to us as a result of her positions and her control of our common stock ms wenjia controls the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval including the election of our directors our business strategy and our daytoday operations in addition ms wenjia’s ownership of our common stock and control of the company could discourage the acquisition of our common stock by potential investors and could have an antitakeover effect preventing a change in control of the company and possibly depressing the trading price of our common stock there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise with respect to ms wenjia’s ownership and control of the company or that any conflicts will be resolved in a manner favorable to the other shareholders of the company   our internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation as a newly public reporting company we will be in a continuing process of developing establishing and maintaining internal controls and procedures that will allow our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to our internal controls over financial reporting if and when required to do so under section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act until the date we are no longer an emerging growth company our management will be required to report on our internal controls over financial reporting under section  if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls we would not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section  at such time our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented designed or operating moreover our testing or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm that must be performed may reveal other material weaknesses or that the material weaknesses described above have not been fully remediated if we do not remediate the material weaknesses described above or if other material weaknesses are identified or we are not able to comply with the requirements of section  in a timely manner our reported financial results could be materially misstated or could subsequently require restatement we could receive an adverse opinion regarding our internal controls over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm and we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities which would require additional financial and management resources and the market price of our stock could decline   in the event of a breach of law by us or a breach of a contractual obligation our shareholders will have little or no recourse because all of our assets as well as our officers and directors are located in canada and france investors in our company will have little recourse in the event of a breach of law or contractual obligation that has an adverse effect upon our operations because of the inherent difficulties in enforcing their rights since all of our assets are located in canada and france jing wenjia and zhao hongxi as our officers and directors reside outside of the united states investors located in the united states may have difficulty enforcing their rights against such persons if they were to breach their duties in addition it may not be possible to affect service of process in canada and france and uncertainty exists as to whether the courts in canada and france would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against our officers and directors predicated on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the us or any state thereof or to be competent to hear original actions brought in canada and france against us or such person predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof   if we are unable to hire retain or motivate qualified personnel consultants independent contractors and advisors we may not be able to grow effectively our performance will be largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly qualified personnel for all areas of our organization competition for such qualified employees is intense if we do not succeed in attracting excellent personnel or in retaining or motivating them we may be unable to grow effectively in addition all future success depends largely on our ability to retain key consultants and advisors we cannot assure that any skilled individuals will agree to become an employee consultant or independent contractor of sinorama our inability to retain their services could negatively impact our business and our ability to execute our business strategy from our past experiences we have never had difficulties hiring or retaining qualified personnel independent contractors or advisors   our lack of an independent audit committee and audit committee financial expert at this time may hinder our board of directors’ effectiveness in fulfilling the functions of the audit committee without undue influence from management and until we establish such committee will prevent us from obtaining a listing on a national securities exchange although our common stock is not listed on any national securities exchange for purposes of independence we use the definition of independence applied by nasdaq currently we have no independent audit committee our full board of director’s functions as our audit committee and is comprised of three directors an independent audit committee plays a crucial role in the corporate governance process assessing our companys processes relating to our risks and control environment overseeing financial reporting and evaluating internal and independent audit processes the lack of an independent audit committee may prevent the board of directors from being independent from management in its judgments and decisions and its ability to pursue the responsibilities of an audit committee without undue influence we may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications if we are unable to attract and retain qualified independent directors the management of our business could be compromised an independent audit committee is required for listing on any national securities exchange therefore until such time as we meet the audit committee independence requirements of a national securities exchange we will be ineligible for listing on any national securities exchange           our board of directors act as our compensation committee which presents the risk that compensation and benefits paid to those executive officers who are board members and other officers may not be commensurate with our financial performance a compensation committee consisting of independent directors is a safeguard against selfdealing by company executives our board of directors acts as the compensation committee and determines the compensation and benefits of our executive officers administers our employee stock and benefit plans and reviews policies relating to the compensation and benefits of our employees our lack of an independent compensation committee presents the risk that our executive officer on the board may have influence over his personal compensation and benefits levels that may not be commensurate with our financial performance   limitations on director and officer liability and indemnification of our company’s officers and directors by us may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against an officer or director our company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide with certain exceptions as permitted by governing state law that a director or officer shall not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer except for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct fraud or knowing violation of law or unlawful payments of dividends these provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against a director or officer for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by stockholders on our behalf against a director or officer   we are responsible for the indemnification of our officers and directors should our officers andor directors require us to contribute to their defense we may be required to spend significant amounts of our capital our certificate of incorporation and bylaws also provide for the indemnification of our directors officers employees and agents under certain circumstances against attorneys fees and other expenses incurred by them in any litigation to which they become a party arising from their association with or activities on behalf of our company this indemnification policy could result in substantial expenditures which we may be unable to recoup if these expenditures are significant or involve issues which result in significant liability for our key personnel we may be unable to continue operating as a going concern   our management has limited experience managing a public company at the present time none of our management has experience in managing a public company this may hinder our ability to establish effective controls and systems and comply with all applicable requirements attendant to being a public company if compliance problems result these problems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations as a public company we will incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company in addition the sarbanesoxley act of  or sarbanesoxley act and the doddfrank act of  as well as rules subsequently implemented by the sec have imposed various new requirements on public companies including requiring changes in corporate governance practices our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to our new compliance requirements moreover these requirements will increase our legal accounting and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more timeconsuming and costly for example we expect it will be difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors our board committees or as executive officers   the new technologies of the internet market make it much easier for individuals to plan the details of their own trips the new technologies of the internet make it much easier for affluent individuals and others to plan the details of their own trips thereby eliminating the fees we hope to collect such selfmanaged trips may have caused many travel operators to go out of business in recent years and may continue to cause travel agencies to go out of business   uncertainty and adverse changes in the general economic conditions of the markets in which we will participate may negatively affect our business current and future conditions in the economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty it is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts sectors and regions of the economy including the markets in which we will participate as a result it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction for the economy as a whole adverse changes may occur as a result of soft global economic conditions rising oil prices wavering consumer confidence unemployment declines in stock markets contraction of credit availability or other factors affecting economic conditions in general these changes may negatively affect our sales or increase our exposure to losses these possible changes may also affect the ability for company like us to raise sufficient capital in the us equity market in the future   as a smaller travel company with reporting obligations we may be at a competitive disadvantage to other travel companies the travel industry has low barriers to entry because the travel market is competitive is driven in part by costs and consists mostly of private companies that do not have public reporting obligations our reporting obligations may put us at a competitive disadvantage the travel industry has low barriers to entry in addition we face additional expenses that a private travel company does not have such as pcaob auditor fees edgar filing fees and legal fees related to our sec reporting obligations other nonpublic travel companies do not incur these costs we are at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors because of this          risks related to regulation   litigation and regulatory investigations may result in significant financial losses and harm to our reputation we face significant risk of litigation regulatory investigations and similar actions in the ordinary course of our business including the risk of lawsuits and other legal actions relating to unauthorized transactions error transactions breach of data privacy laws breach of fiduciary or other duties any such action may include claims for substantial or unspecified compensatory damages as well as civil regulatory or criminal proceedings against our directors officers or employees and the probability and amount of liability if any any remain unknown for significant periods of time we may be also subject to various regulatory inquiries such as information requests and book and records examinations from regulators and other authorities in the geographical markets in which we operate a substantial liability arising from a lawsuit judgment or a significant regulatory action against us or a disruption in our business arising from adverse adjudications in proceedings against our directors officers or employees could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results or operations moreover even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation regulatory action or investigation we could suffer significant harm to our reputation which could materially affect our prospects and future growth including our ability to attract new agents as customers retain current agents and their customers and recruit and retain employees and agents   as a result of our becoming a public company we will become subject to additional reporting and corporate governance requirements that will require additional management time resources and expense in connection with this filing we will become obligated to file with the us securities and exchange commission annual and quarterly information and other reports that are specified in the us securities exchange act of  we will also become subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements under the sarbanesoxley act of  as amended and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder all of which will impose significant compliance and reporting obligations upon us   our processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements evolving security standards differing views of personal privacy rights or security breaches in the processing of our travel transactions we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable information this information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world typically intended to protect the privacy and security of personal information it is also subject to evolving security standards for credit card information that is collected processed and transmitted we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business travel businesses have also been subjected to investigations lawsuits and adverse publicity due to allegedly improper disclosure of passenger information as privacy and data protection have become more sensitive and politicized issues we may also become exposed to potential liabilities in relation to our handling use and disclosure of travel related data as it pertains to individuals as a result of differing views on the privacy of such data our business could be affected by public concerns in some parts of the world other privacy concerns including security breaches could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations   our business is regulated and any failure to comply with such regulations or any changes in such regulations could adversely affect us we operate in a regulated industry our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or the enactment of new laws rules andor regulations applicable to us which could decrease demand for products and services increase costs or subject us to additional liabilities moreover regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations accordingly such regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us if our practices were found not to comply with the then current regulatory or licensing requirements or any interpretation of such requirements by the regulatory authority our failure to comply with any of these requirements or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our operations   from time to time we may be involved in legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes we are and in the future may be subject to material legal proceedings in the course of our business including but not limited to actions relating to contract disputes business practices intellectual property and other commercial and tax matters such legal proceedings may involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief or might necessitate changes to our business or operations and the defense of such actions may be both time consuming and expensive further if any such proceedings were to result in an unfavorable outcome it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations   a slowdown or other adverse developments in the canada and france economy may materially and adversely affect our customers demand for our products and our business we are a holding company and of our operations are entirely conducted in the canada and france in addition all of our revenues are currently generated from sales in the canada and france although the canada and france economy has grown at a remarkable pace in recent years we cannot assure you that such growth will continue a slowdown in overall economic growth an economic downturn or recession or other adverse economic developments in the canada and france may materially reduce the demand for our products and have a materially adverse effect on          risks relating to our common stock   we are an emerging growth company and as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies our common stock may be less attractive to investors we are an emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies including but not limited to a requirement to present only two years of audited financial statements an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements pursuant to the rules applicable to smaller reporting companies and no requirement to seek nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements although some of these exemptions are available to us as a smaller reporting company ie a company with less than  million of its voting equity held by affiliates  we have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements  we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions  if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our choices there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile   pursuant to section b of the jobs act we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under section b of the jobs act this election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies as a result our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates the decision to opt out is irrevocable   because the worldwide market value of our common stock held by nonaffiliates or public float is below  million we are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined under the exchange act some of the foregoing reduced disclosure and other requirements are also available to us because we are a smaller reporting company and may continue to be available to us even after we are no longer an emerging growth company under the jobs act but remain a smaller reporting company under the exchange act as a smaller reporting company we are not required to   • have an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act and   • present more than two years of audited financial statements in our registration statements and annual reports on form k and present any selected financial data in such registration statements and annual reports filings made by the company on the edgar company search page of the securities and exchange commissions web site the address for which is wwwsecgov the public may read and copy any materials the company files with the sec at the secs public   because we are subject to “penny stock” rules the level of trading activity in our stock may be reduced brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in “penny stocks” are regulated by penny stock rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on some national securities exchanges the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and if the brokerdealer is the sole market maker the brokerdealer must disclose this fact and the brokerdealer’s presumed control over the market and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account in addition brokerdealers who sell these securities to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction consequently these requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity if any in the secondary market for a security subject to the penny stock rules if a trading market does develop for our common stock these regulations will likely be applicable and investors in our common stock may find it difficult to sell their shares           finra sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock finra has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer a brokerdealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their noninstitutional customers brokerdealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status tax status investment objectives and other information under interpretations of these rules finra believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers finra requirements make it more difficult for brokerdealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in our common stock as a result fewer brokerdealers may be willing to make a market in our common stock reducing a stockholder’s ability to resell shares of our common stock   state securities laws may limit secondary trading which may restrict the states in which you can sell the shares offered by this prospectus if you purchase shares of our common stock sold pursuant to this offering you may not be able to resell the shares in a certain state unless and until the shares of our common stock are qualified for secondary trading under the applicable securities laws of such state or there is confirmation that an exemption such as listing in certain recognized securities manuals is available for secondary trading in such state there can be no assurance that we will be successful in registering or qualifying our common stock for secondary trading or identifying an available exemption for secondary trading in our common stock in every state if we fail to register or qualify or to obtain or verify an exemption for the secondary trading of our common stock in any particular state the shares of common stock could not be offered or sold to or purchased by a resident of that state in the event that a significant number of states refuse to permit secondary trading in our common stock the market for the common stock will be limited which could drive down the market price of our common stock and reduce the liquidity of the shares of our common stock and a stockholder’s ability to resell shares of our common stock at all or at current market prices which could increase a stockholder’s risk of losing some or all of his investment   shareholders do not have preemptive rights which will cause them to experience dilution if we issue additional securities at any time or times after this offering we may issue and sell additional shares of our authorized but previously unissued shares of common stock preferred stock or common stock warrants on such terms and conditions as our board of directors in its sole discretion may determine without consent of our shareholders our shareholders do not have preemptive rights to acquire additional shares should we in the future issue or sell additional securities thus we are not required to offer any existing shareholder the right to purchase his or her pro rata portion of any future issuance of securities and therefore upon the issuance of any additional securities by us hereafter our shareholders will not be able to maintain their then existing pro rata ownership in our outstanding shares of common stock preferred stock or common stock warrants without additional purchases of securities at the price then set internally by us           because we do not intend to pay any dividends on our common stock holders of our common stock must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment there are no restrictions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws that prevent us from declaring dividends we do not anticipate paying any such dividends for the foreseeable future accordingly holders of our common stock will have to rely on capital appreciation if any to earn a return on their investment in our common stock   we may not be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms which could have a material adverse impact on the market value of our common stock the trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business we do not control these analysts however security analysts of major brokerage firms may not provide coverage of our common stock since there is no incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock if equity research analysts do provide research coverage of our common stock the price of our common stock could decline if one or more of these analysts downgrade our common stock or if they issue other unfavorable commentary about us or our business if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company we could lose visibility in the market which in turn could cause our stock price to decline   our insiders beneficially own a significant portion of our stock and accordingly may have control over stockholder matters the company’s business and management the percentage ownership information shown in the table below is calculated based on  shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of march   we do not have any outstanding options warrants or other securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of our common stock           amount and nature         title of       of beneficial         class   name of beneficial owner   ownership     percentage   common stock   jing

          all officers and directors as a group                as a result our executive officers directors and affiliated persons will have significant influence to     · elect or defeat the election of our directors     · amend or prevent amendment of our articles of incorporation or bylaws     · effect or prevent a merger sale of assets or other corporate transaction and     · affect the outcome of any other matter submitted to the stockholders for vote   moreover because of the significant ownership position held by our insiders new investors will not be able to affect a change in the company’s business or management and therefore shareholders would be subject to decisions made by management and the majority shareholders   in addition sales of significant amounts of shares held by our directors and executive officers or the prospect of these sales could adversely affect the market price of our common stock management’s stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price            the sale of securities by us in any equity or debt financing could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and have a material adverse effect on our earnings we are authorized to issue up to  shares of common stock of which  shares are issued and outstanding our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock and to determine the rights preferences and privilege of such shares without consent of any of our stockholders any sale of common stock by us in a future private placement offering could result in dilution to the existing stockholders as a direct result of our issuance of additional shares of our capital stock in addition our business strategy may include expansion through internal growth by acquiring complementary businesses acquiring or licensing additional brands or establishing strategic relationships with targeted customers and suppliers in order to do so or to finance the cost of our other activities we may issue additional equity securities that could dilute our stockholders’ stock ownership we may also assume additional debt and incur impairment losses related to goodwill and other tangible assets and this could negatively impact our earnings and results of operations   if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade their recommendations regarding our common stock our stock price and trading volume could decline the trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock our common stock price would likely decline if analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline   the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified members for our board of directors as a public company we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” and the sarbanesoxley act the requirements of these rules and regulations increase our legal accounting and financial compliance costs may make some activities more difficult timeconsuming and costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel systems and resources in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting we will need to expend significant resources and provide significant management oversight we have a substantial effort ahead of us to implement appropriate processes document our system of internal control over relevant processes assess their design remediate any deficiencies identified and test their operation as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could harm our business operating results and financial condition these efforts will also involve substantial accountingrelated costs   as a result of these and other factors our operating results may not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts who choose to follow our company our failure to meet market expectations would likely result in decreases in the trading price of our common stock   because some of our officers and directors live outside of the united states you may have no effective recourse against them for misconduct and may not be able to receive compensation for damages to the value of their investment caused by wrongful actions by our directors and officers some of officers and directors live outside the us as a result it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the us any judgments obtained against those officers and directors or obtain judgments against them outside of the us that are predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the us or any state thereof investors may not be able to receive compensation for damages to the value of their investment caused by wrongful actions by our directors and officers          item     properties   in june  vacances sinorama leases office

world our business experiences fluctuations reflecting seasonal variations in demand for leisure travel services sales of leisure travel products and services will increase in respect of holiday periods and decrease in respect of offpeak times and prices of leisure travel products and services are subject to fluctuation between peak seasons and low seasons for example we have historically experienced higher revenue from bus tours between may to october of the year and lower revenue between november to april of the following year we also have historically experienced higher revenue from asian tours between april to june and between september to november of the year and lower revenue for the rest of the year because many of our customers tend to travel during summer holidays consequently our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter our rapid growth has tended to mask the seasonality of our business          plan of operation   over the next twelve months we will concentrate on the following four areas to grow our operations   ●   design new products – seek to design some more new tour products to compete with competitors   ●   advertising and marketing – work with several marketing companies to develop brand identity marketing materials and update our web site utilize all available marketing venues and public relations opportunities to

attributable to the company’s and the noncontrolling interest   use of estimates   the preparation of audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made however actual results could differ from those estimates significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include valuation allowances for receivables and recoverability of carrying amount and the estimated useful lives of longlived assets these estimates are often based on complex judgments and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable actual results could differ from these estimates           revenue recognition   the group’s revenues are primarily derived from sale of our selfdeveloped products including bus tour products and asian tour products and the group is also selling third party products air ticketshotel and etc revenue is recognized only when the persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the service has been performed the price is fixed or determinable and the collectability of the related fee is reasonably assured in accordance with asc  revenue recognition or asc  specifically contracts are signed to establish significant

risks and responsibilities for the delivery of products and is responsible for refunding the customers their payments   income taxes and uncertain tax positions   the company adopts fasb asc topic

returns under this method deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized   in july  the fasb issued fin asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxesan interpretation of fasb statement no  asc  which requires income tax positions to meet a morelikelythannot recognition threshold to be recognized in the financial statements under fin asc  tax positions that previously failed to meet the morelikelythannot threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the morelikelythannot threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met   the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation the evolution of regulations and court rulings therefore the actual liability may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities or deferred tax asset valuation allowance   as a result of the implementation of fin  asc  the company made a comprehensive review of its portfolio of tax positions in accordance with recognition standards established by fin  asc  the company recognized no material adjustments to liabilities or shareholder’s equity as a result of the

the “exchange act” that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the material information required to be disclosed by us in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms  disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures

executive officer and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   as of december   our management under the supervision of and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by rules ab and db under the exchange act  based upon this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december   as a result of the material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting  these material weaknesses are discussed in “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” below  our management considers our internal control over financial reporting to be an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures   management’s report on internal control over financial reporting   the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting as defined in rules af and df under the securities exchange act the company’s management is also required to assess and report on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  “section ” internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the company’s financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that i pertain to maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the company’s

made in accordance with management authorization and iii provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis   the management considered that material weaknesses identified in our internal controls and procedures over financial reporting were  lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures  inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives and  ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes           because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate   as of december   our management under the supervision of and with the participation of the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required by rules ac and dc under the exchange act  in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in  internal control – integrated framework  including the following five framework components i control environment ii risk assessment iii control activities iv information and communications and v monitoring   this annual report does not include an attestation report of the company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal

basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional improvements as necessary and as funds allow  however our management cannot guarantee that the measures taken or any future measures will remediate the material weaknesses identified or that any additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting notwithstanding the material weaknesses described above our management believes that there are no material inaccuracies or omissions of material fact and to the best of its knowledge believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report present fairly in all material respects our financial position results
