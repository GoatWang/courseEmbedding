gebert started out as a plumber in rapperswil switzerland receiving a trade permit in  through the end of the century gebert built up his plumbing business at the dawn of the th century however gebert decided to enter manufacturing as well and in  began producing toilet tanks geberts first tank called the phoenix was built of wood and lined with lead and also featured a lead flush mechanism the tank system represented somewhat of a breakthrough in the development of modern sanitary systems and the company was awarded a patent on the design in  gebert himself was not to live to see that event upon his death in  the company was taken over by his sons albert and leo by the end of that decade gebert had developed markets for the companys tanks across switzerland as well as throughout much of the region gebert set up a number of production workshops in order to supply these foreign markets production levels began to grow again as world war i drew to a close prompting the company to build a new production plant in rapperswil in  the new facility included the companys own foundry the following year the company added a new range of products including ubend pipes and taps and valves which also were used by the chemicals industry in  the company centralized all of its manufacturing activity into the single facility in rapperswil the company continued to develop its foreign markets particularly in the germanspeaking countries by the end of the s however the gebert family extended the companys reach into france with the opening of a sales office in paris in  the company continued to develop its product lines and in the mids the company once again placed itself at the forefront of sanitary technology the development of plastic was to take its place among the most significant events of the th century transforming nearly every aspect of peoples lives in  the gebert family company became one of the first to begin adapting the new plastic material to its toilet tank and piping systems the noncorroding nature of the new material made it ideally suited for use in producing certain components for toilet systems particularly in the concealed systems being developed for public facilities world war ii placed a halt on the companys growth by the s however with much of europe undergoing a vast reconstruction and a corresponding economic boom the company returned to its position as innovators in sanitary technology in  the company debuted its first allplastic geberit toilet tank that product produced with the newly developed polyethylene plastic marked a new success for the company international growth in the s the next generation of geberts brothers heinrich and klaus took over management of the familyowned company in  at that time the company registered the geberit trademark and adopted the slightly modified word as the new company name geberit then began to expand its european interests creating a new international distribution subsidiary and opening new foreign offices offering sales and technical services germany represented the market with the largest growth potential particularly given the vast rebuilding effort needed in the postwar years in order to position itself in the german market geberit created its first foreign subsidiary in  in pfullendorf which constructed its own production plant and began developing a dedicated network of sales and technical service offices across germany in addition to pursuing the foreign market geberit eyed an expansion of its product line the flexibility of the new generation of plastics enabled the company to begin developing complementary product ranges starting with geberits first drainage systems products including ubends and odor traps and related components in  geberit launched a new foreign subsidiary in france in  which was followed by the establishment of a subsidiary in vienna austria in  by then the company had moved to a larger plant in rapperswiljona constructed in  to meet

tank production in  geberit added a third production plant in potterbrunn outside of vienna in that year geberit moved into a new market with the addition of a subsidiary in belgium a subsidiary was formed in the netherlands in  during the s geberit continued to add new product categories extending its product range to include full drainage systems flushmounted systems and introducing new components for the hygiene sector the company remained wholly focused on europe until the mids in  however geberit made its first attempt to enter the us market launching a subsidiary and production plant in michigan city indiana in  the united states was to remain a relatively minor market for geberit however sanitary technology leader in the new century a more significant event for the company came with its move into the installation systems market in  that product market became the companys single largest accounting for more than onethird of its sales at the dawn of the st century at the same time geberit began developing a range of other products such as the socalled shower toilet which featured a bidetlike spray attachment for standard and custombuilt toilets the s saw continued growth for the company geberit expanded its pfullendorf plant again in  while opening a warehouse facility at its rapperswiljona site that same year in  geberit moved into the scandinavian market with

systems based in weilheim germany the company automated its production process in  in  geberit moved into new product territories specifically with an entry into the fresh water supply systems sector

founding family to cash out of the business instead geberit was sold to british investment house doughty handson manager of the largest private equity investment fund in europe in  gunter kelm and the rest of geberits management team remained in place acquiring a minority share in the company which projected a public offering for later in the decade with stronger financial backing geberit began a

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be
