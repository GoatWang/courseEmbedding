that ill turn the call over to mattmatthew scott stadler cohen  steers inc  cfo and evp read morethank you adam my remarks this morning will focus on our asadjusted results which exclude the aftertax financial effect associated with our seed investments certain discrete tax items and the effect of an accelerated vesting of certain restricted stock units in the first quarter of last yearyesterday we reported earnings of  per share compared with  in the prior years quarter and  sequentially revenue was  million for the quarter compared with  million in the prior years quarter and  million sequentially the increase in revenue from the fourth quarter was attributable to higher average assets under management partially offset by  fewer days in the quarteraverage assets under management for the quarter were  billion compared with  billion in the prior years quarter and  billion sequentiallyoperating income was  million for the quarter compared with  million in the prior years quarter and  million sequentially our operating margin decreased to  from  last quarter expenses increased  on a sequential basis primarily due to higher compensation and benefits partially offset by lower distribution and service fees and gathe compensationtorevenue ratio was  for the quarter consistent with the guidance provided on our last call the decrease in distribution and service fee expense was consistent with the decline in average assets under management in our us noload openend mutual funds and ga decreased  on a sequential basis primarily due to lower travel and entertainmentour effective tax rate for the quarter was  consistent with the guidance we provided on the last callpage  of the earnings presentation displays our cash cash equivalents and seed investments for the current and trailing  quarters and indicates that portion of cash and cash equivalents held outside the us our firm liquidity totaled  million compared with  million last quarter and stockholders equity was  million compared with  million at december  we remain debtfreeassets under management totaled  billion at march  an increase of  billion or  from december  assets under management in institutional accounts totaled  billion an increase of  million or  from last quarter and openend funds had assets under management of  billion an increase of  million or  from last quarterassets under management in closedend funds increased  million or  we recorded total net inflows of  million in the quarter an annualized organic growth rate of  this marks the th consecutive quarter of net inflowsinstitutional accounts had net inflows of  million in the first quarter an annualized organic growth rate of  subadvised portfolios in japan had net inflows of  million in the quarter compared with  million of net inflows last quarter net inflows were primarily from us real estate portfoliosdistributions increased slightly to  million in the first quarter compared with  million last quarter subadvised accounts excluding japan had net inflows of  million with inflows from global real estate and global listed infrastructure portfolios being partially offset by outflows from large cap value portfolios advised accounts had net outflows of  million during the quarter and bob steers will provide some color on the level of activity and our institutional pipeline in a momentopenend funds had net inflows of  million during the quarter an annualized organic growth rate of  distributions totaled  million of which  million were reinvestedlet me briefly discuss a few items to consider for the second quarter and remainder of  with respect to compensation and benefits we expect to maintain a  compensationtorevenue ratio we still expect ga to increase between  and  from last year the increase is driven by investments to strategically add to our distribution capabilities in the dcio channel and in europe as well as higher mutual fund reimbursement costs and increased costs for administering our collective investment trusts both of which are generally associated with asset growth in those respective vehicles excluding these items ga is projected to be flat yearoveryear finally we expect that our effective tax rate will remain at approximately with that id like to turn it over to bobrobert hamilton steers cohen  steers inc  cofounder ceo and director thanks matt and good morning before i get into our first quarter results for perspective i think it will be useful to explain our strategies regarding resource allocation at cohen  steers the resource allocation process for us entails prioritizing investments and opportunities that have a high probability of generating significant organic growth while simultaneously finding efficiencies and cost savings wherever possiblewith these goals in mind we are continuing to strategically add to our global investment and distribution teams what gives us confidence to spend despite the current industry headwinds is our conviction that real asset and alternative income strategies are gaining share of portfolio allocations globally institutional search activity continues to grow for all of our strategies but especially in infrastructure real estate multistrat real assets and preferred security strategieslisted infrastructure as an example is currently experiencing exceptionally strong institutional demand it appears that institutional investors are looking to capitalize not only on the looming prospect of higher government spending but also on the secular and seismic shift in supply chain logistics for bb and bc ecommerce as were seeing in the retail sector as a result we have developed new and more targeted strategies within listed infrastructure that invest in companies related to logistics and separately the beneficiaries of current and prospective public works infrastructure programssimilarly interest in our blended multistrat real asset strategy is growing as well in this instance because risk tolerances vary widely among prospective investors we are now offering a balanced version of our real asset strategy which lowers volatility through higher rates and tips and credit additional iterations are in the works as wellalso demand for preferred security strategies remain strong in the wealth channel and is expanding in the institutional channel and here too we have product expansion opportunities such as our new lowduration portfolioto capitalize on these and other opportunities we are adding headcount to a number of our investment teams in order to add breadth and depth to our existing capabilities complementing this we have and continue to broaden our institutional distribution capabilities across the board including regionally in europe hong kong and tokyo and domestically by expanding our dcio consultant relations and direct sales teamslisted real asset and alternative income strategies have generated consistent and significant organic growth because active management works and asset allocations are increasing this is what gives us confidence that spending now to broaden our real asset and alternative income strategies and expand our distribution reach globally will generate additional organic growth and diversify our asset basealthough were investing for growth we are also mindful of the margin pressures facing the industry and are carefully managing our cost structure to that end we have formed an internal task force aimed at more formally searching for efficiencies and cost savings in addition were utilizing technology wherever possible to improve productivity throughout the organization although were confident that expanding our organization will produce new and meaningful growth opportunities we believe that the cost of this investment can be partially mitigated through diligent productivity and cost managementturning to the first quarter investment performance with the exception of global listed infrastructure all of our real asset strategies lag behind the sp  following the postelection pattern of risk on investing that said all of our strategies except for commodities had positive returns and  out of  core investment strategies outperformed their respective benchmarks in the quarter with the laggards being commodities resource equities real assets and international real estateover the past  months  of our aum is in outperforming strategies and  of our openend fund assets are in  or star funds asset flows in the quarter were again positive as matt mentioned and we have now achieved net inflows for  consecutive quartersbolstering our view that demand for our real asset and alternative income strategies is broadening out we experienced net inflows in  out of  strategies with only large cap value experiencing any material outflows our openend funds registered net inflows of  million for a  organic growth rate as has been the case in the past we experienced strong net inflows into our topperforming us real estate fund and our preferred securities fund however we also had a  million of net inflows into our lowduration preferred fund this fund was recently approved and added to the merrill lynch and wells fargo platforms and is an excellent example of the growing opportunities and demand that we are experiencing from an expanded product setadvisory net outflows were a modest  million and the pipeline of awarded but unfunded mandates shrank slightly from  million in the fourth quarter to  million in the first quarter on the surface both metrics were slightly disappointing however its not atypical for the first quarter to be seasonally weak and as i said upfront search activity is now strong and improving we are currently a finalist competing for  mandates totaling over  billion across multiple strategies and we expect that most if not all of these searches will be concluded in this quarterin addition we have been awarded  new model delivery subadvisory mandates which are aua and not included in our pipeline figures one is focused on mlps and the second on global preferred securities importantly each of these opportunities gives us access to new wealth markets in asia one in taiwan and the other in south korea we expect both will fund in this quartersubadvisory ex japan net flows were solid  million for a  organic growth rate in japan we remain one of the only us reit subadvisers with net inflows before distributions our net inflows in the quarter were  million and total distributions were  millionobviously were very upbeat about the prospects for our product and market opportunities were also as committed as ever to active management in our space and our decision to devote additional resources to pursue investment and growth opportunities reflects our optimismwith that id like to open the floor to questionsquestions and answersoperator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ari ghosh with credit suissearinash ghosh crédit suisse ag research division  research analyst so i believe that the outflow in the advisory channel was related to a mandate moving to passive so i was just wondering if this client had more assets with you and also if you had a sense for additional atrisk assets that may move to passive strategies across your channelsrobert hamilton steers cohen  steers inc  cofounder ceo and director sure i didnt hear all of the question ari but just to address the one question about the redemption in advisory that related to a large cap value mandate where with the client we manage several accounts and for this one account they went passive and as im sure you know in terms of the industry trends for the core style boxes thats where youre seeing the most switching from active to passive large cap value assets are a very small part of our asset base so theres not a lot of potential for that to continue going forwardarinash ghosh crédit suisse ag research division  research analyst and then maybe if you can give us an update on the cits including your partnership with sei i would just imagine that there was a fair bit of retirement money in motion from dol and one for your seasonality so i was just wondering about the velocity of flows here as you look to grow your retirement footprint and also if youre seeing any increased competition from cheaper passively managed targeted fundsjohn todd glickson cohen  steers inc  director of global marketing and product solutions and evp this is todd glickson from the product and marketing group just to comment on your question about cits and its a good one you saw the uptick in our flows from last year its safe to say with our focus on dcio more that will continue were working with our current clients that are in our retirement  that are investors in our retirement products to evaluate whether or not the cit is the right vehicle for them separate and apart from what they are invested in now and as we look at the new business that comes in with more and more frequency they are certainly looking at that construct so i dont think theres anything but positive news as it relates to that and as we look to open new offerings were going to be very  or new strategies were going to be very thoughtful about what the best wrapper is so if we think that the appetite is more retirement focused in general we may lead with the cit as opposed to for the act product it really just depends on the distribution opportunities but its safe to say that that more frequency youll see us trafficking in that spaceoperator our next question comes from the line of john dunn with evercore isijohn joseph dunn evercore isi research division  associate question on free compression i mean clearly its most pronounced in the classic style boxes but looking outside of that are there any strategies where you guys are feeling pressure on fees and also as more competitors try to crack into real estate strategies can you just talk about some of the homecourt advantages you guys havejohn todd glickson cohen  steers inc  director of global marketing and product solutions and evp sure this is todd glickson again perfect question we talked a little bit about it last quarter one of the things that we continue to be vigilant about is our price point versus our peers so we always look at a couple of things not only where were priced relative to our peers but also the peers that we think are most like us as it relates to the asset classes that we traffic in and bob talked about it before you can clearly see the advantage of active management there is over time an alpha component thats been relatively consistent and high over the benchmark and i think that gives us a little bit of comfort as it relates to our price point but we stay focused on being competitive as it relates to competition certainly etfs are out there for us it gets back to where active works where passive works we think that theres a place for both in the spaces that we play in active has got some pronounced benefits that we see and that the market believes to be true so well continue to be vigilant but in terms of where we are now we feel comfortable but rest assured were examining those price points on a regular basis to make sure that we stay on top of itjohn joseph dunn evercore isi research division  associate got you and thenrobert hamilton steers cohen  steers inc  cofounder ceo and director maybe ill continue the answer with respect to the homecourt advantages and our real estate strategies i think the question was framed in terms of new entrants into the space and i would say were not seeing a lot of new entrants to this space weve got a lot of competition both on the active side and on the passive side in terms of our homecourt advantages its the size and the experience of our team and its a global team when you think about real estate with us we run many strategies us global regional when you think about the competition which is primarily from passive the most penetration has occurred in the us historically active managers have had a high betting average of outperformance last year that was in the case only about  of active managers outperform last year thats very unusual this year active managers i think are going to have a pretty good year and one reason just to give you some perspective is that retail which youd probably read about in the press is under a lot of stress and those companies have underperformed and if youre active in your underweight retails youre doing well versus the passive indexes just thinking about the homecourt advantage more broadly when you think about global we think that active has a lot to offer when you think about the different ways we can add alpha through country selection security selection emerging markets hedging currency now thats a place and we think that theres going to be increasing demand for global mandates because of how well the us markets have performed looking backward but the global space is one where active brings a lot to the tablejohn joseph dunn evercore isi research division  associate got it and then on expenses to get to the  to  in ga its going to be a ramp in the next few quarters can you give us a sense of what the target for you that might be quartertoquarter and then with the internal task force would you say that a goal that task force might be to slow the ga rate below the increase this yearmatthew scott stadler cohen  steers inc  cfo and evp well john id say the goal of task force is just to rationalize all the expenses and make sure were getting the appropriate value there so it is not a target its just a discipline i think with respect to the increase in the ga i basically just say its pro rata over the remaining  quartersoperator our next question comes from the line of michael carrier with bank of america merrill lynchmichael roger carrier bofa merrill lynch research division  director i guess just on the advisory and subadvisory ex japan both those channels it sounds like you guys are making and have been making some investments given the outlook on distribution for allocations into some of the product categories i think you guys mentioned kind of the uptick on the finalist that youre in just wanted to get a sense can you give us any numbers maybe yearoveryear feel on how thats progressing just to get some sense on if youre seeing more and more traction as youre making in these investments and as institutions are allocating more into these strategiesrobert hamilton steers cohen  steers inc  cofounder ceo and director i dont think we have any hard data in terms of yearoveryear weve  periodically we try to compare the volume of rfps and things like that yearoveryear but what were finding is that a majority of the searches that were involved with currently dont utilize consultants and sometimes they use rfps and sometimes they dont i would say that the volume that were seeing now easily is more diverse than weve seen in the past because were seeing for example preferred securities strategies which heretofore have been virtually exclusively a retail product were seeing institutional interest both domestically and internationally in preferreds we are also seeing as i mentioned in my comments a major uptick in interest in listed infrastructure probably in part due to all of the discussions about fiscal stimulus here and elsewhere and along the way  and i think one of our other homecourt advantages is some of these newer strategies whether its lowduration preferreds or logistics subset of global infrastructure public works the homecourt advantage is no one else does this we dont have any competition yet and so its exciting that we have both new and existing relationships who want to explore with us the possibilities of these new strategies so were working with these institutions were working with cios at wealth management firms who themselves are trying to define real assets define listed infrastructure and were in the room with these folks helping to refine exactly how to capitalize on the trends in infrastructure and elsewhere and so thats our real homecourt advantage and thats whats exciting about this pipeline the diversity of it and how its evolvingjoseph martin harvey cohen  steers inc  president and cio id add too in terms of the diversity of the  mandates that were in the finals  it represents  different investment strategies so thats one area of diversity but theres another area of diversity and thats the type of institution that were engaging with and this spans a spectrum of public funds sovereign wealth funds health care organizations insurance companies and endowments and i think that speaks more to the investments weve made in people to target some of these markets in the advisory spacerobert hamilton steers cohen  steers inc  cofounder ceo and director and i would add were still  were just beginning to see some green shoots in our more recent commitments to rebuild our european staff last year and the dcio efforts which also include institutional efforts and virtually none of these mandates or searches in the current pipeline ma from those sources so were fully expecting incremental growth from those newer endeavorsmichael roger carrier bofa merrill lynch research division  director okay thats helpful and then a quick followup just on japan i think some of the products in the market distributions have been reduced just wanted to get a sense on when that occurs how you expect that to kind of impact maybe the demand given other competing products in the market and i know you guys dont control that but just wanted to get a sense on how youre seeing that progress over timerobert hamilton steers cohen  steers inc  cofounder ceo and director sure so as you point out it wouldnt be a surprise to see a reduction in the distributions there as you point out were not involved in the process so we cant handicap when or if but when distributions are reduced the outcome is pretty clear you see a uptick in redemptions which is somewhat offset by the lower outflows from distributions we  ill be going over to asia this weekend and weve been through this process before so again if and when it happens we have ramped up and are prepared to accelerate our support activities with the distributors in japan to explain to them current fundamentals valuations the outlook and so forth so were prepared in the event that distributions are reduced and were hopeful given the fact that our relationships in japan distribute somewhat differently than the other reit managers there which are mainly through wirehousetype channels whereas were predominantly distributed through regional banks which tends to be somewhat less volatileoperator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of ann dai with kbwann dai keefe bruyette  woods inc research division  assistant vp equity research just looking at trend in inflows maybe from fourth quarter it looks like gross inflows were a little bit slower in the quarter and i understand some of that comes from timing around the institutional mandates but maybe just on the openend mutual fund side of things do you think some of that slowdown is related to the december rate hike based on conversations with your various distributors do you think you expect to see some kind of similar effects from march and subsequent hikesrobert hamilton steers cohen  steers inc  cofounder ceo and director i dont think  i think flows were affected by the environment postelection and the bond market the year move not really  the fed really i dont think is much of a factor its really i think expectations for economic growth and substantially higher interest rates so in that decemberjanuary period we saw weakness in our preferred and other incomeoriented strategies and as that has abated if not reversed weve seen the underlying securities like reits have for the last month or more have outperformed dramatically and flows have improved accordingly so were not really watching the fed were really watching the macroeconomy and where longterm interest rates are goingann dai keefe bruyette  woods inc research division  assistant vp equity research okay understood and one quick one on large cap value can you just give us maybe some more color on what those assets are today is it a couple billionmatthew scott stadler cohen  steers inc  cfo and evp well get that exact number but its about  billionrobert hamilton steers cohen  steers inc  cofounder ceo and director its included in otheroperator our next question comes from the line of mac sykes with gabellimacrae sykes g research llc  research analyst joe would you expand a little bit more about the amazon effect on retail sales and mall traffic i mean i understand it may be a relative advantage for reit investing as you suggested in terms of positioning but could you just talk about the effects in terms of the overall impact to the reit index in general in terms of just the health of commercial retail stocksjoseph martin harvey cohen  steers inc  president and cio thats a really good question just to frame it quickly about  of the market capitalization is represented by retail real estate companies part of them are big regional malls and closed mall stores and then the remainder in neighborhood community shopping centers which are typically anchored by a food store and pharmacy et cetera so whats really important is the quality of the retail property and said more simply how much barrier to competition or new supply in the physical space so within the regional mall sector properties and companies that own malls that have a lot of competition are frankly going out of business and thats been happening very slowly as we build supply of real estate here in the united states but its been accelerated by the market share gains of ecommerce these are secular trends its going to continue we think that physical retail has an important presence but its going to be shrinking and its going to get concentrated into the properties that are in dense markets that are in highincome markets that have natural barriers to supply so ive been reading in the press a lot of these scare stories about whats going on in retail and were going to see more retailer bankruptcies which obviously are critical elements of the cash flows for retail real estate its a secular trend right now its taken another leg down there will be survivors our job is to know when the market over shoots and the types of companies that will be survivors and the profit from the volatility in share prices and the psychological concerns in the marketmacrae sykes g research llc  research analyst and matt could you just remind us for a  what percentage change in the corporate rate the impact to eps i know were still all kind of playing taxes but i just want to keep up of thatrobert hamilton steers cohen  steers inc  cofounder ceo and director tax reduction trendmatthew scott stadler cohen

that mean in terms of the increase in epsmatthew scott stadler cohen  steers inc  cfo and evp i think we said its about  a share ill have to refresh my notes and get back to you on thatoperator thank
