explored current directions of research in delay differential equations and related dynamical systems and celebrated the contributions of kenneth cooke to this field on the occasion of his th birthday the volume contains three survey papers reviewing three areas of current research and seventeen research contributions the research articles deal with qualitative properties of solutions of delay

in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide vertically transmitted diseases by stavros n busenberg book  editions published between  and  in english and spanish and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide infectious diseases are transmitted through various different mechanisms including person to person interactions by insect vectors and via vertical transmission from a parent to an unborn offspring the population dynamics of such disease transmission can be very complicated and the development of rational strategies for controlling and preventing the spread of these diseases requires careful modeling and analysis the book describes current methods for formulating models and analyzing the dynamics of the propagation of diseases which include vertical transmission as one of the mechanisms for their spread generic models that describe broad classes of diseases as well as models that are tailored to the dynamics of a specific infection are formulated and analyzed the effects of incubation periods maturation delays and agestructure interactions between disease transmission and demographic changes population crowding spatial spread chaotic dynamic behavior seasonal periodicities and discrete time interval events are studied within the context of specific disease transmission models no previous background in disease transmission modeling and analysis is assumedand the required biological concepts and mathematical methods are gradually introduced within the context of specific disease transmission models graphs are widely used to illustrate and explain the modeling assumptions and results remarks note the authors have supplied variants on the promotion text that are more suitable for promotionin different fields by virtue of

richard bellman book  editions published between  and  in  languages and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide asymptotic behavior of solutions of differentialdifference equations by richard bellman book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide in this paper the problem was considered of determining the asymptotic behavior of solutions of linear differentialdifference equations whose coefficients possess asymptotic series although the problem is considerably more complicated than the corresponding problem for ordinary differential equations by means of a sequence of transformations the problem was reduced to a form where the standard techniques of ordinary differential equation theory could be employed the differentialdifference equation was transformed into an integral equation which was trans formed into an integrodifferential equation at this point the liouville transformation plays a vital role although the guiding ideas were simple the analysis became formidable for this reason only some of the more immediate aspects of the problem were considered stability theory and adjoint operators for linear differentialdifference equations by richard bellman book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this paper extends to linear differentialdifference equations a number of results familiar in the stability theory of ordinary linear differential equations in this theory one considers a system of equations of the form  dxdt  atx x  c where t is a real variable x is a column vector with n rows and at is an n by n matrix and a perturbed system  dxdt  at  btx in general terms the stability problem is to determine conditions on the matrix b
