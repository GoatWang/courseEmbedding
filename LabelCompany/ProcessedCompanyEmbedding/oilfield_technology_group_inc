hexion’s oilfield technology group releases canadian resin coated proppants jul   the oilfield technology group otg of hexion inc announced the release of new resin coated proppants that are produced in canada hexion’s true north™ proppants are a curable resin coated sand available in  and  mesh sizes the true north resin system is applied to canadian frac sand to provide an economical resin coated proppant for the region these new proppants incorporate hexion’s stress bond™ technology they bond in the fracture with closure stress providing all the benefits of a curable resin coated sand such as increased fracture flow capacity and proppant flowback control along with proppant fines reduction there is also a low temperature version of the product true north l proppants are specifically designed for low temperature reservoirs additionally the resin system of these proppants offers reduced dust generation during the pneumatic transfer and conveying process compared to uncoated frac sand true north proppants can reduce the amount of respirable silica to levels below the new us department of labor’s occupational safety and health administration osha and existing canadian limits this helps improve the health and safety of workers on location resin coated proppants are used in the hydraulic fracturing process to help optimize production from oil and gas wells by maximizing fracture flow capacity from the reservoir to the wellbore technological innovations and hexion’s introduction of enhanced materials have expanded the use of resin coated proppants into unconventional reservoirs that feature complex and challenging geological formations hexion’s experienced personnel with their years of hydraulic fracturing knowledge and expertise continue to bring advanced proppants to the industry hexions oilfield technology group announces expansion of canadian proppant manufacturing plant jun   the oilfield technology group otg of hexion inc announced the

railcars new storage silos will ensure ample sand supplies especially during peak seasons production capacity improvements will allow for quicker response to market demand and ontime delivery of product through hexions transloading network that services the western canadian sedimentary basin this plant is currently the only proppant manufacturing facility in canada within the industry and produces a variety of products such as hexions yukon black proppants which are a nextgeneration resin coated sand that bonds at low temperatures these proppants are ideal for fracture treatments in the low temperature reservoirs in canada where flowback control is necessary low temperature bonding down to degreef degreec bottomhole static temperature is achieved without the use of a
