information summers memo in december  while at the world bank summers signed a memo that was leaked to the press lant pritchett has claimed authorship of the private memo which both he and summers say was intended as sarcasm the memo stated that the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that ive always thought that underpopulated countries in africa are vastly underpolluted according to pritchett the memo as leaked was doctored to remove context and intended irony and was a deliberate fraud and forgery to discredit larry and the world bank service in the clinton administrationedit in  summers was appointed undersecretary for international affairs and later in the united states department of the

that the problem was excessive government regulation under the advice of kenneth lay summers urged davis to relax californias environmental standards in order to reassure the markets summers hailed the gramm–leach–bliley act in  which lifted more than six decades of restrictions against banks offering commercial banking insurance and investment services by repealing key provisions in the  glass–steagall act today congress voted to update the rules that have governed financial services since the great depression and replace them with a system for the st century summers said this historic legislation will better enable american companies to compete in the new economy many critics including president barack obama have suggested the  subprime mortgage financial crisis was caused by the partial repeal of the  glass–steagall act indeed as a member of president clintons working group on financial markets summers along with us securities and exchange commission sec chairman arthur levitt fed chairman greenspan and secretary rubin torpedoed an effort to regulate the derivatives that many blame for bringing the financial market down in fall  summerss role in the deregulation of derivatives contractsedit on may   the commodity futures trading commission cftc issued a concept release soliciting input from regulators academics and practitioners to determine how best to maintain adequate regulatory safeguards without impairing the ability of the otc overthecounter derivatives market to grow and the ability of us entities to remain competitive in the global financial marketplace on july   thendeputy secretary of the treasury summers testified before the us congress that the parties to these kinds of contract are largely sophisticated financial institutions that would appear to be eminently capable of protecting themselves from fraud and counterparty insolvencies at the time summers stated that to date there has been no clear evidence of a need for additional regulation of the institutional otc derivatives market and we would submit that proponents of such regulation must bear the burden of demonstrating that need in  summers endorsed the gramm–leach–bliley act which removed the separation between investment and commercial banks saying with this bill the american financial system takes a major step forward towards the st century when george stephanopoulos asked summers about the financial crisis in an abc interview on march   summers replied that there are a lot of terrible things that have happened in the last eighteen months but whats happened at aig  the way it was not regulated the way no one was watching  is outrageous at the  federal reserve conference in jackson hole raghuram rajan presented a paper called has financial development made the world riskier rajan pointed to a number of potential problems with the financial developments of the past thirty years the problems that rajan considered include skewed incentives of managers herding behavior among traders investment bankers and hedge fund operators who suffer withdrawals if they underperform the market rajan also discussed the problems associated with firms that goose up returns by taking risky positions that yield a positive carry justin lahart writing in the wall street journal in january  about the response to rajans paper at the conference recounts that former treasury secretary lawrence summers famous among economists for his blistering attacks told the audience he found the basic slightly leadeyed premise of mr rajans paper to be largely misguided in february  summers quoted john maynard keynes saying when circumstances change i change my opinion reflecting both on the failures of wall street deregulation and his new leadership role in the government bailout on april   in an interview on abcs this week program clinton said summers was wrong in the advice he gave him not to regulate derivatives president of harvardedit in  when george w bush became president summers left the treasury department and returned to harvard as its th president serving from july  until june  he is considered harvards first jewish president though his predecessor neil rudenstine had jewish ancestry and received praise from harvards jewish community for his support a number of summerss decisions at harvard attracted public controversy cornel west affairedit in an october  meeting summers criticized african american studies department head cornel west for allegedly missing three weeks of classes to work on the bill bradley presidential campaign and complained that west was contributing to grade inflation summers also claimed that wests rap album was an embarrassment to the university west pushed back strongly against the accusations the hiphop scared him its a stereotypical reaction he said later west who later called summers both uninformed and an unprincipled power player in describing this encounter in his book democracy matters  subsequently returned to princeton university where he had taught prior to harvard university differences between the sexesedit see also women in science in january  at a conference on diversifying the science  engineering workforce sponsored by the national bureau of economic research summers sparked controversy with his discussion of why women may have been underrepresented in tenured positions in science and engineering at top universities and research institutions summers had prefaced his talk saying he was adopting an entirely positive rather than normative approach and that his remarks were intended to be an attempt at provocation summers then began by identifying three hypotheses for the higher proportion of men in highend science and engineering positions the highpowered job hypothesis different availability of aptitude at the high end different socialization and patterns of discrimination in a search the second hypothesis the generally greater variability among men compared to women in tests of cognitive abilities leading to proportionally more males than females at both the lower and upper tails of the test score distributions caused the most controversy in his discussion of this hypothesis summers said that even small differences in the standard deviation between genders will translate into very large differences in the available pool substantially out from the mean summers referenced research that implied differences between the standard deviations of males and females in the top  of twelfth graders under various tests he then went on to argue that if this research were to be accepted then whatever the set of attributes that are precisely defined to correlate with being an aeronautical engineer at mit or being a chemist at berkeley are probably different in their standard deviations as well summers then concluded his discussion of the three hypotheses by saying so my best guess to provoke you of whats behind all of this is that the largest phenomenon by far is the general clash between peoples legitimate family desires and employers current desire for high power and high intensity that in the special case of science and engineering there are issues of intrinsic aptitude and particularly of the variability of aptitude and that those considerations are reinforced by what are in fact lesser factors involving socialization and continuing discrimination i would like nothing better than to be proved wrong because i would like nothing better than for these problems to be addressable simply by everybody understanding what they are and working very hard to address them summers then went on to discuss approaches to remedying the shortage of women in highend science and engineering positions this lunchtime talk drew accusations of sexism and careless scholarship and an intense negative response followed both nationally and at harvard summers apologized repeatedly nevertheless the controversy is speculated to have contributed to his resigning his position as president of harvard university the following year as well as costing summers the job of treasury secretary in obamas administration summerss protégée sheryl sandberg has defended him saying that larry has been a true advocate for women throughout his career at the world bank and treasury sandberg described of the lunch talk what few seem to note is that it is remarkable that he was giving the speech in the first place – that he cared enough about womens careers and their trajectory in the fields of math and science to proactively analyze the issues and talk about what was going wrong summerss opposition and support at harvardedit on march   members of the harvard faculty of arts and sciences which instructs graduate students in harvard graduate school of arts and sciences and undergraduates in harvard college passed – a motion of lack of confidence in the leadership of summers with  abstentions a second motion that offered a milder censure of the president passed  to  also with  abstentions the members of the harvard corporation the universitys highest governing body are in charge of the selection of the president and issued statements strongly supporting summers fas faculty were not unanimous in their comments on summers influential psychologist steven pinker defended the legitimacy of summerss january lecture when asked if summerss talk was within the pale of legitimate academic discourse pinker responded good grief shouldnt everything be within the pale of legitimate academic discourse as long as it is presented with some degree of rigor thats the difference between a university and a madrassa there is certainly enough evidence for the hypothesis to be taken seriously summers had stronger support among harvard college students than among the college faculty one poll by the harvard crimson indicated that students opposed his resignation by a threetoone margin with  of responding students opposing his resignation and  supporting it in july  a board member of harvard corporation conrad k harper resigned saying he was angered both by the university presidents comments about women and by summers being given a salary increase the resignation letter to the president said i could not and cannot support a raise in your salary  i believe that harvards best interests require your resignation support of economist andrei shleiferedit harvard and andrei shleifer a close friend and protégé of summers controversially paid  million to settle a lawsuit by the us government over the conflict of interest shleifer had while advising russias privatisation program the us government had sued shleifer under the false claims act as he bought russian stocks while designing the countrys privatisation in  a federal judge ruled that while harvard had violated the contract shleifer and his associate alone were liable for treble damages in june  harvard and shleifer announced that they had reached a tentative settlement with the us government in august harvard shleifer and the department of justice reached an agreement under which the university paid  million to settle the fiveyearold lawsuit shleifer was also responsible for paying  million worth of damages because harvard paid almost all of the damages and allowed shleifer to retain his faculty position the settlement provoked allegations of favoritism on summers his continued support for shleifer strengthened summerss unpopularity with other professors as reported in the harvard crimson ive been a member of this faculty for over  years and i am no longer easily shocked is how frederick h abernathy the mckay professor of mechanical engineering began his biting comments about the shleifer case at tuesdays fiery faculty meeting but abernathy continued i was deeply shocked and disappointed by the actions of this university in the shleifer affair in an word article how harvard lost russia in institutional investor by david mcclintick january  the magazine detailed shleifers alleged efforts to use his inside knowledge of and sway over the russian economy in order to make lucrative personal investments all while leading a harvard group advising the russian government that was under contract with the us the article suggests that summers shielded his fellow economist from disciplinary action by the university although it noted that summers had forewarned shleifer and his wife nancy zimmerman about the conflictofinterest regulations back in  summerss friendship with shleifer was well known by the corporation when it selected him to succeed rudenstine and summers recused himself from all proceedings with shleifer whose case was actually handled by an independent committee led by former harvard president derek bok resignation as harvard presidentedit on february   summers announced his intention to step down at the end of the school year

extent exceptional for the history of the world bank in recent decades dirty industries controversyedit further information summers memo in december  while at the world bank summers signed a memo that was leaked to the press lant pritchett has claimed authorship of the private memo which both he and summers say was intended as sarcasm the memo stated that the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that ive always thought that underpopulated countries in africa are vastly underpolluted according to pritchett the memo as leaked was doctored to remove context and intended irony and was a deliberate fraud and forgery to discredit larry and the world bank service in the clinton administrationedit in  summers was appointed undersecretary for international affairs and later in the united states department of the treasury under the clinton administration in  he was promoted to deputy secretary of the treasury under his longtime political mentor robert rubin in  he succeeded rubin as secretary of the treasury much of summerss tenure at the treasury department was focused on international economic issues he was deeply involved in the clinton administrations effort to bail out mexico and russia when those nations had currency crises summers set up a project through which the harvard institute for international development provided advice to the russian government between  and  later there was a scandal when it emerged that some of the harvard project members had invested in russia and were therefore not impartial advisors summers encouraged thenrussian leader boris yeltsin to use the same threeations of policy he advocated in the clinton administration – privatization stabilization and liberalization summers pressured the korean government to raise its interest rates and balance its budget in the midst of a recession policies criticized by paul krugman and joseph stiglitz according to the book the chastening by paul blustein during this crisis summers along with paul wolfowitz pushed for regime change in indonesia summers was a leading voice within the clinton administration arguing against american leadership in greenhouse gas reductions and against us participation in the kyoto protocol according to internal documents made public in  as treasury secretary summers led the clinton administrations opposition to tax cuts proposed by the republican congress in  during the california energy crisis of  thentreasury secretary summers teamed with alan greenspan and enron executive kenneth lay to lecture california governor gray davis on the causes of the crisis explaining that the problem was excessive government regulation under the advice of kenneth lay summers urged davis to relax californias environmental standards in order to reassure the markets summers hailed the gramm–leach–bliley act in  which lifted more than six decades of restrictions against banks offering commercial banking insurance and investment services by repealing key provisions in the  glass–steagall act today congress voted to update the rules that have governed financial services since the great depression and replace them with a system for the st century summers said this historic legislation will better enable american companies to compete in the new economy many critics including president barack obama have suggested the  subprime mortgage financial crisis was caused by the partial repeal of the  glass–steagall act indeed as a member of president clintons working group on financial markets summers along with us securities and exchange commission sec chairman arthur levitt fed chairman greenspan and secretary rubin torpedoed an effort to regulate the derivatives that many blame for bringing the financial market down in fall  summerss role in the deregulation of derivatives contractsedit on may   the commodity futures trading commission cftc issued a concept release soliciting input from regulators academics and practitioners to determine how best to maintain adequate regulatory safeguards without impairing the ability of the otc overthecounter derivatives market to grow and the ability of us entities to remain competitive in the global financial marketplace on july   thendeputy secretary of the treasury summers testified before the us congress that the parties to these kinds of contract are largely sophisticated financial institutions that would appear to be eminently capable of protecting themselves from fraud and counterparty insolvencies at the time summers stated that to date there has been no clear evidence of a need for additional regulation of the institutional otc derivatives market and we would submit that proponents of such regulation must bear the burden of demonstrating that need in  summers endorsed the gramm–leach–bliley act which removed the separation between investment and commercial banks saying with this bill the american financial system takes a major step forward towards the st century when george stephanopoulos asked summers about the financial crisis in an abc interview on march   summers replied that there are a lot of terrible things that have happened in the last eighteen months but whats happened at aig  the way it was not regulated the way no one was watching  is outrageous at the  federal reserve conference in jackson hole raghuram rajan presented a paper called has financial development made the world riskier rajan pointed to a number of potential problems with the financial developments of the past thirty years the problems that rajan considered include skewed incentives of managers herding behavior among traders investment bankers and hedge fund operators who suffer withdrawals if they underperform the market rajan also discussed the problems associated with firms that goose up returns by taking risky positions that yield a positive carry justin lahart writing in the wall street journal in january  about the response to rajans paper at the conference recounts that former treasury secretary lawrence summers famous among economists for his blistering attacks told the audience he found the basic slightly leadeyed premise of mr rajans paper to be largely misguided in february  summers quoted john maynard keynes saying when circumstances change i change my opinion reflecting both on the failures of wall street deregulation and his new leadership role in the government bailout on april   in an interview on abcs this week program clinton said summers was wrong in the advice he gave him not to regulate derivatives president of harvardedit in  when george w bush became president summers left the treasury department and returned to harvard as its th president serving from july  until june  he is considered harvards first jewish president though his predecessor neil rudenstine had jewish ancestry and received praise from harvards jewish community for his support a number of summerss decisions at harvard attracted public controversy cornel west affairedit in an october  meeting summers criticized african american studies department head cornel west for allegedly missing three weeks of classes to work on the bill bradley presidential campaign and complained that west was contributing to grade inflation summers also claimed that wests rap album was an embarrassment to the university west pushed back strongly against the accusations the hiphop scared him its a stereotypical reaction he said later west who later called summers both uninformed and an unprincipled power player in describing this encounter in his book democracy matters  subsequently returned to princeton university where he had taught prior to harvard university differences between the sexesedit see also women in science in january  at a conference on diversifying the science  engineering workforce sponsored by the national bureau of economic research summers sparked controversy with his discussion of why women may have been underrepresented in tenured positions in science and engineering at top universities and research institutions summers had prefaced his talk saying he was adopting an entirely positive rather than normative approach and that his remarks were intended to be an attempt at provocation summers then began by identifying three hypotheses for the higher proportion of men in highend science and engineering positions the highpowered job hypothesis different availability of aptitude at the high end different socialization and patterns of discrimination in a search the second hypothesis the generally greater variability among men compared to women in tests of cognitive abilities leading to proportionally more males than females at both the lower and upper tails of the test score distributions caused the most controversy in his discussion of this hypothesis summers said that even small differences in the standard deviation between genders will translate into very large differences in the available pool substantially out from the mean summers referenced research that implied differences between the standard deviations of males and females in the top  of twelfth graders under various tests he then went on to argue that if this research were to be accepted then whatever the set of attributes that are precisely defined to correlate with being an aeronautical engineer at mit or being a chemist at berkeley are probably different in their standard deviations as well summers then concluded his discussion of the three hypotheses by saying so my best guess to provoke you of whats behind all of this is that the largest phenomenon by far is the general clash between peoples legitimate family desires and employers current desire for high power and high intensity that in the special case of science and engineering there are issues of intrinsic aptitude and particularly of the variability of aptitude and that those considerations are reinforced by what are in fact lesser factors involving socialization and continuing discrimination i would like nothing better than to be proved wrong because i would like nothing better than for these problems to be addressable simply by everybody understanding what they are and working very hard to address them summers then went on to discuss approaches to remedying the shortage of women in highend science and engineering positions this lunchtime talk drew accusations of sexism and careless scholarship and an intense negative response followed both nationally and at harvard summers apologized repeatedly nevertheless the controversy is speculated to have contributed to his resigning his position as president of harvard university the following year as well as costing summers the job of treasury secretary in obamas administration summerss protégée sheryl sandberg has defended him saying that larry has been a true advocate for women throughout his career at the world bank and treasury sandberg described of the lunch talk what few seem to note is that it is remarkable that he was giving the speech in the first place – that he cared enough about womens careers and their trajectory in the fields of math and science to proactively analyze the issues and talk about what was going wrong summerss opposition and support at harvardedit on march   members of the harvard faculty of arts and sciences which instructs graduate students in harvard graduate school of arts and sciences and undergraduates in harvard college passed – a motion of lack of confidence in the leadership of summers with  abstentions a second motion that offered a milder censure of the president passed  to  also with  abstentions the members of the harvard corporation the universitys highest governing body are in charge of the selection of the president and issued statements strongly supporting summers fas faculty were not unanimous in their comments on summers influential psychologist steven pinker defended the legitimacy of summerss january lecture when asked if summerss talk was within the pale of legitimate academic discourse pinker responded good grief shouldnt everything be within the pale of legitimate academic discourse as long as it is presented with some degree of rigor thats the difference between a university and a madrassa there is certainly enough evidence for the hypothesis to be taken seriously summers had stronger support among harvard college students than among the college faculty one poll by the harvard crimson indicated that students opposed his resignation by a threetoone margin with  of responding students opposing his resignation and  supporting it in july  a board member of harvard corporation conrad k harper resigned saying he was angered both by the university presidents comments about women and by summers being given a salary increase the resignation letter to the president said i could not and cannot support a raise in your salary  i believe that harvards best interests require your resignation support of economist andrei shleiferedit harvard and andrei shleifer a close friend and protégé of summers controversially paid  million to settle a lawsuit by the us government over the conflict of interest shleifer had while advising russias privatisation program the us government had sued shleifer under the false claims act as he bought russian stocks while designing the countrys privatisation in  a federal judge ruled that while harvard had violated the contract shleifer and his associate alone were liable for treble damages in june  harvard and shleifer announced that they had reached a tentative settlement with the us government in august harvard shleifer and the department of justice reached an agreement under which the university paid  million to settle the fiveyearold lawsuit shleifer was also responsible for paying  million worth

information summers memo in december  while at the world bank summers signed a memo that was leaked to the press lant pritchett has claimed authorship of the private memo which both he and summers say was intended as sarcasm the memo stated that the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that ive always thought that underpopulated countries in africa are vastly underpolluted according to pritchett the memo as leaked was doctored to remove context and intended irony and was a deliberate fraud and forgery to discredit larry and the world bank service in the clinton administrationedit in  summers was appointed undersecretary for international affairs and later in the united states department of the treasury under the clinton administration in  he was promoted to deputy secretary of the treasury under his longtime political mentor robert rubin in  he succeeded rubin as secretary of the treasury

nations had currency crises summers set up a project through which the harvard institute for international development provided advice to the russian government between  and  later there was a scandal when it emerged that some of the harvard project members had invested in russia and were therefore not impartial advisors summers encouraged thenrussian leader boris yeltsin to use the same threeations of policy he advocated in the clinton administration – privatization stabilization and liberalization summers pressured the korean government to raise its interest rates and balance its

california energy crisis of  thentreasury secretary summers teamed with alan greenspan and enron executive kenneth lay to lecture california governor gray davis on the causes of the crisis explaining that the problem was excessive government regulation under the advice of kenneth lay summers urged davis to relax californias environmental standards in order to reassure the markets summers hailed the gramm–leach–bliley act in  which lifted more than six decades of restrictions against banks offering commercial banking insurance and investment services by repealing key provisions in the  glass–steagall act today congress voted to update the rules that have governed financial services since the great depression and replace them with a system for the st century summers said this historic legislation will better enable american companies to compete in the new economy many critics including president barack obama have suggested the  subprime mortgage financial crisis was caused by the partial repeal of the  glass–steagall act indeed as a member of president clintons working group on financial markets summers along with us securities and exchange commission sec chairman arthur levitt fed chairman greenspan and secretary rubin torpedoed an effort to regulate the derivatives that many blame for bringing the financial market down in fall  summerss role in the deregulation of derivatives contractsedit on may   the commodity futures trading commission cftc issued a concept release soliciting input from regulators academics and practitioners to determine how best to maintain adequate regulatory safeguards without impairing the ability of the otc overthecounter derivatives market to grow and the ability of us entities to remain competitive in the global financial marketplace on july   thendeputy secretary of the treasury summers testified before the us congress that the parties to these kinds of contract are largely sophisticated financial institutions that would appear to be eminently capable of protecting themselves from fraud and counterparty insolvencies at the time summers stated that to date there has been no clear evidence of a need for additional regulation of the institutional otc derivatives market and we would submit that proponents of such regulation must bear the burden of demonstrating that need in  summers endorsed the gramm–leach–bliley act which removed the separation between investment and commercial banks saying with this bill the american financial system takes a major step forward towards the st century when george stephanopoulos asked summers about the financial crisis in an abc interview on march   summers replied that there are a lot of terrible things that have happened in the last eighteen months but whats happened at aig  the way it was not regulated the way no one was watching  is outrageous at the  federal reserve conference in jackson hole raghuram rajan presented a paper called has financial development made the world riskier rajan pointed to a number of potential problems with the financial developments of the past thirty years the problems that rajan considered include skewed incentives of managers herding behavior among traders investment bankers and hedge fund operators who suffer withdrawals if they underperform the market rajan also discussed the problems associated with firms that goose up returns by taking risky positions that yield a positive carry justin lahart writing in the wall street journal in january  about the response to rajans paper at the conference recounts that former treasury secretary lawrence summers famous among economists for his blistering attacks told the audience he found the basic slightly leadeyed premise of mr rajans paper to be largely misguided in february  summers quoted john maynard keynes saying when circumstances change i change my opinion reflecting both on the failures of wall street deregulation and his new leadership role in the government bailout on april   in an interview on abcs this week program clinton said summers was wrong in the advice he gave him not to regulate derivatives president of harvardedit in  when george w bush became president summers left the treasury department and returned to harvard as its th president serving from july  until june  he is considered harvards first jewish president though his predecessor neil rudenstine had jewish ancestry and received praise from harvards jewish community for his support a number of summerss decisions at harvard attracted public controversy cornel west affairedit in an october  meeting summers criticized african american studies department head cornel west for allegedly missing three weeks of classes to work on the bill bradley presidential campaign and complained that west was contributing to grade inflation summers also claimed that wests rap album was an embarrassment to the university west pushed back strongly against the accusations the hiphop scared him its a stereotypical reaction he said later west who later called summers both uninformed and an unprincipled power player in describing this encounter in his book democracy matters  subsequently returned to princeton university where he had taught prior to harvard university differences between the sexesedit see also women in science in january  at a conference on diversifying the science  engineering workforce sponsored by the national bureau of economic research summers sparked controversy with his discussion of why women may have been underrepresented in tenured positions in science and engineering at top universities and research institutions summers had prefaced his talk saying he was adopting an entirely positive rather than normative approach and that his remarks were intended to be an attempt at provocation summers then began by identifying three hypotheses for the higher proportion of men in highend science and engineering positions the highpowered job hypothesis different availability of aptitude at the high end different socialization and patterns of discrimination in a search the second hypothesis the generally greater variability among men compared to women in tests of cognitive abilities leading to proportionally more males than females at both the lower and upper tails of the test score distributions caused the most controversy in his discussion of this hypothesis summers said that even small differences in the standard deviation between genders will translate into very large differences in the available pool substantially out from the mean summers referenced research that implied differences between the standard deviations of males and females in the top  of twelfth graders under various tests he then went on to argue that if this research were to be accepted then whatever the set of attributes that are precisely defined to correlate with being an aeronautical engineer at mit or being a chemist at berkeley are probably different in their standard deviations as well summers then concluded his discussion of the three hypotheses by saying so my best guess to provoke you of whats behind all of this is that the largest phenomenon by far is the general clash between peoples legitimate family desires and employers current desire for high power and high intensity that in the special case of science and engineering there are issues of intrinsic aptitude and particularly of the variability of aptitude and that those considerations are reinforced by what are in fact lesser factors involving socialization and continuing discrimination i would like nothing better than to be proved wrong because i would like nothing better than for these problems to be addressable simply by everybody understanding what they are and working very hard to address them summers then went on to discuss approaches to remedying the shortage of women in highend science and engineering positions this lunchtime talk drew accusations of sexism and careless scholarship and an intense negative response followed both nationally and at harvard summers apologized repeatedly nevertheless the controversy is speculated to have contributed to his resigning his position as president of harvard university the following year as well as costing summers the job of treasury secretary in obamas administration summerss protégée sheryl sandberg has defended him saying that larry has been a true advocate for women throughout his career at the world bank and treasury sandberg described of the lunch talk what few seem to note is that it is remarkable that he was giving the speech in the first place – that he cared enough about womens careers and their trajectory in the fields of math and science to proactively analyze the issues and talk about what was going wrong summerss opposition and support at harvardedit on march   members of the harvard faculty of arts and sciences which instructs graduate students in harvard graduate school of arts and sciences and undergraduates in harvard college passed – a motion of lack of confidence in the leadership of summers with  abstentions a second motion that offered a milder censure of the president passed  to  also with  abstentions the members of the harvard corporation the universitys highest governing body are in charge of the selection of the president and issued statements strongly supporting summers fas faculty were not unanimous in their comments on summers influential psychologist steven pinker defended the legitimacy of summerss january lecture when asked if summerss talk was within the pale of legitimate academic discourse pinker responded good grief shouldnt everything be within the pale of legitimate academic discourse as long as it is presented with some degree of rigor thats the difference between a university and a madrassa there is certainly enough evidence for the hypothesis to be taken seriously summers had stronger support among harvard college students than among the college faculty one poll by the harvard crimson indicated that students opposed his resignation by a threetoone margin with  of responding students opposing his resignation and  supporting it in july  a board member of harvard corporation conrad k harper resigned saying he was angered both by the university presidents comments about women and by summers being given a salary increase the resignation letter to the president said i could not and cannot support a raise in your salary  i believe that harvards best interests require your resignation support of economist andrei shleiferedit harvard and andrei shleifer a close friend and protégé of summers controversially paid  million to settle a lawsuit by the us government over the conflict of interest shleifer had while advising russias privatisation program the us government had sued shleifer under the false claims act as he bought russian stocks while designing the countrys privatisation in  a federal judge ruled that while harvard had violated the contract shleifer and his associate alone were liable for treble damages in june  harvard and shleifer announced that they had reached a tentative settlement with the us government in august harvard shleifer and the department of justice reached an agreement under which the university paid  million to settle the fiveyearold lawsuit shleifer was also responsible for paying  million worth of damages because harvard paid almost all of the damages and allowed shleifer to retain his faculty position the settlement provoked allegations of favoritism on summers his continued support for shleifer strengthened summerss unpopularity with other professors as reported in the harvard crimson ive been a member of this faculty for over  years and i am no longer easily shocked is how frederick h abernathy the mckay professor of mechanical engineering began his biting comments about the shleifer case at tuesdays fiery faculty meeting but abernathy continued i was deeply shocked and disappointed by the actions of this university in the shleifer affair in an word article how harvard lost russia in institutional investor by david mcclintick january  the magazine detailed shleifers alleged efforts to use his inside knowledge of and sway over the russian economy in order to make lucrative personal investments all while leading a harvard group advising the russian government that was under contract with the us the article suggests that summers shielded his fellow economist from disciplinary action by the university although it noted that summers had forewarned shleifer and his wife nancy zimmerman about the conflictofinterest regulations back in  summerss friendship with shleifer was well known by the corporation when it selected him to succeed rudenstine and summers recused himself from all proceedings with shleifer whose case was actually handled by an independent committee led by former harvard president derek bok resignation as harvard presidentedit on february   summers announced his intention to step down at the end of the school year

not shown interest in collaborating on policy solutions to the economic crisis on the other hand obama himself was reportedly thrilled with the work summers did in his first few weeks on the job and

figure at the last minute according to the wall street journal summers called senator chris dodd dct asking him to remove caps on executive pay at firms that have received stimulus money including

extent exceptional for the history of the world bank in recent decades dirty industries controversyedit further information summers memo in december  while at the world bank summers signed a memo that was leaked to the press lant pritchett has claimed authorship of the private memo which both he and summers say was intended as sarcasm the memo stated that the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that ive always thought that underpopulated countries in africa are vastly underpolluted according to pritchett the memo as leaked was doctored to remove context and intended irony and was a deliberate fraud and forgery to discredit larry and the world bank service in the clinton administrationedit in  summers was

international development provided advice to the russian government between  and  later there was a scandal when it emerged that some of the harvard project members had invested in russia and were

executive kenneth lay to lecture california governor gray davis on the causes of the crisis explaining that the problem was excessive government regulation under the advice of kenneth lay summers urged davis to relax californias environmental standards in order to reassure the markets summers hailed the gramm–leach–bliley act in  which lifted more than six decades of restrictions against banks offering commercial banking insurance and investment services by repealing key provisions in the  glass–steagall act today congress voted to update the rules that have governed financial services since the great depression and replace them with a system for the st century summers said this historic legislation will better enable american companies to compete in the new economy many critics including president barack obama have suggested the  subprime mortgage financial crisis was caused by the partial repeal of the  glass–steagall act indeed as a member of president clintons working group on financial markets summers along with us securities and exchange commission sec chairman arthur levitt fed chairman greenspan and secretary rubin torpedoed an effort to regulate the derivatives that many blame for bringing the financial market down in fall  summerss role in the deregulation of derivatives contractsedit on may   the commodity futures trading commission cftc issued a concept release soliciting input from regulators academics and practitioners to determine how best to maintain adequate regulatory safeguards without impairing the ability of the otc overthecounter derivatives market to grow and the ability of us entities to remain competitive in the global financial marketplace on july   thendeputy secretary of the treasury summers testified before the us congress that the parties to these kinds of contract are largely sophisticated financial institutions that would appear to be eminently capable of protecting themselves from fraud and counterparty insolvencies at the time summers stated that to date there has been no clear evidence of a need for additional regulation of the institutional otc derivatives market and we would submit that proponents of such regulation must bear the burden of demonstrating that need in  summers endorsed the gramm–leach–bliley act which removed the separation between investment and commercial banks saying with this bill the american financial system takes a major step forward towards the st century when george stephanopoulos asked summers about the financial crisis in an abc interview on march   summers replied that there are a lot of terrible things that have happened in the last eighteen months but whats happened at aig  the way it was not regulated the way no one was watching  is outrageous at the  federal reserve conference in jackson hole raghuram rajan presented a paper called has financial development made the world riskier rajan pointed to a number of potential problems with the financial developments of the past thirty years the problems that rajan considered include skewed incentives of managers herding behavior among traders investment bankers and hedge fund operators who suffer withdrawals if they underperform the market rajan also discussed the problems associated with firms that goose up returns by taking risky positions that yield a positive carry justin lahart writing in the wall street journal in january  about the response to rajans paper at the conference recounts that former treasury secretary lawrence summers famous among economists for his blistering attacks told the audience he found the basic slightly leadeyed premise of mr rajans paper to be largely misguided in february  summers quoted john maynard keynes saying when circumstances change i change my opinion reflecting both on the failures of wall street deregulation and his new leadership role in the government bailout on april   in an interview on abcs this week program clinton said summers was wrong in the advice he gave him not to regulate derivatives president of harvardedit in  when george w bush became president summers left the treasury department and returned to harvard as its th president serving from july  until june  he is considered harvards first jewish president though his predecessor neil rudenstine had jewish ancestry and received praise from harvards jewish community for his support a number of summerss decisions at harvard attracted public controversy cornel west affairedit in an october  meeting summers criticized african american studies department head cornel west for allegedly missing three weeks of classes to work on the bill bradley presidential campaign and complained that west was contributing to grade inflation summers also claimed that wests rap album was an embarrassment to the university west pushed back strongly against the accusations the hiphop scared him its a stereotypical reaction he said later west who later called summers both uninformed and an unprincipled power player in describing this encounter in his book democracy matters  subsequently returned to princeton university where he had taught prior to harvard university differences between the sexesedit see also women in science in january  at a conference on diversifying the science  engineering workforce sponsored by the national bureau of economic research summers sparked controversy with his discussion of why women may have been underrepresented in tenured positions in science and engineering at top universities and research institutions summers had prefaced his talk saying he was adopting an entirely positive rather than normative approach and that his remarks were intended to be an attempt at provocation summers then began by identifying three hypotheses for the higher proportion of men in highend science and engineering positions the highpowered job hypothesis different availability of aptitude at the high end different socialization and patterns of discrimination in a search the second hypothesis the generally greater variability among men compared to women in tests of cognitive abilities leading to proportionally more males than females at both the lower and upper tails of the test score distributions caused the most controversy in his discussion of this hypothesis summers said that even small differences in the standard deviation between genders will translate into very large differences in the available pool substantially out from the mean summers referenced research that implied differences between the standard deviations of males and females in the top  of twelfth graders under various tests he then went on to argue that if this research were to be accepted then whatever the set of attributes that are precisely defined to correlate with being an aeronautical engineer at mit or being a chemist at berkeley are probably different in their standard deviations as well summers then concluded his discussion of the three hypotheses by saying so my best guess to provoke you of whats behind all of this is that the largest phenomenon by far is the general clash between peoples legitimate family desires and employers current desire for high power and high intensity that in the special case of science and engineering there are issues of intrinsic aptitude and particularly of the variability of aptitude and that those considerations are reinforced by what are in fact lesser factors involving socialization and continuing discrimination i would like nothing better than to be proved wrong because i would like nothing better than for these problems to be addressable simply by everybody understanding what they are and working very hard to address them summers then went on to discuss approaches to remedying the shortage of women in highend science and engineering positions this lunchtime talk drew accusations of sexism and careless scholarship and an intense negative response followed both nationally and at harvard summers apologized repeatedly nevertheless the controversy is speculated to have contributed to his resigning his position as president of harvard university the following year as well as costing summers the job of treasury secretary in obamas administration summerss protégée sheryl sandberg has defended him saying that larry has been a true advocate for women throughout his career at the world bank and treasury sandberg described of the lunch talk what few seem to note is that it is remarkable that he was giving the speech in the first place – that he cared enough about womens careers and their trajectory in the fields of math and science to proactively analyze the issues and talk about what was going wrong summerss opposition and support at harvardedit on march   members of the harvard faculty of arts and sciences which instructs graduate students in harvard graduate school of arts and sciences and undergraduates in harvard college passed – a motion of lack of confidence in the leadership of summers with  abstentions a second motion that offered a milder censure of the president passed  to  also with  abstentions the members of the harvard corporation the universitys highest governing body are in charge of the selection of the president and issued statements strongly supporting summers fas faculty were not unanimous in their comments on summers influential psychologist steven pinker defended the legitimacy of summerss january lecture when asked if summerss talk was within the pale of legitimate academic discourse pinker responded good grief shouldnt everything be within the pale of legitimate academic discourse as long as it is presented with some degree of rigor thats the difference between a university and a madrassa there is certainly enough evidence for the hypothesis to be taken seriously summers had stronger support among harvard college students than among the college faculty one poll by the harvard crimson indicated that students opposed his resignation by a threetoone margin with  of responding students opposing his resignation and  supporting it in july  a board member of harvard corporation conrad k harper resigned saying he was angered both by the university presidents comments about women and by summers being given a salary increase the resignation letter to the president said i could not and cannot support a raise in your salary  i believe that harvards best interests require your resignation support of economist andrei shleiferedit harvard and andrei shleifer a close friend and protégé of summers controversially paid  million to settle a lawsuit by the us government over the conflict of interest shleifer had while advising russias privatisation program the us government had sued shleifer under the false claims act as he bought russian stocks while designing the countrys privatisation in  a federal judge ruled that while harvard had violated the contract shleifer and his associate alone were liable for treble damages in june  harvard and shleifer announced that they had reached a tentative settlement with the us government in august harvard shleifer and the department of justice reached an agreement under which the university paid  million to settle the fiveyearold lawsuit shleifer was also responsible for paying  million worth of damages because harvard paid almost all of the damages and allowed shleifer to retain his faculty position the settlement provoked allegations of favoritism on summers his continued support for shleifer strengthened summerss unpopularity with other professors as reported in the harvard crimson ive been a member of this faculty for over  years and i am no longer easily shocked is how frederick h abernathy the mckay professor of mechanical engineering began his biting comments about the shleifer case at tuesdays fiery faculty meeting but abernathy continued i was deeply shocked and disappointed by the actions of this university in the shleifer affair in an word article how harvard lost russia in institutional investor by david mcclintick january  the magazine detailed shleifers alleged efforts to use his inside knowledge of and sway over the russian economy in order to make lucrative personal investments all while leading a harvard group advising the russian government that was under contract with the us the article suggests that summers shielded his fellow economist from disciplinary action by the university although it noted that summers had forewarned shleifer and his wife nancy zimmerman about the conflictofinterest regulations back in  summerss friendship with shleifer was well known by the corporation when it selected him to succeed rudenstine and summers recused himself from all proceedings with shleifer whose case was actually handled by an independent committee led by former harvard president derek bok resignation as harvard presidentedit on

strongly in diversity who resists racism in all of its many incarnations who thinks that there is a great deal that’s unjust in american society that needs to be combated but it seems to be that there

information summers memo in december  while at the world bank summers signed a memo that was leaked to the press lant pritchett has claimed authorship of the private memo which both he and summers say was intended as sarcasm the memo stated that the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that ive always thought that underpopulated countries in africa are vastly underpolluted according to pritchett the memo as leaked was doctored to remove context and intended irony and was a deliberate fraud and forgery to discredit larry and the world bank service in the clinton administrationedit in  summers was appointed undersecretary for international affairs and later in the united states department of the treasury under the clinton administration in  he was promoted to deputy secretary of the treasury under his longtime political mentor robert rubin in  he succeeded rubin as secretary of the treasury much of summerss tenure at the treasury department was focused on international economic issues he was deeply involved in the clinton administrations effort to bail out mexico and russia when those nations had currency crises summers set up a project through which the harvard institute for international development provided advice to the russian government between  and  later there was a scandal when it emerged that some of the harvard project members had invested in russia and were therefore not impartial advisors summers encouraged thenrussian leader boris yeltsin to use the same threeations of policy he advocated in the clinton administration – privatization stabilization and liberalization summers pressured the korean government to raise its interest rates and balance its

california energy crisis of  thentreasury secretary summers teamed with alan greenspan and enron executive kenneth lay to lecture california governor gray davis on the causes of the crisis explaining that the problem was excessive government regulation under the advice of kenneth lay summers urged davis to relax californias environmental standards in order to reassure the markets summers hailed the gramm–leach–bliley act in  which lifted more than six decades of restrictions against banks offering commercial banking insurance and investment services by repealing key provisions in the  glass–steagall act today congress voted to update the rules that have governed financial services since the great depression and replace them with a system for the st century summers said this historic legislation will better enable american companies to compete in the new economy many critics including president barack obama have suggested the  subprime mortgage financial crisis was caused by the partial repeal of the  glass–steagall act indeed as a member of president clintons working group on financial markets summers along with us securities and exchange commission sec chairman arthur levitt fed chairman greenspan and secretary rubin torpedoed an effort to regulate the derivatives that many blame for bringing the financial market down in fall  summerss role in the deregulation of derivatives contractsedit on may   the commodity futures trading commission cftc issued a concept release soliciting input from regulators academics and practitioners to determine how best to maintain adequate regulatory safeguards without impairing the ability of the otc overthecounter derivatives market to grow and the ability of us entities to remain competitive in the global financial marketplace on july   thendeputy secretary of the treasury summers testified before the us congress that the parties to these kinds of contract are largely sophisticated financial institutions that would appear to be eminently capable of protecting themselves from fraud and counterparty insolvencies at the time summers stated that to date there has been no clear evidence of a need for additional regulation of the institutional otc derivatives market and we would submit that proponents of such regulation must bear the burden of demonstrating that need in  summers endorsed the gramm–leach–bliley act which removed the separation between investment and commercial banks saying with this bill the american financial system takes a major step forward towards the st century when george stephanopoulos asked summers about the financial crisis in an abc interview on march   summers replied that there are a lot of terrible things that have happened in the last eighteen months but whats happened at aig  the way it was not regulated the way no one was watching  is outrageous at the  federal reserve conference in jackson hole raghuram rajan presented a paper called has financial development made the world riskier rajan pointed to a number of potential problems with the financial developments of the past thirty years the problems that rajan considered include skewed incentives of managers herding behavior among traders investment bankers and hedge fund operators who suffer withdrawals if they underperform the market rajan also discussed the problems associated with firms that goose up returns by taking risky positions that yield a positive carry justin lahart writing in the wall street journal in january  about the response to rajans paper at the conference recounts that former treasury secretary lawrence summers famous among economists for his blistering attacks told the audience he found the basic slightly leadeyed premise of mr rajans paper to be largely misguided in february  summers quoted john maynard keynes saying when circumstances change i change my opinion reflecting both on the failures of wall street deregulation and his new leadership role in the government bailout on april   in an interview on abcs this week program clinton said summers was wrong in the advice he gave him not to regulate derivatives president of harvardedit in  when george w bush became president summers left the treasury department and returned to harvard as its th president serving from july  until june  he is considered harvards first jewish president though his predecessor neil rudenstine had jewish ancestry and received praise from harvards jewish community for his support a number of summerss decisions at harvard attracted public controversy cornel west affairedit in an october  meeting summers criticized african american studies department head cornel west for allegedly missing three weeks of classes to work on the bill bradley presidential campaign and complained that west was contributing to grade inflation summers also claimed that wests rap album was an embarrassment to the university west pushed back strongly against the accusations the hiphop scared him its a stereotypical reaction he said later west who later called summers both uninformed and an unprincipled power player in describing this encounter in his book democracy matters  subsequently returned to princeton university where he had taught prior to harvard university differences between the sexesedit see also women in science in january  at a conference on diversifying the science  engineering workforce sponsored by the national bureau of economic research summers sparked controversy with his discussion of why women may have been underrepresented in tenured positions in science and engineering at top universities and research institutions summers had prefaced his talk saying he was adopting an entirely positive rather than normative approach and that his remarks were intended to be an attempt at provocation summers then began by identifying three hypotheses for the higher proportion of men in highend science and engineering positions the highpowered job hypothesis different availability of aptitude at the high end different socialization and patterns of discrimination in a search the second hypothesis the generally greater variability among men compared to women in tests of cognitive abilities leading to proportionally more males than females at both the lower and upper tails of the test score distributions caused the most controversy in his discussion of this hypothesis summers said that even small differences in the standard deviation between genders will translate into very large differences in the available pool substantially out from the mean summers referenced research that implied differences between the standard deviations of males and females in the top  of twelfth graders under various tests he then went on to argue that if this research were to be accepted then whatever the set of attributes that are precisely defined to correlate with being an aeronautical engineer at mit or being a chemist at berkeley are probably different in their standard deviations as well summers then concluded his discussion of the three hypotheses by saying so my best guess to provoke you of whats behind all of this is that the largest phenomenon by far is the general clash between peoples legitimate family desires and employers current desire for high power and high intensity that in the special case of science and engineering there are issues of intrinsic aptitude and particularly of the variability of aptitude and that those considerations are reinforced by what are in fact lesser factors involving socialization and continuing discrimination i would like nothing better than to be proved wrong because i would like nothing better than for these problems to be addressable simply by everybody understanding what they are and working very hard to address them summers then went on to discuss approaches to remedying the shortage of women in highend science and engineering positions this lunchtime talk drew accusations of sexism and careless scholarship and an intense negative response followed both nationally and at harvard summers apologized repeatedly nevertheless the controversy is speculated to have contributed to his resigning his position as president of harvard university the following year as well as costing summers the job of treasury secretary in obamas administration summerss protégée sheryl sandberg has defended him saying that larry has been a true advocate for women throughout his career at the world bank and treasury sandberg described of the lunch talk what few seem to note is that it is remarkable that he was giving the speech in the first place – that he cared enough about womens careers and their trajectory in the fields of math and science to proactively analyze the issues and talk about what was going wrong summerss opposition and support at harvardedit on march   members of the harvard faculty of arts and sciences which instructs graduate students in harvard graduate school of arts and sciences and undergraduates in harvard college passed – a motion of lack of confidence in the leadership of summers with  abstentions a second motion that offered a milder censure of the president passed  to  also with  abstentions the members of the harvard corporation the universitys highest governing body are in charge of the selection of the president and issued statements strongly supporting summers fas faculty were not unanimous in their comments on summers influential psychologist steven pinker defended the legitimacy of summerss january lecture when asked if summerss talk was within the pale of legitimate academic discourse pinker responded good grief shouldnt everything be within the pale of legitimate academic discourse as long as it is presented with some degree of rigor thats the difference between a university and a madrassa there is certainly enough evidence for the hypothesis to be taken seriously summers had stronger support among harvard college students than among the college faculty one poll by the harvard crimson indicated that students opposed his resignation by a threetoone margin with  of responding students opposing his resignation and  supporting it in july  a board member of harvard corporation conrad k harper resigned saying he was angered both by the university presidents comments about women and by summers being given a salary increase the resignation letter to the president said i could not and cannot support a raise in your salary  i believe that harvards best interests require your resignation support of economist andrei shleiferedit harvard and andrei shleifer a close friend and protégé of summers controversially paid  million to settle a lawsuit by the us government over the conflict of interest shleifer had while advising russias privatisation program the us government had sued shleifer under the false claims act as he bought russian stocks while designing the countrys privatisation in  a federal judge ruled that while harvard had violated the contract shleifer and his associate alone were liable for treble damages in june  harvard and shleifer announced that they had reached a tentative settlement with the us government in august harvard shleifer and the department of justice reached an agreement under which the university paid  million to settle the fiveyearold lawsuit shleifer was also responsible for paying  million worth of damages because harvard paid almost all of the damages and allowed shleifer to retain his faculty position the settlement provoked allegations of favoritism on summers his continued support for shleifer strengthened summerss unpopularity with other professors as reported in the harvard crimson ive been a member of this faculty for over  years and i am no longer easily shocked is how frederick h abernathy the mckay professor of mechanical engineering began his biting comments about the shleifer case at tuesdays fiery faculty meeting but abernathy continued i was deeply shocked and disappointed by the actions of this university in the shleifer affair in an word article how harvard lost russia in institutional investor by david mcclintick january  the magazine detailed shleifers alleged efforts to use his inside knowledge of and sway over the russian economy in order to make lucrative personal investments all while leading a harvard group advising the russian government that was under contract with the us the article suggests that summers shielded his fellow economist from disciplinary action by the university although it noted that summers had forewarned shleifer and his wife nancy zimmerman about the conflictofinterest regulations back in  summerss

release has been a matter of serious concern not merely to treasury but to all those with an interest in the otc derivatives market in our view the release has cast the shadow of regulatory

parties to these kinds of contracts are largely sophisticated financial institutions that would appear to be eminently capable of protecting themselves from fraud and counterparty insolvencies read

great depression and replace them with a system for the st century this historic legislation will better enable american companies to compete in the new economy read the statement here on november   summers and other regulators issued a report that would serve as the congressional blueprint for the commodities futures modernization act drafted the following year the presidents working group on financial markets concluded that under many circumstances the trading of financial derivatives by eligible swap participants should be excluded from the cea commodities exchange act to do otherwise would perpetuate legal uncertainty or impose unnecessary regulatory burdens and constraints upon the development of these markets in the united states read the working group report here summers

various positions in the us treasury department including that of treasury secretary from  to  summers has described the ’s as a time when “important steps” were taken to achieve “deregulation in key sectors of the economy” such as financial services he has also said that during this period government officials and private financial interests collaborated in a spirit of cooperation “to provide the right framework for our financial industry to thrive”  summers recommended before he left the treasury department that removing policies that “artificially constrict the size of markets” should remain a priority for the us government along with robert rubin and alan greenspan summers brought about elimination of key us financial regulations including the glasssteagall act he was particularly aggressive in his efforts to block regulations of derivatives regulations that might have prevented the economic meltdown the us suffered in  according to economist dean baker the policies he promoted as treasury secretary and in his subsequent writings led to the economic disaster that we now face  support for repeal of the glasssteagall act when he was treasury secretary larry summers advocated repeal of the glasssteagall act which was a target of the financial industry in their report  “sold out how wall street and washington betrayed america”  robert weissman and harry rosenfeld identified the repeal of this legislation as one of the main causes of the  financial crisis according to weissman and rosenfeld “the financial services modernization act of  formally repealed the glasssteagall act of  also known as the banking act of  and related laws which prohibited commercial banks from offering investment banking and insurance services…the  repeal of glasssteagall helped create the conditions in which banks invested monies from checking and savings accounts into creative financial instruments such as mortgagebacked securities and credit default swaps investment gambles that rocked the financial markets in ”  summers worked for congressional approval of the financial services modernization act sponsored by republicans phil gramm jim leach and thomas bliley this act eliminated provisions in the glasssteagall act that prohibited banks from affiliating with securities firms it also repealed provisions in the bank holding company act that prevented banks from underwriting insurance arianna huffington points out that the financial services modernization act “created an oversight disaster with supervision of banking conglomerates split among a host of different government agencies  agencies that often failed to let each other know what they were doing and what they were uncovering”  summers has promoted financial deregulation as a form of modernization rather than a return to the lack of government oversight and instability of the predepression era in  summers claimed the financial services modernization act would create a financial regulatory system “for the st century” and “promote stability in our financial system”  however democrat senator byron dorgan warned at the time “i think we will look back in  years’ time and say we should not have done this but we did because we forgot the lessons of the past and that that which is true in the s is true in  we have now decided in the name of modernization to forget the lessons of the past of safety and of soundness”  summers argued for elimination of the glasssteagall act by saying it imposed “archaic financial restrictions” he said that the us government “must allow competition to work” and that meant “allowing common ownership of banking securities and insurance firms” summers insisted that us financial organizations must have the ability to choose “the structure that is right for them” and to offer “a full range of products” in summers’ view the financial services modernization act that repealed glasssteagall struck the right balance between giving financial institutions more flexibility and protecting us taxpayers  summers cast the repeal of the glasssteagall act as a victory for the international competitiveness of us financial firms and for us consumers “if it can be done without compromising other critical objectives repeal of the common ownership restrictions of current law would be an important boost to our financial system our leadership of the worlds financial markets would be enhanced and consumers would see the benefits in the form of greater innovation and lower prices”  however the financial innovation that followed the repeal of the glasssteagall act has been criticized for its damaging effects on the us economy and us taxpayers in their report proposing financial regulatory reform the congressional oversight panel for the troubled asset relief program observed that “creativity and innovation are too often channeled into circumventing regulation and exploiting loopholes” the panel’s report notes how after the introduction of key financial regulations during the depression  including the  glasssteagall act that summers helped to repeal  the us had enjoyed a long period of high economic growth that was also free of major financial crises  opposition to regulation of derivatives summers’ principal link to the  financial crisis may be the role he played while at the treasury department in blocking regulation of derivatives  conducted outside of formal exchanges most derivative trading is not only unregulated it is also largely unreported so that the full extent of the risk financial institutions are exposed to cannot be known overthecounter derivatives are traded in “dark markets” with little transparency summers argued as treasury secretary that the us should deregulate derivative markets so they could grow he saw benefits for the us housing market from expansion of derivatives arguing that “by enabling more sophisticated management of assets including mortgages consumer loans and corporate debt derivatives can help lower mortgage payments insurance premiums and other financing costs for american consumers and businesses”  however frank partnoy a former wall street trader has explained how unregulated derivatives transformed the us subprime mortgage crisis into a fullblown global financial crisis “without derivatives the total losses from the spike in subprime mortgage defaults would have been relatively small and easily contained…instead derivatives multiplied the losses from subprime mortgage loans through side bets based on credit default swaps  still more credit default swaps based on defaults by banks and insurance companies themselves magnified losses on the subprime side bets as investors learned about all of this side betting they began to lose confidence in the system when they looked at the banks’ financial statements all they saw were vague and incomplete references to unregulated derivatives” while he was at the treasury department summers’ enthusiasm for financial deregulation conflicted with the views of brooksley born who became chair of the commodity futures trading commission in  born had extensive previous experience working as a lawyer in the derivatives area and was concerned about the lack of oversight of this multitrillion dollar financial market however summers collaborated with alan greenspan robert rubin and arthur levitt to block born’s efforts to initiate discussion of regulating derivatives according to new york times report timothy o’brien “they were all part of a very concerted effort to shut her up and to shut her down and they did in fact shut her up and shut her down bob rubin is not a guy who likes confrontation hes confrontationaverse but he understands that you need someone in there who can swing a heavy axe and that person was larry summers he was the enforcer”  former cftc director michael greenberger has recounted how summers called born personally to accuse her of risking a major financial crisis with her proposal  to discuss regulation of derivatives summers echoed the concerns of bankers who were in his office at the time he made the call to born in his senate committee testimony opposing brooksley born’s initiative summers stated that opening the door to regulation of derivatives had “cast the shadow of regulatory uncertainty over an otherwise thriving market  raising risks for the stability and competitiveness of american derivative trading” summers opposed even raising “the possibility of increased regulation over this market” because of the uncertainty it might create  summers praised the  trillion unregulated overthecounter otc us derivatives market as “second to none” playing “a major role in our own economy” and acting as “a magnet for derivative business from around the world” summers argued that not only wall street but also the average person had an interest in the growth of derivatives markets “otc derivatives directly and indirectly support higher investment and growth in living standards in the united states and around the world” summers’ view of derivatives as benefiting average americans contrasted with born’s who testified that losses resulting from misuse of otc derivatives instruments or from sales practice abuses in the otc derivatives market can affect many americans  the us economy had already experienced a number of disasters that signaled the dangers of unregulated derivatives the largest municipal bankruptcy in us history – that of orange county california – occurred in  because of losses on derivatives amounting to  for every resident two us corporations – proctor and gamble and gibson’s greeting cards – had been “taken to the cleaners” in  by derivative traders from bankers trust and in  as summers was testifying about the riskmanagement benefits of derivatives long term capital management was in the process of selfdestructing and almost taking the banking system down with it having made  trillion in derivative trades with major banks despite holding only  billion to back them up  support for permanent deregulation of derivatives as well as blocking brooksley born’s efforts to regulate derivatives summers worked to ensure derivatives remained permanently deregulated by promoting passage of the commodity futures modernization act  summers said the act would “allow the united states to maintain its competitive position in this rapidly growing sector…” this legislation was another piece of deregulatory legislation sponsored by republican senator phil gramm summers supported the act’s exclusion of overthecounter derivatives from regulation under the commodity exchange act and also from statelevel laws that regulate gambling in a report  he coauthored on derivatives that preceded passage of the commodity futures modernization act summers recommended the us government permanently exclude from the commodity exchange act derivative trades between “sophisticated” parties while summers was president of harvard the university purchased derivatives in the form of interest rate swap contracts these derivative contracts involved harvard in paying high fee to investment banks and having to compensate for massive losses when interest rates fell the losses occurred despite the “sophistication” in financial issues that might have been expected of harvard’s leaders including summers  summers and his coauthors in the report on derivatives argued against imposing “unnecessary regulatory burdens and constraints upon the development of these markets in the united states” although the us had already experienced problems with derivatives the report concluded there was “no compelling evidence of problems involving bilateral swap agreements that would warrant regulation under the commodity exchange act”  summers characterized both the financial services modernization act and the commodity futures modernization act despite their deregulatory impacts as “clear steps to strengthen the integrity of americas financial system” he told a business lobby group that “even in the us with the most open financial markets in the world further deregulation of domestic financial markets as weve recognized in our financial services legislation proposals can make an important difference in spurring a healthier and more efficient financial sector” record and controversies role as director of the national economic council the national economic council is the agency responsible for advising the us president on economic policy as director of the nec summers is “the only top adviser with a west wing office sees the president more than the other economic advisers and controls the daily economic briefings”  summers had a key role in determining the size of the economic stimulus package the obama administration submitted to congress in a july  speech summers highlighted how bad the economy was when the obama administration took office he said “fear was widespread and confidence was scarce” the lesson he took from previous economic crises was that government’s response could not be “too little or too late”  the size of the stimulus however has been criticized as too little economist paul krugman warned that while cutting the size of the stimulus might get more republican votes it would fail to significantly reduce unemployment this failure would then be blamed on the democrats and be used to argue that government spending does not work  links to the financial industry after resigning under pressure from being president of harvard university summers sought jobs on wall street with goldman sachs and citigroup  he was hired by one of the world’s largest hedge funds de shaw where he worked one day a week and earned  million in the year before he became director of the national economic council  between  and  he had worked as a consultant for another hedge fund taconic capital advisors in  summers tried to get one of the founders of taconic appointed to head the government’s financial bailout oversight office summers now seeks input on public policy issues from the hedge fund managers he met while working with the industry including the ceo of blackrock  while his former financial industry colleagues say they feel more confident in the administration with summers in his current post others have questioned whether the public is served by his ties to the financial sector professor andrew sabl has said “this is what might be called contamination did summers spend so much time with the hedge fund or its investors sovereign wealth funds and so on that he started to think like them”  summers’ financial disclosure forms for  indicate that in addition to his  million compensation from de shaw he also earned  million in speaking fees among the financial institutions that paid him to speak were jp morgan chase citigroup goldman sachs lehman brothers and merrill lynch with goldman sachs paying  for a single appearance  views on the role of regulation in financial markets as treasury secretary summers recognized potential problems could arise due to “lack of transparency the risks that hedging strategies and models may not live up to their design and the toxic combination of excessive leverage and illiquidity” these problems would end up creating the  financial crisis however despite his own criticisms of the notion that markets are selfcorrecting in  summers argued against government regulation on the grounds that the financial industry had demonstrated “significant selfcorrection where excesses had developed” he gave the following rationale for limited government oversight of the financial industry “as i have stated before it is the private sector not the public sector that is in the best position to provide effective supervision and reduce the likelihood that these issues rise to a level that could threaten market stability market discipline is the first line of defense in maintaining the integrity of our financial system” the “best approach to regulation” in summers’ view was “to ensure that public activities do not crowd out the supervision provided by counterparties creditors and investors”  financial regulation should be “based on a presumption of permission rather than a presumption of prohibition”  a section of one of summers’ speeches  as treasury secretary is titled “providing a strong legal and regulatory framework for the financial markets” however the examples summers gives of the public sector’s contribution to this “strong regulatory framework” are in fact the deregulatory acts he championed the  financial services modernization act which repealed the glasssteagall act and the  commodity futures modernization act summers appeared to view deregulation as the primary contribution the public sector could make to strengthen financial markets according to summers the goal of government policies should be to help financial corporations expand and that was why deregulation was needed he claimed that governments should implement “policies that help to expand the size of markets…that means that deregulation becomes that much more important to ensure that government is not preventing or distorting the development of fastgrowing markets that is we worked so hard to pass the right kind of financial modernization legislation last year…” robert rubin summers’ mentor and predecessor as treasury secretary relates in his memoir that “larry thought i was overly concerned with the risks of derivatives” summers has recently explained his own lack of concern by saying “if we had known that derivatives markets would mushroom the way they did and that regulators would remain spectators we would have acted”  however summers’ rationale for deregulating the derivatives market was precisely so that it could expand and he took a lead role in sidelining regulators like brooksley born who wanted to act summers’ opinion while at the treasury department was that public servants should work cooperatively with the financial institutions they are responsible for regulating “by drawing on a spirit of cooperation between the private sector and the public sector over the past  years this administration has worked to provide the right framework for our financial industry to thrive”  during george bush’s presidency summers was critical of the government’s lack of oversight of critical areas of the economy asked to explain his apparent change of attitude towards regulation summers said the following “and so when things were pretty screwed up and the dominant thrust of the policy had been of doing nothing the inclination was much more on the activist side but i don’t think it’s because i changed i think it’s because the world changed” views on the role of the finance industry in the us economy summers promotes the concept of “a postindustrial age” where manufacturing is not key to prosperity he has said that the strength of the us economy largely relies on the strength of its financial system an expression he was fond of repeating as treasury secretary was “financial markets do not just oil the wheels of economic growth they are the wheels”  for summers “modern competitive finance” is an area where the us excels “no other financial market is so open to foreign competition or so quick to innovate whether it be in the area of securitization financial derivatives highyield debt or equity finance” he has particular praise for the us derivatives market which he sees as “a powerful symbol of the kind of innovation and technology that has made the american financial system as strong as it is today” in contrast warren buffet likens derivatives to “time bombs both for the parties that deal in them and the economic system  summers identifies the wellbeing of us financial institutions with that of the overall economy “in a very real sense the financial system is the central nervous system of our economy and just as the past dynamism of our financial sector has been central to americas current prosperity so the future success of that sector will be very important to the wellbeing of the economy as a whole”  recently summers has commented on the ways to address high unemployment job rate and the lack of economic growth this is a profoundly important problem for our society but its the task of economists to analyze it in a more bloodless way  asked when that high unemployment would abate he explained that it would depend upon the pace of the economic recovery in terms of gdp gross domestic product and whether the formula that economists have historically used to predict job growth based on gdp would continue to be skewed by unusually high productivity make your judgment about the gdp forecast over the next several years take your guess about whether the formula is going to snap back or continue to be off and you can form a view about the unemployment rate maybe things will restore to normal he said  in which case job growth would actually outpace gdp that would be my guess though not one i would hold confidently  but asked if the country needs another stimulus he replied i dont think framing the question in terms of a stimulus is very helpful he said he favored continuing unemployment insurance new funding for local governments and investments in energy efficiency  three major progressive goals but beyond that he said is this the moment for some major new experiment in keynesian pumppriming absolutely no  with respect to the growth of large american banks summers opposes breaking huge banks into smaller institutions but thats not the important issue summers said during the interview adding to his answer as to why the us shouldnt break up megabanks observers believe that it would actually make us less stable because the individual banks would be less diversified and therefore at greater risk of failing because they would havent profits in one area to turn to when a different area got in trouble and most observers believe that dealing with the simultaneous failure of many  many small institutions would actually generate more need for bailouts and reliance on taxpayers than the current economic environment he added  views on trade summers had worked as a consultant for the coalition of services industries  a lobby group founded by american express citibank and aig  before he joined the treasury department the coalition was founded in the ’s to get an international agreement on trade in financial services according to harry freeman the american express vicepresident assigned to head this lobby group the decision by amex to spend unlimited funds on the lobbying campaign and hire larry summers and others “paid off”  as treasury secretary when he was speaking to a luncheon sponsored by the coalition of service industries summers thanked participants on behalf of the treasury department for their “terrific cooperation” in advancing trade priorities that “the us government and that us industry share”  summers has said that the most important issue that will affect the lives of americans for the next fifty years is the country’s support for global integration and open markets in advance of the world trade organization  ministerial in seattle summers argued that while there is a strong political economic and national security case for trade the benefits are undervalued he gave as an example that americans do not notice they are able to buy twice as many christmas toys “because of our increased trade links with very poor countries who can make these things more cheaply”  in a  speech to the insurance industry  summers boasted about the clinton administrations’ negotiations of  new trade agreements including nafta and highlighted the world trade organization agreement on financial services in particular this agreement committed countries to trade in the full range of financial products including derivatives views on social programs summers believes social assistance unemployment insurance and unions cause unemployment government assistance to the unemployed in summers’ view provides both an incentive and the means for them not to work he moderates these assertions by also saying that “it is however a great mistake made by some conservative economists to attribute most unemployment to government interventions in the economy or to any lack of desire to work on the part of the unemployed”  role in the enron crisis when he was about to take office as treasury secretary summers received a congratulatory letter from ken lay the president of enron corporation the letter was addressed “dear larry” in his response addressed to “ken” summers promised “i’ll keep my eye on power deregulation and energymarket infrastructure issues”  during california’s energy crisis in  summers rejected the idea that energy companies like enron were manipulating the market and gouging consumers he opposed governor gray davis’ plan for governments to intervene with price controls claiming “this is classic supply and demand the only way to fix this is ultimately by allowing retail prices to go wherever they have to go” summers also encouraged energy executives to compromise for the sake of preserving the potential for energy deregulation in other states  summers has been criticized for allowing the “enron loophole” to be included in the commodity futures modernization act a loophole that ensured the commodity futures trading commission could not regulate energy trading in its review of original correspondence between enron and summers public citizen has concluded summers responses “marked a departure from previous working group consensus and indicated a sea change in the clinton administration’s policy suggesting the administration would not oppose enron in its pursuit of legislation to further deregulate the energy trading business” public citizen connected the enron loophole with the crisis california subsequently suffered “following passage of the commodity futures modernization act of  sponsored by gramm and not opposed by the clinton administration enron and other energy traders were allowed to operate unregulated power auctions that greatly enhanced their ability to manipulate deregulated electricity and natural gas markets”  role in international crises as undersecretary in the treasury department in the early ’s summers pressured russia to institute rapid privatization and liberalization he suggested that multilateral support which would include imf funds would be withdrawn if these changes were not made fast enough reviewing the impacts of these prescriptions naomi klein has written in the shock doctrine about the corrupt enrichment of oligarchs and the impoverishment of the general populace sharp rises in alcoholism suicides homicides and homelessness resulted from what klein describes as the “planned misery” summers and others forced on russia  summers worked to strengthen the ability of the imf to enforce neoliberal policies on foreign countries in his analysis of us influence on foreign countries’ economic policies edward luce has written “led by robert rubin and lawrence summers mr clinton’s economic team spent the decade adding heft to the international monetary fund’s often intrusive attempts to restructure exposed economies  from mexico in  to the victims of the asian flu crisis in  these countries had strayed from the orthodoxies of the washington consensus and were required to don the hairshirt in recompense”  in the south asian financial crisis of the late ’s summers was the treasury official sent to block efforts by japan and other asian countries to create a fund for a bailout korea indonesia and thailand were forced to deal with the imf and conform with its policy directives to cut public spending privatize and open their economies to foreign companies according to mark weisbrot “the orders from washington were clear any bailout would have to go through the imf with results that turned out to be an economic and human disaster  former imf economist simon johnson remembers having “the imf in one room and the south koreans in another but larry summers was the guy dictating the conditions from a third”  harvard summers became president of harvard university in  and resigned under pressure in  while the weekly standard named summers its favorite university president his term as president was associated with a number of controversies including  derivative losses summers departed the treasury in  and went off to be the president of harvard where he ignored repeated warnings by expert staff and lost harvard some  billion of its endowment funds including  billion on toxic interest rate swaps read about it in the boston globe and bloomberg in november  bloomberg businessweek reports that the derivatives losses continue to mount the larry summers administration is still costing harvard university the school lost  million this fiscal year getting out of interest rate swaps it agreed to before the financial crisis when summers then the university president made bets on exotic debt derivatives the swaps losses were an increase from  million in  and now add up to more than  billion since  bloomberg news reported harvard detailed the figures in its annual financial report pdf which showed its endowment the nation’s largest returning  percent to reach  billion that’s a big improvement from  when harvard posted the financial performance in the ivy league losing  percent   views on women in  summers gave a speech speculating that the reason why women were underrepresented as tenured engineering and science professors was due to their unwillingness to work the long hours required and “issues of intrinsic aptitude and particularly of the variability of aptitude” he argued that “socialization and continuing discrimination” were “lesser factors”   support for reserve officers’ training corps rotc at harvard summers made a special effort to encourage the rotc presence at harvard according to the campus newspaper summers “broke with precedent and spoke at the annual rotc ceremony every year during his presidency in an effort to show support for students in the program and for expanded military access to the campus   harvard payment to settle case of summers’ close friend professor andrei shleifer harvard paid  million to settle a suit after “a us district court found shleifer liable for conspiracy to defraud the us government and concluded that harvard had breached its contract with the government” shleifer and his wife had invested in russia at the same time that they were on contract with the government’s agency for international development resulting in a conflict of interest faculty members were critical of the payment harvard made to settle the case and the lack of disciplinary action taken against shleifer one professor said at a meeting with summers “the outcome of the tawdry shleifer affairwould have been unthinkable—unthinkable—during the last two presidencies but is all too characteristic of the present malaise”  tobacco larry summers is mentioned in the tobaccorelated research librarytdoresourceid resourcecodesummerslawrence searchtermlawrence summerstdo background info

securities and exchange commission sec chairman arthur levitt fed chairman greenspan and secretary rubin torpedoed an effort to regulate the derivatives that many blame for bringing the financial market down in fall  summerss role in the deregulation of derivatives contractsedit on may   the commodity futures trading commission cftc issued a concept release soliciting input from regulators academics and practitioners to determine how best to maintain adequate regulatory safeguards without impairing the ability of the otc overthecounter derivatives market to grow and the ability of us entities to remain competitive in the global financial marketplace on july   thendeputy secretary of the treasury summers testified before the us congress that the parties to these kinds of contract are largely sophisticated financial institutions that would appear to be eminently capable of protecting themselves from fraud and counterparty insolvencies at the time summers stated that to date there has been no clear evidence of a need for additional regulation of the institutional otc derivatives market and we would submit that proponents of such regulation must bear the burden of demonstrating that need in  summers endorsed the grammleachbliley act which removed the separation between investment and commercial banks saying with this bill the american financial system takes a major step forward towards the st century when george stephanopoulos asked summers about the financial crisis in an abc interview on march   summers replied that there are a lot of terrible things that have happened in the last eighteen months but whats happened at aig  the way it was not regulated the way no one was watching  is outrageous at the  federal reserve conference in jackson hole raghuram rajan presented a paper called has financial development made the world riskier rajan pointed to a number of potential problems with the financial developments of the past thirty years the problems that rajan considered include skewed incentives of managers herding behavior among traders investment bankers and hedge fund operators who suffer withdrawals if they underperform the market rajan also discussed the problems associated with firms that goose up returns by taking risky positions that yield a positive carry justin lahart writing in the wall street journal in january  about the response to rajans paper at the conference recounts that former treasurysecretary lawrence summers famous among economists for his blistering attacks told the audience he found the basic slightly leadeyed premise of mr rajans paper to be largely misguided in february  summers quoted john maynard keynes saying when circumstances change i change my opinion reflecting both on the failures of wall street deregulation and his new leadership role in the government bailout on april   in an interview on abcs this week program clinton said summers was wrong in the advice he gave him not to regulate derivatives president of harvardedit in  when george w bush became president summers left the treasury department and returned to harvard as its th president serving from july  until june  he is considered harvards first jewish president though his predecessor neil rudenstine had jewish ancestry and received praise from harvards jewish community for his support a number of summerss decisions at harvard attracted public controversy cornel west affairedit in an october  meeting summers criticized african american studies department head cornel west for allegedly missing three weeks of classes to work on the bill bradley presidential campaign and complained that west was contributing to grade inflation summers also claimed that wests rap album was an embarrassment to the university west pushed back strongly against the accusations the hiphop scared him its a stereotypical reaction he said later west who later called summers both uninformed and an unprincipled power player in describing this encounter in his book democracy matters  subsequently returned to princeton university where he had taught prior to harvard university differences between the sexesedit see also women in science in january  at a conference on diversifying the science  engineering workforce sponsored by the national bureau of economic research summers sparked controversy with his discussion of why women may have been underrepresented in tenured positions in science and engineering at top universities and research institutions summers had prefaced his talk saying he was adopting an entirely positive rather than normative approach and that his remarks were intended to be an attempt at provocation summers then began by identifying three hypotheses for the higher proportion of men in highend science and engineering positions the highpowered job hypothesis different availability of aptitude at the high end different socialization and patterns of discrimination in a search the second hypothesis the generally greater variability among men compared to women in tests of cognitive abilities leading to proportionally more males than females at both the lower and upper tails of the test score distributions caused the most controversy in his discussion of this hypothesis summers said that even small differences in the standard deviation between genders will translate into very large differences in the available pool substantially out from the mean summers referenced research that implied differences between the standard deviations of males and females in the top  of twelfth graders under various tests he then went on to argue that if this research were to be accepted then whatever the set of attributes that are precisely defined to correlate with being an aeronautical engineer at mit or being a chemist at berkeley are probably different in their standard deviations as well summers then concluded his discussion of the three hypotheses by saying so my best guess to provoke you of whats behind all of this is that the largest phenomenon by far is the general clash between peoples legitimate family desires and employers current desire for high power and high intensity that in the special case of science and engineering there are issues of intrinsic aptitude and particularly of the variability of aptitude and that those considerations are reinforced by what are in fact lesser factors involving socialization and continuing discrimination i would like nothing better than to be proved wrong because i would like nothing better than for these problems to be addressable simply by everybody understanding what they are and working very hard to address them summers then went on to discuss approaches to remedying the shortage of women in highend science and engineering positions this lunchtime talk drew accusations of sexism and careless scholarship and an intense negative response followed both nationally and at harvard summers apologized repeatedly nevertheless the controversy is speculated to have contributed to his resigning his position as president of harvard university the following year as well as costing summers the job of treasury secretary in obamas administration summerss protégée sheryl sandberg has defended him saying that larry has been a true advocate for women throughout his career at the world bank and treasury sandberg described of the lunch talk what few seem to note is that it is remarkable that he was giving the speech in the first place  that he cared enough about womens careers and their trajectory in the fields of math and science to proactively analyze the issues and talk about what was going wrong summerss opposition and support at harvardedit on march   members of the harvard faculty of arts and sciences which instructs graduate students in harvard graduate school of arts and sciences and undergraduates in harvard college passed – a motion of lack of confidence in the leadership of summers with  abstentions a second motion that offered a milder censure of the president passed  to  also with  abstentions the members of the harvard corporation the universitys highest governing body are in charge of the selection of the president and issued statements strongly supporting summers fas faculty were not unanimous in their comments on summers influential psychologist steven pinker defended the legitimacy of summerss january lecture when asked if summerss talk was within the pale of legitimate academic discourse pinker responded good grief shouldnt everything be within the pale of legitimate academic discourse as long as it is presented with some degree of rigor thats the difference between a university and a madrassa there is certainly enough evidence for the hypothesis to be taken seriously summers had stronger support among harvard college students than among the college faculty one poll by the harvard crimson indicated that students opposed his resignation by a threetoone margin with  of responding students opposing his resignation and  supporting it in july  a board member of harvard corporation conrad k harper resigned saying he was angered both by the university presidents comments about women and by summers being given a salary increase the resignation letter to the president said i could not and cannot support a raise in your salary  i believe that harvards best interests require your resignation support of economist andrei shleiferedit harvard and andrei shleifer a close friend and protégé of summers controversially paid  million to settle a lawsuit by the us government over the conflict of interest shleifer had while advising russias privatisation program the us government had sued shleifer under the false claims act as he bought russian stocks while designing the countrys privatisation in  a federal judge ruled that while harvard had violated the contract shleifer and his associate alone were liable for treble damages in june  harvard and shleifer announced that they had reached a tentative settlement with the us government in august harvard shleifer and the department of justice reached an agreement under which the university paid  million to settle the fiveyearold lawsuit shleifer was also responsible for paying  million worth of damages because harvard paid almost all of the damages and allowed shleifer to retain his faculty position the settlement provoked allegations of favoritism on summers his continued support for shleifer strengthened summerss unpopularity with other professors as reported in the harvard crimson ive been a member of this faculty for over  years and i am no longer easily shocked is how frederick h abernathy the mckay professor of mechanical engineering began his biting comments about the shleifer case at tuesdays fiery faculty meeting but abernathy continued i was deeply shocked and disappointed by the actions of this university in the shleifer affair in an word article how harvard lost russia in institutional investor by david mcclintick january  the magazine detailed shleifers alleged efforts to use his inside knowledge of and sway over the russian economy in order to make lucrative personal investments all while leading a harvard group advising the russian government that was under contract with the us the article suggests that summers shielded his fellow economist from disciplinary action by the university although it noted that summers had forewarned shleifer and his wife nancy zimmerman about the conflictofinterest regulations back in  summerss friendship with shleifer was well known by the corporation when it selected him to succeed rudenstine and summers recused himself from all proceedings with shleifer whose case was actually handled by an independent committee led by former harvard president derek bok resignation as harvard presidentedit on february   summers announced his intention to step down at the end of the school year effective june   harvard agreed to provide summers on his resignation with a oneyear paid sabbatical leave subsidized a  million outstanding loan from the university for his personal residence

barack obama as president in january  summers was appointed to the post of director of the national economic council in this position summers emerged as a key economic decisionmaker in the obama administration where he attracted both praise and criticism there had been friction between summers and former federal reserve chairman paul volcker as volcker accused summers of delaying the effort to organize a panel of outside economic advisers and summers had cut volcker out of white house meetings and had not shown interest in collaborating on policy solutions to the economic crisis on the other hand obama himself was reportedly thrilled with the work summers did in his first few weeks on the job and peter orszag another top economic advisor called summers one of the worlds most brilliant economists according to henry kissinger larry summers should be given a white house post in which he was charged with shooting down or fixing bad ideas  in january  as the obama administration tried to pass an economic stimulus spending bill representative peter defazio dor criticized summers saying that he thought that president barack obama is illadvised by larry summers larry summers hates infrastructure defazio along with liberal economists including paul krugman and joseph stiglitz had argued that more of the stimulus should be spent on infrastructure while summers had supported tax cuts in late  summers and economic advisors for thenpresidentelect obama presented a memo with options for an economic stimulus package ranging from  billion to  billion according to the new republic economic advisor christina romer initially recommended a trillion package which proposal summers quickly rejected believing any stimulus approaching  trillion would not pass through
