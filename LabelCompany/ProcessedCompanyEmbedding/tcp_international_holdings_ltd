incandescent will give you a rough estimate of just how well it will light a room as a very ballpark figure for led wattages  or  the incandescent wattage value is usually close to what you need lumens  lumens directly measure just how much light the bulb gives out in total on average a watt incandescent shines at  lumens with roughly  lumens of difference above or below the variance depends on manufacturer and age of the lamp leds are directly rated for their max lumen rating and last much longer without dimming of the bulb color temperature  your guide to how the light itself will look

competition from a variety of wellestablished and emerging lighting companies we believe that our competitors mainly operate under two distinct business models with some manufacturing bulbs inhouse and others purchasing bulbs through joint ventures or from original equipment manufacturers or oems for resale under their own brand we compete with companies that employ both of these models including traditional lighting manufacturers and distributors that source and sell finished products we believe that the key competitive factors in the electric light bulb market include o portfolio of products and product quality o price and cost competitiveness o access to distribution channels globally o customer orientation and strong customer relationships and o product development and speed to market we compete against a different set of companies in each of the technologies that we produce in the cfl market our primary competitors include feit electric general electric megaman philips sylvania and westinghouse lighting in addition to several smaller cfl manufacturers in our led product line we primarily compete with cree general electric lg electronics lighting science group msi philips samsung sharp sylvania and several smaller led bulb providers many of which are new entrants in the market in the last few years in the fixture market we mainly compete with acuity brands cooper industries havells india howard power solutions hubbell and philips some of our competitors are larger than we are with greater resources to devote to rd manufacturing and marketing as well as greater brand name recognition and channel access some of our more diversified competitors can also compete more aggressively with us by subsidizing losses in their led lighting businesses with profits from other lines of business moreover if one or more of our competitors or suppliers were to merge or otherwise consolidate with one another the change in the competitive landscape could materially and adversely affect our customer channel or supplier relationships and as a result our competitive position in addition any loss of a key channel partner whether to a competitor or otherwise could materially and adversely affect our competitive position we primarily compete based on the numerous benefits of cfl and led lighting and our strategy of offering a complete product portfolio that provides access to all emerging energy efficient socketbased lamp technology alternatives we believe our breadth of product offerings provides us with flexibility regardless of which lighting technology becomes most accepted we believe we also outperform our competitors in energy efficient lighting products with our customer service and operational supply performance our channel relationships technology and understanding of the industry enable us to compete favorably against our competitors company description we are a leading producer and provider of energy efficient light bulbs to the global structures light bulb market our primary products include socketbased compact fluorescent lamps or cfls light emitting diodes or leds and halogen bulbs we were the number one provider of cfls in the united states in  with a  market share according to the national equipment manufacturers association or nema we have a strong distribution footprint and reputation among retailers and commercial lighting distributors and sell our products through more than  retail and commercial  industrial or ci outlets since we manufacture only energy efficient light bulbs and not conventional incandescent bulbs we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the phase out of inefficient bulbs taking place in many major markets around the world with more than  cfl stockkeeping units or skus we believe that we have the largest and one of the most technologically advanced cfl product offerings in the world we also sell a product line of more than  led skus and  halogen skus that address a majority of socketbased lighting applications since our inception we have focused on product innovation and research and development or rd we have approximately  engineers and technicians focused on delivering new products to market and improving our existing products we have developed several award winning products including our private label cfls that achieved the highest overall rating from consumer reports for a cfl product from  through  we have also developed award winning led bulbs including our par and par series led bulbs which were both ranked  out of  and  entries respectively in a recent study performed by the institute for electric efficiency in which they were compared to products from lighting science group philips samsung and sylvania among others as the global lighting market reduces its reliance on conventional incandescent light bulbs we believe that our broad portfolio of energy efficient lighting products creates a technologyneutral platform for growth enabling us to address the majority of global socketbased lighting applications regardless of which technologies gain market acceptance we currently sell our products to a diverse global customer base through our two primary channels the retail channel and the ci channel we also sell our products to retailers through utility and government incentive programs our key customers in the retail channel include the home depot to which we are the largest energy efficient bulb supplier in the united states as well as homebase and walmart which primarily sell our products under private label our key customers in the ci segment include consolidated electrical distributors or ced grainger hd supply regency and rexel we have also established a presence in asia europe and south america and seek to leverage our strong north american customer and distribution base to facilitate expansion in these attractive global markets we utilize a vertically integrated efficient and highly automated process to manufacture our cfl products for our led bulbs we develop our own design specifications and source components from world class suppliers and then we assemble and test the led bulbs inhouse we have four manufacturing facilities located in china where we have developed and currently utilize several advanced manufacturing techniques that we believe are proprietary we currently outsource production of halogen bulbs however we plan to bring this production inhouse as demand for these products grows unlike many of our competitors that outsource much or all of their product manufacturing we believe our vertically integrated manufacturing processes enable us to control substantially all phases of our product manufacturing and distribution allowing us to achieve
