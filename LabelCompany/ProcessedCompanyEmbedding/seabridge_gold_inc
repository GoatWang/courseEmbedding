seabridge gold inc is designed to provide its shareholders with exceptional leverage to a rising gold price from  through  when the gold price was lower seabridge acquired nine north american projects with substantial gold resources including courageous lake and ksm subsequent exploration by seabridge has significantly expanded its acquired gold resource base seabridge considers each of its common shares to represent an indirect ownership interest in its reserves and resources our aim is to increase the value of this ownership interest by growing reserves and resources faster than shares outstanding project acquisitions exploration and engineering programs are carefully designed and monitored to ensure that equity dilution required to fund these activities is more than offset by additional reserves and resources seabridge is pursuing three valueenhancing strategies first the company continues to search for gold projects in north america which would be accretive in terms of gold resources second seabridge funds exploration and engineering work considered likely to expand resources and upgrade them to reserves third seabridge sells or partners its projects when they reach

flowthrough common shares at share for aggregate gross proceeds of m  including overallotment  proceeds from the financings grant the company flexibility to proceed with ongoing exploration at the

owned ksm project and exploring the nearby iskut project for highergrade epithermal mineralization with deep porphyry potential  given that it is relatively uncommon to find a fully preserved system from porphyry to lithocap we will be eagerly watching to see how the quartz rise target will play out jeffrey briggs singular research  seabridge gold inc has made advances on several fronts over the past few months including a resource expansion at its flagship ksm project the company has also recently acquired a new project the snowstorm project with high upside and minimal dilution for shareholders we are maintaining our buy rating tony lesiak canaccord genuity  we continue to believe that seabridge gold incs owned ksm project will find a development partner  while a development partner for ksm remains the key rerating catalyst for the companys shares in our view we also highlight seabridges exceptional historical leverage to the gold price and the improving exploration potential gary baschuk peartree securities  seabridge gold inc announced an update to the inferred mineral resources on the deep kerr deposit at the owned kerr sulphurets mitchell ksm project in

british columbia deep kerr is one of the three ore bodies kerr sulphurets and mitchell that make up the ksm project and is of relatively higher grade  the ksm project provides attractive optionality and is one of the few fully permitted largescale projects in a stable jurisdiction cantor fitzgerald  we favor highquality geopolitically stable goldsilver developers and smaller tier operators capable of demonstrating output growth in the sweet spot of the production curve our preferred equities include seabridge gold inc which we rate a speculative buy mike kozak cantor fitzgerald  to call seabridge gold inc�s owned ksm aucu project massive is an understatement in terms of proven and probable gold and copper reserves ksm ranks as the largest undeveloped mining project globally  the sheer sizescale of ksm  mmoz aueqyr over a minelife of  years makes it a truly unique soughtafter asset and one that is highly likely to attract a number of potential toptier jv partners that will help fund the initial capex hurdle  we are initiating coverage of seabridge with a speculative buy recommendation don maclean paradigm capital  we believe seabridge provides investors with ownership in one of the most strategically compelling and prolific copper‐gold projects in the world the ksm project in bc at one of the lowest market caps per ounce to the investor  a new pea released on oct  outlines further gamechanging improvements  the pea shows better economics  steady improvements as encapsulated in the pea are hastening the day when a senior miner or partnership will seek to buy ksm  longterm minded investors with a positive view for the price of gold and copper might consider owning sea now tony lesiak canaccord genuity  seabridge gold incs ksm will be of strategic interest to both a major gold miner and a diversified miner noting the increased copper bias higher grade copper in deep kerr a fully permitted project in a politically stable jurisdiction canada producing mozpa

seabridge gold incs flagship asset is the ksm project which hosts four large coppergold porphyry deposits with total reserves of  billion lbs of copper  million oz of gold and significant amount of silver and molybdenum byproducts  the importance of the ksm project lies in its significant scale one of the largest undeveloped coppergold deposits at grades that are comparable to currently producing large porphyry deposits around the world  we maintain sector perform rating but lowering target to was   our target is based on x our est navps  of was  tony lesiak canaccord genuity  seabridge gold inc announced the results of an updated pfs for its ksm project the project showcased an  aftertax irr at oz gold and lb copper the weaker cadusd  rate utilized almost completely offset higher capital parameters  and weaker gold  and copper  price assumptions  we note that the project is fully permitted is located in one of the worlds best mining jurisdictions and has longerterm optionality with a  year reserve life or year total resource life that is not recognized in irr or nav analysis raj ray national bank financial  we expect the results of the upcoming pea will include a positive updated resource estimate at seabridge gold incs ksm goldsilvercoppermolybdenum project  note that both the updated  pfs and initial  pfs vary from our assumptions considerably given the fact that neither pfs accounts for upside potential at deep kerr and iron cap lower zone  we assume  openpitunderground production with two openpit and three underground blockcave operations vs the

acquisition of snipgold which has a  interest in the  moz iskut project located in the golden triangle region of northwestern bc km from seas ksm project  overall we view the snip acquisition favorably given the large sq km highly prospective land package historic high grade hg profile gt au and potential synergies with ksm  the  program at snip is expected to step out on structures on the johnny mtn trend m  gt historic hole and delineate the source area for the multiounce boulders at mcfadden eric lemieux zzzzzpeartree securities  on april   seabridge gold inc announced an agreement to acquire snipgold corp a canadian exploration company focused on exploration in the golden triangle area of northwestern british columbia snipgolds primary asset iskut project is a contiguous block of ground in excess of km assembled since  seabridges ksm project has geological similarities to the iskut project host to the bronson slope porphyry deposit  the proposed transaction should enhance seas exploration potential in an area where its technical team has built up significant expertise gwen preston resource maven  seabridge gold inc is buying snipgold in a m deal aimed at sggs iskut property iskut is km northwest of seabridges ksm project which is adjacent to pretiums brucejack property the area is known as british columbias golden triangle  the potential to discover another valley of the kings or another deep kerr along this red line is what has attracted so many explorers to the golden triangle�and it is undoubtedly what compelled seabridge to acquire snipgold singular research  seabridge gold inc continues to make progress at ksm announcing a large increase to the mineral resource at deep kerr  we expect additional increases in mineral resource at deep kerr as it remains open in most directions  we are maintaining our buy rating and raising our price target of   seabridge announced a large increase in the inferred mineral resource at deep kerr adding  moz gold

speculative buy rating and have increased our target to c from the c target price matthew dilallo motley fool  higher gold prices are important for gold producers because they have so much leverage to
