elapsed time  minutes by focusing on our customers’ needs rather than our own we ensure we’re not wasting our time and resources developing a product that customers do not want ann arbor michigan prweb october   from blood to food to medicine cells are all around us however the current methods of separating those cells from their surroundings for research diagnostics and cell therapy—also known as cell sorting—can be timeconsuming costly and damaging to the cells to address this ann arborbased startup akadeum life sciences is developing a radically new product that uses bacs™ buoyancyactivated cell sorting to acquire target cells from biological samples by using tiny floating spheres called “microbubbles” and disposable microbubble collectors the microbubbles are introduced into biological samples and attach to target cells such as t cells b cells or cancer cells after just a few minutes the microbubbles gently float the target cells to the top of the sample allowing for their easy capture and removal in order to continue product development as well as increase sales and marketing efforts akadeum has secured a total of  million in investment investment in this round of financing was led by michigan elab and also includes detroit innovate invest michigan university of michigan mints and jeffrey schox a nationally renowned patent attorney series a financing is planned for  as a lean biotech startup akadeum credits its initial success to the fact that it has iteratively built its products to meet the needs of its users as part of its application discovery program akadeum works directly with customers to develop products that address their specific problems “what truly excited us at michigan elab was not only the disruptive nature akadeum’s bacs™ microbubble solution has on the market but the intense customer focus the founding team had including embracing lean startup methodologies typically found in software companies” said doug neal managing director of michigan elab and akadeum board member “not many biotech startups have active customers just  months after company formation we are excited about the opportunity for akadeum to rapidly grow the company’s approach to lean methodology ensures that its products solve customers’ problems and incorporate features they want most “actively listening to your customers is vital to the successful development of products that seek rapid adoption” said brandon mcnaughton ceo of akadeum life sciences “by focusing on our customers’ needs rather than our own we ensure we’re not wasting our time and resources developing a product that customers do not want” akadeum’s chief technology officer john younger further elaborated stating “rapidly refining product design based on customer response has greatly accelerated our understanding of the technology’s strengths and nearterm applications and professionally i’ve never experienced anything comparable to the tempo of this approach as customers continue to provide feedback we continue to improve our product development” as part of their continued growth akadeum has added two key team members principal scientist leo
