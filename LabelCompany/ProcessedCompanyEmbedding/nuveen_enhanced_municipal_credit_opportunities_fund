its taken a while but nuveen asset managements efforts to merge a bunch of its national closedend municipal bond funds into two large funds is nearing completion the consolidation which involves eight funds was approved by fund boards last august the first shareholder vote was last november but it took until early march before both sets of mergers were approved by the required number of shareholders in late march nuveen announced the dates the merging funds would be making their final distributions in early april and early may before being consolidated jim robinson portfolio manager of the robinson tax advantaged income robax a mutual fund made up of closedend muni funds is a fan of the two remaining nuveen funds they should benefit from better trading efficiency scale and the current discounts should narrow over time he says nuveen dividend advantage municipal income fund nvg and nuveen dividend advantage municipal fund  nzf both have  discounts currently  wider than the current average discount for closedend municipal bond funds “mergers historically have been a sticky solution to a chronic discount problem” says robinson he isnt surprised it took a while to round up the necessary number of votes from the funds shareholder base of individual investors also the mergers tweak the characteristics of the acquiring funds a bit both have their investment mandates broadened to allow them to buy more lower rated bonds nvg also becomes entirely exempt from securities subject to the alternative minimum tax amt more details on the mergers are available in a qa on the nuveen website the mergers will also increase the total costs by a few basis points but not enough to outweigh the benefits says robinson to be folded into nzf which will be renamed nuveen
