construction business how many projects like mine have you completed who will be working on the project are the workers employees or subcontractors can you provide me with references who is your designer and what are his or her qualifications are your employees licensed and insured how do you charge and what does that include can you give me a written estimate what do your services include when can this job get done what happens when cost exceeds the budget what about changes to materials or labor pricing what will i need to provide are there any important considerations or concerns you
