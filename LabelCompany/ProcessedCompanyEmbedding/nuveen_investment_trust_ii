fund solicited shareholders to approve  its reorganization and  the new subadvisory agreement each a �proposal� after the joint proxy statementprospectus was mailed nuveen fund advisors and the funds actively solicited votes through direct mailings and the use of an experienced and wellrespected proxy solicitor in an effort to achieve a quorum for each fund as of november   an overwhelming majority of the votes received by the funds� shareholders were cast in favor of both proposals nuveen fund advisors however believed that despite all the efforts made there was a high probability that neither fund would receive the number of votes necessary to reach a quorum by the expiration date accordingly as of november   you requested assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action against nwq under section a of the  act if nwq continued to serve as subadviser to the funds for the additional period as described below pursuant to written investment subadvisory agreements that had not been approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the funds analysis section a of the  act states in relevant part that it shall be unlawful for a person to serve as an investment adviser of a registered investment company except pursuant to a written contract that among other things has been approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of such registered investment company section a was adopted to give fund shareholders a voice in approving fund investment advisory contracts and to prevent trafficking in fund advisory contracts rule a under the  act provides a temporary exemption from the shareholder approval requirement in section a where among other circumstances the registered investment company�s board of directors has terminated the previous advisory contract the rule permits a person to act as an investment adviser to a registered investment company under an interim advisory agreement without the required shareholder approval for a period no greater than  days following the date on which the previous contract terminated subject to the requirements set forth in the rule rule a was designed to prevent registered investment companies from being harmed by losing investment advisory services before shareholders can approve a new investment advisory contract you proposed to have nwq continue to serve as investment subadviser to each fund for an additional period of time following the interim period allowed by rule a but not to exceed the earliest of i the consummation of the reorganization ii shareholder approval of the fund�s new subadvisory agreement or iii  days after the expiration date the �additional period� nuveen fund advisors and the trusts believed that extending the term of the interim subadvisory agreements was in the best interests of the funds and the board approved such extension without such an extension you argue that it may have been necessary to liquidate the funds as conditions to the requested relief the funds and nuveen fund advisors agreed to the following during the additional period nuveen fund advisors and the funds with the assistance of their proxy solicitor would continue their proxy solicitation efforts to seek to reach a quorum nuveen fund advisors would bear all postage printing tabulation and proxy solicitation costs during the additional period nuveen fund advisors would waive the portion of each fund�s investment advisory fee in an amount equal to the amount of the subadvisory fee that would have been payable by nuveen fund advisors to nwq under the original terms of the interim subadvisory agreement other than changes to reflect the relief granted the terms and conditions of the interim subadvisory agreements would remain the same conclusion on the basis of the facts and representations set forth in your letter we would not recommend enforcement action to the commission against nwq under section a of the  act for continuing to serve as investment adviser to each fund for the additional period pursuant to written investment subadvisory agreements that were not approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the fund this response expresses our views on enforcement action only and does not express any legal conclusions on the questions presented because our position is based on the facts and representations in your letter you should note that any different facts or representations may require a different conclusion jill ehrlich senior counsel  this letter confirms oral noaction relief that the staff provided to deborah bielicke eades esq of vedderprice pc on november    nuveen fund advisors� investment advisory agreements with the funds comply in all respects with section a of the  act including having been approved by a vote of a majority of the funds� outstanding voting securities  nuveen fund advisors and nwq serve as the investment adviser and investment subadviser respectively of nuveen nwq global equity income fund  in particular you state that several factors likely contributed to the failure to reach a quorum including  the level of redemptions since the record date for the shareholder meeting  a higher than typical percentage of each fund�s shares represented by objecting beneficial owners as of the record date and  each fund�s shareholder base was more dispersed than is typical  section a applies to investment advisers as defined in section aa and b of the  act which includes both primary advisers and subadvisers  see

when it buys and sells securities or turns over its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a

risk the market values of securities owned by the fund may decline at times sharply and unpredictably this risk is generally greater for lower market capitalization companies because they tend to have more limited product lines markets and financial resources and may be dependent on a smaller management group than larger more established companies nonus riskemerging markets risk nonus risk is the risk that securities of nonus companies or us companies with significant nonus operations may be subject to additional risks than securities of companies that principally operate in the united states as a result of among other things political social and economic developments abroad and different legal regulatory and tax environments these additional risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in or with significant operations in emerging market countries currency risk changes in currency exchange rates may affect the funds net asset value the value of dividends and interest earned and gains and losses realized on the sale of securities as with any mutual fund investment loss of money is a risk of investing fund performance the following bar chart and table

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
