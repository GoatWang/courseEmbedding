have failed to maintain focus on their vision for these products in favor of focusing on selling the company which theyve done  times in two years now with the unfortunate result of significant reductions in core revenue around their supposed flagship products the emts response to poor performance has been typical for the bisch regime which is to reduce cost read lay off personnel even this

kofax fulltime more than a yearprosi havent noticed any pros as we transition to kofax from perceptive software it appears to be just an average company that focuses on the bottom line and not employee moral or motivationconsthe ceo is very conceited to quote him when asked if he was worried about a new private equity firm removing the elt we are the most valuable aspect of the company previously with perceptive the employees were considered one of the most valuable aspects of the company there will be a lot of negativity primarily because we went from a great and fun place to work to just some average company there is a high rate of turnover some of the sectors are going to struggle specifically with healthcare the hc sales teams have been depleted and growth will probably come to a halt and take several years to recoveradvice to managementfocus on retaining the talent we have focus on attracting great talent we take some great benefits such a unlimited vacation these are the types of things that will get you the best talent these are the types of things that will get you growth its important to focus on the bottom line but you have to realize that items such as unlimited vacation really dont cost you on the bottom linepolish your message to employees dont invite them to leave the only vision ive seen is layoffs and more work for the remaining staff dont tell the employees their new benefit packages have some improvements but cant seem to give any examples of those improvements understand that the negativity derives from a talented and productive group

have been working at kofax fulltime more than  yearsprosive been employed at kofax for  years and no im not a rose colored glasses recruiter with an agenda but i do feel inclined to set the record straight a bit after seeing some one sided posts if you want to see a tight and well run company then id say kofax is an interesting case study and its given me a path for career growth and maturity along the way that will help me perform well and see through the useless and wasteful practices some other companys employ elsewhere what i like most about kofax is the people i work with there are some solid down to earth people that dwell in the trenches every day and find satisfaction in what they do and dont let other adolescent naysayers weigh them down which exist probably at every company to some extent wasnt high school like  years go peopleconsmanagement can sometimes be misunderstood primarily by employees less familiar and newer to kofax business practices that have become comfortable in less ambitious companies they worked for in the past and dont want to change or are used to doing things that dont make sound business sense those that are at the nerve center of the company get it though and others sometimes dont understand that management is ambitious and aggressive but generally has a good reason for doing what they are doing though sometimes not good at helping others understand their reasons is probably primary fault could improve on the company is not perfect and mistakes have been made along the way but im encouraged by recent course correction and direction that management is taking to retain talent if you like to hide in an overly bloated department of people that creates busywork fluff to do everyday rather than adding real business value than kofax is probably not the place for you youll get discovered eventually though sometimes it takes longer than it shouldadvice to managementget out from under the current headwinds and put laser focus on on building what is a broad portfolio of products with lots of opportunity for continued growth dust off the vision and direction a bit and built a trajectory from a strong foundation that has been built out of all those years of driving strong shareholder value as a publicly traded company that was under the microscope and naturally became an interesting acquisition target to lexmark

recommendnegative outlookdisapproves of ceoi worked at kofax fulltime more than a yearprosprevious fat client generations of kofax capture and extraction were market leaders and are still available for sale those earlier versions kofax analytics and kofax robotic process automation keep the lights on for kofax today even thought they are siloed and nonintegrated offerings sales salaries are generally a little higher here than at other mid sized software companiesconsthe company is for sale again reynolds bish ceo manipulates the companys direction to leverage himself into more and more stock while doing nothing to grow revenues he personally maintains a significant shareholder position and so that every time he sells the failing but entrenched company he makes millions b lexmark foolishly over leveraged themselves to buy kofax for b in  and bish saw his opportunity by blocking all investment in sw innovation and integration with lexmark to force his parent to sell lexmark to a chinese consortium apexpag in late  in the process riffed over  while making himself millions in this latest sale and it gets worse for the employees that remain because cfius the committee on foreign investment in the us has forced the chinese to divest itself of the sw entity so kofax is for sale again setting bish up for another big stock take this is the stuff you read about high finance where the rich get richer by taking advantage of employees my team lost all but the smallest additional capacity deals they were working on because of the kofax revolving ownership problems and the uncertainty associated with the next sale of the company by the chinesethe flagship product total agility doesnt work when kofax moved from a their earlier fat client architecture to thin client as the market demands the product stopped working at scale one of the nations largest insurance companies at least  of the largest global financial companies and the largest us gaming and resort company are all suing kofax for breach of contract due to product failure while they advertise that they do they have no saas solution this because bish gets to recognize saas revenues ratably over time where perpetual licenses pay bish upfront  if you do sell a saas deal expect the company to take the business but dont expect to be paid commissionsexpect to have even perpetual commissions witheld andor refused bish regularly manipulates and changes territories and accounts to limit the commissions that he has to pay especially when it comes to big deals if that territory manipulation doesnt work he will simply refuse to pay commissions my team and i sold the largest two deals in the companys history and i had to beg to get paid on the first and was paid less than half of the commissions owed on the second if youre a true salesperson you will be frustrated to no end here if youre a bc player and you can live on your salary this could be the place for you you will have to endure lots of beatings and grilling around your sales cycles while getting no value from the managers who do it but if you can live on your salary you can work here forever  they cant fire you because they cant replace you i tried for  years to build a full team but saw almost no resumes from recruiting kofax also advertises mobile functionality but has  sales peopleoverlays for the entire us and is simply selling capture and extraction in their sdk which doesnt work well and leaves integration to back end systems to their customersadvice to managementuntil bish is out of the picture this company is going nowhere everyone is simply lining bishs pockets and setting him up for his next big sale of the company get a new ceo and new sr sales managment develop a true saas offering the technology is perfect for it and the market wants it learn to leverage your existing renewal base fix total agility the thin client version of their leading capture and extraction technologyshare on
