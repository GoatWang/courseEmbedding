companies the fact that old national bancorp—at  years indiana’s oldest financial institution—will survive to see its th birthday is largely attributable to the oldfashioned fiscal conservatism personified by its cfo christopher a wolking   photo courtesy old national bancorp founded in evansville in  the company is the largest financial institution headquartered in indiana with total assets of approximately  billion in addition to retail and commercial banking old national provides investment wealth management and cash management services and owns one of the state’s largest independent insurance agencies while other financial entities selfdestructed after making questionable bets during the good times old national avoided disaster by passing on the riskier stuff most tellingly the company has no subprime mortgage exposure this allowed it not just to survive during tough times but thrive   “old national confronted the difficult operating environment and we’ve managed to exceed analysts’ earnings expectations every quarter this year” wolking said “we’ve done this by reducing expenses managing to stay ahead of the shifting regulatory environment and continuing to make good lending decisions” not that the turbulence of the last few years didn’t deal old national some bumps—including a dustup with the tarp program in late  the company was asked by the department of the treasury to participate in the capital purchase program for strong healthy banks the bank signed on only to see the scheme which is under the tarp umbrella painted in an increasingly negative manner so the company under wolking’s guidance became one of the first four banks to repay the funds and exit the program he also worked with an outside firm to develop a selfadministered “stress test” that the company easily passed moving from challenge to challenge he was then asked to help secure fresh capital for the company—during a time when ready cash was roughly as easy to obtain as a zerodown home mortgage nevertheless he helped draw  million in fresh funds to the bank’s coffers wolking who took over the cfo position in january  was a key member of the old national team that in  partnered with citizens financial group to acquire the indiana charter one franchise giving the bank the thirdlargest branch network in indiana he also spearheaded the integration of several insurance entities into one division the indianapolisbased old national insurance and developed a more detailed budgeting process for banking centers improving forecasts and goal setting more from ibj click here to return to the cfo of the year landing page he watches the government’s actions closely because the fortunes of his employer could depend on it “the financial services industry is experiencing the most sweeping change in its regulatory environment that i have seen in my  years in the business” wolking said “the associated costs of complying with new regulations compounded with restrictions on fees a slow economy and pressure on capital will have significant ramifications for community banking over the next several years” though wolking still harbors a bit of a bunker mentality he does foresee a day when it will be safe to sound the allclear and walk around outside again “the economy will recover slowly but i’m certain it will recover” he said “this is america after all and we’re pretty good at adapting and overcoming challenges i’d expect shortterm rates to begin to rise late in  or early  i am very concerned about inflation once the economy begins to recover i hope the fed is vigilant and nimble and i’d like to see brakes put to the current fiscal stimulus”• email tweet advertisement recent articles by sam stall entrepreneur a master of ‘creative renovation’ king ribs keeps it in
