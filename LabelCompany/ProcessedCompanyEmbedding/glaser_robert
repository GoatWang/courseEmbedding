robert glaser a cognitive psychologist who helped define the terms of the national debate over student testing and who pioneered ways of measuring not only how students learn but how teachers teach died on feb  in pittsburgh he was the cause was complications of alzheimer’s disease said a spokesman for the university of pittsburgh learning research and development center which dr glaser helped found in dr glaser was probably best known for promoting a kind of standardized test that became the norm for the federal government’s national assessment of educational progress the statebystate evaluation commonly known as the nation’s report cardthe method which he did not invent but championed and coined as “criterionreferenced testing” measured not just what students knew but how well they were learning rather than measuring students in comparison with one another as iq and other traditional standardized tests do “criterion” tests were mainly designed to compare students’ results with their own previous test results while not obviously different from traditional tests like the sats — which the report card used at first — dr glaser argued successfully that criterion tests were the more nimble tool for helping teachers adjust lessons to their students’ needs advertisement continue reading the main story it became the standard testing system for the periodic “report cards” exams in math reading history and science given to th th and th graders throughout the country continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story dr glaser was equally resolute though less successful in warning about the limits of testingin  when the department of education asked the national academy of education to critique the report card system dr glaser was named chairman of the academy’s review panel in a report that called test results “fallible and partial indicators of academic achievement” the panel warned educators to avoid letting them become “the major goals of schooling”diane ravitch a policy analyst and historian of education who quoted dr glaser’s report in her  book “the death and life of the great american school system how testing and choice are undermining education” described dr glaser as one of his generation’s most respected and farsighted experts on testing“no one understood testing as well as bob glaser did and what he said in  was prescient” she said in an interview referring to an increase in standardized testing under the federal no child left behind law she added “i don’t think he would like what’s happening today”colleagues and family said dr glaser had had alzheimer’s disease for many years and was unable to give his opinion on current trends in standardized testing but his views about the science of education they said changed the field and influenced the work of three generations of researchers photo robert glaser credit university of pittsburgh “he was one of the first to use testing to measure how we should be teaching not just to sort” high and low achievers said lauren b resnick a psychology professor and former head of the learning research center that dr glaser helped founddr glaser focused on the process by which people learn how do people evolve from novices to experts in their fields whether as physicists or cabdrivers what are low achievers missing when they read or hear someone talk what could help them to get itin the universe of cognitive science dr glaser was known for encouraging his students and other researchers to develop what he called “a unified theory of learning” — one that would measure student teacher and curriculum then use the findings to make each of them better newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot

of his  published articles drawing on an educational theory at least as old as the sayings of confucius he added “learning is driven by failure” advertisement continue reading the main story robert glaser was born on jan   in providence ri and grew up in the bronx one of two children of abe and rose glaser his father a successful furrier during robert’s early life suffered business reversals when robert was a student at new york university abe glaser became a traveling salesman and robert enrolled at city collegein the army during world war ii he helped conduct psychological testing on trainees for bomber crews he and his wife sylvia met as graduate students at indiana university where both studied under the celebrated behavioral psychologist b f skinner who became a professor at harvard mr glaser received his phd in psychology at indiana and in  became an associate professor at the university of pittsburgh where he remained for the rest of his careerhis survivors include two daughters karen glaser and ellen debenedetti two grandchildren a greatgrandchild and a sister irma kemp dr glaser’s wife died in dr glaser was initially a disciple of professor skinner’s embracing the view that learning is a process of behavior modification that is not fundamentally different from teaching rats to press a lever to score food pelletsbut dr glaser developed his own learning theories and a broader view of the mission of education dr ravitch said he articulated them in the  report for the national academy of education which she called “vintage glaser”the report said the goal of education should be not only informational but also “aesthetic and moral” it should aim to equip people with “resilience and courage in the face of stress a sense of craft in our work a commitment to justice and caring in our social relationships a dedication to advancing the public good”the most sophisticated standardized test it concluded would find those cognitive skills “extremely difficult to assess” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think whats next loading go to home page » site index the new york times robert w glaser chief
