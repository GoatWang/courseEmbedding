fixed income securities carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible lowerquality debt securities generally offer higher yields but also involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss before investing consider the funds investment objectives risks charges and
