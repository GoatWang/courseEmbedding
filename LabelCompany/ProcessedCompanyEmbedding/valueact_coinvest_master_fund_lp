daily april   justice department challenges funds’ unreported purchase of halliburton baker hughes shares by jeffrey may jd recent acquisitions by two valueact investment funds of over  billion of voting securities of potential merger partners halliburton company and baker hughes inc violated the reporting and waiting period requirements of the hartscottrodino hsr antitrust improvements act of  according to a complaint filed today by the department of justice antitrust division in the federal district court in san francisco the government contends that the acquisitions of shares were not exempt from hsr filing requirements under a limited investmentonly exemption the suit seeks civil penalties of at least  million and an injunction against further hsr act violations us v va partners i llc case no cv according to the governments complaint valueact promotes itself as having a strategy of “active constructive involvement” in the management of the companies in which it invests the justice departments complaint names va partners i llc valueact capital master fund lp and valueact coinvestment international lp after halliburton and baker hughes—two of the worlds largest providers of oilfield products and services in the world—announced in  their intent to merge valueact began acquiring significant holdings of the two companies it was alleged as a result valueact purportedly became one of the largest shareholders of both companies company documents show that valueact’s most senior executives planned from the outset to play an active role at halliburton and baker hughes the government claimed valueact apparently intended to push management of both companies to complete the merger which is still under review regardless of how the merger process unfolded valueact intended to influence the business decisions of both companies in the government’s view antitrust chief’s reaction “valueact’s substantial stock purchases made it one of the largest shareholders of two competitors in the midst of our antitrust review of the companies’ proposed merger and valueact used its position to influence decisionmaking at both companies” said bill baer assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division in announcing the complaint “valueact was not entitled to avoid hsr requirements by claiming to be a passive investor given the seriousness of the violation and valueact’s prior hsr violations we will be seeking significant civil penalties and an injunction against further violations” prior hsr filing issues valueact funds previously have violated the hsr act by acquiring voting securities without making the required hsr notifications the government alleges in  the federal district court in washington dc approved a consent decree  trade cases ¶ resolving hsr allegations concerning three acquisitions made in  that action followed corrective filings in  regarding three other acquisitions of voting securities generally the government excuses

of the largest providers of oilfield products and services in the world on november   halliburton and baker hughes announced their intent to merge their proposed merger is the subject of an ongoing antitrust review in the united states and several other countries  valueact began acquiring significant holdings of the two companies on the heels of the halliburtonbaker hughes merger announcement from the beginning valueact anticipated influencing the business decisions of the companies as the merger process unfolded valueact sent memoranda to its investors outlining this strategy and explaining that purchasing a stake in each of these firms would allow it to “be a strong advocate for the deal to close” which would in turn “increase probability of deal happening” if the deal encountered “regulatory issues” valueact “would be well positioned as an owner of both companies to help develop the new terms” valueact executives also discussed internally a backup plan to “sell at least some of bakers pieces” if the deal were blocked or abandoned  valueacts purchases of halliburton and baker hughes shares did not qualify for the narrow exemption from the requirements of the hsr act for acquisitions made solely for the purpose of investment valueact planned from the outset to take steps to influence the business decisions of both companies and met frequently with executives of both companies to execute those plans  these hsr act violations allowed valueact to become one of the largest shareholders of both halliburton and baker hughes without providing the government its statutory right to notice and prior review of the stock purchases valueact established these positions as halliburton and baker hughes were being investigated for agreeing to a merger that threatens to substantially lessen competition in numerous markets valueact intended to use its position as a major shareholder of these companies to obtain access to management to learn information about the merger and the companies strategies in private conversations with senior executives to influence those executives to improve the chances that the merger would be completed and to influence other business decisions whether or not the merger went forward  the court should assess a civil penalty of at least  million to address valueacts violations of the hsr act and should restrain valueact from further violations ii jurisdiction and venue  this complaint is filed and these proceedings are instituted under section a of the clayton act  usc a added by title ii of the hsr act to recover civil penalties and equitable relief for violations of that section  this court has jurisdiction over the defendants and over the subject matter of this action pursuant to section ag of the clayton act  usc ag and pursuant to  usc  a  and  each of the defendants is engaged in commerce or in activities affecting commerce within the meaning of section  of the clayton act  usc  and section aa of the clayton act  usc aa  venue is properly based in this district under section  of the clayton act  usc  and under  usc b c each of the defendants transacts or has transacted business in this district and has its principal place of business here iii intradistrict assignment  assignment to the san francisco division is proper because this action arose primarily in san francisco county many of the events that gave rise to the claims occurred in san francisco and defendants headquarters and principal places of business were during the relevant events and continue to be located in san francisco iv the defendants  this case arises from acquisitions of stock over several months by two investment funds—valueact master capital fund lp “master fund” and valueact coinvest international lp “coinvest fund” though separate entities for purposes of the hsr act both funds have the same general partner—va partners i llc “va partners” master fund and coinvest fund are organized under the laws of the british virgin islands and va partners is organized under the laws of delaware master fund coinvest fund and va partners collectively “valueact” or “defendants” all have the same principal office and place of business in san francisco california  valueact is well known as an activist investor in contrast to other large funds that focus on passive investment strategies to generate returns valueacts web site explains that it pursues a strategy of “active constructive involvement” in the management of the companies in which it invests the web site further states “the goal in each investment is to work constructively with management andor the companys board to implement a strategy or strategies that maximize returns for all shareholders”  valueact tracks its “activism” in these investments by various metrics such as success in changing executive compensation and touts these statistics in its presentations to potential investors as illustrated by the following slide from valueacts june  presentation start printed page   in presentations valueact has explained that it likes “disciplined oligopolies” and looks to invest in businesses in “oligopolistic markets high barrierstoentry”  valueact funds have previously violated the hsr act by acquiring voting securities without making the required notifications in  valueact capital partners lp filed corrective notifications for three prior acquisitions of voting securities valueact outlined steps it would take to ensure future compliance with the hsr act no enforcement action was taken at that time master fund then failed to make required filings with respect to three acquisitions that it made in  valueact agreed to pay a  million civil penalty to settle an hsr act enforcement action based on these violations v background a the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act  the hsr act requires parties to file a notification with the federal trade commission and the department of justice and to observe a waiting period before consummating acquisitions of voting securities or assets that exceed certain value thresholds these requirements give the antitrust enforcement agencies prior notice of and information about proposed transactions the waiting period also provides the antitrust enforcement agencies with an opportunity to investigate and to seek an injunction to prevent the consummation of anticompetitive transactions  the hsr act contains certain limited exemptions to the notification and waiting period requirements the acquirer of voting securities has the burden of showing eligibility for an exemption one such exemption applies narrowly to acquisitions made “solely for the purpose of investment” if the voting securities held do not exceed ten percent of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer  usc ac the regulations implementing the act explain that to qualify for this exemption the acquiring party must have “no intention of participating in the formulation determination or direction of the basic business decisions of the issuer”  cfr i b valueacts initial investment decision and strategy  after halliburton and baker hughes announced their intent to merge on november   valueact began purchasing stock in each company through its master fund and coinvest fund valueact continued to make purchases in both companies for several months eventually acquiring over  billion in securities of the two companies combined  as valueact was acquiring stock in these two companies in december  and early january  its executives were developing strategies to use valueacts ownership position to influence management of each firm as necessary to increase the probability of the deal being completed valueacts master fund crossed the applicable hsr act reporting thresholds for baker hughes and halliburton on december  and december   respectively and master fund continued to build up its position as its executives discussed strategy these discussions culminated in the drafting of memoranda that valueact sent to its investors on january   these memoranda—one about baker hughes and one about halliburton—explained valueacts decision to acquire stakes in these competitors through its master fund and offered investors the opportunity to increase their stakes in these firms through additional share purchases by valueacts coinvest fund  these memoranda and other contemporaneous documents show that valueacts most senior executives planned from the outset to play an active role at halliburton and baker hughes the lead valueact partner responsible for the baker hughes investment internally circulated a draft of an investor memorandum explaining that “our activist approach limits our downside in the unlikely case that the merger does not close” the draft further noted that if the merger were not completed valueact “would likely seek to take a more active role in overseeing the company” valueacts ceo then start printed page requested an insertion into the memorandum highlighting that valueacts “active role” is an additional reason to invest in both companies  although the memoranda ultimately shared with investors watered down the words used to describe valueacts activist strategy they still emphasized that purchasing a stake in halliburton and baker hughes would “increase probability of deal happening” and would allow valueact to be “a strong advocate for the deal to close” valueact identified this as one of three “key considerations” supporting its investment decision a contemporaneous email among valueact partners remarked that if halliburtons shareholders threatened to vote against the deal valueacts “position in hal should be meaningful enough to have a substantial role in those conversations”  valueact also intended to help restructure the merger if it hit roadblocks on december   valueacts ceo emailed his partners “if we own both we can drive new terms to get the deal done if weird expletive is happening” valueact also expressed this view in its memos to investors “in the event of further fundamental dislocation or regulatory issues it is possible the deal would need to be restructured and we believe valueact capital would be well positioned as an owner of both companies to help develop the new terms”  in a december  internal email a valueact partner observed that “if the deal failed the backup plan would seem to be to sell at least some of bakers pieces and we think that we could get up to x ebitda for just  of bhis businesses—artificial lift and chemicals” valueacts memoranda to investors noted “recent transactions in each of those industries specialty chemicals and artificial lift suggest that these businesses are worth north of  times ebitda” moreover the baker hughes memorandum explained that there are “numerous levers for the company to pull to drive margin expansion” and identified baker hughess pressure pumping business as a good candidate for margin improvement  regardless of how the merger process unfolded valueact intended to influence the business decisions of both companies for example on december   the day master funds holdings in halliburton crossed the hsr act threshold a valueact partner wrote an email to valueacts ceo about halliburton “wonder if it would be possible to get the vrx valeant pharmaceuticals comp plan in from outside the board room” the ceo responded “yes good idea” valueact had recently convinced management to change the executive compensation plan at another of its investments valeant pharmaceuticals  valueact also intended to play a role in halliburtons efforts to integrate the two firms valueact told its investors that its stake in halliburton “helps to further enhance our relationship with management and the board of directors as they work to complete the merger and integrate the business into halliburtons existing operations” c valueacts efforts to influence the management of both companies  consistent with its investment strategy of “active constructive involvement” valueact established a direct line to senior management at both halliburton and baker hughes and met with them frequently from the time it started acquiring stock from december  through january  valueact met in person or had teleconferences more than fifteen times with senior management of halliburton or baker hughes including meeting multiple times with the ceos of both companies valueact partners also exchanged a number of emails with management at both firms about the merger and the companies respective operations  valueact reached out to baker hughes immediately after it began purchasing shares on december   the day master funds holdings crossed the hsr act threshold for baker hughes a valueact partner told a baker hughes executive that valueact was positive on the merger but also liked “that  of baker hughess revenue comes from noncapital intensive business lines which could command a big multiple if sold” a few days later valueacts ceo met in person with the cfo of baker hughes according to baker hughess notes of the meeting valueacts ceo “highlighted that it was critical that bhi continued focused sic on many of these improvement opportunities despite the acquisition he specifically emphasized with graphs the largest gapopportunities he saw” with respect to the gap in baker hughess north american margins valueacts ceo stated “looking to learn with bhi on how to close that gap sic” valueacts ceo also discussed other areas “that he thought bhi should continue to focus on as there was a lot of improvement opportunity” according to the notes the meeting ended with valueacts ceo “stating that they would remain in contact and sharing that they plan to be large shareholders of bhi”  on january   valueact filed a beneficial ownership report schedule d with the securities and exchange commission publicly disclosing its substantial stake in baker hughes and reporting that it might discuss “competitive and strategic matters” with baker hughes management and might “propose changes in baker hughess operations” before submitting the schedule d valueacts ceo notified halliburtons ceo of the impending filing on baker hughes explaining that the filing “gives us the flexibility to engage with the company baker hughes on all issues” later the same day valueacts ceo emailed halliburtons ceo a copy of its investment memoranda for both halliburton and baker hughes  by february after valueact had completed its outreach to investors seeking capital for additional share purchases valueact began acquiring stock in halliburton and baker hughes through coinvest fund on march   coinvest funds holdings in halliburton crossed the applicable hsr act reporting threshold  also in early march valueact contacted halliburton to offer assistance in advance of the shareholder vote on the merger valueact offered halliburton “to speak with any of halliburtons top shareholders about valueacts view of the merger prior to the vote” halliburton responded that it would let valueact know if valueacts help became necessary  in may  valueact further engaged with halliburton on the companys plans for postmerger integration on may  valueact met with halliburtons ceo to discuss actions that halliburton could take in an attempt to achieve its target merger synergies on may  a valueact partner called halliburtons chief integration officer to recommend a firm for real estate integration services in a subsequent email exchange another valueact partner emphasized the need to engage on these issues at the executive level and stated that halliburtons plan was “a traditional approach likely to leave value on the table” instead the partner identified alternative ways the real estate firm could work with halliburton to help achieve the synergy goals  valueact also followed through on its idea for changing halliburtons executive compensation plan on july   valueact contacted halliburtons ceo to schedule a meeting to discuss executive compensation at start printed page the meeting which ultimately occurred in september valueact delivered a thirtyfivepage presentation detailing valueacts preferred approach commenting on halliburtons current plan and proposing specific changes d consistent with its initial plans valueact worked to restructure the merger or to sell parts of baker hughes  valueact carefully monitored the status of the antitrust review process and intended to intervene with the management of each firm as necessary to increase the probability of the deal being completed valueact met with baker hughess ceo in may  and according to valueacts notes of that meeting baker hughess ceo “seemed pretty worried about antitrust and implied odds deal goes through  or lower in his mind” valueact then continued to push management of both companies to preserve the deal or if these efforts failed to sell off pieces of baker hughes  on august   valueact met with baker hughess ceo “to plant the seed to seek alternative options with other buyers if the deal falls through” in its initial investment analysis the valueact partners had discussed selling individual baker hughes businesses as a backup plan if the merger failed valueact presented an updated analysis to argue this case to baker hughes valueact also proposed restructuring the deal with halliburton suggesting that baker hughes should sell its pressure pumping artificial lift and specialty chemical businesses to halliburton at a premium in lieu of receiving the merger termination fee  according to valueact notes from the meeting baker hughess ceo was “very committed to running bhi standalone if the deal fails and did not seem to entertain the idea of shopping the business piecemeal to other buyers” the notes explain that valueact agreed that the baker hughes ceos plan to “focus on technologybased product lines and grow the business organically in these areas seems like the right areas to focus for the standalone company” but this plan was not what the valueact executives hoped for “the problem is that this story seems like a  year period with the stock not generating a great return over that period” according to baker hughess notes of the meeting the valueact executives registered disappointment with baker hughess ceo and informed him that halliburton and baker hughes were “the only investment valueact had where they did not have board seats”  on september   valueact pitched its restructuring plan to halliburtons ceo advocating that halliburton pursue selective acquisitions of baker hughess production chemicals and artificial lift businesses according to halliburtons notes of the call valueact suggested that halliburton should offer a substantial sum to acquire these businesses and settle the  billion merger breakup fee at the same time  during this conversation with the ceo of halliburton valueact shared baker hughess plans if the merger could not close according to halliburtons notes of the call valueact stated that if the merger could not be consummated baker hughess ceo intended to “run the company like he did before” halliburtons ceo then asked whether baker hughess ceo was “listening to va” a valueact partner replied that baker hughess ceo “realize sic can go to his board directly” valueact also asked halliburtons ceo if there was “anything we valueact can do to be helpful” and explicitly offered to “apply pressure to bhi ceo regarding unhappiness if he continues to run co if deal does not go through” in short valueact offered to use its position as a shareholder to pressure baker hughess management to change its business strategy in ways that could affect baker hughess competitive future  valueact and halliburtons willingness to discuss the competitive future of baker hughes in the absence of a merger is further confirmed by notes contained in valueacts files these notes list “ options that lazard presumably halliburtons ceo david lesar discussed” with respect to baker hughes one of those options was “cripple a competitor”  on november   valueact made a detailed fiftyfive page presentation to baker hughess ceo proposing operational and strategic changes to the company the same day valueact lobbied halliburtons senior management to pursue alternative ways to get the deal done vi violations alleged  plaintiff alleges

necessary to enable the court and the public to evaluate the proposed final judgment that would terminate this civil antitrust proceeding i nature and purpose of this proceeding on april   the united states filed a complaint against va partners i llc “va partners i” valueact capital master fund lp “master fund” and valueact coinvest international lp “coinvest fund” collectively “valueact” or “defendants” related to master funds and coinvest funds acquisition of voting securities of halliburton co “halliburton” and baker hughes incorporated “baker hughes” in  and  the complaint alleges that valueact violated section a of the clayton act  usc a commonly known as the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of  the “hsr act” the hsr act states that “no person shall acquire directly or start printed page indirectly any voting securities of any person” exceeding certain thresholds until that person has filed preacquisition notification and report forms with the department of justice and the federal trade commission collectively the “agencies” and the postfiling waiting period has expired id a key purpose of the notification and waiting period is to protect consumers and competition from potentially anticompetitive transactions by providing the agencies an opportunity to conduct an antitrust review of proposed transactions before they are consummated this case arises because valueact an investment manager that is well known for actively involving itself in the management of the companies in which it invests made substantial purchases of stock in two direct competitors with the intent to participate in those companies business decisions without complying with the notification and waiting period requirements of the hsr act through these purchases valueact simultaneously became one of the largest shareholders of both halliburton and baker hughes valueact established these positions as halliburton and baker hughes—the second and third largest providers of oilfield services in the world—were being investigated for agreeing to a merger that threatened to substantially lessen competition in over twenty product markets in the united states after the united states challenged that merger on april   halliburton and baker hughes abandoned their anticompetitive plan to merge valueacts failure to comply with the hsr act prevented the agencies from reviewing valueacts acquisitions in advance compromising the agencies ability to protect competition and consumers the complaint alleges that the defendants could not rely on the hsr acts limited exemption for acquisitions made “solely for the purpose of investment” the “investmentonly exemption”  usc ac exempts “acquisitions solely for the purpose of investment of voting securities if as a result of such acquisition the securities acquired or held do not exceed  per centum of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer” voting securities are held “solely for the purpose of investment” if the acquirer has “no intention of participating in the formulation determination or direction of the basic business decisions of the issuer”  cfr § i as explained in the complaint valueact did not qualify for the investmentonly exemption because it intended to participate in the business decisions of both companies the complaint seeks a ruling that the defendants acquisitions of voting securities of halliburton and baker hughes without filing and observing the mandatory waiting period violated the hsr act the complaint asks the court to issue an appropriate injunction and order the defendants to pay an appropriate civil penalty to the united states on july   the united states filed a stipulation and proposed final judgment that eliminates the need for a trial in this case the proposed final judgment is designed to prevent and restrain defendants hsr act violations under the proposed final judgment which is explained more fully below defendants must pay a civil penalty of  million further defendants are prohibited from engaging in future conduct of the sort alleged in the complaint the united states and the defendants have stipulated that the proposed final judgment may be entered after compliance with the appa unless the united states first withdraws its consent entry of the proposed final judgment would terminate this case except that the court would retain jurisdiction to construe modify or enforce the provisions of the proposed final judgment and punish violations thereof ii description of the events giving rise to the alleged violations of the antitrust laws a the defendants and the acquisitions of halliburton and baker hughes voting securities master fund and coinvest fund are offshore funds organized under the laws of the british virgin

“active constructive involvement” in the management of the companies in which it invests the website further elaborates “the goal in each investment is to work constructively with management andor the companys board to implement a strategy or strategies that maximize returns for all shareholders” valueact entities have previously violated the hsr act by acquiring voting securities without making the required notifications in  valueact capital partners lp filed corrective notifications for three prior acquisitions of voting securities valueact outlined steps it would take to ensure future compliance with the hsr act no enforcement action was taken at that time master fund then failed to make required filings with respect to three acquisitions that it made in  valueact capital partners lp agreed to pay a  million civil penalty to settle an hsr act enforcement action based on these violations b the defendants unlawful conduct the complaint in this case alleges that valueact violated the hsr act in connection with acquisitions of voting securities of halliburton and baker hughes in  and  in making these acquisitions valueact improperly relied on the limited investmentonly exemption from hsr filing requirements despite the fact that valueact intended from the outset to play an “active role” at both halliburton and baker hughes valueacts failure to file the necessary notifications prevented the department from timely reviewing valueacts stock acquisitions which risked harming competition given that they resulted in valueacts becoming one of the largest shareholders in two direct competitors that were pursuing an anticompetitive merger the complaint alleges that valueact committed three distinct violations of the hsr act first defendant master fund acquired voting securities of halliburton in excess of the hsr acts thresholds without complying with the notification and waiting period requirements second defendant coinvest fund acquired voting securities of halliburton in excess of the hsr acts thresholds without complying with the notification and waiting period requirements third defendant master fund acquired voting securities of baker hughes in excess of the hsr acts thresholds without complying with the notification and waiting period requirements as described in more detail in the complaint valueact intended from the time it made these stock purchases to use its position as a major shareholder of both halliburton and baker hughes to obtain access to management to learn information about the companies and the merger in private conversations with senior executives to influence those executives to improve the chances that the halliburtonbaker hughes merger start printed page would be completed and ultimately influence other business decisions regardless of whether the merger was consummated valueact executives met frequently with the top executives of the companies both in person and by teleconference and sent numerous emails to these the top executives on a variety of business issues during these meetings valueact identified specific business areas for improvement valueact also made presentations to each companys senior executives including presentations on postmerger integration the totality of the evidence described in the complaint makes clear that valueact could not claim the limited hsr exemption for passive investment iii explanation of the proposed final judgment the proposed final judgment contains injunctive relief and requires payment of civil penalties which are designed to prevent future violations of the hsr act the proposed final judgment sets forth prohibited conduct and provides access and inspection procedures to enable the united states to determine and ensure compliance with the proposed final judgment a prohibited conduct section iv of the proposed final judgment is designed to prevent future hsr violations of the sort alleged in the complaint under this provision the defendants may not rely on the hsr acts investmentonly exemption if they intend to take or their investment strategy identifies circumstances in which they may take the following actions  proposing a merger acquisition or sale to which the issuer of the acquired voting securities is a party  proposing to another person in which the defendant has an ownership stake the potential terms for a merger acquisition or sale between the person and the issuer  proposing new or modified terms for a merger or acquisition to which the issuer is a party  proposing an alternative to a merger or acquisition to which the issuer is a party either before consummation or upon abandonment  proposing changes to the issuers corporate structure that require shareholder approval or  proposing changes to the issuers strategies regarding pricing production capacity or production output of the issuers products and services the hsr act exempts acquisitions made “solely for the purpose of investment”  usc ac emphasis added as explained in the regulations implementing the hsr act an acquirer must have “no intention of participating in the formulation determination or direction of the basic business decisions of the issuer” to qualify for the investmentonly exemption  cfr § i emphasis added valueact did not have a passive intent when it acquired stock in halliburton and baker hughes the proposed merger of these competitors was central to valueacts investment strategy as described in the complaint valueact intended from the outset to use its ownership stake in each firm to influence the firms management as necessary to increase the probability of the merger being consummated or propose alternatives if it could not be completed an investor who is considering influencing basic business decisions—such as merger and acquisition strategy corporate restructuring and other competitively significant business strategies eg relating to price production capacity or production output—is not passive therefore valueact was not entitled to rely on the investmentonly exemption the prohibited conduct provision of the proposed final judgment is aimed at deterring future hsr violations of the sort alleged in the complaint in particular those that pose the greatest threat to competition this provision does not represent a comprehensive list of all conduct that would disqualify an acquirer of voting securities from relying on the investmentonly exemption of the hsr act other actions including but not limited to those described in the statement of basis and purpose accompanying the hsr rules to implement the act may disqualify an acquirer from relying on the investmentonly exemption premerger notification reporting and waiting period requirements  fed reg   july   identifying conduct that may be inconsistent with the investmentonly exemption in light of valueacts conduct at issue in this case and its past violations this injunction is an appropriate means to ensure that valueact is deterred from violating the hsr act again if valueact does violate any of the provisions of the proposed final judgment the court may impose additional sanctions for contempt if appropriate b compliance section v of the proposed final judgment sets forth required compliance procedures section v requires the defendants to designate a compliance officer who is required to distribute a copy of the final judgment to each person who has responsibility for or authority over each defendants acquisitions of voting securities the compliance officer is also required to obtain a certification form from each such person verifying that he or she has received a copy of the final judgment and understands his or her obligations to help ensure that the defendants comply with the final judgment section vi grants duly authorized representatives of the united states department of justice “doj” access upon reasonable notice to each defendants records and documents relating to matters contained in the final judgment the defendants must also make their personnel available for interviews or depositions regarding such matters in addition the defendants must upon written request from duly authorized representatives of the assistant attorney general in charge of the dojs antitrust division submit written reports relating to matters contained in the final judgment c civil penalties the hsr act currently provides a maximum civil penalty of  per day for each day a defendant is in violation of the act this maximum penalty will be adjusted to  per day as of august   pursuant to the federal civil penalties inflation adjustment act improvements act of  public law  §  further amending the federal civil penalties inflation adjustment act of  and federal trade commission rule   cfr   fed reg  june   the proposed final judgment imposes an  million civil penalty for the defendants failure to comply with the notice and waiting requirements of the hsr act the department considered several factors in assessing what penalty would be appropriate in this case first the facts as described in the complaint make clear that valueact intended to take an active role in the business decisions of both halliburton and baker hughes and valueact should have recognized its filing obligation to the extent that valueact had any doubt about its obligations it could have sought the advice of the federal trade commissions premerger notification office but did not do so second as discussed above valueact has previously violated the hsr act six times finally although the hsr act is a strict liability statute the department considers it an aggravating factor that the transactions at issue raised substantive competitive concerns valueact became one of the largest shareholders of two direct competitors start printed page and proceeded to actively and simultaneously participate in the management of each company moreover valueact established these positions as halliburton and baker hughes were being investigated for agreeing to a merger that threatened to substantially lessen competition in over twenty product markets in the united states and planned to intervene to influence the probability that the merger would be completed or to determine the companies courses if it was not as a result the violations prejudiced the departments ability to enforce the antitrust laws together these factors call for a substantial penalty however the department did adjust the penalty downward from the maximum because the defendants are willing to resolve the matter by consent decree and avoid prolonged litigation despite the downward adjustment the penalty in this case will be the largest penalty ever imposed for a violation of the hsr act such a penalty appropriately reflects the gravity of the conduct at issue and will deter valueact and other companies from violating the hsr act iv remedies available to potential private litigants there is no private antitrust action for hsr act violations therefore entry of the proposed final judgment will neither impair nor assist the bringing of any private antitrust action v procedures available for modification of the proposed final judgment the united states and defendant have stipulated that the proposed final judgment may be entered by this court after compliance with the provisions of the appa provided that the united states has not withdrawn its consent the appa conditions entry of the decree upon this courts determination that the proposed final judgment is in the public interest the appa provides a period of at least sixty  days preceding the effective date of the proposed final judgment within which any person may submit to the united states written comments regarding the proposed final judgment any person who wishes to comment should do so within sixty  days of the date of publication of this competitive impact statement in the federal register or the last date of publication in a newspaper of the summary of this competitive impact statement whichever is later all comments received during this period will be considered by the united states which remains free to withdraw its consent to the proposed final judgment at any time prior to entry the comments and the response of the united states will be filed with the court in addition comments will be posted on the us department of justice antitrust divisions internet website and under certain circumstances published in the federal register written comments should be submitted to kathleen s oneill chief transportation energy and agriculture section antitrust division united states department of justice  fifth street nw suite  washington dc  email kathleenoneillusdojgov the proposed final judgment provides that this court retains jurisdiction over this action and the parties may apply to this court for any order necessary or appropriate for the modification interpretation or enforcement of the final judgment vi alternatives to the proposed final judgment as an alternative to the proposed final judgment the united states considered pursuing a full trial on the merits against the defendants the united states is satisfied however that the proposed relief is an appropriate remedy in this matter given the facts of this case the united states is satisfied that the injunction coupled with the proposed civil penalty is sufficient to address the violations alleged in the complaint and to deter violations by similarly situated entities in the future without the time expense and uncertainty of a full trial on the merits vii standard of review under the appa for the proposed final judgment the appa requires that remedies contained in proposed consent judgments in antitrust cases brought by the united states be subject to a sixty  day comment period after which the court shall determine whether entry of the proposed final judgment is “in the public interest”  usc e in making that determination the court in accordance with the statute as amended in  is required to consider a the competitive impact of such judgment including termination of alleged violations provisions for enforcement and modification duration of relief sought anticipated effects of alternative remedies actually considered whether its terms are ambiguous and any other competitive considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment that the court deems necessary to a determination of whether the consent judgment is in the public interest and b the impact of entry of such judgment upon competition in the relevant market or markets upon the public generally and individuals alleging specific injury from the violations set forth in the complaint including consideration of the public benefit if any to be derived from a determination of the issues at trial  usc ea  b in considering these statutory factors the courts inquiry is necessarily a limited one as the government is entitled to “broad discretion to settle with the defendant within the reaches of the public interest” united states v microsoft corp  fd   dc cir  see generally united states v sbc commcns inc  f supp d   ddc

v inbev nvsa no  jr  trade cas cch ¶   us dist lexis  at  ddc aug   noting that the courts review of a consent judgment is limited and only inquires “into whether the governments determination that the proposed remedies will cure the antitrust violations alleged in the complaint was reasonable and whether the mechanism to enforce the final judgment are clear and manageable” as the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit has held under the appa a court considers among other things the relationship between the remedy secured and the specific allegations set forth in the governments complaint whether the decree is sufficiently clear whether enforcement mechanisms are sufficient and whether the decree may positively harm third parties see microsoft  fd at  with respect to the adequacy of the relief secured by the decree a court may not “ engage in an unrestricted evaluation of what relief would best serve the public ” united states v bns inc  fd   th cir

balancing of competing social and political interests affected by a proposed antitrust consent decree must be left in the first instance to the discretion of the attorney general the courts role in protecting the public interest is one of insuring that the government has not breached its duty to the public in consenting to the decree the court is required to determine not whether a particular decree is the one that will best serve society but whether the settlement is “within the reaches of the public interest” more elaborate requirements might undermine the effectiveness of antitrust enforcement by consent decree bechtel  fd at  emphasis added citations omitted in determining whether a proposed settlement is in the public interest a district court “must accord deference to the governments predictions about the efficacy of its remedies and may not require that the remedies perfectly match the alleged violations” sbc commcns  f supp d at  see also us airways  f supp d at  noting that a court should not reject the proposed remedies because it believes others are preferable microsoft  fd at  noting the need for courts to be “deferential to the governments predictions as to the effect of the proposed remedies” united states v archerdanielsmidland co  f supp d   ddc  noting that the court should grant due respect to the united states prediction as to the effect of proposed remedies its perception of the market structure and its views of the nature of the case courts have greater flexibility in approving proposed consent decrees than in crafting their own decrees following a finding of liability in a litigated matter “a proposed decree must be approved even if it falls short of the remedy the court would impose on its own as long as it falls within the range of acceptability or is within the reaches of public interest ” united states v am tel  tel co  f supp   ddc  citations omitted quoting united states v gillette co  f supp   d mass  affd sub nom

at  united states v alcan aluminum ltd  f supp   wd ky  approving the consent decree even though the court would have imposed a greater remedy to meet this standard the united states “need only provide a factual basis for concluding that the settlements are reasonably adequate remedies for the alleged harms” sbc commcns  f supp d at  moreover the courts role under the appa is limited to reviewing the remedy in relationship to the violations that the united states has alleged in its complaint and does not authorize the court to “construct its own hypothetical case and then evaluate the decree against that case” microsoft  fd at  see also us airways  f supp d at  noting that the court must simply determine whether there is a factual foundation for the governments decisions such that its conclusions regarding the proposed settlements are reasonable inbev  us dist lexis  at  stating that “the public interest is not to be measured by comparing the violations alleged in the complaint against those the court believes could have or even should have been alleged” because the “courts authority to review the decree depends entirely on the governments exercising its prosecutorial discretion by bringing a case in the first place” it follows that “the court is only authorized to review the decree itself” and not to “effectively redraft the complaint” to inquire into other matters that the united states did not pursue microsoft  fd at  as the united states district court for the district of columbia recently confirmed in sbc communications courts “cannot look beyond the complaint in making the public interest determination unless the complaint is drafted so narrowly as to make a mockery of judicial power”  f supp d at  in its  amendments congress made clear its intent to preserve the practical benefits of utilizing consent decrees in antitrust enforcement adding the unambiguous instruction that “nothing in this section shall be construed to require the court to conduct an evidentiary hearing or to require the court to permit anyone to intervene”  usc § e see also us airways  f supp d at  indicating that a court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing or to permit intervenors as part of its review under the tunney act the language wrote into the statute what congress intended when it enacted the tunney act in  as senator tunney explained “the court is nowhere compelled to go to trial or to engage in extended proceedings which might have the effect of vitiating the benefits of prompt and less costly settlement through the consent decree process”  cong rec   statement of sen tunney rather the procedure for the public interest determination is left to the discretion of the court with the recognition that the courts
