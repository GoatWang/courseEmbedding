interest brokerage fees and extraordinary expenses from exceeding  of average daily net assets  pursuant to their authority under the respective variable contracts and the prospectuses describing the same and subject to the approval of the commission under section c of the  act mllic and mlny propose to substitute shares of the replacement portfolios for shares of the substituted portfolios in the separate accounts the “substitutions”  the substitutions are part of an overall business plan involving the management of mllic and mlny to make their respective products including the variable contracts more competitive both in terms of new sales as well as with regard to the retention of existing blocks of business and more efficient to administer and oversee the proposed substitutions are consistent with this business plan and involve mutual funds with similar investment objectives  over the past several years mllic and mlny have engaged in a thorough review of the efficiencies and structures of all of the investment options they offer under the variable contracts as part of this ongoing effort to make the variable contracts more competitive the applicants engaged in certain substitutions on may   based on their continuing evaluation of the available investment options mllic and mlny believe that more concentrated and streamlined operations for investment options could result in increased operational and administrative efficiencies and economies of scale for the companies more specifically mllic and mlny feel that streamlining the number of nonproprietary fund families available through the variable contracts and altering the available portfolios will simplify the administration of the variable contracts particularly with regard to communications with the fund families and the preparation of various reports and disclosure documents this streamlining will allow them to enhance their communication efforts to variable contract owners and sales representatives regarding the available portfolios and may provide for more enhanced and timely reporting to mllic and mlny from fund families and therefore from mllic and mlny to variable contract owners furthermore reducing the number of nonproprietary fund families also will provide mllic and mlny with more control over fund changes that affect their variable contracts allowing for appropriate longterm strategic planning  during this continuing evaluation of the available investment options mllic and mlny also have engaged in a thorough review of the quality of all of the investment options offered under the variable contracts this due diligence review involved an evaluation of the investment performance the investment process and the investment start printed page teams responsible for the management of the substituted portfolios ultimately mllic and mlny concluded that the substituted portfolios offered under the variable contracts warrant replacement and that it would be preferable to make alternative investment options available to both current and future variable contract owners consequently mllic and mlny identified certain investment options ie the replacement portfolios that mllic and mlny feel would be more competitive and more attractive to variable contract owners in fact under certain of the variable contracts where administratively feasible mllic and mlny closed the subaccounts investing in the substituted portfolios to the allocation of premium and contract value on may   and simultaneously added new investment options that invest in the replacement portfolios  mllic and mlny also feel that these options would better promote their goals of increasing administrative efficiency of and control over their variable contracts if they were a part of their affiliated fund families for example one of the proposed substitutions involves the roszeldelaware trend portfolio which is modeled on one of its corresponding substituted portfolios the delaware vip trend series this replacement portfolio also shares an identical investment objective and substantially similar policies restrictions and risks as this substituted portfolio in addition as the replacement portfolios operate pursuant to the manager of managers order the substitutions would provide protection to variable contract owners by giving roszel advisors the agility and flexibility to change the subadvisers of the replacement portfolios should such a change become warranted or advisable  mllic and mlny will effect the substitutions as soon as practicable following the issuance of the requested order as follows as of the effective date of the substitutions “effective date” each separate account will redeem shares of the applicable substituted portfolios inkind the proceeds of such redemptions will then be used to purchase shares of the corresponding replacement portfolios with each subaccount of the applicable separate account investing the proceeds of its redemption from the substituted portfolios in the applicable replacement portfolios following these transactions certain separate accounts may have two subaccounts holding shares of the replacement portfolios each separate account will combine the two subaccounts holding shares of each replacement portfolio by transferring shares on the same date from one of the subaccounts holding shares of the replacement portfolio to the other subaccount holding shares of the replacement portfolio the net effect of the substitutions will be to eliminate the subaccount in each separate account relating to the substituted portfolios  redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times all redemptions of shares of the substituted portfolios and purchases of shares of the replacement portfolios will be effected in accordance with rule c of the  act  the substitutions will take place at relative net asset value with no change in the amount of any variable contract owners contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investments in any of the subaccounts variable contract owners will not incur any additional fees or charges as a result of the substitutions nor will their rights or mllics and mlnys obligations under the variable contracts be altered in any way although variable contract owners will lose their right to vote on whether the mlig trust and roszel advisors may enter into and materially amend investment subadvisory agreements relating to the replacement portfolios pursuant to the manager of managers order described above all expenses incurred in connection with the substitutions including legal accounting transactional and other fees and expenses including brokerage commissions will be paid by mllic or mlny in addition the substitutions will not impose any tax liability on variable contract owners the substitutions will not cause the variable contract fees and charges currently paid by existing variable contract owners to be greater after the substitutions than before the substitutions neither mllic nor mlny will exercise any right it may have under the variable contracts to impose restrictions on transfers under the variable contracts for a period of at least thirty days following the substitutions to the extent that the total operating expenses of either of the replacement portfolios taking into account any expense waiver or reimbursement for each fiscal quarter during the twentyfour months following the substitutions exceed on an annualized basis the net expense level of the corresponding substituted portfolio for the fiscal year ended december   mllic and mlny will for each variable contract outstanding on the date of the substitutions make a corresponding reduction in separate account expenses on the last day of such fiscal quarter such that the amount of the replacement portfolios net expenses together with those of the corresponding separate account will on an annualized basis be no greater than the sum of the net expenses of the corresponding substituted portfolio and the expenses of the separate account for the  fiscal year in addition for twentyfour months following the substitutions mllic and mlny will not increase assetbased fees or charges for variable contracts outstanding on the day of the substitutions thereafter expenses of the replacement portfolios will vary from year to year and may exceed those of their corresponding substituted portfolios the procedures to be implemented are sufficient to assure that each variable contract owners cash values immediately after the substitutions shall be equal to the cash value immediately before the substitutions and that the substitutions will not affect the value of the interests of those owners of other mllic and mlny variable contracts other than the variable contracts who currently have contract value allocated to any of the portfolios of the alliancebernstein fund the delaware trust the mfs trust or the mlig trust  variable contract owners have been notified of the application by means of a supplement to the prospectus for each of the variable contracts that discloses that the applicants have filed the application and seek approval for the substitutions “presubstitution notice” the presubstitution notice set forth the anticipated effective date and advised variable contract owners that contract values attributable to investments in the substituted portfolios will be transferred to the replacement portfolios without charge including sales charges or surrender charges and without counting toward the number of transfers permitted without charge on the effective date the presubstitution notice stated that from the date the initial application was filed with the commission through the date thirty  days after the substitutions variable contract owners may make one transfer of contract value from the subaccounts investing in the substituted portfolios before the substitutions or the replacement portfolios after the substitutions to any other subaccount without charge including sales charges or surrender charges and without that transfer counting toward the number start printed page permitted without charge under the variable contract  in addition mllic will solicit approval of the proposed substitutions from mllic variable contract owners and mlny will solicit approval of the proposed substitutions from mlny variable contract owners such approval will be sought from the owners of first generation mllic vli contracts second generation mllic vli contracts mllic annuity contracts first generation mlny vli contracts second generation mlny vli contracts and mlny annuity contracts each voting as a separate group this solicitation will make clear that approval of the proposed substitutions signifies approval of the replacement portfolios reliance on the manager of managers order described above if mllic and mlny do not receive approval for the substitutions and in effect the replacement portfolios reliance on the manager of managers order for all groups of contracts mllic and mlny may decide to effect the substitutions only for some or all of those groups whose owners approve them similarly if mllic and mlny do not receive approval for all of the substitutions mllic and mlny may decide to effect only those substitutions that were approved by variable contract owners neither mllic nor mlny will effect any proposed substitution for any group of contracts that has not approved that substitution approval will be obtained by the affirmative vote of the lesser of  a majority of the outstanding interests in each applicable subaccount investing in the relevant substituted portfolio measured by the dollar value of accumulation units or   of such outstanding interests voted if votes received represent a majority of such interests mllic and mlny will solicit approval of variable contract owners by sending them written voting forms accompanied by a voting information statement and other disclosure documents in a manner generally consistent with applicable requirements of regulation a under the  act collectively “voting materials” in particular the relevant information statement will disclose in substance the information required by applicable items of form n any beneficial financial interest that mllic or mlny may have in any of the separate accounts is immaterial in relation to the interests of variable contract owners and neither mllic nor mlny will cast any votes pursuant to rule a under the  act the voting materials have been filed with the commission as proxy materials applicants anticipate that voting materials will be sent to variable contract owners on october   unless extended by either mllic or mlny votes must be received by november   to be counted  all variable contract owners will have received a copy of the most recent replacement portfolio prospectuses prior to the substitutions  finally within five  days after the substitutions variable contract owners will be notified by means of a supplement to the prospectus for each of the variable contracts that the substitutions were carried out “postsubstitution notice” the postsubstitution notice will restate the information set forth in the presubstitution notice eg advising variable contract owners of the “free” transfer right applicants legal analysis  section c of the  act prohibits any depositor or trustee of a unit investment trust that invests exclusively in the securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without the approval of the commission section c provides that such approval shall be granted by order of the commission if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of the  act  section c was intended to provide for commission scrutiny of proposed substitutions which could in effect force shareholders dissatisfied with the substitute security to redeem their shares thereby possibly incurring a loss of the sales load deducted from initial purchase payments an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the proceeds of redemption or both the section was designed to forestall the ability of a depositor to present holders of interest in a unit investment trust with situations in which a holders only choice would be to continue an investment in an unsuitable underlying security or to elect a costly and in effect forced redemption the applicants submit that the substitutions meet the standards set forth in section c and that if implemented the substitutions would not raise any of the aforementioned concerns that congress intended to address when the  act was amended to include this provision in addition the applicants submit that the proposed substitutions meet the standards that the commission and its staff have applied to substitutions that have been approved in the past  the replacement of the substituted portfolios with the replacement portfolios is consistent with the protection of variable contract owners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act and thus meets the standards necessary to support an order pursuant to section c of the  act the substitutions will provide variable contract owners with comparable investment vehicles  although not always identical the investment objectives policies and strategies of the replacement portfolios are comparable to those of their respective substituted portfolios  in each proposed substitution the types of investment advisory and administrative services provided to the replacement portfolios by their various investment advisers are comparable to the types of investment advisory and administrative services provided to the substituted portfolios by their respective investment advisers variable contract owners invested in the delaware vip trend series one of the substituted portfolios will enjoy continuity of their investment adviser due to the “manager of managers” approach employed by roszel advisors the investment adviser to the corresponding replacement portfolio the replacement portfolio will be managed overall by roszel advisors but much of the daytoday management activity will be handled by the subadviser dmc the investment adviser currently managing the delaware vip trend series while variable contract owners invested in the alliancebernstein quasar portfolio whose investment adviser is currently alliance would be managed by a new investment adviser and a new subadviser as stated above the types of investment advisory and administrative services provided after the substitution will be comparable to those received before the substitution similarly the same will be true of the substitution of shares of the roszelpimco ccm capital appreciation portfolio the replacement portfolio whose investment adviser will be roszel advisors and whose subadvisers will be pimco and cadence for shares of the mfs research series and mfs investors trust series whose investment adviser is mfs  although the delaware vip trend series advisory fee and total operating expenses are lower than those of the roszeldelaware trend portfolio before any waivers and reimbursements the alliancebernstein quasar portfolios advisory fee and total operating expenses are higher than those of the roszeldelaware trend portfolio before start printed page any waivers and reimbursements moreover the proposed substitutions will be effected only with the approval of variable contract owners finally mllic and mlny will agree that for two years from the date of the substitutions they will reduce separate account expenses to the extent the annualized expenses for either replacement portfolio for any fiscal quarter exceed the  net expense level of its corresponding substituted portfolio similarly although the advisory fee and total operating expenses of the mfs research series and the mfs investors trust series are lower than those of the roszelpimco ccm capital appreciation portfolio before any waivers and reimbursements mllic and mlny will effect the proposed substitutions only if variable contract owner approval is received and mllic and mlny will agree that for two years from the date of the substitutions they will reduce separate account expenses to the extent the annualized expenses for either replacement portfolio for any fiscal quarter exceed the  net expense level of its corresponding substituted portfolio  although not always identical the investment risks of the replacement portfolios are comparable to those of their respective substituted portfolios  the section b applicants also request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section b of the  act exempting them from section a of the  act to the extent necessary to permit mllic and mlny to carry out the substitutions by redeeming shares issued by alliancebernstein fund delaware trust and mfs trust inkind and using the distributed securities to purchase shares issued by mlig trust  section a and a of the  act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of an affiliated person from selling any security or other property to such registered investment company and from purchasing any security or other property from such registered investment company mllic and mlny anticipate that the substitutions will be done in whole or in part by redeeming shares of the substituted portfolios inkind rather than in cash and then using those assets to purchase shares of the replacement portfolios redemptions and purchases inkind involve the purchase of property from a registered investment company and the sale of property to a registered investment company by mllic mlny and the mlig trust each arguably an affiliated person of those investment companies  pursuant to section a of the  act the section b applicants may be considered affiliates of one or more of the funds involved in the substitutions based upon the definition of “affiliated person” under section a of the  act because the substitutions may be effected in whole or in part by means of inkind redemptions and subsequent purchases of shares and also by means of inkind transactions the substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliates  any inkind redemptions and purchases for purposes of the substitutions will be effected in a manner consistent with the investment objectives and policies of the substituted portfolios and the replacement portfolios subject to the oversight of roszel advisors dmc will review the securities holdings of the alliancebernstein quasar portfolio and the delaware vip trend series and pimco and cadence will review the securities holdings of the mfs research series and the mfs investors trust series and determine which of these substituted portfolio holdings would be suitable investments for the roszeldelaware trend portfolio and the roszelpimco ccm capital appreciation portfolio respectively in the overall context of the replacement portfolios investment objectives and policies and consistent with their management of the replacement portfolios the section b applicants state that securities to be paid out as redemption proceeds and subsequently contributed to the replacement portfolios to effect the contemplated inkind purchases of shares will be valued based on the normal valuation procedures of the redeeming and purchasing portfolios the redeeming and purchasing values will be the same consistent with rule ad under the  act no brokerage commissions fees or other remuneration will be paid in connection with the inkind transactions if roszel advisors declines to accept particular portfolio securities of any of the substituted portfolios for purchase inkind of shares of any of the replacement portfolios those positions will be liquidated by the applicable substituted portfolio and shares of the corresponding replacement portfolio will be purchased with cash  section b of the  act provides that the commission may upon application grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of section a if the evidence establishes that  the terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned  the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned as recited in its registration statement and records filed under the  act and  the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the  act  the section b applicants submit that the terms of the substitutions including the consideration to be paid and received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the section b applicants also submit that the substitutions are consistent with the policies of alliancebernstein fund delaware trust mfs trust and mlig trust and their portfolios as recited in the current registration statements and reports
