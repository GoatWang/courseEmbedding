equity  narwhal capital select page equity at narwhal equity investing is all about value or perhaps more appropriately equity investing is about identifying undervalued stocks with understandable stories we firmly believe that bottomup individual equity selection is both a science and an art we consider losses to be more mathematically damaging than gains are psychologically joyful and as such we invest prudently by focusing closely on stock valuations relative to components such as free cash flow balance sheet strength earnings potential and dividend distributions while we tend to begin our stock screening process with more measured analysis we firmly believe that bottomup individual equity selection is both a science and an art in the light of that we do place an emphasis on less

our general disclosures subscribe you have successfully subscribed asset allocation  narwhal capital select page asset allocation while every narwhal portfolio is customized to each client’s risk tolerance income needs time horizon and investment objectives very few are onedimensional and focused solely on stocks or entirely on bonds most of our portfolios are balanced across all asset classes but every single account is customized to each individual client to the contrary the overwhelming majority of our accounts are balanced—across equity stocks fixed income bonds cash and commodities—to some extent to be sure this customization yields a wide array of portfolio profiles some are aggressive some are conservative some are geared toward growth others are focused on maximizing current income but a wideranging collection of clients mandates an eclectic mix of asset allocations we believe we add as much value to clients in our allocation analysis and implementation as we do with our individual stock or bond selection accordingly we take great pride in this element of our stewardship subscribe to our newsletterjoin our mailing list to receive the latest news and updates from our
