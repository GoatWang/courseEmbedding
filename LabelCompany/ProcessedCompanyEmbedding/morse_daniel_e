chemosensory receptors signal transducers and the activation of gene expression controlling establishment of a marine symbiosis by d e morse book  editions published between 9 and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide obiective to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which marine invertebrate larval chemosensory receptors and their associated signal transducers regulate surface attachment and metamorphosis of the larvae in response to chemical signals from the environment and to characterize the molecular mechanisms regulating the activation of specific gene expression in the developmentally arrested marine invertebrate larva in response to chemical inducers of metamorphosis we have found that metamorphosis in larvae of the marine mollusc haliotis rufescens red abalone is controlled by exogenous chemical signals recognized and transduced by two convergent chemosensory pathways a morphogenetic pathway activated by a gaba mimetic peptide morphogen encountered by the larvae on surfaces of recruiting host algae and a regulatory pathway stimulated by lysine in seawater the system displays both habituation acting at the level of the morphogenetic pathway receptors and facilitation mediated by the regulatory pathway output and sensitivity of the morphogenetic pathway are amplified as much as fold by stimulation of the regulatory

worldcat member library worldwide this study will develop a conceptual model of leadership based on an analysis of leadership functions in broad outline i will argue that an essential function of a leader is to develop and maintain social bonds among group members in fact i will conclude that this is a function of paramount importance which has been neglected by most research i will argue that analysis of the bondbuilding function can provide significant insight into the nature of leadership regardless of context the specific features of social bonds and how they are developed and maintained will vary in different groups and situations but an essential leadership function in every case will be their development and maintenance such a model would be readily open to empirical confirmation would provide theoretical insights into leadership processes within groups and would have useful practical consequences for leadership development and training as well biochemical control of marine fouling  edition published in 9 in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide although marine fouling is initiated in several cases by the accretion of a thin molecular and microbial layer microfouling it is the attachment of larger organisms macrofouling that is responsible for the principal increase in drag on vessel hulls increase in fuel consumption stress and deterioration of piers pilings and cassions and the reduced efficiency of heatexchangers in the marine environment virtually all marine organisms that contribute to macrofouling are recruited to immersed surfaces as larvae or propagules setting from the plankton the objectives of research supported by this contract have been  to identify and characterize the biochemical signals receptors and their mechanisms of action that control the settlement metamorphosis and recruitment of larvae of marine invertebrates onto surfaces and thus control marine fouling and  based on these results to identify new strategies for countermeasures that are specific nontoxic and environmentally safe keywords fouling organisms antifouling pioneering research for the army at the institute for collaborative biotechnologies icb  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide the worlds of biology and biotechnology have found their way into the development of vital technologies that will have a positive impact on soldier performance this is being accomplished through the basic and applied research efforts of investigators within the armys institute for collaborative biotechnologies icb the icb was established in  and operated on behalf of the army at the university of california at santa barbara ucsb in partnership with the massachusetts institute of technology mit the california institute of technology caltech and partners in industry the icb is one of only a few congressionally chartered university affiliated research centers designed to facilitate and accelerate the transition from discovery to development and implementation through its own research and its strategic collaborations and alliances with army laboratories research development and engineering centers rdecs and industrial partners the icb provides the army with a single conduit for developing assessing and adapting new products and biotechnologies in direct support of army missions the army needs addressed by the icb include research and development r  d improvements in the fields of advanced sensors materials synthesis power and energy information processing network analysis and neuroscience the icbs mission is to use the tools of modern biotechnology to discover the mechanisms responsible for the remarkably high performance of complex biological systems and translate these into revolutionary advances in engineering for the support of army operations biotechnology opens new routes to highperformance materials for improved photovoltaics batteries uncooled ir detectors ferroelectrics and optical applications  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide biological systems fabricate multifunctional high performance materials at low temperatures and nearneutral ph with a precision of threedimensional nanostructural control that exceeds the capabilities of present human engineering using the tools of biotechnology and genetic engineering we discovered the unanticipated mechanism of simultaneous catalysis and templating governing the nanofabrication of silica in a biological system we then translated this mechanism to develop a new biologically inspired lowtemperature lowcost route for the synthesis of silica and a wide range of silicones organic polymers and nanostructured metal oxide hydroxide and phosphate semiconductor thin films without the use of organic templates this new synthesis method is generic yielding more than  different inorganic thin films and nanostructured bimetallic perovskite ferroelectrics because kinetic control is achieved at low temperature thus circumventing the thermodynamic default many of the inorganic materials made by this process exhibit morphologies and electronic properties not observable in the corresponding products made by conventional high temperature processes the electronic properties of some of these novel materials suggest strong advantages for highefficiency photovoltaics lightweight high powerdensity d batteries improved battery safety uncooled ir detectors and other energy and information storage applications because no organics are used the resulting products exhibit very high purity making the process fully integrable with mocvd and other conventional manufacturing methods because synthesis occurs from solution adaptation to rolltoroll and other high throughput methods may be possible transitioning of these developments to army applications is now beginning related efforts now in progress are focused on revolutionary bioinspired approaches to optical materials kinetically controlled vapordiffusion synthesis of novel nanostructured metal hydroxide and phosphate films using no organic reagents  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide the objective of this research was to develop a novel lowtemperature route to the structurally controlled nanofabrication of bimetallicoxide semiconductors with controlled order stoichiometry and spacing of the bimetallic centers on the atomic and nanoscale to deliver materials with neverbefore observed electronic properties resulting from the controlled electronic interactions of the two metal centers our approach took advantage of two recent developments i a new biologicallyinspired lowtemperature synthesis method we recently developed and ii the synthesis of defined molecular precursors of bimetallic oxides thereby extending our synthesis method from single metal oxide materials to bimetallic oxide and sulfideoxide ferroelectric and optoelectronic semiconductor materials to obtain control over structure and enhancement of properties never before achievable we report success

films grown by a novel lowtemperature process for uncooled ir detector applications  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide many army applications such as driver vision enhancement dve rifle sights seekers physical security target acquisition and fire control would benefit from affordable passive uncooled infrared ir sensor options the main considerations for uncooled ir sensors are cost weight and power we have begun a threeyear effort to develop a novel approach to the fabrication of uncooled ir focalplane array fpa detectors using bioinspired lowtemperature multimetallic perovskite nanoparticle deposition directwrite digitallyscripted laser phase conversion and mems fabrication and optimization techniques success is contingent on fully characterizing the perovskite films and resolving basic materials issues during the first year of this project molecular marine symbiosis  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide we advance both our in vitro dissection of the molecular mechanisms controlling larval attachment and metamorphosis of the mollusc haliotis rufescens and our characterization of the molecular adhesive and the mechanisms controlling fouling by the cementing polychaete phragmatopoma californica our results show that the chemosensory mechanisms and the internal signal transducers mediating the induction of larval attachment and metamorphosis in both phragmatopoma and haliotis larvae are highly related at the molecular level thus providing evidence from  phyla that the molecular mechanisms regulating the initial steps in macrofouler attachment are generic novel semiconductors  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member

edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide we present atomic force microscopy observations of mature nacre specifically the polygonal aragonite tablets which comprise the mineral portion of nacre in two types of molluscs a bivalve atrina serrate and a gastropod haliotis rufescens by imaging in liquids it was possible to dissolve away the nacre layer by layer to reveal both the structure of a single tablet and its relationship to vertically adjacent tablets atrina tablets inner face had a concave appearance the central depression was surrounded by elongate rings mimicking the orientation and aspect ratio of the unit cell rectangle unit cell orientations were generally aligned vertically and laterally between tablets of atrina although occasional twinning was also observed etching with hci initially removed a top crust in bleached atrina tablets revealing a flatter base without the elongate rings further etching lifted off individual tablets to reveal underlying nacreous layers showing no morphological registry between vertically adjacent tablets the nacreous structure of haliotis differed from atrina in three ways  the tablets were flatter and showed no top crust or elongate rings  the positions of the central depressions approximately repeated between nacreous layers showing that the presumed nucleation sites line up along a given stack and  the unit cell orientations were not preserved between laterally adjacent tablets but were between vertically adjacent tabletsan observation which could not be made by xmy

principal long term objective of this project was to identify and characterize those environmental biological and surface parameters that control the initial and ratelimiting processes of larval settlement attachment metamorphosis growth and recruitment of macrofouling organisms on surface immersed in the ocean macrofouling of surfaces immersed in the ocean is initiated by the delivery and attachment of larvae or propagules from the plankton work in our laboratory conducted with support from an earlier contract from onr revealed that settlement attachment and metamorphosis of larvae of the mollusc haliotis rufescens are controlled by the interaction between two chemosensory pathways receptors of the morphogentic pathway recognize a surfaceassociated biochemical morphogen produced by

harnessing transduction and storage yet the synthesis of advanced composites and multimetallic semiconductors with nanostructures optimized for these functions remains poorly understood and even less well controlled to help address this need we proposed three goals  to further investigate the hierarchical structure of the biologically synthesized silica comprising the skeletal spicules of sponges that we discovered to better resolve the role and mechanism of templating by the hierarchically assembled silicatein protein filament  to extend our molecular and genetic analyses and engineering of silicatein the selfassembling structuredirecting silicasynthesizingmore » enzyme we discovered and characterized to better understand and manipulate the catalysis and templating of semiconductor synthesis and  to further investigate scale up and harness the biologically inspired lowtemperature kinetically controlled catalytic synthesis method we developed based on the mechanism we discovered in silicatein to investigate the kinetic control of the structurefunction relationships in magnetic materials and develop new materials for energy applications the bioinspired catalytic synthesis method we have developed is lowcost low temperature and operates without the use of polluting chemicals in addition to direct applications for improvement of batteries and fuel cells the broader

izumi michi  kolodin dmitriy   october   proc natl acad sci usa the way nature evolves and sculpts materials using proteins inspires new approaches to materials engineering but is still not completely understood here we present a cellfree synthetic biological platform to advance studies of biologically synthesized solidstate materials this platform is capable of simultaneously exerting many of the hierarchical levels of control found in natural biomineralization including genetic chemical spatial structural and morphological control while supporting the evolutionary selection of new mineralizing proteins and the corresponding genetically encoded materials that they produce dnadirected protein expression and enzymatic mineralization occur on polystyrene microbeads in waterinoil emulsions yielding synthetic surrogates of biomineralizing cellsmore » that are then screened by flow sorting with lightscattering signals used to sort the resulting mineralized composites differentially we demonstrate the utility of this platform by evolutionarily selecting newly identified silicateins biomineralizing enzymes previously identified from the silica skeleton of a marine sponge for enzyme variants capable of synthesizing silicon dioxide silica or titanium dioxide titania composites mineral composites of intermediate strength are preferentially selected to remain intact for identification during cell sorting and then to collapse postsorting to expose the encoding genes for enzymatic dna amplification some of the newly selected silicatein variants catalyze the formation of crystalline silicates whereas the parent silicateins lack this ability the demonstrated bioengineered route to previously undescribed materials introduces in vitro enzyme selection as a viable strategy for mimicking genetic evolution of materials as it occurs in nature« less full text available « prev select page number go to page  of  » next » switch to detail view for this search
