held within a uit as of the date of deposit as well as the mandatory termination date of the trust while it is not common a trust may terminate early as described in the prospectus uits offer an attractive opportunity for investors to own a portfolio of securities via a low minimum typically liquid investment as a point of contrast while many actively managed funds continually buy and sell securities thereby changing their investment mix the securities held in a uit generally remain fixed how are uit securities chosensome uit securities are chosen according to a quantitative selection process determined by a sponsor while some are based on an index other uits are chosen by experienced analysts or portfolio managers who research the securities and screen them for various characteristics according to specific objectives once securities are selected the uit portfolios are then supervised accordingly throughout the life of the trust can a security held in a uit be removed at any timewhile it is rare a security held in a uit may be removed from a portfolio under certain circumstances such as a significant decline in credit rating by and large securities held in
