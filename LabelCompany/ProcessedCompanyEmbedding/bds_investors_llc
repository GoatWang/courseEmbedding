brenda admin   years ago a good question and one we aim to publish a full article on in due course the key consideration is that the palestinians themselves asked for and continue to be supportive of an international bds action in solidarity with their struggle for justice the livelihoods of palestinians are already severely restrained and dictated by israel the ultimate goal of equitable peaceful and respectful coexistence in historical palestine far outweighs any temporary hurdles that may arise as a result of bds reply becky isais   years ago let our wallets be our tanks reply s   years ago

gdp annually… about  billion to  billionso imagine that – this soft nonviolent human rights movement that’s global and led by palestine civil society can affect israel’s economy to the extent that we can offset the entire us aid to israel which is one of the main reasons why israel’s regime of oppression is able to maintain its denial of palestinian rights” salon reply ladeed   year ago above

its violation of international law reply maha   year ago should we boycott starbucks there has been many rumors about it yet starbucks’ website denies it reply admin   months ago we often encounter confusion in the bds movement about whether mcdonald’s and starbucks are on the list the answer from the bds national committee is that “effective bds campaigns are based on accurate research there is a lot of information online claiming that big companies give money to israel sometimes these rumours turn out to be false for example some campaigners call for a boycott of starbucks but starbucks doesn’t have any stores in israel and officially confirms that it does not support israel companies such as mcdonald’s are not priorities for the bds movement at this stage we focus on companies that play a clear and direct role in sustaining israeli violations of international law and that we can have a tangible impact upon” reply simon   months ago starbucks closed it stores its stores in israel

told me he thought the international company was begin boycotted please advise reply admin   year ago motorola solutions is listed above and has long been a target of bds for its very close ties with the israeli military especially in regard to the supply of surveillance equipment the presbyterian church usa successfully passed a resolution in  to divest from motorola solutions motorola mobility

ca in  and said that while intel is a very significant contributor the coffers of the israeli government and and has benefitted from its policies of ethnic cleansing at this time the bds national committee have not made intel a target of specific boycott campaigns from strategic reasons he emphasized the importance of building the movement by taking on targets for which success is

months ago the palestinian bds national committee emphasizes a targetted approach to the boycott campaign and “context sensitivity” that is if activists in a region have good reasons to boycott a particular company they will be supported bds what to boycott certainly avoiding any product made in israel is a good idea to avoid providing financial support to the israeli government and companies profiting from its apartheid policies if any app can help with that all the better reply kiki   months ago i just ordered brooklinen sheets and took them out of the wash excited to use them… and then saw the tag “made in israel” are they are your list reply admin   months ago definitely anything with a label that says “made in israel” should be boycotted it seems brooklinen has decided to team up with a factory in israel and it is worth letting them know that such economic support for israel ignores the palestine bds call and supports israeli apartheid the list is focussed on companies that have active campaigns directed towards them… please let us know if you write an email or take further action and we’ll certainly add them to the list reply blumpkin   months ago i saw some food items

are far more important than individuals just saying they say support the consumer boycott carefully targeted boycott campaigns that can boost public awareness and show public support through their success are the heartbeat of bds this site like all bds activists take ultimate guidance from the palestinian bds national committee they are very aware of the importance of “context sensitivity” and

ago tv shows that accept funding from the israeli government are certainly targets of bds a campaign against the series ‘dig’ bought by usa network successfully drew attention to the way tv shows can be used to promote israel’s “military occupation and illegal colonization” religion is always irrelevant to the selection of targets and campaigning by bds what matters is involvement and support with israel and its violations of international law and palestinians’ human rights as bassem tamimi recently said netanyahu could convert to islam tomorrow and the boycott would remain in place please let

strauss group based in israel for strauss group’s other brands see here the term “sabra” is israeli slang for a jewish person born in historical palestine  the term “sabra” also refers to an extensively upgraded m patton military tank developed by israel military industries  the company is a subsidiary of blue  white foods llc whose name refers to the colours of the israeli flag background  israeli born zohar norman founded sabra in new york with the israeli yanko family who at the time owned the tzabar hebrew form of ‘sabra’ brand of packaged salads and spreads sold in

murdered journalist daniel pearl  pearl bought out norman  major share  bought by strauss group pearl maintained   strauss formed jointventure partnership with pepsico pearl remains partner and chairman of the board of blue  white foods llc and its subsidiary sabra perhaps in the spirit of the original founding member of strauss being a member of the infamous haganah militia strauss group boasts of its support of the israeli military specifically the two brigades notorious for human rights abuses golani and givati  until late  strauss group stated on its website “our connection with soldiers goes as far back as the country and even further  we see a mission and need to continue to provide our soldiers with support to enhance their quality of life and service conditions and sweeten their special moments  we have adopted the golani reconnaissance platoon for over  years and provide them with an ongoing variety of food products for their training or missions and provide personal care packages for each soldier that completes the path  we have also adopted the southern shualei shimshon troops from the givati platoon with the goal of improving their service conditions and being there at the front to spoil them with our best products” under pressure from bds activists strauss group removed this statement from its website to replace it with a description whose concern seems more social than military “as part of its donations program the sales division of strauss israel has made a contribution to the men and women who serve in the golani brigade  the funds are designated for welfare cultural and educational activities such as pocket money for underprivileged soldiers sports and recreational equipment care packages and books and games for the soldiers’ club  yotvata our dairy in the south contributes likewise to the southern shualei shimshon unit” this move was clearly cosmetic camouflage however as its chairperson ofra strauss subsequently conceded that strauss group continued to provide food to soldiers during training and on missions while noting “for us israeli soldiers are not army israeli soldiers are our kids”  strauss sits on the advisory board of the foundation for former lone soldiers heseg an organisation that pays nonisraelis to serve in the israeli military forces  she is also an executive member of the board of governors of the jewish agency a zionist public relations organisation that recruits and financially supports new citizens and soldiers for an exclusively jewish israel there is little doubt then that strauss group actively supports this vision of a militarised zionist enclave  yet as a successful business it recognises the importance of selling an image  today you will not find a mention of strauss group’s military support  instead you will find the new marketing image focusing on its support of youth groups needy families and female professionals  showing a smiling semiveiled woman it even highlights a programme called “partnering with jasmine” which is “designed to promote jewish and arab businesswomen who run small businesses”  this guise of equitability is rather at odds with the stance of ofra strauss’s endeavours at the jewish agency   leading us to suspect that this “play fair” image is merely a typical illusion crafted to suit “brand israel” nonetheless sabra’s israeli born ceo ronen zohar has dismissed bds efforts saying “the protesters make noise but they make noise to themselves  it doesn’t have any influence on our business”  sure both strauss group and sabra still make a fortune in profits  but being in the bds spotlight has prompted them to downplay their roots in aggressive zionism  not only has strauss rewritten its “community involvement” for instance but sabra’s recent publication “hummus for dummies” describes sabra as “an american company” failing to mention its relation with the israeli strauss group  in fact sabra’s website describes its seemingly wholesome history as being founded “in  in queens new york as sabra blue  white foods” with the “simple mission of bringing the healthy and delicious cuisine of the mediterranean to people’s everyday diets”  new york  the mediterranean  not israel  and not exactly that simple  despite very deep israeli roots the sabra website only mentions israel once noting the strauss group happens to be headquartered there the value of boycotting sabra products lies in its power to hold israeli companies accountable for israel’s egregious violations of human rights and international law  sabra is just one element of a massive food products corporation  no matter how strong a boycott of sabra will barely make a dent in the corporate profits  but that is not the point  the goal of singling out particular products such as sabra hummus is to force public scrutiny of zionist israel  the ongoing boycott has already prompted the company to mask its identity  that begs the question of why that identity has become so troublesome    years ago consumer tweet join the conversation cancel reply notify me of followup comments by email notify me of new posts by email reply jack   year ago i don’t

from principles outlined by the founders of the movement and can be learned about on the site bdsmovementcom  strategic effectiveness targets of bds must be chosen with an eye for realistic and effective success in its broader campaign sabra has a clear and direct link to supporting the occupation all the more so since a controlling interest was bought by the prozionist strauss group in   context sensitivity  “bds is not a dogmatic or centralized movement—it is all about context sensitivity and creativity bds supporters in any particular context decide what to target and how to mobilize and organize their local campaigns” pepsico should certainly be pressured to cut all contact with sabra and any company involved in the occupation but currently students are focussing

boycott israel by refusing to buy the goods listed on this site you will avoid supporting the oppression of palestinians and pressure the israeli government into obeying international laws why did this campaign start in  over  palestinian unions and other civic groups issued a unified call for help to the international community a call for boycott divestment and sanctions bds it was a year after the separation wall had been ruled illegal by the un and israel continued to violate this and countless other un resolutions geneva conventions and other international laws without consequences or any sign of progress via diplomacy and political negotiations palestinian people were continuing to see their lands stolen by settlements their economy throttled by a blockade the daily humiliations of checkpoints and severe limitations on the basics of human life and dignity like water electricity and education all this under a brutal security regime permitting idf soldiers and israeli settlers to harass and kill palestinians with near impunity drawing inspiration from nelson mandela and the international boycott that led to the end of apartheid in south africa the occupied palestine and golan heights advocacy initiative opgai formulated a strategy that could be shared around the world the call for boycott divestment and sanctions was able to gain wide acceptance among palestinians and gains evergrowing international support including jewish and israeli groups through its emphasis on nonviolence and the core issues of israel’s violations of international law and human rights why does it work the economic pressure and the power of public opinion that is generated by a widescale international boycott is immense fw de klerk wrote that the boycott disinvestment and sanctions campaign against apartheid south africa led to a  decline in national economic growth this impact was not only from people avoiding south african goods but from a changed psychology that compelled companies organizations and governments to avoid doing business with south africa’s apartheid government as the bds campaign like the campaign against “blood diamonds” makes enough people aware of israel’s human rights abuses governments and organizations are compelled to act why does israel get called apartheid israeli policy regards arab people as a demographic threat much as the afrikaners regarded native africans arabs in israel suffer discrimination across all aspects of life over  laws clearly segregate arab people as second citizens including severely restricting where they can buy or rent property their political rights and access to fair judicial process israel operates separate education systems and allocates about  per year on each arab student compared to  per jewish student the legal center for arab and minority rights in israel has an informative list of the discriminatory laws in israel for palestinians living in gaza or the west bank the discrimination is even more severe and life is far harder than for their israeli neighbors living in wellsubsidized settlements built on the illegally annexed villages and farmlands these  million palestinians do not have israeli citizenship and so cannot vote in israeli elections they are subject to military justice which commonly detains palestinians without evidence or charge for months or years even if you are a child and regular reports of torture  daily life is subject to countless humiliations cars are required to have special licence plates and are forbidden from driving on the wellmaintained highways used by settlers only palestinians attempting a trip to the shop or hospital are commonly delayed for hours by about  permanent checkpoints and s more temporary ones where the whim of soldiers has complete power over  palestinian children have been born at checkpoints like in the south african pass system palestinians require a permit for any trip and these permits are often delayed or not awarded for no apparent reason hate crimes and malicious destruction of property by settlers is almost never investigated or punished palestinians in the gaza and the west bank are treated with disdain by the occupying force after john kerry has said israel risked becoming an “apartheid state”  archbishop desmond tutu is among many south african individuals and civic groups that have declared support for bds i go and i visit the holy land and i see things that are a mirror image of the sort of things that i experienced under the apartheid apartheid is clearly a contentious term that meets with strong objection from the powerful israellobby the network of organizations supporting israel’s current policies but understanding and communicating the apartheid structure in israeli laws and policies helps people understand the injustice occurring in israel and motivates them to do something about it why not boycott other countries with objectionable behavior a boycott against a state is a strategy to achieve real political change not just a personal commentary on something you object to the oppressed palestinian population has called for this boycott and its impact is already clear there are not many other serious calls from populations to boycott the country they live in china is one and individuals must make the decision whether a boycott would be

doing a good service by providing the names of these companies i hope you expand the list i support boycott of all israeli goods boycott of goods of companies doing business in israel not just the west bank and divestment from all such companies and all israelie companies however i have three objections  you do not mention palestinians in the diaspora shatat commonly called refugees and their descendants with a single word this is a grave oversight  you do mention apartheid within ‘israel’ against palestinians and hats off for this although you should perhaps give the link to adalah’s database of the over israeli  apartheid laws httpswwwadalahorgencontentview but palestinians within israel and those in exile receive from you less attention than you give to palestinians in the west bank and gaza and in my opinion this is not only wrong in principle but less likely to succeed than a blanket boycott aimed at israel as such with no qualifications and complications involving ‘west bank settlements’ and such  of the six companiesorganisations you highlight in some detail fully five of them are targeted because of their activities in the west bank ahava gs sodastream ariel university and jordan river dates sabra food products is the only company targeted because of its connection to israel in general your ‘full list’ contains  companiesorganisations if ariel u is included and about  of them have asterisks by their names indicating the ‘profit directly’ from activity in the illegal jewish west bank settlements there is no point in distinguishing between these companies and the others the cause of the plight of all three groups of palestinians that we can divide according to where they live – exile ‘israel’ and wbg – is… israel therefore nothing less than a full boycott of all things israeli makes sense the south african boycott was built on this model of full boycott of the guilty country but you are making false distinctions between injustice to wbg palestinians and the others making things moreover more complicated israel is ‘occupying’ all of historic palestine your emphasis on just the west bank makes the other palestinians less visible – for instance your own website does not see the shatat palestinians dividing palestinians into the three goups is part of the divideandconquer strategy in the first place and you should not play along with that one bit i hope you continue your good work but expand your philosophy to one of a simple principle – boycott israel thank you reply admin   years ago thank you very much for your thoughtful response blake alcott this “why” section is still being completed and your comments will help guide its development the link to that excellent resource has been added above cheers and certainly the list of products and companies itself has only just begun as the site’s name suggests the mission of the site is to be a resource for bds supporters and potential supporters seeking a list of companies to boycott making this list and keeping up with bds successes and news is our immediate intention we do not intend a comprehensive survey of the injustices israel perpetrates towards palestinians as there are better resources out there for that big job that said statements on this page should make perfectly clear that bds supports the right of return of palestinians in the diaspora given the aims of bds to pressure the israeli government to change its unjust laws and practices a blanket boycott and divestment of israeli companies including a cultural boycott and an academic boycott will clearly have the greatest impact the israeli government will not feel the world’s anger as forcefully if there is selective boycott of settlement companies only the site’s current emphasis on these settlement companies came about as these companies are the lowlying fruit – they are clear and obnoxious products of israeli illegality and are helping create a consensus of people around the globe who want to boycott an israel that produces them the fact that  eu countries recently stated that business in settlements is bad business seems to suggest governments are adopting bds tactics we do not promote any particular one or twostate solution that is for palestinians and israelis to decide when palestinians are equal partners in the negotiations we promote equality and justice for palestinians wherever they are reply blake alcott   years ago and thank you admin for your reply to my comment and for including the link to adalah’s list of discriminatoryisraeli laws if you’ll pardon my persistence i’d like to bring up the ‘refugees’ again those  million  outside of historic palestine who have the right to return and the right to ownership of their property in israel in most palestine solidarity organisations they are an afterthought yet the collapse of zionism follows recognition of their rights just as day follows night perhaps obviously i support the one democratic state solution which i think is the only solution consistent with bds’s  demands see the  call were these demands fulfilled boycott and divestment could be called off and de facto there would be one state with equal rights for all or absurdly there could be two democratic states which would merge for me all twostate solutions are just that a solution with two states – and one of them is the ethnocratic apartheid zionist state that denies right of return known as israel on the basis of universal values in my opinion all such racist states should be opposed and therefore by a process of elimination i can’t support any twostate solution so to wind this up i disagree that outsiders neither palestinian nor jewish israeli must stay on the fence on the onestatetwostate issue as long as one palestinian supports one democratic state i will support that palestinian you write of this issue that “that is for palestinians and israelis to decide” but

become one of the world’s premiere “security and defence” firms specializing in military electronics surveillance systems unmanned air vehicles uavs or “drones” and security systems it is a symbol for the israeli economy which essentially thrives on and fuels war repression and control in palestine and around the globe elbit systems is built on the expertise of the israeli ministry of defense research institute and has profited greatly from supplying the israeli military with a variety of equipment used to sustain israeli occupation of the palestinian people it produces the drones used in the wars and attacks against gaza and lebanon and provides equipment for the israeli merkava tanks the israeli apartheid wall which is crippling palestinian communities by isolating them in walledin ghettos has provided a massive source of revenue for elbit elbit systems provides “intrusion detection systems” for the wall in particular around jerusalem subsidiaries elbit electrooptics elop and elbit security systems supplied and incorporated lorros surveillance cameras in the ariel settlement section as well as around ar ram one product made by elbit systems “torch” is manufactured specifically for use on the wall elbit offers its experience in ghettoizing and killing palestinians to repress other people in  its american subsidiary kollsman inc won a contract to participate in the creation of the us – mexico border wall dubbed by activists the ‘wall of death’ on june th  the international court of justice ruling on the legal consequences of the wall not only confirmed the illegality of the wall under international law but also insisted that all state parties to the fourth geneva convention are obligated “to ensure compliance by israel with international humanitarian law” and thus “not render any aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by the construction of the wall” thus actors who aid israel in the construction of the wall are by association in breach of international law including as the icj ruling highlights the united nations charter international humanitarian law and human rights law many international financial institutions and pension funds have additional ethical guidelines or are part of international human rights frameworks such as the un global compact which include provisions against complicity with human rights violations and war crimes because elbit systems is knowingly participating in and aiding israeli war crimes and israeli occupation of the palestinian people investors in and partners of the security firm are by extension accessories to israel’s many violations of international law and human rights standards grassroots movements and campaigners have raised awareness of this relationship and several pension funds and financial institutions have pulled their investments from elbit the world is becoming increasingly unwilling to bankroll israeli war crimes campaign successes since the launch of the bds campaign in  on the first anniversary of the icj ruling against the wall the bds movement has made huge strides in raising awareness about the central role international support plays in sustaining israeli apartheid the campaign against elbit systems has had numerous successes and has become a key pillar of the bds movement in may  deutsche bank germany’s biggest bank announced it was ‘out of

their investment portfolios the swedish ap funds which manage assets of more than  billion kroner  bn in the state pension system fully divested from the corporation according to ap’s ethical council elbit was excluded because it “can be linked to violations of fundamental conventions and norms through its active development delivery and maintenance of a custommade monitoring system for certain parts of the separation barrier being built in the west bank” shares in elbit fell by  percent in the days that immediately followed the swedish announcement curiously israel’s response to the swedish funds was surprisingly weak only stating that it was a “regrettable” decision this muted reaction suggests that israel is struggling to find an effective way to counter the bds movement’s rapidly growing momentum ap’s refusal to be complicit in israel’s human rights abuses follows a trend started by norway in  when the norwegian finance minister announced that the state pension fund was to become the first major fund to divest from elbit because of its connections to violations of human rights and international law     a timeline of bust elbit successes  september  norwegian state

when choosing a target and developing a campaign strategy a discovering the size and importance of the investment both large and small investments have their benefits and drawbacks as campaign targets while the loss of a large investment has the opportunity to make a more tangible effect on a corporate policy larger investments make more difficult targets the loss of smaller investments while not making a huge financial dent may be easier to effect and are still effective in raising awareness about israeli apartheid and bds and create spaces for future campaigns note that the size and importance of investments are always relative to the overall investments an institution holds and the availability of alternative investments b assessing the likelihood that a given fund will divest based on its specific guidelines many banks and funds have ethical guidelines or have made commitments to ethical standards such as the un global compact elbit clearly violates international law human rights and the basic principles of the un global compact activists may choose to campaign for the adoption of some sort of binding ethical guidelines as a first step to divestment and this may be a good way to build alliances with other campaign groups interested in ethical investment c assessing the likelihood for divestment from a particular company based on a fund’s record of divestment some investment funds and banks are particularly conscious of their image as ethically responsible investors they may have a history of divesting from unethical companies the history of a financial institution can be useful in gauging the likely success of a campaign and can provide useful precedents d gaining support from stakeholders if a financial institution manages funds for a public or third sector body such as churches trade unions or universities these stakeholders may be sympathetic to the campaign and be able to provide additional pressure e using legal mechanisms international and human rights law can be a useful tool in divestment campaigns both with state and government investments and pension funds as well as when targeting private institutions the apartheid wall is being built in defiance of international and humanitarian law and in disregard of the  international court of justice icj decision as such companies in states that incorporate international law into their national legal system can be prosecuted in national courts for example veolia and alstom two french multinationals are on trial in french courts for violations of international law through their involvement in the jerusalem light rail system that aims to cement israel’s hold on occupied east jerusalem links to more information source stop the wall  factsheet on
