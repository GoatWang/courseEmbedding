noble purveyors of valuable advice at a favorable price” said david b loeper president and chief executive officer of wealthcare capital management “our patented process is unique to the industry since it doesn’t consider beating a benchmark as success instead we measure success against reaching clients’ life goals and dreams” noted loeper “the days of nonintegrated managed account platforms that focus on managing isolated accounts without taking a client’s life goals and other assets into consideration are numbered” said wealthcare capital management board member leonard reinhart “investors should not have to pay substantial fees for a platform that does not capture the full purpose of their wealth  achieving their goals advisors have long recognized that clients expect management of life goals and income distribution but they have not had a cost effective platform to execute these strategies the platforms that do exist have been very expensive and generally focused on the value proposition of the product manufacturer rather than the advisor wealthcares patented platform is the first that bridges this gap delivering lowcost investment strategies that are directly linked to each investors life goals while increasing the value of the advisor” noted reinhart the wealthcare umh is a comprehensive suite of services provided to financial advisors through wealthcare
