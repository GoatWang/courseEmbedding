youre responsible to pay for covered medical expenses some plans have coinsurances where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill and insurance will cover the rest copays state a flat rate for certain services like paying  when you visit your gp or a  copay for an emergency room visit once you reach your outofpocket maximum which will differ if youre an individual or within a family plan

provider or go online to see what your plan covers you can choose the best doctor for your needs understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expensessetting your appointmentmost doctors require a phone call for an appointment although some may provide online scheduling as well be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your

karatedopublicationsthe protease of herpes simplex virus type  is essential for functional capsid formation and viral growthjournal of virologyjune the herpes simplex virus type  protease and related proteins are involved in the assembly of viral capsids the protease encoded by the ul gene can process itself and its substrate icp encoded by the ul gene to better understand the functions of the protease in infected cells we have isolated a complementing cell line bmsmg and constructed and characterized a null ul mutant virus m the mutant virus failed to grow on vero cells and required a complementing cell line for its propagation confirming that the ul gene product is essential for viral growth phenotypic analysis of m shows that i normal amounts of the c and d forms of icp were produced but they failed to be processed to the cleaved forms e and f ii viral dna replication of the mutant proceeded at near wildtype levels but dna was not processed to unit length or encapsidated iii capsid structures were observed in thin sections of minfected vero cells by electron microscopy but assembly of vp into hexons of the capsid structure was conformationally altered and iv nuclear localizations of the protease and icp are independent of each other and the functions of na at least in part is to direct the catalytic domain no to the nucleus authors patrick mccannidentification of the herpes simplex virus protease cleavage sites by direct sequence analysis of autoproteolytic cleavage productsthe journal of biological chemistryjanuary herpes simplex virus type hsv encodes a protease responsible for proteolytic processing of the virus assembly protein icp infected cell protein  the coding region of icp is contained within the gene that encodes the protease and icp shares amino acid identity with the carboxylterminal  amino acids of the protease the hsv protease was expressed in escherichia coli as a fusion protein containing a unique epitope and the protein a fc binding domain at its carboxyl terminus the fusion protease underwent autoproteolytic cleavage at two distinct sites the size of the cleavage products containing the carboxylterminal epitope mapped one cleavage site near the carboxyl terminus of the protease corresponding to the proteolytic processing site of icp and the second site proximal to the amino terminus consistent with previous data the carboxylterminal autoproteolytic cleavage products were partially purified on an igg affinity column by virtue of the protein a fc binding domain and subjected to direct aminoterminal sequence analysis protein sequencing revealed that cleavage occurs between the ala and ser residues at amino acids  and  of the hsv protease the flanking sequences share homology with each other and are highly conserved in homologous proteases of other herpes viruses authors patrick mccannautoproteolysis of herpes simplex virus type  protease releases an active catalytic domain found in intermediate capsid particlesjournal of virologyoctober the ul gene of herpes simplex virus type  hsv encodes a aminoacid protease that cleaves itself and the hsv assembly protein icpcd f liu and b roizman j virol   we previously examined the hsv protease by using an escherichia coli expression system i c deckman m hagen and p j mccann iii j virol   and identified two autoproteolytic cleavage sites between residues  and  and residues  and  of ul c l diianni d a drier i c deckman p j mccann iii f liu b roizman r j colonno and m g cordingley j biol chem   in this study a series of cterminal truncations of the ul open reading frame was tested for cleavage activity in e coli our results delimit the catalytic domain of the protease to the nterminal  amino acids of ul corresponding to no the aminoterminal product of protease autoprocessing autoprocessing of the fulllength protease was found to be unnecessary for catalysis since elimination of either or both cleavage sites by sitedirected mutagenesis fails to prevent cleavage of icpcd or an unaltered protease autoprocessing site catalytic activity of the aminoacid protease domain was confirmed in vitro by using a glutathionestransferase fusion protein the fusion protease was induced to high levels of expression affinity purified and used to cleave purified icpcd in vitro indicating that no other proteins are required by using a set of domainspecific antisera all of the hsv protease cleavage products predicted from studies in e coli were identified in hsvinfected cells at least two protease autoprocessing products in addition to fully processed icpcd icpef were associated with intermediate b capsids in the nucleus of infected cells suggesting a key role for proteolytic maturation of the protease and icpcd in hsv capsid assembly authors patrick mccannthe cterminal  amino acids of the protease and its substrate icp of herpes simplex virus type  are involved in the formation of sealed capsidsjournal of virologyjuly the herpes simplex virus type  protease and its substrate icp are involved in the assembly of viral capsids both proteins are encoded by a single open reading frame from overlapping mrnas the protease is autoproteolytically processed at two sites the protease cleaves itself at the cterminal site maturation site and also cleaves icp at an identical site releasing a aminoacid aa peptide from each protein to determine whether these  aa play a role in capsid assembly we constructed a mutant virus expressing only prb the protease without the cterminal  aa phenotypic analysis of the prb virus in the presence and absence of icp shows the following i prb retains the functional activity of the wildtype protease which supports virus growth in the presence of icp ii in contrast to the icp null mutant delta icp virus the prb virus fails to grow in the absence of icp and iii transcomplementation experiments indicated that fulllength icp icp cd but not the cleaved form icp ef complements the growth of the prb virus the most striking phenotype of the prb virus is that only unsealed aberrant capsid structures are observed by electron microscopy in mutantinfected vero cells our results demonstrate that the growth of herpes simplex virus type  requires the cterminal  aa of either the protease or its substrate icp and that the cterminal  aa are involved in the formation of sealed capsids authors patrick mccannherpes simplex virus type  protease expressed in escherichia coli exhibits autoprocessing and specific cleavage of the icp assembly proteinjournal of virologydecember the ul gene of herpes simplex virus type  hsv encodes a protease which is responsible for the cterminal cleavage of the nucleocapsidassociated proteins icp c and d to their posttranslationally modified counterparts icp e and f to further characterize the hsv protease the ul gene product was expressed in escherichia coli the expressed protease underwent autoproteolytic processing at two independent sites the first site is shared with icp and results in removal of  amino acids from the c terminus of the protease the second unique site gives rise to protein species consistent with deletion of a kda fragment at the n terminus a mutant protease which showed no activity in a mammalian cell cotransfection assay f liu and b roizman proc natl acad sci usa   failed to exhibit autoproteolytic processing at either site when expressed in bacteria the inactive mutant was able to serve as a substrate in a trans assay in which the substrate and protease were coexpressed in bacteria this experiment demonstrated that the unique nterminal processing was mediated exclusively by the hsv protease icp cd also served as a substrate in this assay and was correctly processed by hsv protease in e coli this transcleavage assay will aid in the characterization of hsv protease and assist in investigation of the role of proteolytic processing in the virus authors patrick mccanninvestigation of the specificity of the herpes simplex virus type  protease by point mutagenesis of the autoproteolysis sitesjournal of virologyjanuary the herpes simplex virus type  hsv protease is cleaved at two autoprocessing sites during viral maturation one of which shares amino acid identity with its substrate icp similar autoprocessing sites have been observed within other members of the herpesviridae introduction of point mutations within the autoprocessing sites of the hsv protease indicated that specificity resides within the pp region of the cleavage sites authors patrick mccannrelease of the catalytic domain no from the herpes simplex virus type  protease is required for viral growthjournal of virologynovember the herpes simplex virus type  hsv protease and its substrate icp are involved in the assembly of viral capsids and required for efficient viral growth the fulllength protease pra consists of  amino acid aa residues and is autoproteolytically processed at the release r site and the maturation m site releasing the catalytic domain no vp nb vp and a aa peptide to understand the biological importance of cleavage at these sites we constructed several mutations in the cloned protease gene transfection assays were performed to determine the functional properties of these mutant proteins by their abilities to complement the growth of the protease deletion mutant m our results indicate that i expression of fulllength protease is not required for viral replication since a aa protease molecule lacking the m site could support viral growth and that ii elimination of the r site by changing the residue ala to ser abolished viral replication to better understand the functions that are mediated by proteolytic processing at the r site of the protease we engineered an hsv recombinant virus containing a mutation at this site analysis of the mutant as virus demonstrated that i the mutant protease retained the ability to cleave at the m site and to trans process icp but failed to support viral growth on vero cells demonstrating that release of the catalytic domain no from pra is required for viral replication and that ii only empty capsid structures were observed by electron microscopy in thin sections of asinfected vero cells indicating that viral dna was not encapsidated our results demonstrate that processing of icp is not sufficient to support viral replication and provide genetic evidence that the hsv protease has nuclear functions other than enzymatic activity authors patrick mccannidentification of a novel peptide substrate of hsv protease using substrate phage displayvirologyseptember the method of substrate phage display was used to select a preferred substrate from three monovalent display libraries using the hsv protease the display libraries consisted of four random amino acids six random amino acids and a biased library containing four amino acids from the p side of the hsv maturation site followed by four random amino acids a series of consensus peptides was synthesized based upon the results from these screens and tested in peptide cleavage assays an eight amino acid consensus peptide lvlasssf derived from the phage results was cleaved as efficiently as a mer maturation site peptide the selected amino acid sequences also allowed the design of a four amino acid paranitroanilide substrate for continuous assay of hsv protease similar to hcmv protease these results define p to p as a minimal substrate recognition domain for the hsv protease and suggest that p to p is the minimal substrate domain which all herpesvirus proteases recognizeauthors patrick mccannseparate functional domains of the herpes simplex virus type  protease evidence for cleavage inside capsidsjournal of virologyjuly the herpes simplex virus type  hsv protease pra and related proteins are involved in the assembly of viral capsids and virion maturation pra is a serine protease and the activesite residue has been mapped to amino acid aa  ser this aa protease encoded by the ul gene is autoproteolytically processed at two sites the release r site between amino acid residues  and  and the maturation m site between residues  and  when the protease cleaves itself at both sites it releases nb the catalytic domain n and the cterminal  aa icp a substrate of the hsv protease is the product of the ul gene as it is translated from a met codon within the ul gene icp cd are identical to the cterminal aa sequence of the protease and are trans cleaved at an identical cterminal site to generate icp ef and a aa peptide only fully processed pra n and nb and icp icp ef are present in b capsids which are believed to be precursors of mature virions using an rsite mutant as virus we have recently shown that this mutant protease retains enzymatic activity but fails to support viral growth suggesting that the release of n is required for viral replication here we report that another mutant protease with an amino acid substitution ser to cys at the active site can complement the as mutant but not a protease deletion mutant cell lines expressing the activesite mutant protease were isolated and shown to complement the as mutant at the levels of capsid assembly dna packaging and viral growth therefore the complementation between the rsite mutant and the activesite mutant reconstituted wildtype pra function one feature of this intragenic complementation is that following sedimentation of infectedcell lysates on sucrose gradients suggesting that proteolytic processing occurs inside capsidsauthors patrick

demonstrate a functional conservation of an between hsv and hcmvauthors patrick mccannna an autoproteolytic product of the herpes simplex virus type  protease can functionally substitute for the assembly protein icpjournal of virologyfebruary the herpes simplex virus type  hsv protease and its substrate the assembly protein icp are involved in virion maturation both proteins are encoded by a single open reading frame but are translated independently from coterminal mrnas of different sizes and are in frame the herpesvirus shell assembles around an internal scaffold which is subsequently lost during packaging of the viral genome the scaffold is composed of icp which is the major component and autoproteolytically processed forms of the viral protease containing sequences common to icp nb in the baculovirus system hsv intact capsids can be formed in the presence of the protease or icp indicating that the protease may substitute for icp thomsen et al j virol   this is further supported by the fact that icp in contrast to the protease is not absolutely essential for viral growth the processed intermediate of the protease analogous to icp is the aminoacid aa protein na which is an nterminal aa extension of the aa icp to directly examine whether na can functionally substitute for icp during viral replication we first constructed a mutant virus na delta in which  aa from the n terminus of na were deleted phenotypic analysis of the mutant showed that this deletion had no effect on protease function the function of na was further examined by construction of a plasmid expressing na alone and testing its ability to complement the growth of the mutant prb virus in the absence of icp our results demonstrate that na can functionally substitute for icp during viral replication authors patrick mccannlanguagesenglishnative or bilingual proficiencyspanishelementary proficiencyrecommendationsa preview of what linkedin members have to say about patricki have had the
