they serve as a tool for measuring the performance of the stocks in a defined industry country or other group however amidex funds which track amidex indexes are available as investment vehicles the fund is an index fund meaning that it invests in the companies in the index to replicate the composition of the index and to replicate the indexs performance because the fund will invest in a passive manner any volatility in the index will be closely reflected in the fund if the index declines the fund will decline with it if the companies in the index perform well the fund will also reflect that performance investing in an amidex fund should have similar overall performance minus expenses to the underlining index  funds may hold significant cash positions and therefore may not always closely
