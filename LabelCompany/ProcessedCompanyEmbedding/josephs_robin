applying humanist principles to practical experience in britain and internationally he sought to tease out of today’s structures clues for a more equitable tomorrow he saw beyond fordism – industrialised mass production and mass consumption – and neoliberalism with its emphasis on the private sector and free trade as chief economic adviser to the greater london council  robin led a team working for an inclusive democratic economy their london industrial strategy involved trade unionists and user groups in economic planning invested in child care and adult education developed cultural and creative industries gave a boost to cooperatives and other social enterprises and helped set up the london food commission whose work included the study of additives and the effects of food poverty learning from the smallscale enterprises of emiliaromagna the region of italy with bologna at its centre his team encouraged networks of decentralised production units with an emphasis on flexible specialisation particularly in the furniture industry this was the enabling state in action the influence of this approach went far beyond london and outlived the glc led by ken livingstone and abolished by margaret thatcher’s government in  ever enthusiastic about local democracy robin advised a consortium of local authorities that produced the south east economic development strategy which contributed to the  labour government setting up regional development agencies drawing on his glc experience robin wrote for marxism today on benetton britain  and life after henry ford  – explaining the postfordist transformation of the production process to the wider left aware of the widening gap between the market’s winners and losers robin argued that the new technological and organisational forms of production could facilitate democratic selfmanagement and collaborative creativity and help the transition to democratic socialism guided by bertolt brecht’s maxim that “truth is in the concrete” he organised a series of initiatives “in the interests of labour rather than of capital” selfrealisation for the marginalised and exploited for women for the young was at the heart of his mission in  with michael barratt brown robin founded the third world information network twin a trading organisation designed to ensure economic equity for producers in a global market and of which he was a director for  years out of twin came the trailblazing fair trade brands cafédirect and divine chocolate in  in kerala southwest india at a global assembly of liberation nuts and in defiance of the company’s perilous financial condition robin’s voice boomed out to  farmers “we are about people and community” liberation nuts lives on the twin group of companies now acts as a trading and marketing arm for more than  small farmers and fair trade sales in the uk in  totalled £bn it all began with twin importing cigars from cuba and rocking chairs from nicaragua letter robin murray obituary read more from  robin worked for two years with the province of ontario he brought canadian expertise in sustainability back to england founding the london pride waste action programme which started pilot schemes showing how costeffective and popular recycling can be with new methods and technologies across england recycling rates soared his book creating wealth from waste  was followed by the greenpeace report zero waste  in which he argued that product design for repeated use was as important as recycling his achievements in redirecting uk waste policy led the guardian to identify him in  as one of the “ people who could save the planet” with the deputy mayor of london he worked to establish the london climate change agency in  and two years later a green homes advice service for the young foundation he coauthored the open book of social innovation  a worldwide survey and investigation into ways new technology could reduce carbon footprints sustain health and alleviate poverty – work premised on the belief that only globally equitable approaches would avoid the catastrophic impacts of climate change his teaching at schumacher college in dartington south devon deepened his connection to ecology through economics combining his knowledge and love of farming and his faith in a sustainable future more recently he focused on work with cooperatives

journey began as a mixedmedia film maker we made always love which had a stop motion puppet band playing the song with a beautiful story running in the backgroundon the screen after this we tried a big gamble with a very challenging project the junky macaque as all the traditionally animated characters interacted with the stop motion animated props march  stepping into d our films were a little dark up till this point of time and we wanted to create something funny yet thought provoking so i started writing the story of i wish which was going to be our first d animated movie it was made for an inter arena film festival and it was completed with  months of sweat and blood we got an amazing response from the audience when it was screened at the event and we won third prize out of the ten shortlisted entries that came from different zones of north india present going international my work helped me get into an international indie project titled dyipoy and my role changed from an animator to concept artist the film is still in production and the artists working on it are from different parts of the world collaborating virtually now activism life is much more than the self i started finding happiness in giving a part of myself to things that i wanted to change i am an active member of the zeitgeist movement it advocates how a resource based economy can avoid all the
