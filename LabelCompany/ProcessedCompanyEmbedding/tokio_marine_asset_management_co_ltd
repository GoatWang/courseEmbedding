philosophy we aim to contribute to the promotion of a prosperous society and spur economic development through responsible investment and asset management as such we carefully consider not just the financial aspect of a company but also its nonfinancial background ie esg policy when making investment decisions in addition we aim to improve the midterm investment return of clients by taking an active role in pursuing and pushing for growth in our investee companies this philosophy is applied to all our leading actively managed japanese equity products and it is through constructive dialogue with investee companies that we aim to fulfill our stewardship responsibilities in the case of passively invested products and quantitative investment management products we aim to influence investee companies through exercising our voting rights at tmam we conduct thorough indepth qualitative research on investable companies and work hard to invest responsibly each individual company is examined and judged by the sector analyst on the basis of governance management strategy business performance capital structure and risk both social and environmental to further assess a company’s nonfinancial qualities specifically with regard to environment social governance and risk management factors esgr we utilise the research conducted by tokio marine  nichido risk consulting co ltd a group company which evaluates companies’ csr we are also strongly committed to shareholder responsibility and company stewardship rather than just making simple use of voting rights as a shareholder we express our views and opinions to the senior management of companies and promote the sharing of information in this way we take a proactive approach when engaging with investee companies and place a high importance on good corporate governance which in turn should improve midterm investment returns we strive for productive and open dialogue with management including independent external directors which centres on improving a company’s value and capital efficiency with the goal of encouraging continuous growth whether these are private meetings small meetings with management or results briefings we use every opportunity to actively engage with investee companies additionally for this dialogue to be meaningful our analysts and fund managers continually research and review each company and share this information internally one of our actively managed products is our engagement fund for this fund we believe in active communication prior to investing in any stock being considered for inclusion in the fund when we do invest we limit this to a concentrated portfolio of stocks in which we are able to invest a greater amount of our time and resources into each investee company than is possible with our other actively managed products in order to work with the company towards a shared objective principle  our approach to conflicts of interest at tmam the importance of building and retaining customer trust is incorporated into every aspect of our business to be a trusted and indispensable partner to our clients we prioritize client wealth when providing solutions and making any agreement to achieve this priority we consign duly selected distributors for promotions please also note that we do not consign any promotions to our parent company we act against potential conflicts of interest according to our internal guidelines specific categories of potential conflicts of interest and our approaches against them are outlined below  potential conflict of interest in purchasing securities issued by affiliated companiesin principle we do not invest in securities issued by our affiliated companies in client portfolios exceptions to this rule are where investing in these securities will be of benefit to our clients or where not investing in these securities will be a disadvantage to our clients for these exceptions we set internal rules and procedures where our cio approves individual trades case by case  potential conflict of interest in shareholder voting for affiliated companiesin cases of shareholder voting for our affiliated companies we have internal rules to exercise these voting rights advised and guided by thirdparty institutions in other cases such as proxy voting to invested companies we intend to avoid any potential conflict of interest by completing proxy voting decisionmaking process within our investment divisionplease refer to principle  objectives in exercising voting rights  potential conflict of interest in our employee’s personal tradingwe have guidelines for personal trading according to our employee’s job functions also we have personal trading rules to avoid the case where there can be a conflict of interest between these employees and our clients principle  monitoring of companies we invest in when investing in stocks we make decisions through the evaluation of company value taking into account both the financial and nonfinancial aspects of each company especially in the case of validating midtolong term growth potential we analyse the business strategy and growth drivers contributing to the increase in company value and confirm the superiority of its business model using our proprietary qualitative valuation sheet after making investments we continue to monitor these companies for their sustainable growth here we cover various elements such as business fundamentals externalinternal factors corporatefinancial strategies governancerisk management etc on a continuous basis to capture signs of changes and challenges in a timely manner  business fundamentals  short termlong term financial performance cyclical and structural factors  progress of implementing their strategic business plans and identifying gaps between plans and results  external factors  target market size growth demand and supply etc  competition number of competitors barriers of entry threat of substitutes etc  internal factors  costs rd purchasing manufacturing sales  marketing etc  differentiation quality brands rd technical strength etc  corporate strategies  firmwide strategies resource allocation business portfolio etc  businessunit strategies competitiveness expanding existing businesses incubating new businesses  financial strategies  deployment of cash flow investments for growth shareholder returns financial strengthening etc  corporate finance financing payouts attention to roe etc  governancerisk management  governance independent directors antisocial misconduct board meeting reviews etc  risk management including risks related to social environmental issues we believe that monitoring companies continuously and comprehensively as described above allow us to identify early signs of issues which potentially distract from shareholder wealth and of challenges in respect to midto longterm growth potential principle  constructive dialogue with companies tmam actively engages in dialogue with management which centres on improving a company’s value and capital efficiency with the goal of encouraging continuous growth in evaluating a company’s value we look at whether the company is capable of providing returns greater than cost of capital and its equity spread roe – cost of equity through the items listed in the above “principle  monitoring of companies we invest in” we attempt to accurately identify factors relating to the company’s midterm growth potential if we identify aspects that could damage that company’s value or ways in which the company could further add value in favourable business conditions we will relay that information to the company and communicate with them on how best to move forward examples in which we will hold dialogue with the company are as follows when a change in strategy is required due to a change in business environment   holding talks with companies on the need to switch strategies rationalise costs in nonprofitable businesses and improve profits when the environment changes from deflationary to inflationary when a strategy is necessary for sustained growth   holding discussions on the need to implement rd strategies and form alliances to achieve further growth when a company needs to adjust its capitalisation policy as part of its financial strategy   holding discussions on achieving a balance between investment for growth and shareholder returns for capital efficient cashflow with regard to governance and risk management systems   holding discussions with companies on the prevention of scandals on measures relating to business risks and succession and on the need for external directors these discussions will generally be held with members of management including external directors while we prefer to conduct these talks through private meetings we are mindful that these talks do not interfere with the regular duties of management as such we make use of every opportunity open to us for dialogue with the company including small meetings with management and results briefings we do not askreceive nonpublic sensitive corporate information from companies when conducting these dialogues in view of each company’s disclosure policy and we consider this information unnecessary for our purposes if we do receive nonpublic sensitive corporate information we treat it according to our internal guidelines principle  objectives in exercising voting rights tmam exercises voting rights based on our judgement of investee companies through constructive discussions and daily research activities with these companies exercising voting rights correctly we believe will lead to an enhancement of the governance structures resulting in medium to long term improvements in shareholder value and sustainable growth in terms of proxy voting in principle all the holdings companies under our active investment strategies will be included for examination of voting rights we recognise that our clients eventually bear the related costs from these votes hence we vote taking into account impacts of cost on performance given this we screen out target companies according to our investment policy for passive strategies as a general rule we choose to respect the management decisions of companies screened out in this way in addition to exercising voting rights on companies held in our active portfolios we also exercise our voting rights on companies selected by the responsible investment committee as the subject of focused research companies suffering from poor performance companies that have committed antisocial acts companies with issues in corporate governance etc andor scrutiny we have set out the following guidelines with regard to exercising voting rights  exercising voting rights for companies with antisocial behaviourwe define antisocial behaviour as violations of the law disrespecting public order displaying poor morality and actions to damage the social credibility of the companies which result in economic losses for shareholders customers and employees in addition actions resulting in social losses such as pollution are considered to be antisocial behaviour we will in principal exercise our votes to object to the election of a director or an auditor in charge of the department responsible for any antisocial behaviour this exercise however is not to deny the company’s decision immediately but to demonstrate our views by carrying out due diligence individually to ensure clarification of management’s responsibility and any countermeasures to pursue shareholder benefits  evaluation of company performance when exercising voting rightswhen making judgements individually we also take into account the company’s performance in general we will respect the management decisions of companies with good performance if performance is poor however we take a firmer approach to make sure the proper governance standard is applied companies with poor performance are defined as companies with recurring operating losses or with no dividend payout for the previous three years for these poor performing companies we will not take a shortterm view but a medium to long term view and exercise our votes accordingly  exercise of vote in disunityas a general rule we will not vote in disunity unless our clients provide particular instructions to do so however if these instructions are considered to be irrational we will voice our opinion to the customer at that timethere is also a provision for exceptional circumstances in the voting rights policy for the engagement strategynotification of objection votes are sent to companies who wish to be sent them individually and to companies which we believe will rise in value with this notification in this way we try our best to contribute to the sustainable growth of investee companiesfurthermore we sometimes use external advisory companies to get a better understanding of the consensus and we receive a report based on the guidelines of the advisory company we may use these reports as a reference when making voting decisions furthermore we receive reports from advising companies iss institutional shareholder services inc based on their specific guidelines we may use these reports as a reference in order to get a better understanding of the consensus when making final voting decisions while the dedicated esg specialist in the responsible investment group is the primary contact for all proxy voting matters the research analysts in charge of the relevant companies will also attend meetings related to proxy voting and share any necessary information with the specialist furthermore the dedicated esg specialist the other research analysts and the relevant fund managers share the execution of proxy voting in addition the responsible investment committee selects companies to be closely monitored due to poor performance antisocial acts or corporate governance issues and reviews the proxy voting for those companies in principle we provide our clients with reports about our voting decisions at fixed term intervals we also publish all our voting decisions on our website principle  regular reporting to clients in addition to the notification of voting decisions as described in principle  we report at fixed intervals the content of the dialogue with investee companies and how our stewardship activities are carried out as a general rule however these reports may be omitted in the case where clients do not require such information in respect to dialogue with investee companies we report on the constructive communication we have with these companies such as sharing midterm views on how to improve company value sharing and improving on company ideas and discussions with management if performance is poor we keep records of all dialogues through mom and we make reports based on these of course when we do send reports to clients we judge what information would be most beneficial from the client’s perspective and try to improve on this principle  organisational learning as a responsible institutional investor we strive to enhance our internal resources to exercise stewardship activities so that we contribute to our investment companies’ sustainable growth through constructive dialogue we make sure our efforts are substantial key decision makers in our investment activities such as the pms and the analysts for japanese equities respectively make significant efforts in order to conduct meaningful dialogue with investee companies in an effort to encourage this in addition to holding an internal seminar about stewardship activity we review our investment activities from a stewardship point of view regularly and accumulate organisational knowledge and experience by sharing individual activities which we think significantly contributed to investee companies’ higher value and sustainable growth also we make efforts to strengthen our stewardship capability through exchanging views with external organizations and holding dialogue with investee companies conducted by our dedicated esg specialist in the responsible investment group we aspire to lead the japanese asset management industry through participation in working groups in this area such as the principle for responsible investment the principles for financial action for the st century and the japan stewardship forum proxy voting  basic policy on proxy voting from the perspective of fiduciary responsibility pertaining to the asset management business as a basic policy on proxy voting we request invested companies address corporate governance in good faith for the interests of clients of discretionary investment management and beneficiaries of investment trusts we recognize the importance of corporate governance as a means to increase investment returns and seek to communicate our views as a shareholder to and share challenges with the company management beyond proxy voting as part of these efforts particularly in voting proxies we ensure we fulfill our fiduciary responsibility by expressing our intention proactively  purpose of proxy voting in voting proxies on the premise that the effective owners are clients and beneficiaries we make judgments solely for the purpose of contributing to the interests of clients and beneficiaries in our equity investment we put focus on shareholder value which companies create enduringly as a primary source of investment return corporate governance is particularly influential in three aspects i goodfaith management ii effective use of resources and iii adequate selection of investments and from these aspects we make judgments for the purpose of seeking to maximize the shareholder value through proxy voting we recognize that the company should be managed in view of balancing the interests of shareholders with the interests of stakeholders such as employees business partners and regional community rather than only seeking the shortterm interests of shareholders and that the longterm interests of shareholders can be achieved by establishing a good cooperative relationship with these stakeholders  proxy voting guidelines in voting proxies we make judgments and express our intention individually on the following main proposals among others
