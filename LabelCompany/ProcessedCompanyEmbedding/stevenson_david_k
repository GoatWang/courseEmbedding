research is focused on the study of the ontogeny and control of heme catabolism and bilirubin production in the developing neonate a better understanding of the role of increased bilirubin production in neonatal jaundice and the prevention of hemolytic jaundice has remained an overall objective of our program to this end we are actively investigating a more targeted preventive approach to the diagnosis and treatment of newborns who are high producers of the pigment andor unable to efficiently eliminate bilirubin thus leading to an accumulation of the pigment in circulation and tissues which may lead to irreversible neurologic injury control of bilirubin production is a logical strategy but has unexplored consequences for the immature mammal thus we are studying the pivotal role of heme oxygenase ho the ratelimiting enzyme in the production of bilirubin under a variety of commonly encountered pathological conditions such as infection and hypoxiaischemia as well as in antioxidant defense immune response and the regulation of hematopoiesis in support of the above interests studies are in progress which are designed to screen a variety of metalloporphyrins and other compounds for maximum in vitro and in vivo efficacy with minimal side effects to determine the ontogeny of the ho enzyme system in various murine tissues focusing on perturbations resulting from treatment with ho inhibitors and further to develop and test new technologies for noninvasive or minimallyinvasive measurements of in vivo metabolism that could be used for diagnostic and monitoring purposes

preterm labor and infections are the leading causes of neonatal deaths worldwide during pregnancy immunological cross talk between the mother and her fetus is critical for the maintenance of pregnancy and the delivery of an immunocompetent neonate a precise understanding of healthy fetomaternal immunity is the important first step to identifying dysregulated immune mechanisms driving adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes this study combined singlecell mass cytometry of paired peripheral and umbilical cord blood samples from mothers and their neonates with a graphical approach developed for the visualization of highdimensional data to provide a highresolution reference map of the cellular composition and functional organization of the healthy fetal and maternal immune systems at birth the approach enabled mapping of known phenotypical and functional characteristics of fetal immunity including the functional hyperresponsiveness of cd and cd t cells and the global blunting of innate immune responses it also allowed discovery of new properties that distinguish the fetal and maternal immune systems for example examination of paired samples revealed differences in endogenous signaling tone that are unique to a mother and her offspring including increased erk mapkactivated protein kinase  rps and creb phosphorylation in fetal tbetcd t cells cd t cells b cells and cdlocd nk

role of maternal hmox the inducible hmox isozyme on placental vasculature formation mice with a partial deficiency in hmox hmox were used threedimensional images of placental vasculatures as well as spiral arteries from hmox or hmox placentas were created by vascular corrosion casting technique and imaged by microcomputerized tomography microct the structures and morphologies of fetomaternal

an infants risk for developing bilirubin neurotoxicity relative to an infants age in hours because all infants have an impaired conjugation ability infants at greatest risk are those who have

thus reducing bilirubin production is a rational approach for its management the situation can become critical in infants with an associated impaired bilirubin elimination mechanism as a result of a

wkold suckling wkold juvenile wkold and adult wkold balbc mice mice were orally infected with various doses of a bioluminescentlabeled wildtype or mutant s typhimurium strain and progression of

respectively than those for adult mice at the lower inocula newborn mice showed disseminated systemic infection as indicated by the pattern of photon emission assessed by bli whereas no bioluminescent

furthermore as low as  log cfu could be detected by bli in tissue the present study demonstrates that susceptibility to s typhimurium infection decreases with age also we established that bli can be

certain mps are phototoxic and some increase transcription of ho the inducible ho isozyme therefore effective development of this class of compounds as therapeutics for treating pathologic jaundice will require rapid and integrated biological screens to identify the most efficacious and safe mps to study the safety of these compounds we assessed their cytotoxic effects and measured luciferase activity by bioluminescent imaging bli as an index of ho transcription first in live cell cultures and then in living transgenic reporter mice a total of  mps were first evaluated in the correlative cell culture assay based on results from this study  mps zinc protoporphyrin znpp and zinc bis glycol porphyrin znbg were selected for further studies in the live animal model in vitro bli showed znpp to be a strong inducer of ho transcription in comparison to znbg which showed minimal induction cytotoxicity studies revealed that znpp was phototoxic whereas znbg had no effect on cell viability in vivo bli showed that both znpp and znbg had minimal effects on the levels of ho transcription in the animals furthermore serum enzyme assays indicated that neither caused detectable liver toxicity these findings and especially those with znbg support the use of selected mps as therapies for pathologic jaundice coupling the high throughput advantage of cell culture with the capability of imaging for wholebody temporal analyses could accelerate and refine the preclinical phases of drug development thus this study serves as a model for understanding the effects of specific compounds in relation

controlled cortical impact injury model to determine the extent and mechanism of damage between ho knockout ko  and wildtype wt  mice the specific cellular and temporal expressions of ho and ho were characterized by immunocytochemistry and western blots ho was immunolocalized in neurons both before and after tbi whereas ho was highly upregulated in glia only after tbi ho activity determined by gas chromatography using brain sonicates from injured ho ko mice was significantly less than that of ho wild types despite the induction of ho expression after tbi cell loss was significantly greater in ko mice in areas including the cortex the ca region of hippocampus and the lateral dorsal thalamus furthermore motor recovery after injury as measured by the rotarod assay and an inclined beamwalking task was compromised in the ko mice finally brain tissue from injured ho ko mice exhibited decreased ability to reduce oxidative stress as measured with an feascorbic acidmediated carbon

likely reduce their potential therapeutic utility the differential effects of mps on the transcription of ho were therefore evaluated in living transgenic tg reporter mice of the compounds evaluated we observed that zinc bisglycol porphyrin znbg a potent inhibitor of ho enzyme activity did not alter ho transcription patterns in tg mice whole body images of ho transcription patterns did however reveal increases in ho transcription in tg mice after treatment with other mps heme and cadmium chloride cdcl intravenous injections of cdcl resulted in expression patterns that differed in tempo and location from those observed in tg mice treated with intraperitoneal injections spatiotemporal analyses of transcriptional regulation in living animals accelerated the assessment of an adverse effect

transitional phenomenon is a dynamic balance between the production and elimination of bilirubin these processes can be exacerbated by a number of pathophysiologic conditions which cause either an increase in bilirubin production rates such as hemolysis or a decrease in bilirubin elimination rates such as bilirubin conjugation defects the most dangerous circumstance for an infant is the combination of increased bilirubin production with impaired elimination these infants are at considerable risk for developing excessive and potentially dangerous hyperbilirubinemia and subsequent

systemic blood pressure as well as fetoplacental vascular tone and fetal blood delivery to assess the potential of vascular tissue to produce co we determined haem oxygenase ho activity through in vitro quantitation of co production with gas chromatography and its inhibition by  microm of chromium mesoporphyrin crmp in homogenate preparations of rat aorta and vena cava and human umbilical cord tissues we compared these results to ho activity in rat heart and liver we also discuss normalization of ho activity on a per mg protein as well as per g fresh weight fw tissue basis we found that both rat vascular tissue ho activities per g fw were equal but greater than that of heart x and less than that of liver x for human cord tissues ho activities of artery and vein were equal but greater than that of whartons jelly also ho activity in rat vascular tissues was x greater than that of the human cord tissues ho activity was completely inhibited by crmp in rat heart  per cent and liver  per cent but incompletely  per cent in both rat and human vascular tissues we established that it is unlikely that other nonhaem cogenerating processes account for this unique insensitivity of ho to crmp inhibition in fact high concentrations of other potent metalloporphyrin inhibitors affected vascular tissue ho even less we found that the degree of in vitro ho inhibition appeared to be related to the concentration of haem in the reaction medium we conclude that the presence of ho activity in cord tissues supports the possibility that co plays a role in fetoplacental blood flow regulation

metabolite with a mission clinical chemistry labbe r f vreman h j stevenson d k     abstract zinc protoporphyrin znpp is a normal metabolite that is formed in trace amounts during heme biosynthesis the final reaction in the biosynthetic pathway of heme is the chelation of iron with protoporphyrin during periods of iron insufficiency or impaired iron utilization zinc becomes an alternative metal substrate for ferrochelatase leading to increased znpp formation evidence suggests that this metal substitution is one of the first biochemical responses to iron depletion causing increased znpp to appear in circulating erythrocytes because this zincforiron substitution occurs predominantly within the bone marrow the znppheme ratio in erythrocytes reflects iron status in the bone marrow in addition znpp may regulate heme catabolism through competitive inhibition of heme oxygenase the ratelimiting enzyme in the heme degradation pathway that produces bilirubin and carbon monoxide physiological roles especially relating to carbon monoxide and possibly nitric oxide production have been suggested for znpp clinically znpp quantification is valuable as a sensitive and specific tool for evaluating iron nutrition and metabolism diagnostic determinations are applicable in a variety of clinical settings including pediatrics obstetrics and blood banking znpp analytical methodologies for clinical studies are discussed in addition to diagnostic tests and metabolic studies znpp has a potential therapeutic application in controlling bilirubin formation in neonates as a preventive

mammals viral promoters fused to firefly luciferase as transgenes in mice allowed external monitoring of gene expression both superficially and in deep tissues in vivo bioluminescence was detectable using either intensified or cooled chargecoupled device cameras and could be detected following both topical and systemic delivery of substrate in vivo control of the promoter from the human immunodeficiency virus was demonstrated as a model for dnabased therapies and vaccines in vivo transfection of a luciferase expression vector sv promoter and enhancer controlling expression was detected we conclude that gene regulation dna delivery and expression can now be noninvasively monitored in living mammals using a luciferase reporter thus realtime noninvasive study of gene

of brain tissue ischemia or hypoxia before the development of irreversible injury visible and near infrared light pass through human bone and tissue in small amounts and the emerging light can be used

predominant source in mammals and may be equally important in plants and lower animals the enzyme appears to be ubiquitous highly conserved throughout phylogeny and tightly regulated during development this and other evidence suggests that heme oxygenase has an important physiological role of which co production may be a part other minor sources of co include the oxidation of organic molecules this includes the following  autooxidation of phenols flavenoids and halomethanes  photooxidation of organic compounds and  lipid peroxidation of membrane lipids no longer thought of as a waste product only recent studies suggest that in the central nervous system cellular co production can influence cgmp levels through effects on soluble guanylyl cyclase activity cellular co production may also be linked to cellcell interactions and may be important in the cells response to environmental changes whether co will have a place similar to nitric oxide in cellular metabolism is still unclear but it is apparent that these metabolic relationships will become increasingly complex cellular heme oxygenase activity results in the equimolar production of co and bilirubin for

production of functional images of tissues such as oxygenation of brain during stroke fast algorithms are needed to allow diagnostically useful images to be generated under realistic conditions including the likelihood that transmission geometries will not be possible we proposed a linear algorithm while less than ideal may allow rapid reconstruction of images and avoid the pitfalls of recursive nonlinear solutions such techniques may also facilitate the use of varied but physiologic imaging geometries we found that linear backprojection tomography is feasible for clinical use

undergoing normal weaning and compared to gradients in rats receiving no intraluminal nutrients or rats receiving nutrients in elemental form in suckling animals preexisting jejunoileal gradients for dna and protein persisted through the weaning period gradients for lactase formed by rapid decline of ileal function and sucrase gradients formed by rapid increase in jejunal activities intraluminal nutrients in elemental form resulted in the formation of jejunoileal gradients similar to those in intestines of normally weaned rats the lack of intraluminal nutrients resulted in no qualitative differences in the expression of jejunoileal gradients for sucrase but provision of elemental nutrients resulted in increased jejunoileal differences for this enzyme the lack of intraluminal nutrients resulted in no gradients for dna less pronounced jejunoileal differences for protein and delayed maturational decline of ileal lactase which prevented development of jejunoileal gradients for the

abstract the regulation of heme oxygenase activity in the developing neonate is essential to the control of bilirubin production as well as intracellular heme and hemoprotein metabolism the coordinated activity of the microsomal enzymes heme oxygenase and nadphcytochrome c p reductase and the cytosolic enzyme biliverdin reductase is responsible for the degradation of heme the complete reaction sequence requires oxygen and nadph and produces bilirubin and carbon monoxide in equimolar amounts although heme oxygenase expresses a rather broad range of substrate affinities the oxidative degradation of heme is exclusively alphaspecific heme oxygenase is found in several tissues with significant activity levels in the liver spleen and erythropoeitic tissue heme oxygenase activity is inducible by heme and other metalloporphyrins hormones starvation stress toxins and xenobiotics heme oxygenase induction is generally considered to be the result of an increased protein synthesis and gene transcription this hypothesis is supported by recent studies of the heme oxygenase gene that identified inducer element binding sites responsive to metal administration heat shock and nutrient availability in the developing fetus and neonate hepatic heme oxygenase activity and mrna levels are elevated above that of the adult this suggests that the elevated heme catabolism observed in neonates may be associated with an increased transcription of the heme oxygenase gene the apparent induction of hepatic heme oxygenase during the neonatal period is probably the result of tissuespecific and timedependent transcriptional regulating factors including potentially hormones and heme several metalloporphyrins such as the tin and zinc porphyrin complexes inhibit heme oxygenase activity and thus have therapeutic potential for the treatment of neonatal jaundice recent studies suggest that the meso and bisglycol derivatives of these metalloporphyrins may be more

events in gastrointestinal ontogeny occur in the infant rat in association with weaning resulting in striking alterations in small intestinal structure and function although the dietary changes attendant to weaning are not essential for the initiation of these events dietary nutrients have been shown to participate in the maturation of some intestinal parameters in order to define more precisely the role of intraluminal nutrients in the regulation of small intestinal ontogeny a longitudinal study was conducted using a unique animal model in which intraluminal nutrients were excluded from the intact maturing intestine in vivo throughout the entire weaning period without major compromise in nutritional status the absence of intraluminal nutrients over the weaning period resulted in diminished lengthening and accretion of mucosal mass suggesting a slower rate of intestinal growth lower mucosal dna protein and mitotic indices in intestines of animals receiving no intraluminal nutrients suggested that the lack of intraluminal nutrients resulted in the blunting of the striking increases in cellular proliferation normally exhibited by the developing intestinal mucosa at this

particular tin protoporphyrin and tin mesoporphyrin have been proposed for this purpose because these compounds competitively inhibit heme oxygenase the ratelimiting enzyme in the hemedegrading pathway however these compounds are not only potent inhibitors of heme oxygenase but are also photosensitizers which can generate cytotoxic oxygen species such as singlet oxygen therapeutic regimens designed to avoid the phototoxicity caused by these and other metalloporphyrins have been suggested an alternative approach would be the development of derivatives of tin protoporphyrin or other heme analogs that are less phototoxic and are stronger inhibitors of heme oxygenase however our understanding of the molecular basis of heme oxygenase inhibition is still limited the response of heme oxygenase to specific inhibitors varies a great deal and depends on the organ and stage of development this may be a result of the differing proportions of heme oxygenase isoenzymes in different

used to measure indirectly the rate of bilirubin production by estimating the endogenous production of co which is formed in equimolar amounts with bilirubin in the catabolism of heme there has been no study to confirm that complete recovery of co produced in vivo from the catabolism of known amounts of heme occurs via pulmonary excretion we report here quantitative determinations of the
