there are more than  operational satellites in varying orbits around the earth including satellites used for communications  broadcasting military  reconnaissance meteorology navigation imaging  remote sensing research communications  broadcasting satellites typically orbit above the equator at about  kilometers  miles in what is called the “geostationary arc” from this arc the satellite appears to remain in a fixed location above the earth – a highly desirable feature that enables antennas on the ground to point to or access the satellite without tracking its movement and then receive or transmit communications signals because geostationary geo satellites operate at a very high altitude above the equator a single satellite can cover or see approximately onethird of the earth’s surface this makes geo communications satellites extremely powerful for broadcasting content such as tv programs one geo satellite can cover continents eg north  south america and three can fully cover the earth except for the extreme northern and southern latitudes geo satellites are often described by their longitudinal orbital location or “slot” such as telesat’s anik f at  degrees west longitude the orbital slot designations of “east” and “west” are in relation to the prime meridian that passes through greenwich london united kingdom there are more than  geo communications and broadcasting satellites in orbit today around the world main frequencies are cband –first band to be used in the commercial satcom industry uses  to  ghz frequency band for transmissions from the satellite to the receive earth terminal consistent frequency allocation worldwide with lowcost and wellproven earth station equipment supports video broadcasting cable and overtheair and telecom trunking minimally affected by atmospheric conditions telesat was the first to use cband in a domestic geo communications satellite   kuband – growth began in the s uses frequency subbands in the range    and  ghz frequency band for transmissions from the satellite to the receive terminal and allows for smaller dishes supports satellite directtohome dth and vsat networking still growing rapidly in most world regions mature in north america and europe some atmospheric effects particularly in tropical regions telesat was the first in the world to commercialize kuband on the anik b satellite   kaband – growth began in the s uses frequency subbands in the range ghz to  ghz for transmissions from the satellite to the receive terminal ka frequencies have the shortest wavelength of the three commercial fixed satellite bands and are most affected by atmospheric absorption short wavelengths allow for multiple spot beams each of which concentrates the satellite power into a small geographic area spot beam kaband satellites are well suited for twoway broadband services such as high speed internet access for homes and small businesses major consumer broadband services using advanced kaband satellites are underway in both north america and europe kaband spot beams can also support distribution of regional or local broadcast programming and interactive television services telesat was the first in the world to successfully commercialize consumer kaband broadband services using the anik f satellite about us who we are executive team why satellitebrief history advantages
