of pediatrics at the mayo clinic jan is passionate about basic medical research and its potential to transform human health and treatment of disease he has a longstanding interest in questions related to cell cycle control and cellular responses to stress he helped establish the concept that with aging and development of agerelated disease wasteful transformed cells that cannot divide litter tissues and organs in small numbers and demonstrated that clearance of these socalled “senescent cells” extends both healthspan and lifespan during his phd training jan pioneered technologies to knock down the expression of endogenous genes in mice and these techniques have proven to be particularly useful in uncovering the physiological function of mammalian genes essential to cell division or viability in applying these technologies to address the longstanding question as to whether aneuploidy is a cause or a consequence of cancer jan discovered that bubr an essential mitotic checkpoint protein that ensures faithful chromosome segregation is causally implicated in cancer progeria and aging studies originating from his desire to understand these mechanisms are credited with providing the first in vivo evidence that ppositive senescent cells drive aging and agerelated disease thus establishing cellular senescence as a promising target for therapeutic intervention dr van deursen

you age but without the diseases your parents got  a future in which it doesn’t hurt to grow old at unity we design therapeutics that prevent halt or reverse diseases of aging our medicines are designed to lengthen healthspan the amount of time you live in good health targeting a root cause when the world’s over population doubles to two billion in  one in four humans will be

could make many debilitating consequences of aging as uncommon as polio ageing and health world health organization  september httpwwwwhointmediacentrefactsheetsfsen from mechanisms to medicines our initial focus at unity is on selectively eliminating senescent cells cellular senescence is a biological “emergency brake” cells use to stop dividing  it’s an important antitumor mechanism because it prevents cells from multiplying out of control but after this “brake” has been pulled senescent cells remain in the body accumulating with age and unlike normal cells these cells secrete inflammatory molecules that harm neighboring cells and tissues unity has demonstrated in animal models that selectively eliminating senescent cells reverses or prevents a wide range of diseases including osteoarthritis atherosclerosis eye diseases and kidney diseases pipeline our senolytic medicines target vulnerabilities unique to senescent cells allowing us to eliminate them from the human body
