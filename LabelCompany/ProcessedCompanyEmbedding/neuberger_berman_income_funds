units entail substantial risks the values and prices of mlp units depend on business economic and other factors affecting those issuers in addition the mlp units may decline due to general market conditions which are not specifically related to a particular company such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions changes in the general outlook for earnings changes in interest or currency rates commodity prices or adverse investor sentiment generally an investment in mlp units involves certain risks which differ from an investment in the securities of a corporation holders of mlp units or similar securities have limited control and voting rights on matters affecting the entity in which they hold an interest in addition there are certain tax risks associated with an investment in mlp units see below and conflicts of interest exist between common unit holders and the general partner for example conflicts of interest may arise from incentive distribution payments paid to the general partner or referral of business opportunities by the general partner or one of its affiliates to an entity other than the mlp the fund is not responsible for operating mlps and similar entities and cannot control or monitor their compliance with applicable tax securities and other laws and regulations necessary for the profitability of such investments furthermore the structures and terms of the mlps and other entities may not be indicative of the structure and terms of every entity in which the fund invests although the mlp sector has grown significantly in recent years such market trends may not continue due to economic conditions which are not predictable or other factorsbecause of its concentration in mlp investments the fund is not eligible to be a regulated investment company under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code accordingly the fund will be treated as a taxable regular corporation or so called c corporation for federal tax purposes c corporation as a result the fund will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at the graduated rates applicable to corporations currently at a maximum rate of  as well as state and local income taxes as a consequence of this concentration the aggregate returns the fund realizes may be adversely affected if a small number of investments perform poorlygiven that the fund will be treated as a c corporation for federal tax purposes it will incur tax expenses in calculating its nav in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the fund will among other things account for its deferred tax liability andor asset balances  the fund will accrue a deferred income tax liability balance at the currently effective maximum statutory federal income tax rate currently  plus an estimated state and local income tax rate for its future tax liability associated with the capital appreciation of its investments and the distributions it receives on equity securities of mlps considered to be returns of capital and for any net operating gains any deferred tax liability balance will reduce the funds nav on the funds sale of a portfolio security it may recognize gains for federal state and local income tax purposes which may result in income taxes imposed on the fund no assurance can be given that such taxes will not exceed the funds deferred tax liability assumptions for purposes of computing its nav per share which would result in an immediate reduction of that value which could be materialshares of closedend funds frequently trade at a discount of their net
