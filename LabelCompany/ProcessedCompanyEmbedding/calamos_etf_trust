convertibles sets launch for its first etf an active equity strategy an earlier version of this article made reference to smartbeta funds calamos has obtained regulatory permission to market active etf strategies and the first fund is an active etf and not a smart beta fund we regret the error etf newcomer calamos etf trust a naperville illbased money manager on monday july  is launching its own brand of active etfs wrapper at a time when issuers are trying to slice and dice capweighted indexes to extract every ounce of beta they can from markets that are still reaching new highs calamos plans to roll out the calamos focus growth etf cfge which will invest primarily in growthoriented companies with market capitalizations of more than  billion that the firm believes offer the best opportunities for growth according to the regulatory filing the fund may also invest up to  percent of its assets in foreign securities and may invest in equity securities issued by other investment companies including money market funds it has a net expense ratio of  percent or  for every  invested calamos a mutual fund shop with a reputation in convertible securities is one of many firms lining up in the hopes of offering up active etf wrappers as the etf industry continues to grow the notion of active to some in the etf industry can extend to newgeneration smart beta indexes for example jp morgan last month launched its quasiactive smartbeta fund the jpmorgan diversified return global equity etf jpge  f but the calamos strategy is actively managed the launch comes at a time when the sp  index is up more than  percent yeartodate after it shot up more than  percent in  gains in stocks have been fueled by an accommodative federal reserve that continues to keep interest rates at ultralow levels additionally the us economy has shown steady if slow growth since it began to recover from the market crash of  to date the etf market has expanded to  funds with more than  trillion in assets under management according to etfcom’s data screener but less than  percent of those assets are in actively managed strategies news of calamos’ plans to launch its first etf on july  came courtesy of a nasdaq communique   etfcom data screener the dog days of summer are settling in and with them comes a lag in filings for new etfs we wanted to take this moment to reflect back on a busy first half of the year and take note of some of the more interesting offerings to hit the shelves this year including a gold etf that promises investors an exchange of their shares for the precious metal yeartodate there have been  new etfsetns launched compared with  for the same period in  and  in  according to etfcom’s data screener although the amount of is year’s new crop of funds is a dropoff from  issuers were seemingly more discerning about their product launches including the highly anticipated smartbeta fund the jpmorgan diversified return global equity etf jpge  f jp morgan’s maiden etf jpge is an index strategy yet has a quasiactive tilt designed to outperform marketcapweighted index funds the bank made clear in an interview with etf report that its presence in the world of etfs will build on its reputation as an active asset manager also noteworthy among the launch traffic is the merk gold trust ounz currency expert axel merk’s physical gold etf which launched on may  on the nyse arca the fund in registration for almost two years competes with wellestablished funds including the spdr gold shares gld  a and the ishares gold trust iau  a merk’s latest offering’s marketing niche lies in the fact that it will allow smaller retail investors in the trust to take delivery of physical gold in exchange for their shares in comparison physical redemptions in gold bullion etfs such as gld have been limited to authorized participants in lots of  shares which is  million worth of gold bars at gld’s current price of  a share another smartbeta fund the cambria global value etf gval brainchild of mebane faber has been a hit with investors garnering  million since launching in march the fund invests in companies from countries that cambria has identified as having undervalued equity markets including brazil spain and russia “many of these markets have declined    percent at some point so you’re investing in what many would consider to be terrible markets” said faber in a
