to their attempt to grow rapidly they cram an inordinate amount of work into each sprint and release they recently switched process in an attempt to be agile by incorporating sprints in doing so they extended our release cycles but added more work in effect rendering this extension in release time irrelevantyou can expect to often work on weekends and put in over time with little incentive other than continuing to have a job this is in part due to the amount of work they want done but also due to the minimal training of the system they provide to new employees the system is extremely complex
