walter banks tech gadgets chipmakers softwarebyte craft limitedsummarya close look at gopro problems from a developer’s perspective concludes that the primary cause is a broken but fixable software development processopen development problems dating back to the gopro launch remain unfixed and are accumulating in gopro’s current hero product linenick woodman may not have the skill set to manage product development but his passion for the gopro action cameras has maintained gopro’s public reputationhero product linethe development process at gopro needs to be replaced nick woodman is both part of the solution and part of the problem at goprofuture camera development at gopro is going to depend on interoperability with other devices and software gopro will need to have the discipline to be compatible with these public standardsa recent seeking alpha article gopro time for nick woodman to go focused on nick woodmans execution failures on gopros initiatives following the high profile public launch of gopro the article concludes that nick woodman should be replaced i am a long term embedded systems developer and have been looking at details of the product failures i believe that the complete removal of nick woodman may actually hurt gopros chances for recovery gopro nasdaqgpro stock has been declining exponentially since the fall of  losing roughly half its value every nine to twelve months the systemic failures and product delays are due to fixable problems with gopros development process gopro lacks the development discipline to deliver finished marketready products this is a problem that pressure from the investment community may actually be able to do something about the technical and public press have been defining what is wrong with gopro products my focus is much more limited to why are delivered products from gopro faulty there has been essentially no public comment on this aspect of gopros decline my perspective as an embedded systems developer and gopro owner is to look at root causes of the failures rather than the specific details of each fault the common cause is a development process that is missing structure and effectiveness what is development process development process is the formal management of development the components of development process include features and function progress metrics to track time lines and predicting completion dates development processes provide communication between company management and developers progress metrics are functionally similar to the role of accounting in a company they both serve the same purpose to plan future operations by tracking operational progress of business plans and to provide a cohesive measure of achievement failure to use formalized progress metrics in development is very similar to a company operating without accounting communication between management and developers is facilitated by progress metrics management may see a project that is currently a few days early on one of the development goals and two days late on another one developers looking at the same data will see that a specific software module is complete and a different module still does not meet required execution timing a common database provides both groups meaningful information to perform their respective functions development completion is determined as an independent measure by progress metrics this simplisticsounding goal is a lot harder than it seems especially for a softwaredominated project project metrics can independently evaluate project status against the requirements list development protocols cover the whole development activity starting with product goals including market expectations software design software implementation software testing and validated release candidates each independently determines component completion without proper completion determination a product will be released with compromised features  often essential features the investment community sees the operational failures at gopro as the problem this is an oversimplified point of view when the details are examined the operational failures they see are actually missing product development processes time pressure clouds clear thinking the hero black appeared to have overwhelming emphasis on the timely release of a new product in the false belief that skipping essential steps in the product development process will somehow help their time line it wont as a developer and veteran of many projects the hero black appeared to me to be a running prototype of a product that was released with the expectation that bugs and code problems could be dealt with later it looked like a product that had missed a requirements review had a rushed implementation phase and lacked adequate software testing essential for the smooth release of a new product gopro had failed some of the most basic development protocols essential for any product nick woodmans leadership nick woodman is gopros creative genius who excited both a customer base and an investment community with an innovative mounting system on a small high performance video camera i followed nick woodmans interviews at this years ces as he tirelessly promoted the recently released hero and explained away in simple terms the failure of the karma drone nick woodman to his credit has kept the public reputation of gopro relatively intact the founders of innovative companies are often reclusive technical types or gregarious promoters neither do well pivoting to the broader responsibility of managing a company company founders bring an essential product idea and very often dont cope with the development process that requires vision focus and incremental baselines of progress creative people are continually improving changing and revising ideas for their product this behavior is at odds with the skill set needed by development management too often the same skill set that brought the innovation in the first place is interfering with orderly product development the investment community describes nick woodman as not always making product announcements in their  or his own  best interest the same communities are quick to acknowledge nick woodmans product passion there is a gap not a complete failure in nick woodmans skill set interest and experience nick woodman is both part of the problem and part of the solution for gopro the earlier article is likely to remain a voice of frustration rather than a blueprint for successful change nick woodman mentioned the hero in a single sentence during the february gopro earnings call gopro gpro q  results  earnings call transcript yes we can confirm there will be new cameras and other accessories released during the year and new camera namely being hero no online comments on the hero can be characterized as anything more than wild speculation or wishful thinking coming from this single sentence specifically i can find no other public comment on the hero that can be traced back to gopro most of the media covered only the hero part of nick woodmans comment the other part of the sentence mentioning cameras and accessories could be far more important to gopros bottom line these will potentially attract new customers to the gopro core camera offerings the gopro fusion a degree camera was announced in april looking for beta testers where is gopro going what are the technical risks cute little video cameras can no longer compete in an isolated world like the welldeveloped point and shoot cameras standards on a number of levels are important gopro customers are becoming part of this need for component compatibility in fact many of gopros critics are starting to complain about this support requirement gopros future depends on them gaining control of their development process to create and release reliable products that meet their customers expectations gopro must master their own technology and support innovation enabling technology to attract new markets changes in fixing the development process cannot wait development deficiencies accumulate over time making the next project more difficult to complete the same accumulation also makes product support increasingly more expensive because old faults remain unresolved the next generation action camera degree surround dome image records video footage centered on the principal participant this makes it possible to participate in the image during playback the business model for these cameras is developmentintensive and will likely require cooperating innovative products the solution is likely already here we just currently dont recognize it as the solution related technologies include interactive static display technology that is currently used in realestate promotion google earth and virtual reality gaming display technology there will be no successful singlesupplier vendor for this technology the overlapping recreational application areas and social media needed for publication will not make this possible virtual reality  video and  panoramic stills are evolving camera technologies that are not yet mature in action cameras gopros announcement of fusion in april adds gopro to the growing list of twosensor approaches to this gopro is going to be forced to be active potentially in a leadership position of emerging interactive file format standards and interactive supporting software the adoption of a recognized vr  video solution by the public would be a quantum leap in perceived function without a significant user cost increment if that happens it could reduce the demand for conventional video action cameras significantly in a very short period of time key technical indicators i would look for how gopro fixes the development product process as a product developer i would measure how effectively the development process is being repaired by monitoring it over the next few months as an indicator of change one of the leading technical indicators is how the accumulated software issues in the hero are being handled in new software updates i will look for robust support for sd cards and three innovationenabling technologies usb wifi and bluetooth these are primarily communication and device handlers whose specifications and requirements are outside of the hands of gopro all are currently flawed in gopro products their flaws cannot be explained away by gopro saying this was our plan gopros implementation of these technologies will be high on my list to judge where gopro is going all of the enabling technologies are essential to new product developments and to the transition of the hero black to a competitive point and shoot product gopro will face a future customer base that combines their high tech toys in various ways that will publicly define them as individuals on social media what is going to happen at gopro there are several possible outcomes  gopro can fix their development process and get on track to produce stable and reliable products integrating into the action camera and point and shoot markets from my point of view nick woodman is an essential ingredient to maintain gopros public image as this transition takes place the process may take a year to show results it would be hard to put a good development process into place for one thing it is unlikely that nick woodman alone can do it he has had a few years and it is still an unsolved problem it is also in my opinion unlikely that gopro would survive without his promotion  if gopro fails to fix their development process it is hard to see any development project that would not exacerbate the problem the incomplete development will continue to accumulate in new products gopro will be marginalized by competitive offerings this is the reason that i will track innovative support technology as a leading indicator of their future capability competitors will come in two forms they will create an innovationfriendly version of the gopro camera with a combination of the gopro camera capabilities and broad functional familiarity of the current crowd of digital and point and shoot cameras alternatively they will move away from the gopro video camera and find imaging technologies to create interactive viewing solutions completely outside of gopros dominance  the third possible outcome that is to combine gopros ip with an established developmentcapable company i am a developer not an investor and this possibility is well outside my experience or expertise quite a few established camera companies have created action camera products that have not succeeded for the same reason that the karma drone initially failed it is difficult to enter an established market without significant experience virtual reality companies have a similar problem with entering into the imaging markets they generally have a lot of experience in dealing with image manipulation in computationally intensive realtime software for these companies buying gopros experience might be a good investment gopros future depends on getting the development fundamentals fixed disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for it other than from seeking alpha i have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article additional disclosure i have a perspective on gopro from an embedded systems developer point of view i agree with the earlier article that gopros product introduction is flawed the problem i see is the development process is broken and could be fixedabout this

for the surfing club he earned a bachelors degree in visual arts and a minor in creative writing from the university of california san diego in  after school woodman founded two startups both of which never fully made it off the ground the first was a website called empowerallcom which attempted to sell electronic goods for no more than a  markup and the second was funbug a gaming and marketing platform that gave users the chance to win cash prizes woodman took the lack of success from both companies personally after failing to reach success on his own nick went home and received a  investment from his father an investment banker in silicon valley  and used his parents connections to venture capital to launch his career as the head of gopro careeredit while on hiatus in australia and indonesia on a surf trip he used a mm camera attached to the palm of his hand by a rubber band to try to capture his surfing activities on film seeing that amateur photographers like him – who wanted to capture quality action photos of their activities – had difficulties because either they could not get close enough to the action or were unable to purchase quality equipment at affordable prices his trip became his inspiration to found gopro his solution was to develop a belt that would attach the camera to the body woodman and his future wife jill financed the business by selling shell necklaces they bought in bali for  from their car along the california coast for  his mother loaned him  and let him borrow her sewing machine which he used to sew camera straps while experimenting with early designs his dad loaned him an additional  which woodman immediately paid back out of company sales his desire for a camera system that could capture close up footage inspired the gopro name the original cameras he developed were pointandshoot mm film cameras which mounted to the users wrist woodman would go about selling his products while using his  volkwagen bus that he named the buscuit as his mobile home the product has since evolved into a compact digital camera that supports wifi can be remotely controlled has waterproof housing records to a micro sd card and is affordable to the average action sports enthusiast – woodman would often act as the test engineer for their earlier products completing tasks such as attaching a gopro to a car and driving at speeds of over  mph in  he made his first big sale when a japanese company ordered  cameras at a sports show thereafter sales doubled every year and in  gopro sold  million cameras in  woodman appeared on

recording modes higher bitrates no white balance applied etc etc the black edition continues to include a wifi remote it does not have the ability to record  fps in p and wvga modes it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions this is an intentional firmware limitation as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate the battery runtime of hero black edition is significantly longer than hero black edition but – lower than the battery runtime of the older hero and hero the silver edition has video modes of p and p and can shoot mp stills at up to  fps in contrast to the black edition the silver edition can record at  fps or higher in all supported resolutions hero silver edition also has about  longer battery runtime during recording than hero black edition they both use the same batteries the difference in runtime depends on the resolutionfps combination and whether wifi and gopro mobile

were under us billion at the time the company kept the details of the filing confidential now the prospectus has been approved by the sec and the ipo is underway and of course its details are now made public for the first time – including the fact that it already achieved revenues of just under us million in its fiscal year to december st  this was just below the us billion threshold which under the  jobs act allowed them to claim confidentiality for the filing read more about nick woodman  nick woodman worth  billion now arrives on forbes  american rich list the prospectus also indicates gopro hopes to raise a minimum of us million from the offering which is likely to be hugely successful as it is now revealed to already be a very profitable company in  gopro recorded net income of us million after launching its first high definition product nearly five years ago in july  gopro has sold  million of its hero cameras with  of these being sold in the last year alone as their concept of personal mountable rugged take anywhere action video cameras has taken off gopro products are popular in part because of the attention that has been placed on simplifying their subsequent digital work flow as well which can be a disincentive for other video systems making them more accessible to their users gopro early on took the trouble to develop its own software gopro studio which enables its customers to quickly edit either simple or complex videos and even create videos from timelapse photo sequences as at march   the prospectus indicates there had been more than  million downloads of gopro studio to get to this point gopro has to date received substantial venture funding from top ranking vc firms such as us venture partners riverwood capital sageview capital steamboat ventures and walden partners taiwan tech manufacturer hon hai precision aka foxconn also invested in the company in  at a valuation that was placed on the company then of around us billion this transaction reportedly made the company’s founder nicholas woodman a billionaire on paper for the first time and the prospectus reveals he and his family still own just under  of the company’s shares out in the wild gopro video gear has become just about ubiquitous these days for many amateur and major professional sporting activities and as well for parts of the action scenes in lots of motion pictures as well while gopro is today clearly a hardware company it also claims to be positioning itself in the future as a media company in the prospectus the company says for example “we are investing to scale gopro as a media entity ” though presently it does not makes any money that way gopro’s media initiatives include its popular youtube channel where thousands of amateur video clips are posted some of which are very popular gopro also regularly commissions a number of professional videos made with its cameras in order to to promote the experience to its wider target audiences the gopro network now even includes a channel on virgin america’s inflight entertainment system essentially an endless loop of some of the best gopro videos is popular for bored passengers to watch sometimes repeatedly gopro even gives all the content to virgin for free at the moment the company has also announced its own xbox channel something that could also eventually bring some monetization through advertising and the option to buy gopro products and with a cut offered to microsoft along the way nevertheless these initiatives all primarily exist to encourage people to buy the hardware just as itunes really started simply to drive sales of apple’s hardware as well accordingly gopro indicates “we expect to continue to derive the substantial majority of our revenue from sales of cameras and accessories for the foreseeable future” nevertheless one never knows as itunes later itself become increasingly a substantial revenue driver for apple pricing and other details for the new initial public offering have not yet been set but will almost certainly see another step up from the  foxconn transaction even after the dilution of a new offering the woodward family will still maintain control of the company due to a dual class of voting share structure the company became a strong cash producer in  generating over us million from operations accordingly it ended up with us million in cash sitting in the bank at march st  total outstanding current and long term debt as of the same date was actually about the same amount also at us million thus gopro’s net debt is therefore about zero at that date the corporate loans in its balance sheet had been raised originally to fund substantial distributions to shareholders along the way the new offering under the ipo is expected to be for a minimum of us million this will include providing liquidity for existing shareholders as well as new money that will go into the company’s treasury depending of course on the final size of the offering and the split between new money raised and money directed towards selling shareholders that portion of the proceeds from the new offering that goes to the company is stated to be intended to be used to repay term debt and for “general corporate purposes” jpmorgan citigroup and barclays are the lead underwriters for the proposed share offering   – read more about gopro ipo nicholas  nick woodman

– woodman honored for allowing sports enthusiasts to capture and share their experiences through the eyes of a dynamic video camera – nicholas  nick woodman getty – nicholas  nick woodman founder and ceo of gopro has been named the national ey entrepreneur of the year  retail and consumer products award winner  by ernst  young  woodman was recognized for developing a highdefinition video camera for extreme sports that has evolved into one of the most engaged brands in social media today he was honored at the entrepreneur of the year awards gala  the forum is the nation’s premier gathering of highgrowth marketleading companies awards were given in  additional categories in addition to woodman the ey entrepreneur of the year retail and consumer products finalists in the us were daniel lubetzky founder and ceo  kind healthy snacks  based in new york david sokolsky president ceo  daisy brand based in dallas texas and  jim weber ceo  brooks sports inc  based in bothell wash the winners were selected by an independent panel of judges and from more than  regional award recipients “we are pleased to honor nicholas woodman with this esteemed award ” said bryan pearce ey americas director entrepreneur of the year “he was able to see early in the game just how important it is to surround yourself with the right team — people who possess the strengths that you don’t the great minds nicholas brought to the table under his leadership have made gopro a huge success” walking before running ironically woodman’s inspiration to develop gopro came as he was trying to recover from the failure of his first internet business  a marketing startup he’d launched after graduating from college while he raised some  million in venture capital and made all the right moves the company didn’t survive the dotcom crash  failure was one thing but the stress of losing other people’s money forced woodman to reassess his goals and focus on building a business based on a true passion surfing an avid surfer woodman had long realized how frustrating it was for surfers to get great shots and footage of themselves while they were riding the waves all that was available at the time were disposable cameras attached to their wrists however the photo quality was terrible and the cameras often flew off sometimes hitting surfers in the face to counter that possibility woodman thought of developing a wearable camera that could be secured with a wrist strap and worn during extreme sports like skiing and surfing just as important the camera would take highquality photos that concept turned into the catalyst for woodman to found gopro which now holds a commanding share of the us video camera market — up to  when specialty channel shops are included from beads to seed in the beginning moving from concept to development was difficult woodman and his wife sold bead and shell belts from bali to raise seed money woodman kept the company small hiring family members and close friends who shared his passion he also put in hour days sometimes not even sleeping as he perfected the product when the first camera was ready woodman personally drove to surf shops to demonstrate and sell the camera the small company grew steadily but when business really began to pick up woodman recognized he couldn’t do everything himself and sought help from beyond his inner circle bringing in outside talent helped transform the business with a strong executive team in place gopro has rapidly built out its infrastructure increasing headcount from  employees to more than  within the last year becoming a social media icon at its start gopro was primarily a wrist camera for surfers youtube changed the equation with video quality replacing photo quality as the primary driver of buyer decisions gopro met the shift in consumer interests and focused on building outstanding video cameras  introducing its first highdefinition video camera in  youtube and social media have also become a powerful marketing channel turning gopro into one of the most engaged brands in social media according to inc as measured by brand audience rate of engagement gopro’s passionate fan base of five million customers has racked up  million views on the gopro network on youtube gopro videos like the one of a mountain biker in africa colliding with a gazelle have gone viral to the tune of more than  million hits gopro’s popularity on youtube also confirms that the company is selling more than just cameras — it is also helping customers share meaningful experiences online   about ey

take good action shots of himself or his friends while they were catching waves surfers were using disposable cameras strapped to their wrists with a rubber band it would often fly off in the middle of the action and hit them in the face woodman wanted to invent a strong adjustable elastic band that could secure a camera to a persons body as they participated in an extreme sport to fund the project woodman and his nowwife purchased  belts made of sea shells from a bali market each cost them  when the woodmans returned to the states they drove up and down californias coast selling the
