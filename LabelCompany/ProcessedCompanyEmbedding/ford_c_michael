credit reuters send us a letter have an opinion about this story click here to submit a letter to the editor and we may publish it in print updated   pm et  adds details detroit  ford motor co today said its michigan assembly plant will stop building the focus and cmax in  in a sign that the automaker sees slow demand for small cars to continue in the foreseeable future ford did not say where it would move focus and cmax assembly or which vehicles would replace them at the plant in wayne mich which employs more than  workers both the focus and cmax are due to be redesigned for the  model year “we actively are pursuing future vehicle alternatives to produce at michigan assembly” ford said in a statement “and will discuss this issue with uaw leadership as part of the upcoming negotiations” uaw leaders who are scheduled to formally open talks with ford on july  posted a letter to their members on facebook saying they are “extremely confident” that ford would assign a new product to michigan assembly and “maintain a full production schedule” at the plant the news comes several weeks after ford eliminated the plant’s third shift and began cutting about  jobs there reviewing options we currently are reviewing several possible options for the focus and cmax and will share details once our studies are complete” ford spokeswoman kristina adamski wrote in an email ford currently builds the focus in nine plants on four continents including two in china it was the topselling nameplate in the world in  with sales of nearly  million because michigan assembly is one of ford’s only us plants with any significant excess capacity the announcement likely means they are headed to mexico or overseas sources have told automotive news that ford may move its smallest car the fiesta from cuautitlan mexico to thailand in  which would allow for focus production at the mexico plant bloomberg and the detroit news reported that union members at the plant were told that assembly of the vehicles would move to a foreign country several uaw members commenting on the union’s facebook posting dismissed the announcement as prenegotiation “scare tactics” major investment ford spent  million to convert the former michigan truck plant into michigan assembly a modern flexible plant that was a centerpiece of the “smallcar offensive” announced by former ceo alan mulally after suv sales plunged the cost of that overhaul and other actions was covered by a  billion loan from a us energy department fund to encourage production of more fuelefficient vehicles “the transformation of michigan assembly plant embodies the larger transformation under way at ford” mulally said in a may  statement “this is about investing in modern efficient and flexible american manufacturing it is about fuel economy and the electrification of vehicles it is about leveraging our expertise and vehicle platforms around the world and partnering with the uaw to deliver bestinclass global small cars it is about skilled and motivated teams working together in new ways to create the future of automobile manufacturing in the united states” but with gasoline prices down significantly from a year ago focus sales declined  percent in june and  percent in the first half of  cmax sales have fallen  percent this year the cmax available as either a traditional or plugin hybrid has struggled to attract buyers since ford reduced the car’s fueleconomy ratings by  mpg in  and compensated owners for overstating its mileage in ads and window stickers contact automotive news tags manufacturing ford

in the american market ford was getting serious about hybrids as well as a result both the ford cmax energi plugin hybrid and the cmax hybrid were unveiled at the north american international auto show in  both models are based on the european diesel and gasolinepowered versions and same as the europen cmax have only five seats the core basics of the mpv’s hybrid system are similar to those of the toyota prius and the old ford escape the gasoline engine operates in perfect tandem with a twomotor planetarygear cvt that provides traction power to the car’s wheels by means of an electric motor and changes transmission modes by using the combustion motor instead of a l fourcylinder atkinsoncycle engine found in the ford escape the cmax features a l engine joined with an ecvt electronically controlled continuously variable transmission aside from the fact that both the allnew hybrid and energi plugin hybrid run on a combination of gas and electric power the versions have many other similarities each model also features such efficient parts and systems as a highvoltage lithiumion battery though the cmax energi has a bigger one that is sure to run at higher speeds and for longer periods the smartgauge with ecoguide that is an advanced instrument panel to provide drivers with the information they need to make smarter driving decisions the sync with myford touch which is a voiceactivated technology aimed to help you concentrate on the way ahead while staying connected to the world what an owner of the cmax is guaranteed to get is the sporty performance and style of a  ford vehicle along with the additional benefit of leaving a small carbon footprint the main difference between the cmax hybrid and energi plugin hybrid is that the latter is the first plugin production automobile for ford in other words the cmax energi while operating like a conventional hybrid is like a ‘hybrid plus’ its plugin capability allows to charge the battery by using either a typical volt or a volt outlet upgraded with available electric vehicle supply equipment also this model can boast of an epaestimated rating of  combined mpge miles per gallon equivalent which is the most efficient combined mpge in comparison to its competitors in addition ford equipped its cmax energi with a button set in the center stack that offers drivers an opportunity to switch the operation of their vehicle between three modes including the conventional hybrid mode the powertrain combines gasoline and electric engine power as appropriate electriconly driving without using combustion engine power or a batterysaving mode the battery power is reserved for later use whichever model of the ford cmax suits your needs and lifestyle both are guaranteed to provide performance efficiency style and comfort to its owner each and every part or accessory found on the vehicle either interior or exterior is designed with a strong attention to detail starting from a sophisticated steering

grayenstanced demon camber you may know it as onicamber youve seen the look and whether you like it or not is totally beside the point the great thing about this stanced look is that it gets your attention from the interviews weve read with owners and drivers of these machines that is exactly what they are after theyve said that its all about being noticedcustom wheels and tires have been around for years and continue to be immensely popular but customizers are always looking for ways to be ahead of the game to be first with a trend it is no longer enough to have the most outrageous set of rims that look can be taken to the next level with stanced cars technically demon camber is extreme negative camber lets explain what negative camber is and how that effect is achievedcamber is one of the alignment specifications which affect the angle or tilt of the wheel compared to the vehicles body if you are looking directly at the front or rear of a car the angle of the tire relative to the ground is the camber look at the illustration below negative camber means that the tops of the tires lean in relative to the cars body zero camber means the tire is perfectly perpendicular to the ground positive camber means the tops of the tires are leaning outmarch  pickup truck cab and bed sizestimothy zahlamericans love to have choices buying a dress shirt decide solid or stripe short
