byron l smith chicagos billionaire smith family anoints its next generation crains — inherited wealth has riven many families such as chicagos pritzkers but another billionaire clan has just anointed its fifthgeneration scion without so much as a public ripple the smith family whose morethanbillion stock portfolio is rooted in northern trust corp and illinois tool works inc is now represented on these boards by david h b smith jr a yearold lawyer and greatgreatgrandson of northerns founder byron l smith universally private to the point of masonic secrecy the smiths also are chicagos most durable corporate dynasty with a history that dates to a time when the swifts armours and mccormicks were the citys new money byron l smiths father launched the familys empire in  when he started a forerunner to continental bank byron l smith started northern trust in  and with his sons established itw in  today the scores of descendants share a fortune that is second only to the pritzkers locally david smith who declined to be interviewed has joked with friends about being the black sheep of a family known for its republican freemarket ideology he worked for a federal regulator the securities and exchange commission from  to  but his time there as a staff attorney and associate director was part of a career steeped in corporate governance that made him a logical heir to his yearold uncle harold b smith jr “the real trick in fourth fifth and sixth generations of family businesses is maintaining the pride and identity in the extended family for the business especially its culture and values” says john ward codirector of the center for family enterprises at northwestern universitys kellogg school of management staying busy one reason the smiths have remained intact appears to be their work ethic which squelches any sense of entitlement david smiths father and his uncles worked as executives at glenviewbased itw—in runofthe mill offices no less—though they easily could have lived on their inheritances the familys chieftains also seem to ensure no member feels left out every year the entire family is invited to private presentations by the ceos of northern and itw most recently at the bank on dec  former itw chairman and ceo james farrell says about  family members including some from younger generations would gather around a conferenceroom table for about an hour amid coffee and soft drinks hed take questions which he says were generally friendly and supportive the robust returns on the familys investments undoubtedly have helped maintain the peace too over the past  years northerns stock has jumped  in value while itws has soared  thats triple the gain of the standard  poors  stock index over the same span the family receives some  million in dividends a year northern was the largest bank in the us to retain its dividend during the recent financial meltdown quotea reason the smiths remain intact appears to be their work ethic which squelches any sense of entitlement the smith family trusts which include holdings of venture capitalist robert mccormack  a smith family member who also is a director at northern and itw own about  of the chicagobased bank and  of the diversified manufacturer in turn their cohesiveness has enabled northern to survive as chicagos last major independent bank and itw to weather economic recessions and make dozens of industrial acquisitions a year since  david smith has been general counsel of the mutual fund directors forum a washington dcbased group that promotes director independence in a conflictprone industry targeted by plaintiffs lawyers mr smith a graduate of harvard law school drafts policy papers and legal briefs contributing “intellectual prowess” to the organization says cofounder david ruder a northwestern university law professor and former sec chairman no taller than  feet  inches mr smith is by all accounts an unpretentious suburban washington dad who never hints at the family wealth and serves as board president of a private grade school in rockville md he likes to hunt fish and pick national football league winners competing for bragging rights each season “when you first meet him hes an averagelooking guy” says forum director gary wilner a retired highland park cardiologist and chairman of chicagobased oakmark funds “when you start to know him and expect things of him he rises to those expectations” mr smith grew up in barrington until he went to boarding school at hotchkiss school in lakeville conn he returned to the midwest to major in philosophy at carleton college in northfield minn he earned a masters degree in english at the university of chicago after harvard he clerked for us appellate court judge douglas ginsberg in washington when visiting the family homestead in barrington as a young adult he would sometimes head to the loop for beers with a friend driving as far as the northwest side and hopping on the el at cumberland avenue “he wasnt being cheap—that was just the way he was” says reid mackin executive director of the belmontcentral chamber of commerce “he still has that persona” mr mackin also recalls that mr smith wore a yarmulke when mr smith married ilene weinreich an attorney and democratic campaign contributor he met when they worked at a washington law firm in the mids mr smiths life hasnt been all smooth sailing his parents divorced and a teenage sister was killed in a car wreck near their barrington home while he was away at carleton passing the accident site later “i wouldnt say he broke down” says former college roommate bill burkett a corporate controller in minneapolis “he was quiet i could just see the shadow cross his face” before stepping down as itw president in  harold smith jr was the last family member in a top position at either of the smiths businesses his brother and davids father david smith sr retired later as itw treasurer by smith family standards harold
