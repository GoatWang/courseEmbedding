investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its manageddistribution policy an investment in the fund could lose money over short intermediate or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics

funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds the year in the fund name refers to the approximate year the target date when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce the

including on or after the target date each lifestrategy fund invests in  broadly diversified vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds the managed payout fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives is subject to loss and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital the dollar amount of the funds monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time it is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its manageddistribution policy an investment in the fund could lose money over short intermediate or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market the fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds which may invest in stocks including stocks issued by reits bonds cash inflationlinked investments commoditylinked investments longshort marketneutral investments and leveraged absolute return investments the managed payout fund may not be appropriate for all investors for example depending on the time horizon retirement income needs and tax bracket an investment in the managed payout fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement in iras or other taxadvantaged accounts for those investors under ½ or for participants in employersponsored plans investors who hold the managed payout fund within a taxadvantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age ½ or if they plan to use the managed payout fund in whole or in part to meet their required minimum distribution rmd obligations distributions from the managed payout fund are unlikely to precisely match an investors ira rmd obligations in addition use of the managed payout fund may be restricted in employersponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents andor at the discretion of the plan administrator
