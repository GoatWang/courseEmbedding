every day—from mobile phones and computing devices to entertainment gadgets and the latest array of features on cars electronic products are everywhere and life without them is unimaginable producing the tiny complex chips used in these devices involves the repetition of a set of core processes and includes hundreds of individual steps to do this successfully semiconductor manufacturers require sophisticated processes and fabrication equipment as a marketleading equipment supplier lam research works closely with customers to deliver the products and technologies needed to enable their success by offering critical chipprocessing capabilities our products provide a vital link between the visionary designs for the latest electronic devices and the companies that produce them our processing solutions market demand for continuously shrinking chip dimensions is driving the development of and migration to new fabrication strategies that enable producing these advanced devices with fine closely packed features creating the cuttingedge microprocessors and memory devices for today’s products is extremely challenging and requires precision control at the atomic scale through collaboration and drawing on multiple areas of expertise lam continues to develop the new capabilities required to manufacture increasingly complex devices with shrinking dimensions our innovative technology and productivity solutions for transistor interconnect patterning advanced memory and advanced packaging applications deliver a wide range of wafer processing capabilities needed to create the latest chips our products lam research offers a broad portfolio of marketleading products for thin film deposition plasma etch photoresist strip and wafer cleaning – complementary processing steps that are repeated multiple times throughout the semiconductor manufacturing process flow for applications that do not require the most advanced wafer processing capability we offer proven solutions with a suite of previousgeneration legacy products we have also extended our products to provide productionworthy and costeffective solutions for the mems and led manufacturing markets company

this article lrcx intc nvda nflx googl mbly amzn earnings season got aggressive this week sure last week we wrapped up much of the financial space but now we dance with the information technology sector for joy the land where fortunes are both won and lost overnight overnight better change that to a matter of minutes many tech names are extremely volatile and will see their market value change in a matter of seconds upon the fast money reaction to their quarterly earnings reports just take a look at the market reaction to the corporate performance of netflix nflx and alphabet googl  what will the markets react to pe ratios not likely growth or the possibility of growth very likely you dont need to know much more than that if for you these names are simply a trade that said what if one wishes to invest in the space thats a little trickier and hanging on to huge gains going into an earnings release can certainly be an extremely stressful event why i like nvidia lam research and intel  when i look for investment opportunities in tech i have to see engagement in the development of what i consider to be relevant or hot segments of the industry artificial intelligence autonomous cars blockchain mining and cybersecurity come to mind what other factors figure into my decision making treasury yields well yes that always matters a taxreform inspired repatriation holiday again yes but thats sort of like watching the chimney to see if santa claus arrives us dollar valuations bingo dollar bill yall cheap dollars will boost earnings for large us multinationals we have been pounding that table all year especially since fellow columnist and currency expert douglas borthwick told the world that the us currency was overvalued he told us that right here at thestreet and he told us that many months prior to anyone else i heard say it in the industry did you know that the tech sector broadly speaking generates  of its revenue outside of us borders did you know that within the tech sector semiconductor names again broadly speaking are exposed to an even greater degree than the sector itself for semiconductors that exposure is an incredible  what yup really see the things you can figure out when youre just a guy scouring the financial universe for an edge so what do we want  engagement in the development of relevant of hot business lines  an edge these two ingredients are all thats really needed to invest in the tech space in and around earnings seems simple right until its not as an investor though unlike with a trader time is your friend even if youre wrong you can adjust hedge and reallocate a trader wins or loses its fast an investor plants a flag and develops as does the stock what am i i am both and i keep the two separate different books for different strategies how much easier it is to organize your thoughts once you learn that little trick semiconductors that have the edge lam research lrcx reports tomorrow afternoon consensus is for  a share the whisper number is roughly a nickel higher than that the street is looking for revenue of  billion this is perhaps my favorite name in the industry what do they do they design manufacture refurbish and service wafer fabrication equipment in other words these guys make the stuff that the rest of the industry needs to do whatever it is that they do cellphones tablets computers storage networks all need what lrcx provides intel corp intc reports thursday afternoon here the industry is looking for eps of  on revenues of  billion this is my sleeper not much in the way of performance for a very long time yet the name provides a dividend yield of  while you wait for something good to happen long involved in computers the firm has spread its wings into the cloud cyber security not to mention the acquisition of mobileye mbly in order to make a splash in the growing autonomous vehicle industry ceo brian krzanich usually presents very well and i look forward to the call on thursday evening nvidia corp nvda does not report until august  so you have some time consensus is for earnings of  a share on revenue of  billion whispers are up above  and possibly already priced into the last sale i love this name its hard not to i joined the party late and its already one of my best trades over the last couple of years it is hard to imagine a company more squarely focused on everything that is relevant right now than nvda artificial intelligence big data research cloudbased computing the ability to integrate an entire computer onto a single chip what yup that means gaming designing entertainment drones autos and robots did i mention the mining of blockchain i dont know about you but when i write this article next year i hope im still long nvda  which brings us to amazon its not that i do not like amazon amzn  i do its certainly not a semiconductor name its more of an everything name i have already been long amzn twice this year and made significant gains both times this time it could be different call it intuition but my spider sense is tingling amazon reports this thursday expectations are for eps of  on revenue of  billion whispers are for an eps number a nickel higher than that expectation why am i iffy on amazon you all know that i am a walmart wmt fan that is not it though i have no problem being long both of these names the stock is trading  above its day simple moving average sma think thats cool just look at things in perspective nvda is a  stock while amzn is trading  above its  day sma see what i mean thats possibly outlandish i will not know if i am willing to take a shot in amzn prior to thursdays close but i do know that i will not be long the shares at that time if i short any it will be within five minutes of that closing bell and i will be flat long before pm this would be a trade for me not an investment that my friends will depend on just how bold i feel in  hours buying one put option with a strike price around the last sale that expires this friday will run the average home gamer around  and could be almost worthless immediately if youre wrong not a warm and fuzzy option  eat drink and talk money with jim
