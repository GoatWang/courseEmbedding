operates—incomeproducing real estateto qualify as a reit a company must have most of its assets and income tied to real estate investment and must distribute at least  percent of its taxable income to stockholders annually in the form of dividends qualifying companies are allowed to deduct dividends paid to their stockholders from their corporate taxable income consequently most reits historically remit at least  percent of their taxable income to stockholders and therefore owe no corporate tax stockholders pay taxes on dividends received and on any capital gains most states recognize this federal treatment and also do not require reits to pay state income tax like other businesses—but unlike partnerships—a reit cannot pass any tax losses to its investorswho is the transfer agentthe
