get finance experience in a bankjune  by interview by ann therese palmer special to the tribuneas a college student at the university of wisconsinmadison norman bobins didnt give much thought to what he would do after graduationthats because in  his paternal grandfather had founded a chicagobased manufacturer of mens belts tie bars and tie clips bobins dad and uncle worked there bobins expected he would too after graduationfor the record  this story contains corrected material published june  from the time i was  i worked there every summer doing a variety of jobs says the chicago native raised in hyde parki worked in plating on the punch press customer service product developmentas planned the newly married bobins joined the firm while his wife virginia finished her undergraduate degree bobins also enrolled in the university of chicagos mba evening program after virginia graduated he switched to the fulltime programwhen i was about to graduate and rejoin the family business my dad and uncle whod become  partners had another idea bobins relates they suggested i get a job with a bank for the financial experience  i thought a couple of years in a bank would be funso bobins joined american national bank as a trainee making  a yearbig money his job for the next  months was gofer for bank chairman allan stolz id get in every morning before he did get him organized make sure everything was planned run his errands even make sure everything was set for his dinner partiesmuch of what bobins learned in that job he is using today but on the other side of the deskbobins  was named head of lasalle bank in  president and ceo of lasalle bank corp in  and ceo of abn amro north america in  abn amro the dutch financialservices firm acquired lasalle bank in  this paragraph as published has been corrected in this textq at what point in your working life did what youre doing now become your goala when i left american national in  and even when i went to exchange bank i assumed id gone as far as i was going to go it was only when i became president of lasalle i realized i had a shot to be president of its holding companyit wasnt a done deal by a long shot when you get too complacent youre sure to be disappointedq were any classes particularly helpful to your careera when i was an undergrad my dad suggested i take some business courses i was terrible particularly in accounting  i never got past the debits on the left credits on the right i was a bachelor living on an allowance having a lot of fun i wasnt a great studierin  things were different when i started business school at the university of chicago i was married about to become a father i had to become seriousq what did you do differentlya my first six months at chicago were really tough it was a very quantitative school as a history major i wasnt accustomed to thati spent hours and hours in the library i also met two very bright students with whom i studied jim nicholson is now chairman of our bank in michigan les bortz also became a banker but then did something i didnt do he took over his familys businessq why didnt you want to returna i was having so much fun with banking i kept asking my dad and uncle to give me a few more years a family business can be cloistered youre not in the mainstream of events you see the same people dailywhen i was  my dad got tired of waiting for me he gave me one last chance and said hed sell the company if i didnt return i thanked him but said i was doing well and liked what i was doingq what previous job best prepared you for this onea working in a family business that did manufacturing was the best preparation when i got into banking i could relate to customers id had experiences similar to what they were going throughtoo often bankers are finance majors guys who are afraid to get their hands dirty theyve never had to get a shipment out on time or have a delivery truck break down on the way to a major clientq how did your personal life fare while you moved up the laddera i met virginia during our junior year in high school in oconomowoc wis there were  students in our classwe sat alphabetically there was no one between bobins and gallagher her last name we went on to madison and married a week after i graduated weve got one son robert a teachershes been my bulwark to get ahead you dont work  am to  pm you
