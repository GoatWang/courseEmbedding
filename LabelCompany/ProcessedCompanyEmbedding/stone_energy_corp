reviewing considering that prior to this update sgy only had  of  guided production hedged at bbl and  mcfe increases to guided production mean selling to spot markets for over hedging balance covered production stone energy nysesgy is out with a seemingly positive operations update in which it updates investors as to the following operations at its cardona  development well in the deepwater gulf of mexico have been proceeding ahead of schedule and below budget and drilling has been completed through the targeted zones sgy expects q production to come in at or above the high end of previous guidance of mmmm cfeday the result of reduced scheduled thirdparty pipeline downtime in the deepwater gulf and flatter than expected production declines in appalachia sgy says it may realize additional upward revisions in appalachian production in q earnings pending participation elections by sgys operating partners from the looks of those headlines this update isnt seemingly positive it flat out is positive but i have to wonder on the topic of production before taking this update at face value first the production numbers and guidance are great thats never a bad thing so dont let me make it out to seem like this update wasnt at the very least neutral but this is a line item worth reviewing considering that prior to this update sgy only had  of  guided production hedged at bbl and  mcfe increases to guided production mean selling to spot markets for over hedging balance covered production more so than prior without sgy listing its irrs in its investor deck this information isnt readily available that said even factoring in that sgy has low gom costs of supply i assume with oil tanking the last few weeks to an intraday spot of  and natural gas trading on the lows  spot  this will have a marked effect on the marcellus production that the irrs are less than ideal the point to be made here is maybe more production isnt the best thing in the immediate term in that realized irrs are at multiyear some would argue historic lows well have to wait for q reporting to be sure still let it be known that the saving grace here is that sgy isnt contributing additional capital to drive this increased production and that makes a world of difference essentially zero extra cost low irr production is better than nothing at all period that said the fact that sgy updated positively for both the gom and its appalachian production does work well into my sgy acquisition thesis ive opined prior that sgy is a unique acquisition that would look good as a bolton either asis or cut up to pieces and sold off individually sgy having a more successful than expected run in the gom and noting lower decline rates in the appalachian are huge valueadds to buyout value the lower decline rates especially ive talked before in reference to sgy about how undervalued its gom assets are and how really the entire gom is especially the shelf miocene sgy isnt a player in this zone i think that with the price of oil presumably lower for longer especially if you believe a source of mine in regards to saudi production the gom will begin to both bid at a premium in the public markets and become an ever increasingly attractive ma focus that should do well for sgy equity the other thing worth reiterating that has nothing to do with this press release by the way is that sgy has an untapped revolver that it can lean on going forward that should keep it safe from what ive been told are going to be fall redetermination revolver raids that too will help price sgy at a premium and further its ma potential everything in oil and gas right now is in flux ive been back and forth on sgy in stating that i dont like its underlying production mix  to make it a front runner should we realize my long called for natural gas commodity bull to end the year that said i also have opined that sgys asset plays could be very attractive to a midmajor or major looking to shelve some fine assets at discount pricing even in todays environment a divestiture andor buyout would take place a premium to spot equity pricing of course thats something i would want readers to be long with sgy invest at your own risk i can see both sides of this story both an underperformance and an overperformance playing out with that being the case i remain on the sidelines until q reporting good luck

corporate profilemanagement teamcorporate governancecareer opportunities gulf of mexico sems irs form  restructuring corporate giving contact informationlegal operations gulf of mexico sems gulf of mexico deep water the deep waters of the gulf of mexico have been a major focus of oil and gas exploration and production companies as early as the s and it can be argued that the gulf of mexico is the most prolific oil and gas producing region in the world new oilrich fields are being discovered year after year propelling some recent estimates of total reserves in the gulf to exceed  billion barrels though the gulf has multiple highly promising regions that continue to be discovered it is more technically challenging than ever before to recover these reserves which lie deep beneath the ocean and the ability to operate with commercial success in the deep waters in the gulf of mexico is limited companies must have the proven technical experience and expertise for understanding and interpreting data to identify the highest quality prospects and they must also have access to essential capital resources for the execution of appropriate riskweighted investments that generate the highest rates of returns stone energy corporation is proud to be recognized as one of these companies both by the industry and investment community stone holds interests in over  lease blocks throughout the gulf of mexico many of our prospects and projects are in the northern mississippi canyon and southern viosca knoll regions approximately  miles southeast of new orleans la our operations in this area are anchored around the pompano and amberjack platforms where we are executing drilling programs and flowing discovered reserves back to for processing we are drilling multiple other prospects in the area which also have the possibility to be flowed back to the pompano or amberjack platforms the ability to access and leverage infrastructure near deep water projects can be the determining factor when planning a deep water well the option to flow volumes back to these platforms provides us with a competitive advantage in this area of the gulf to see more about our operations and most recent developments in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico please visit our investor relations page for our most recent conference presentation or click here deep gas operations throughout the gulf coast region both onshore and in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico there are large natural gas reserves approximately  to  feet below the earth’s surface natural gas reserves at these depths are commonly referred to as “deep gas” traditional drilling methods were not sufficient to recover the reserves however with today’s technology recovery of these reserves is not only possible but is also an attractive investment in many areas onshore and of the shallow waters of the gulf coast region necessary infrastructure is already in place for transport of the reserves which significantly decreases the time it takes to bring these products to market and to more quickly provide cash flows which increases the rate we may receive returns stone holds multiple lease interests with plans to drill potential prospects some of which have already proved successful such as la cantera and tomcat we will continue to build and develop our deep gas drilling program inventory as we explore for additional high potential prospects for more detail on our deep gas operations please visit our investor relations page for our most recent conference presentation or click here conventional shelf operations stone energy maintains core properties in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico also known as the conventional shelf for many years stone was primarily a conventional shelf production company and as late as  conventional shelf assets comprised a majority of the company’s assets the conventional shelf legacy assets provided much of the cash flows that allowed stone to move forward in to the shale plays and deep water exploration as the company pushed itself in to high growth areas to become the company that it is today we have sold most of our properties in the conventional shelf and have kept only a few highly prolific projects which still produce healthy cash flows back to the company our priority as a company stone energy maintains a “best in class” safety performance based on industry standard metrics we use responsible and prudent operational practices during every phase of the well – design drilling completion production maintenance and plugging and abandonment – to ensure that the fluids and commodities recovered are properly handled both in the well and on the surface we collaborate on and stay apprised of best practices that may reduce any potential environmental risks  east kaliste saloom rd lafayette la phone   fax   copyright   stone energy corporation stone energy corporation contact us sems legal home
