under any applicable exemption this communication may contain simulated performance results achieved by means of the retroactive application of the advisers investment methodology or the realtime application of a hypothetical capital allocation to such strategy hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations some of which are described below no representation is being made that any particular trading program will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown in fact there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program one of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight in addition hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading for example the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results there are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results although the information in this communication is believed to be materially correct as at the date of issue no representation or warranty is given as to the

bcml the funds and their affiliates agents service providers and professional advisers assume no liability or responsibility and owe no duty of care for any consequences of any person acting or refraining to act in reliance on the information contained in this communication or for any decision based on it past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results the actual performance realised by any given investor will depend on numerous factors and circumstances this communication may include returns for various indices these indices are not intended to be direct benchmarks for a particular fund nor are they intended to be indicative of the type of assets in which a particular fund may invest the assets invested in by any of the funds will likely be materially different from the assets underlying these indices and will likely have a significantly different risk profile target returns volatility and sharpe ratio figures quoted are targets only and are based over the long term on the performance projections of the investment strategy and market interest rates at time of modelling and therefore may change among the risks we wish to call to the particular attention of prospective investors are the following  each funds investment programme is speculative in nature and entails substantial risks  the investments of each fund may be subject to sudden and large falls in price or value and there could be a large loss upon realisation of a holders investment which could equal the total amount invested  as there is no recognised market for many of the investments of the funds it may be difficult or impossible for a fund to obtain complete andor reliable information about the value of such investments or the extent of the risks to which such investments are exposed  the use of a single adviser group could mean a lack of diversification and consequently higher risk and may depend upon the services of key personnel and if certain or all of them become unavailable the funds may prematurely terminate  an investment in a fund is illiquid and there is no secondary market for the sale of interests in a fund and none is expected to develop  there are restrictions on transferring interests in a fund  bcml and its affiliates may receive performancebased compensation which may result in riskier investments and the funds fees may offset trading profits  the funds are subject to certain conflicts of interest  certain securities and instruments in which the funds may invest can be highly volatile  the funds may be leveraged  a substantial portion of the trades executed for the funds take place on nonus exchanges  changes in rates of exchange may also have an adverse effect on the value price or income of the investments of each fund and  the funds are not mutual funds pursuant to and therefore not subject to regulation under the investment company act bluecrest capital management uk llp a limited liability partnership registered
