store locations gary c dake president of stewarts shops corp left has a lighter moment with customers and works with mark hotaling manager of the stewarts on freemans bridge rd recently outlook get the latest business news from outlook  when william dake ran stewart’s shops he had a unique method for scouting new store locations “he had his own singleengine plane and he would literally get up and fly around over a community to see the traffic patterns” his son gary recalled on a recent winter day “his favorite trick was to go on a morning when there had been a light snow the evening before that way he could see where all the tire tracks were and how everybody got to work” it was as effective as getting traffic counts from the state department of transportation and in the s and ’s — before online maps were available — it was the simplest way to see which neighborhoods and corridors could use a stewart’s today there aren’t many spots left in the capital region to put a stewart’s still when the dake family happens upon an untapped market so close to home they get excited “it’s funny” said gary dake president of stewart’s shops “we still find these little pockets in the capital district where there’s a hole that could use a stewart’s store when galway opened in the spring the response was just unbelievable” the rural saratoga county town got a stewart’s shop last year at the corner of routes  and  business has been nonstop since it opened dake said keeping busy the maltaheadquartered convenience store chain had another busy year in  in addition to building two new stores and replacing five outdated locations stewart’s acquired five eleven convenience stores in the north country installed a kilowatt solar array on its dairy plant complex in greenfield won numerous awards for its dairy products introduced its own line of kcup coffee and saw continued success with its new privatelabel beer and energy drinks the coming year should be another year of growth for the chain which had  stores across eastern new york and southern vermont as of midjanuary stewart’s wants to build a new store in its home county on sitterly road in clifton park and is also hoping to build new stores in the utica and syracuse areas where the chain has sporadic shops and no shops respectively “it’s tough for us to grow into new markets” said dake “we really learned that quite a bit when we went into watertown when we go into a new area the hardest part is teaching people how to use a stewart’s store because if you’re from someplace else you don’t go to a convenience store for lowcost highquality dairy products if you went to college with friends from out of the area and said ‘i’m going to take you out for ice cream’ and they see you pull into a convenience store they think you’re crazy” of course stewart’s doesn’t fit the model of a typical convenience store that’s because it began in  as an ice cream company that had stores and over time became a store chain that had ice cream “it sounds like a semantic difference but it’s not” said dake in  the chain which boasts nearly  employees also added a new shop in latham at the intersection of wade road extension and forts ferry road the chain also replaced five outdated stores last year in glenville on freemans bridge road in schenectady on hamburg street in west cohoes on columbia street in greenwich on main street and in herkimer on mohawk street stewart’s also acquired five eleven stores north of the capital region in the jefferson county city of watertown the st lawrence county town of potsdam the adirondack village of lake placid the rural st lawrence county village of heuvelton and the clinton county village of keeseville “they couldn’t make the stores work in the north country and we have experience in the north country” said dake do it yourself the strategy to stewart’s success seems to be its smart use of vertical integration the chain manufactures threequarters of what it sells in its stores and has its own warehouses too so it needn’t pay others to make and store its merchandise this style of doing business began with stewart’s milk which today comes from more than  dairy farms in saratoga washington and rensselaer counties with a cowtoshelf time of just two days stewart’s uses the same milk to make its own ice cream and dairy products over the years it grew to the point where stewart’s was making many of the food and beverage items it sold in its stores in  stewart’s introduced its own line of beer called mountain brew for  cents a can or  a sixpack the company was able to do this said dake because it has its own warehouse beer permit “we buy direct from a manufacturer in wisconsin and don’t go through a distributor so that cuts out a whole middle man which cuts out the cost” he said “so it’s really cheap i’m not proud to say it but it is the cheapest beverage you can buy in a stewart’s store it’s not the best tasting beer on the market but i don’t think it’s the worst either and i’ll tell you it’s the best  sixpack beer you’re going to find because you’re not going to find another  sixpack of beer” in  stewart’s began selling its own energy drinks — one a lowercost version of red bull and another a lower cost version of fivehour energy drinks and just recently the chain began selling its “scups” — singleserve cups of stewart’s brand coffee that can be used in a keurig machine in essence vertical integration has allowed stewart’s to perfect the model of selling the same quality products at a lower cost of course there’s one product stewart’s sells for a low cost that many believe is superior in quality to most brands stewarts’ awardwinning ice cream is so wellknown today that there is demand for it across the country last summer one man’s quest to fulfill his pregnant wife’s cravings for stewart’s ice cream made headlines when people learned he was willing to fly to new york from south carolina to get it his wife lived down south but had experienced the joy of peanut butter pandemonium during her time working at an amusement park in the region staying home dake said it is sometimes hard to resist the temptation to sell stewart’s ice cream outside of the mile radius the chain’s stores now occupy “we’ve talked about it but there are a couple problems” he said “we don’t know who we trust to pay us when you sell to someone on the outside you’re always getting pressured to find a way to cut the price we do it to our suppliers and there are tremendous pressures to cut quality when you have pressure to cut the price” that’s one of the reasons stewart’s ice cream and milk regularly wins firstplace awards at statewide and national contests in the ice cream business it’s just too easy to cut costs said dake “the ice cream business is the worst” he said “it is always easy to find a way to cut just another penny another penny another penny you find a little cheaper ingredient you cut back the butterfat a little bit ice cream is almost half air so you could put in a little bit more air and i could give you two samples next to one another and you probably couldn’t tell the difference by that one penny i just took out the problem is you do that  times in a row and you’ll be able to taste the difference we can avoid that temptation now” stewart’s ended  with  billion in sales up from  billion the year before in the coming year the company aims to enter the stillnew market in utica and the brand new market in syracuse it will also continue looking for places close to home that could use a stewart’s like the corner of clifton park center and sitterly roads in clifton park even though stewart’s already has multiple locations in clifton park that pocket of town is desirable for the chain said dake the key is knowing when you’ve reached saturation in a market he said “how many more stores do i need in schenectady” he said “i’ve got  or  in saratoga county i mean that’s a lot of stores sitterly will be one more but saratoga county is seeing a lot of growth what we found was when you reach a certain mass people don’t talk about going to the closest convenience store anymore — hess or cumberland farms or stewart’s — they talk about going to the closest stewart’s” reach gazette reporter bethany bump at  or bbumpdailygazettenet view comments hide comments related content sales tax receipts in capital
