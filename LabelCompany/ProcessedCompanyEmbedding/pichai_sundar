mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a

exclusive look at the future of google’s most important products chasing the next billion with sundar pichai inside the mind of the man behind googles most important products by dieter bohn on may   at  pm if you use any google product chances are google’s svp sundar pichai has had some say in how it was created pichai joined google in  and over the course of just a few years pichai has extended his domain beyond chrome to encompass google drive maps apps chrome os android search ads atap and more pichai’s expansive role was formalized back in october of  when ceo larry page handed him the daytoday responsibilities of running the tech giant we sat down with pichai to hear his vision for the google of the future he laid out a plan to improve google’s products through machine learning — but more importantly he sketched out a grand effort to deliver computing capabilities to billions of people around the world both in the way he manages his internal teams and in his belief that technology can change people’s lives for the better pichai advocates an egalitarian ethos after page and cofounder sergey brin pichai is almost certainly the most powerful person at google executives in pichais position tend to lead their teams with vision charisma bombast or usually some combination of all three but theres no bombast to pichai his office is clean to the point of being spartan and that simplicity is reflected in his demeanor pichai is thoughtful and friendly in person nodding carefully as he listens and then responding with real empathy after the first day of io i watched as pichai walked into the hungry press gaggle giving everybody who approached him equal attention amidst the tumult he even sought me out to finish a conversation we’d had the previous week pichai is clearly proud of the fact that googles products work the same whether youre a billionaire or a rural farmer outside the media scrum pichai is slightly more relaxed slightly more willing to dive into technical detail when we briefly discuss the new internet of things communication standard that was announced this week he immediately grasps my low level of technical understanding and comes right down to it gracefully and without a hint of condescension pichai’s approach toward other people is reflected in his attitude toward what technology itself should do with his larger role that attitude is rapidly infusing google’s new products now on tap organized photos virtual reality videos stitched together in the cloud and even project aras first foray into the consumer market in puerto rico are all happening in large part thanks to pichais goal of making googles technology available to as many people as possible under pichai both googles product vision and its outthere rd projects all seem to be heading in the same direction much more than before so when pichai talks about the next billion people about to come online with smartphones i get the impression that for him google’s monetization strategy really is secondary to pichais stated goal giving people everywhere the power of googles machine learning whenever and wherever they need it hes clearly proud of the fact that googles products work the same whether youre a billionaire or a rural farmer in a farflung place and pichais vision is to ensure that dedication becomes a part of everything google makes coming from a different company the claims pichai and his product managers make would sound like clichés a supercomputer in your pocket a new way to systematize innovation empowering the next billion but if anyone in silicon valley has the power to transform moonshot fantasies into powerful realities it’s google — sundar’s google this interview has been edited for clarity and length dieter bohn this is the first io where you were officially in charge of everything being presented did that change your approach sundar pichai it’s a good question historically we’ve used io as an opportunity to take a step back and help people get a sense across what google is doingand tended to focus more on our platforms we’ll continue to do that this year but maybe it’s a bit easier to do it end to end i think it’s been a while since we stepped back and told the story not just from a platform perspective but also from a google standpoint — what we hope to accomplish and also focus on developers how do you identify problems solve them at scale and bring technology to bear back in october there was a little bit of reorganization and you were able to take charge of more or most of google’s core products are there specific priorities you’re better equipped to drive now in some ways yes we have these large services which users use and they work at scale we have ongoing platforms we’re evolving but if you want to think ahead and plan for the next two to three years as to where online computing platforms are evolving and how do you drive the experience on top of it being able to think holistically road map it out and think it through — i do think that’s been unique for example we’ve been thinking hard about how we help organize users information on mobile it’s core to our mission of what we set out to do with those kinds of things it helps us to step back think about it and do it better how are you able to do it better now at a high level i think of what we are doing in terms of two core things one is what we set out and wrote in the founders’ letter which is to say we really want to work on big problems that help solve big problems in users’ lives we want to do it at scale we want to do it for everyone if you look at search it worked that way maps youtube chrome android all did too so we want to continue doing that how do you identify problems solve them at scale and bring technology to bear the second is our core mission statement which is to organize users’ information we’ve seen this with things like google now where we try hard to tell you okay maybe you want to leave earlier to go to a particular meeting or when you land and reach an airport line we say here’s your boarding pass when we think about organizing the world’s information in the context of mobile people are trying to get stuff done so we need to go a step further and be assistive where we can we have taken things like error in word recognition down from about  percent to  percent underlying all of that is we’ve invested a lot in machine learning today if you open a phone and you say hey what does a tree frog look like we are understanding voice going through all images and trying to understand how a tree frog is different from other types of frogs salamanders et cetera sometimes that information needs to be translated all these are huge advances in computer science and are primarily driven by machine learning just in the last three years we have taken things like error in word recognition down from about  percent to  percent and it’s because of what we call deep neural nets we have made great strides but how do you use all this technology and these advances to be more assistive to users so you will see us talk about how we can take google now and make it work better in the context of your phone if you’re looking for information in the context of using applications how can we do that to me doing things like that are core to what google promised users it will do so that’s the second big part of what we do i’ve been talking to a bunch of people in google over the past couple of weeks and a phrase i’m hearing over and over again is the next billion there’s a billion people using android — how do we get the next billion is there a coherent strategy behind that goal the entire pc industry reached about  billion people but with mobile we are truly dealing with the first computing platform that is going to touch people at scale i can see a clear path to getting over  billion users one day i think just in the last  months there have been over  million users who for the first time have had access to a modern computing platform a smartphone effectively so we deeply care about it at our core we want to build products for everyone at a basic level at a foundational level that means both providing computing and making it accessible which is why we are interested in android one and affordable chromebooks and thinking about connectivity over time that is why we are doing things like project loon net neutrality has served us well so we are pretty committed to it the second is from our services standpoint we realize for those users the experience needs to evolve so we are thoughtfully across our products thinking about what it means for a user in india or brazil or indonesia or africa with limited connectivity to use products like youtube google search google maps how do we make their experience better that’s a big part of it i’m sure you’ve seen there’s been a bunch of debate about internetorg and net neutrality does google or do you personally have a stance on whether it’s important to try and have some net neutrality standard in emerging markets net neutrality has served us well so we are pretty committed to it i’m not fully familiar with all the issues around internetorg but … it’s pretty obvious to me that users in these markets want the same as users in the developed world they want data to be plentiful and affordable right i think we have a model which works well which is why i am a big fan of more foundational efforts a lot of carrier partners are investing in a lot of efforts to me this is not a physics problem … we know how to provide connectivity at scale so how we get that done in developing markets has got to be the test of the effort you get asked this question frequently  but i’m going to ask you again android seems like it’s getting more and more popular in china but google services aren’t is your philosophy still we hope to get there but we’re going to wait and see we are going to continue providing android to the fullest extent possible in china so we are incredibly excited the market there is a substantial market it’s unique so we deeply care about investing there we would love to serve chinese users with google services as well obviously i think it will be a privilege to do that but we need to be thoughtful in how we do it we are open to newer approaches we’ll have to wait and see in addition to providing information and its core products google also does a bunch of really crazy shit project loon calico — all these moonshots large and small a lot of this stuff is really interesting but it’s hard to see a path for it to be anything more than cool experiments should these divisions keep doing crazy stuff or should they be pushed to become productized core parts of google i would draw a distinction between things like research and atap which are research efforts with different flavors of how we approach research versus areas like our core products selfdriving cars or project loon or even our iris contact lens   can we apply technology and bring a differentiated and a unique way of solving a problem does it apply to millions or billions of people those efforts are done under that framework and while the effort may seem ambitious or crazy we take a very disciplined approach those projects are thought through like businesses it’s just that we are willing to take a longterm view but we run them in a very disciplined way we have a good notion of okay here’s how much investment it will take here’s how long it will take what are the use cases and applications and how will this whole thing play out where we see traction we will double down otherwise we will coursecorrect where we see traction we will double down otherwise we will coursecorrect we will do both we need to be thoughtful about these things we do them because we believe that software is at a stage where it is increasingly playing a more and more critical role in solving problems it didn’t before you’ve just announced project fi and you’re also announcing android pay both of these feel like departures from the early days of programs like nexus when it seemed like there was an attitude of going at it alone with pay and fi you’re partnering with carriers is there a shift in googles attitude toward working with other companies by the way the same is true for loon we are doing it with vodafone telefonica and telstra our goal is to reach everyone out of that goal arises a lot of what we do because we have decided we want to solve it for everyone inherently that forced us to think hard about a partnership approach that’s what helps us reach everyone with android we do work with  oems and over  carriers to make  distinct devices we shipped over a billion android phones in  when i look at the scale of how it happens all the way from the low end the high end that matters to us search chrome maps and youtube are all products available for everyone for something like project loon to work across the world you will inevitably end up working with carrier partners for selfdriving cars to have an impact you will see us take a partnership approach there as well we shipped over a billion android phones in  what do you think of microsoft’s effort to get android running on windows mobile are you guys working with them on that do you have a dog in that hunt my understanding is based on what i read — probably from the verge summary of the build conference today there are many efforts underway like that right others have efforts amazon does it for their products so it’s not new to us it’s a testament to the scale of the app ecosystem on top of android a lot of what we do in android is open source and things are designed for it to be used easily elsewhere so it’s good to see all that if i bring up microsoft i have to bring up apple apple has entered a slew of new markets they are rumored to be trying to get on tv they’re rumored to do music streaming they just released a watch they have apple pay they’re directly competing with you in lots of areas you’ve got a music streaming service you’ve got a tv product you’ve had wallet for a while what unique advantage does google have over apple across all of these different product categories look apple and google we get talked about together but we two are trying to do different things to users it arrives as a choice of an iphone or an android smartphone but apple is thinking through endtoend they are vertically integrated and they think about an endtoend product we are trying to build a horizontal platform and enable many people so it’s a bit tough to compare and contrast right having said that we do approach things a bit differently we generally think about whatever we build as cross platform trying to reach everyone we think deeply about them being cloud services and leveraging the power of the hard work we have done over the years to build several large cloud services which are building users at scale it matters that we drive technology as an enabler for everyone around the world those are the things we tend to go deeper on it’s good for users that there are companies who are approaching it differently it gives rise to choice and over time i would say healthy innovation which pushes all of us further along apple is doing really well and that forces us to work harder hopefully it’s a virtuous cycle is there anything personally important to you that you wish google as a whole were doing more of the thing that attracted me to google and to the internet in general is that it’s a great equalizer i’ve always been struck by the fact that google search worked the same as long as you had access to a computer with connectivity whether you were a rural kid anywhere or a professor at stanford or harvard i want google to strive to do that — not just build technology for certain segments for me it matters that we drive technology as an equalizing force as an enabler for everyone around the world which is why i do want google to see push and invest more in making sure computing is more accessible connectivity is more accessible and going back to our core mission when we do things like machine learning and assist users i view that as a huge game changer because over time someone who has access to just a smartphone hopefully hasthe same capabilities as someone who is more privileged that’s what’s very exciting about what we are doing photography by cara robbins page  of  the incredibly fast rise of googles sundar pichai

former ge head jeff immeltphoto courtesy david paul morrisbloomberg—getty imagesgooglethe incredibly fast rise of sundar pichaimiguel helftoct  when google announced that it had built a web browser on labor day in  the event represented something of a coming out party for sundar pichai a littleknown and softspoken middle manager at the company based on how the launch went no one would have predicted that six years later pichai would be where is today—a clear no  to ceo larry page following a management shakeup late last weekindeed the launch of the chrome browser was something of a debacle google goog had worked hard behind the scenes to orchestrate a media splash it had readied talking points to explain why it was reigniting a browser war with microsoft msft and why its erstwhile ally mozilla maker of the firefox browser shouldn’t worry as part of it the company had secretly produced an elaborate page comic book that explained the unique features of google’s browser it was expected to land in the mailboxes of journalists and bloggers on that tuesday just as they returned from the threeday weekendbut the comic books arrived in germany on monday and it was not a holiday there after a german blogger posted the comic book online the chrome team had to scramble to handle the fiasco top executives including pichai’s boss at the time marissa mayer were summoned to the googleplex after quick but spirited debate the team decided to move up the announcement by a day as engineers scrambled to make chrome available for download from google’s network of data centers public relations staff started to alert reporters—most of whom where on holiday—one by oneembarrassing as it was the snafu was quickly forgotten chrome which launched amid skepticism that it could make inroads against the dominant browsers of the time internet explorer and firefox became a runaway hit it is now the no  browser in the world with a market share thats more than twice that of the once dominant internet explorer according to statcounter its success paved the way for a series of related strategically important products including chrome os chromebooks and chromecast and it became the engine that powered pichai through one of the fastest corporate ascents in the technology industryinside google however pichai had already made his mark as a director of product management for an obscure but important weapon in the company’s arsenal the google toolbar the toolbar was critical because it helped google make its search engine the default option on ie and firefox and pichai’s role in leading the product as it came under attack from microsoft helped cement his standing in the company as detailed in a fortune story titled the dawn of the chrome age earlier this yearchrome had another less public mission to defend the search engine that accounts for most of google’s  billion in  revenues and  billion in profits since  google had distributed a browser toolbar that made its search engine the default on ie and firefox the toolbar also allowed google to track users’ surfing habitsthe toolbar — as geeky and benign as it sounds — was a key locus of google’s combat with microsoft pichai was the group’s leader and by the midaughts he worried that microsoft would modify ie to make it more difficult or even impossible for users to install the toolbar in a series of sometimes tense conversations with top brass around the time of a major update to ie in october  pichai argued that microsoft could threaten a sizable chunk of google’s business according to two executives who were there “it was a doomsdaylike scenario” one of the executives says shortly after google execs gave chrome the green lightafter the launch of chrome pichai was promoted to vice president and later to senior vice president he was given oversight for google’s apps including gmail and became a member of the exclusive lteam the small group of executives who report directly to page and when android creator andy rubin left to begin a secret robotics project within google page put pichai in charge of android as wellwith his latest promotion which is meant to allow page to
