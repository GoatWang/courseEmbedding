been an independent company for most of its existence though was briefly owned by the houstonbased enron corporation from  until  when enron divested itself of pge during its bankruptcy notably pge does not serve all of portland its service territory comprises most of portland west of the willamette river sharing most of the city east of the river with pacific power pge produces and purchases energy primarily from coal and natural gas plants as well as hydroelectric power from dams on the clackamas willamette and deschutes rivers between  and  pge operated trojan the only nuclear power

company on june   it sent power generated by one of four brush arc light dynamos at willamette falls over a mile electric power transmission line to portland the first us power plant to do so on august   morey frederick van voorhies holman and henry failing formed the portland general electric company it was funded by general electric and the investment arm of old colony trust with  million in capital the newly formed pge company purchased willamette falls electric and the albina light  water company in  less than a year later in may  pge purchased the cityeastside electric light plant a municipal power company e kimbark maccoll who chronicled the history of portland referred to it a generous gift to a private company at the expense of future taxpayers since it was constructed for a cost of  and sold  months later for  in  henry w goode the president of pge decided to make pge a popular public utility his vision was for the company to light the lewis and clark centennial

pge also purchased the union power company in  and the vancouver electric light  power company in  in  pge portland railway company and oregon water power  railway company merged becoming the portland

in  it was reorganized in  as pge on march   pepco defaulted on interest bonds that had been issued in march  the bonds were pledged with pge the electric subsidiary and portland traction company the streetcar subsidiary as collateral with guaranty trust as trustee pepco filed for chapter x bankruptcy now known as chapter  on april   and was assigned district judge james alger fee the proceedings were later called one of the most prolonged and complicated series of legal proceedings in portlands history the reorganization and bond default was brought on by pges difficult negotiations with bonneville power administration the death of seattle city lights visionary j d ross and the indecision created by the possible creation of a public utility district in pges territory the columbia valley authority project would have allowed cva to purchase utilities such as pge pge survived bankruptcy partially through cheap power purchases from bpa beginning in the fall of  and by the end of  they showed net profits in the meantime ormond r bean the oregon public utility commissioner forced pge to lower its rates ultimately pepco and pge were saved by world war ii which led to the construction of three kaiser shipyards and of vanport city oregon to support them by  pge derived nearly  in revenue from the two kaiser shipyards in oregon in august  after the war they were able to sell portland traction for  million in cash judge fee ruled the bankruptcy reorganization complete on june   on july   enron corporation bought pge for  billion in stock and  billion in assumed debt then in  and again in  enron attempted to sell pge to other investorowned utilities including portlandbased nw natural the corporate officers of pge claimed that this utility was not involved in the financial misdealings of its owner pointing to the fact that many of its employees suffered when enron froze the k retirement plan and were unable to sell the rapidly declining stock however ken harrison and joseph hirko pges ceo and cfo respectively at the time of the enron merger were charged on several felony level counts primarily related to financial misrepresentation regarding enron broadband services which had its headquarters within the world trade center complex that comprises pges corporate offices in addition tim belden head of the west coast trading desk and john forney an energy trader who invented various electricity trading strategies such as the death star operated from the trading floor in the pge corporate offices and were also convicted of financial crimes related to the california electricity crisis early attempts to convert the company to a public utility districtedit ballot measures have been filed by citizens several times since the s to convert some or all of pge into a public utility district pud the latest of these being in  most were unsuccessful but an exception was in  when pge announced it was selling its customer base in st helens scappoose and columbia city to west oregon electric pud for  million the terms of this sale proposed to leave the physical assets of the distribution system —the poles wires and other components— owned by enron who would then manage this system as a contractor exempt from state regulation voter distrust of both enron and pge was severe enough for voters to approve the measure despite  being spent in advertisements to oppose it in comparison to the  spent by supporters this resulted in those three cities becoming part of the columbia river pud on terms far more favorable to the customers electricity rates immediately dropped in these cities and remain lower than those for current pge customers attempted acquisition by texas pacific groupedit concerned by uncertainty that the enron bankruptcy would bring several local governments began investigation into acquiring pge by condemnation these studies ended after the announcement on november   that a group called oregon electric utility led by former governor neil goldschmidt and backed by texas pacific group offered to buy pge for  billion this was the sole bid received by the bankruptcy judge who approved the bid when details that goldschmidt had been sexually involved with a minor in the s emerged he withdrew from the negotiations and was replaced by peter o kohler president of the oregon health and science university discomfort over the texas pacific purchase led to further voter initiatives to convert parts of pge into puds pge defeated measures in multnomah county november   yamhill county march  and clackamas county may   also during this time period pge received notice of a strike by  union workers effective march   represented by the international brotherhood of electrical workers points over which the negotiations broke down included retiree medical benefits as well as losses of the members k plan this labor dispute was resolved shortly afterward and the union agreed to a new contract the tpg purchase offer was denied by the oregon public utility commission a threemember regulatory board on march   with the rejection of the texas pacific groups offer the city of portland announced it contacted enron to resume negotiating an offer to purchase pge on april   portland city officials announced that they were willing to spend  million in attorneys fees to buy the utility on july  the city council unanimously adopted a measure to finance the acquisition of pge by the sale of  billion in bonds however enron interim ceo stephen cooper called off negotiations on july   he explained that he did not see a plausible solution under which our teams could reach an agreement that would lead to a transaction closing in a timely fashion cooper addressed several causes for the termination including the refusal of the city to pay a  million deposit on the sale the same day governor ted kulongoski vetoed a bill that would create a public corporation to purchase pge independence from

prolonged and complicated series of legal proceedings in portlands history the reorganization and bond default was brought on by pges difficult negotiations with bonneville power administration the

to sell pge to other investorowned utilities including portlandbased nw natural the corporate officers of pge claimed that this utility was not involved in the financial misdealings of its owner pointing to the fact that many of its employees suffered when enron froze the k retirement plan and were unable to sell the rapidly declining stock however ken harrison and joseph hirko pges ceo and cfo respectively at the time of the enron merger were charged on several felony level counts primarily related to financial misrepresentation regarding enron broadband services which had its headquarters within the world trade center complex that comprises pges corporate offices in addition tim belden head of the west coast trading desk and john forney an energy trader who invented various electricity trading strategies such as the death star operated from the trading floor in the pge corporate offices and were also convicted of financial crimes related to the california electricity crisis early attempts to convert the company to a public utility districtedit ballot measures have been filed by citizens several times since the s to convert some or all of pge into a public utility district pud the latest of these being in  most were unsuccessful but an exception was in  when pge announced it was selling its customer base in st helens scappoose and columbia city to west oregon electric pud for  million the terms of this sale proposed to leave the physical assets of the distribution system —the poles wires and other components— owned by enron who would then manage this system as a contractor exempt from state regulation voter distrust of both enron and pge was severe enough for voters to approve the measure despite  being spent in advertisements to oppose it in comparison to the  spent by supporters this resulted in those three cities becoming part of the columbia river pud on terms far more favorable to the customers electricity rates immediately dropped in these cities and remain lower than those for current pge customers attempted acquisition by texas pacific groupedit concerned by uncertainty that the enron bankruptcy would bring several local governments began investigation into acquiring pge by condemnation these studies ended after the announcement on november   that a group called oregon electric utility led by former governor neil goldschmidt and backed by texas pacific group offered to buy pge for  billion this was the sole bid received by the bankruptcy judge who approved the bid when details that goldschmidt had been sexually involved with a minor in the s emerged he withdrew from the negotiations and was replaced by peter o kohler president of the oregon health and science university discomfort over the texas pacific purchase led to further voter initiatives to convert parts of pge into puds pge defeated measures in multnomah county november   yamhill county march  and clackamas county may   also during this time period pge received notice of a strike by  union workers effective march   represented by the international brotherhood of electrical workers points over which the negotiations broke down included retiree medical benefits as well as losses of the members k plan this labor dispute was resolved shortly afterward and the union agreed to a new contract the tpg purchase offer was denied by the oregon public utility commission a threemember regulatory board on march   with the rejection of the texas pacific groups offer the city of portland announced it contacted enron to resume negotiating an offer to purchase pge on april   portland city officials announced that they were willing to spend  million in attorneys fees to buy the utility on july  the city council unanimously adopted a measure to finance the acquisition of pge by the sale of  billion in bonds however enron interim ceo stephen cooper called off negotiations on july   he explained that he did not see a plausible solution under which our teams could reach an agreement that would lead to a transaction closing in a timely fashion cooper addressed several causes for the termination including the refusal of the city to pay a  million deposit on the sale the same day governor ted kulongoski vetoed a bill that would create a public corporation to purchase pge independence from

construction of three kaiser shipyards and of vanport city oregon to support them by  pge derived nearly  in revenue from the two kaiser shipyards in oregon in august  after the war they were able to sell portland traction for  million in cash judge fee ruled the bankruptcy reorganization complete on june   on july   enron corporation bought pge for  billion in stock and  billion in assumed debt then in  and again in  enron attempted to sell pge to other investorowned utilities including portlandbased nw natural the corporate officers of pge claimed that this utility was not involved in the financial misdealings of its owner pointing to the fact that many of its employees suffered when enron froze the k retirement plan and were unable to sell the rapidly declining stock however ken harrison and joseph hirko pges ceo and cfo respectively at the time of the enron merger were charged on several felony level counts primarily related to financial misrepresentation regarding enron broadband services which had its headquarters within the world trade center complex that comprises pges corporate offices in addition tim belden head of the west coast trading desk and john forney an energy trader who invented various electricity trading strategies such as the death star operated from the trading floor in the pge corporate offices and were also convicted of financial crimes related to the california electricity crisis early attempts to convert the company to a public utility districtedit ballot measures have been filed by citizens several times since the s to convert some or all of pge into a public utility district pud the latest of these being in  most were unsuccessful but an exception was in  when pge announced it was selling its customer base in st helens scappoose and columbia city to west oregon electric pud for  million the terms of this sale proposed to leave the physical assets of the distribution system —the poles wires and other components— owned by enron who would then manage this system as a contractor exempt from state regulation voter distrust of both enron and pge was severe enough for voters to approve the measure despite  being spent in advertisements to oppose it in comparison to the  spent by supporters this resulted in those three cities becoming part of the columbia river pud on terms far more favorable to the customers electricity rates immediately dropped in these cities and remain lower than those for current pge customers attempted acquisition by texas pacific groupedit concerned by uncertainty that the enron bankruptcy would bring several local governments began investigation into acquiring pge by condemnation these studies ended after the announcement on november   that a group called oregon electric utility led by former governor neil goldschmidt and backed by texas pacific group offered to buy pge for  billion this was the sole bid received by the bankruptcy judge who approved the bid when details that goldschmidt had been sexually involved with a minor in the s emerged he withdrew from the negotiations and was replaced by peter o kohler president of the oregon health and science university discomfort over the texas pacific purchase led to further voter initiatives to convert parts of pge into puds pge defeated measures in multnomah county november   yamhill county march  and clackamas county may   also during this time period pge received notice of a strike by  union workers effective march   represented by the international brotherhood of electrical workers points over which the negotiations broke down included retiree medical benefits as well as losses of the members k plan this labor dispute was resolved shortly afterward and the union agreed to a new contract the tpg purchase offer was denied by the oregon public utility commission a threemember regulatory board on march   with the rejection of the texas pacific groups offer the city of portland announced it contacted enron to resume negotiating an offer to purchase pge on april   portland city officials announced that they were willing to spend  million in attorneys fees to buy the utility on july  the city council unanimously adopted a measure to finance the acquisition of pge by the sale of  billion in bonds however enron interim ceo stephen cooper called off negotiations on july   he explained that he did not see a plausible solution under which our teams could reach an agreement that would lead to a transaction closing in a timely fashion cooper addressed several causes for the termination including the refusal of the city to pay a  million deposit on the sale the same day governor ted kulongoski vetoed a bill that would create a public corporation to purchase pge independence from

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
