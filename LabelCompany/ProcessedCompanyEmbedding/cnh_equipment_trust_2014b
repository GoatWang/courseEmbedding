levels are sufficient for the structure to support fitchs initial base case proxy of  for the rating levels listed above quality origination underwriting and servicing cnh industrial capital has demonstrated adequate abilities as originator underwriter and servicer as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of securitized trusts and the managed portfolio integrity of legal structure the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of the trust would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings to increased losses over the life of the transaction fitchs analysis found that the notes display limited sensitivity to increased defaults and losses showing limited impact on the rating of the notes under fitchs moderate x base case loss scenario the notes could experience downgrades of at least two rating category under fitchs severe x base case loss

at the end of this ratings action commentary key rating drivers the affirmations of the class a and the upgrade to the class b notes reflect loss coverage levels consistent with the ratings of aaasf and aasf respectively as of the september  reporting period cumulative net losses totaled  basis points and as such the transaction is extrapolating below fitchs initial base case loss proxy the stable outlook for the class a notes reflects fitchs expectation for loss coverage and credit enhancement to continue to improve as the transaction amortizes the outlook revision to positive for the class b notes reflects the possibility for positive rating actions in the next  to  months rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxy which would impact available loss coverage lower loss coverage could impact ratings and rating outlooks depending on the extent of the decline in coverage in fitchs initial review of the transaction the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to x and x higher of fitchs base case loss expectation initial key rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further described in the new issue report published oct   to date the transaction has exhibited strong performance with losses within fitchs initial expectations with
