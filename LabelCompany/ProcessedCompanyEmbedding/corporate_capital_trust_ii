relating to the offering of our securities an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk and may be considered speculative you should carefully consider the information found in the risk factors within our filings before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock risks involved in an investment in us include among others the following we are a relatively new company and are subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any business with a relatively short operating history including the risk that we will not achieve our investment objective and that the value of our common stock could decline substantially you should not expect to be able to sell your shares regardless of how we perform if you are able to sell your shares of common stock you will likely receive less than your purchase price and the current net asset value per share because you will be unable to sell your shares you will be unable to reduce your exposure on any market downturn we do not intend to list our common stock on any securities exchange during or for what may be a significant time after the offering period and we do not expect a secondary market in the shares to develop we have implemented a share repurchase program but only a limited number of shares of common stock are eligible for repurchase by us in addition any such repurchases will be at a price less than the current offering price in effect on the date that we initiate each quarterly repurchase offer you should consider that you may not have access to the money you invest for an indefinite period of time  an investment in our shares of common stock is not suitable for you if you need access to the money you invest our distributions in our initial year of investment operations were not based on our investment performance but were supported by our advisor in the form of operating expense support payments now we are obligated to repay our advisors and these repayments will reduce the current and future distributions that you should otherwise receive from your investment our portfolio companies may request our assistance in the management of their affairs however we may not have director or shareholder controls over the business affairs of the companies to which we loan capital in addition our investments in portfolio companies will be structured to be held until maturity and may not provide us with favorable terms for short term liquidity of the capital that we invest in them  we have not established any limit on the extent to which we may use borrowings or offering proceeds to fund distributions to shareholders which may reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in assets and there can be no assurances that we will be able to sustain distributions at any particular level our distributions may exceed our earnings particularly during the period before we have substantially invested our net offering proceeds which may result in commensurate reductions in net asset value per share this is a “best efforts” offering and if we are unable to raise substantial funds we will be more limited in the number and type of investments we may make as a result our ability to diversify will be constrained our investments may include original issue discount instruments to the extent original issue discount constitutes a portion of our income we will be exposed to typical risks associated with such income being required to be included in taxable and accounting income prior to receipt of the cash representing such income you should not rely on your own brokerdealer to make an independent review and investigation of the terms of this offering because you should not rely on your brokerdealer you will not have the benefit of any independent review and evaluation of the terms of this offering by our managing dealer in addition we do not and do not expect to have research analysts reviewing our performance or our securities on an ongoing basis therefore you will not have an independent review of our performance and the value of our common stock relative to other publicly traded companies risk factors relating to

losses through a finra arbitration claim against the brokerage firm or financial advisor that recommended the investment to you corporate capital trust ii is a nontraded business development company bdc that provides individuals an opportunity to invest in the debt of privately owned american companies a business development company “bdc” is a form of investment company that invests in small and midsized businesses investors can buy shares in a bdc and the money from their investments is used to fund the businesses in turn investors can profit from dividends paid on their investments or in some cases the sale of their shares bdcs are a relatively new investment product they were created in  after congress approved a series of amendments to the investment act of  the creation of bdcs was meant to spur investment in smaller companies that couldn’t attract traditional forms of capital bdcs have become increasingly popular in recent years in part due to their ability to create strong returns on investment however bdcs are not without their risks and pitfalls business development companies operate much in the same was as reits real estate investment trusts with nontraded bdcs having many of the same problems for investors as nontraded reits – like highrisk high commissions and lack of liquidity the white law group has represented a number of investors over the last few years in nontraded reits and has concerns that bdcs may be the next new wave of problem investments for investors – in large part because of their high commission structure and the possibility that nefarious financial advisors will push these products unsuitably to maximize their own commissions  as such the firm is investigating the liability that brokerage firms may have for recommending highrisk bdcs like corporate capital trust ii bdc brokerage firms are required to perform adequate due diligence on any investment they recommend and to ensure that all recommendations are suitable for the investor in light of that particular investor’s age investment experience net worth risk tolerance investment objectives and income  firms that fail to perform adequate due diligence or that
