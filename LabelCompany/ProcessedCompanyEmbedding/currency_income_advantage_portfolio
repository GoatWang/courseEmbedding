income advantage opportunity closedend portfolio series  the multisector approach the strategic income advantage opportunity closedend portfolio seeks to provide a high rate of current monthly income and to reduce some of the volatility typically associated with highincome investments to accomplish this the portfolio is diversified across a broad range of closedend funds that invest in us and foreign common stocks and taxable bonds because different sectors follow different cycles and react differently to changes in global economies and interest rates spreading assets across this spectrum of closedend funds has the potential to reduce the overall risk of the portfolio in addition based on current publicly available information none of the closedend funds selected for the portfolio are reporting the use of structural leverage closedend features portfolio control unlike openend mutual funds closedend funds maintain a relatively fixed pool of investment capital this allows portfolio managers to better adhere to their investment philosophies through greater flexibility and control in addition closedend funds dont have to manage fund liquidity to meet potentially large redemptions diversification the portfolio offers investors diversification by investing in a broad range of closedend funds that are further diversified across hundreds of individual securities diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against loss income distributions closedend funds are structured to generally provide a more stable income stream than other managed investment products because they are not subjected to cash inflows and outflows which can dilute dividends over time however stable income cannot be assured portfolio objectives this unit investment trust seeks a high rate of current monthly income with capital appreciation as a secondary objective there is however no assurance that the objectives of the portfolio will be achieved not fdic insured  not bank guaranteed  may lose value you should consider the portfolios investment objectives risks and charges and expenses carefully before investing contact your financial advisor or call first trust portfolios lp at  to request a prospectus which contains this and other information about the portfolio read it carefully before you invest risk considerations an investment in this unmanaged unit investment trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated with an investment in a portfolio of closedend funds closedend funds are subject to various risks including management’s ability to meet the fund’s investment objective and to manage the fund’s portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil and as investors’ perceptions regarding the funds or their underlying investments change unlike openend funds which trade at prices based on a current determination of the fund’s net asset value closedend funds frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value in the secondary market based on current publicly available information none of the closedend funds selected for the portfolio are reporting the use of structural leverage structural leverage creates a systematic level of additional investment exposure through a closedend funds issuance of preferred shares or debt securities or through borrowing money closedend funds which employ structural leverage are more volatile than those that do not however certain or all of these closedend funds may have utilized structural leverage in the past and may elect to utilize structural leverage in the future certain of the closedend funds invest in common stocks common stocks are subject to certain risks such as an economic recession and the possible deterioration of either the financial condition of the issuers of the equity securities or the general condition of the stock market certain of the closedend funds invest in investment grade securities investment grade securities are subject to numerous risks including higher interest rates economic recession deterioration of the investment grade bond market or investors perception thereof possible downgrades and defaults of interest andor principal certain of the closedend funds invest in highyield securities or junk bonds investing in highyield securities should be viewed as speculative and you should review your ability to assume the risks associated with investments which utilize such securities highyield securities are subject to numerous risks including higher interest rates economic recession deterioration of the junk bond market possible downgrades and defaults of interest andor principal highyield security prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated securities and are affected by shortterm credit developments to a greater degree certain of the closedend funds invest in options options are subject to various risks including that their value may be adversely affected if the market for the option becomes less liquid or smaller in addition options will be affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of the stock subject to the option an increase in interest rates a change in the actual and perceived volatility of the stock market and the common stock and the remaining time to expiration certain of the closedend funds invest in convertible securities convertible securities are bonds preferred stocks and other securities that pay a fixed rate of interest or dividends and will repay principal at a fixed date in the future however these securities may be converted into a specific number of common stocks at a specified time as such an investment in convertible securities entails some of the risks associated with both common stocks and bonds certain of the closedend funds invest in securities issued by foreign issuers such securities are subject to certain risks including currency and interest rate fluctuations nationalization or other adverse political or economic developments lack of liquidity of certain foreign markets withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting foreign issuers risks associated with investing in foreign securities may be more pronounced in emerging markets where the securities markets are substantially smaller less developed less liquid less regulated and more volatile than the us and developed foreign markets certain of the closedend funds invest in us treasury obligations which are subject to numerous risks including higher interest rates economic recession and deterioration of the bond market or investors’ perceptions thereof it is important to note that an investment can be made in the underlying funds directly rather than through the trust these direct investments can be made without paying the trust’s sales charge operating expenses and organizational costs for a discussion of additional risks of investing in the trust see the “risk factors” section of the prospectus the value of the securities held by the trust may be subject to steep declines or increased volatility due to changes in performance or perception of the issuers although this portfolio terminates in approximately  months the strategy is longterm investors should consider their ability to pursue investing in successive portfolios if available there may be tax consequences unless units are purchased in an ira or other qualified plan   the information in the prospectus is not complete and may be changed we may not sell these securities until the registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission is effective the prospectus is not an offer to sell these securities and is not soliciting an offer to buy these securities in any state

exchangetraded funds exchangetraded funds exchangetraded funds for nearly a century traditional mutual funds have offered many advantages over building a portfolio one security at a time mutual funds provide investors broad diversification professional management relative low cost and daily liquidity exchangetraded funds etfs take the benefits of mutual fund investing to the next level etfs can offer lower operating costs than traditional openend funds flexible trading greater transparency and better tax efficiency in taxable accounts there are drawbacks however including trading costs and learning complexities of the product most informed financial experts agree that the pluses of etfs overshadow the minuses by a sizable margin positive aspects of etfs etfs have several advantages over traditional openend funds the four most prominent advantages are trading flexibility low cost operational transparency and tax benefits trading flexibility traditional openend mutual fund shares are traded only once per day after the markets close all trading is done with the mutual fund company that issues the shares investors must wait until the end of the day when the fund net asset value nav is announced before knowing what price they paid for new shares when buying that day and the price they will receive for shares they sold that day onceperday trading is fine for most longterm investors but some people require greater flexibility etfs are bought and sold during the day when the markets are open the pricing of etf shares is continuous during normal exchange hours share prices vary throughout the day based mainly on the changing intraday value of the underlying assets in the fund etf investors know within moments how much they paid to buy shares and how much they received after selling the nearly instantaneous trading of etf shares makes intraday management of a portfolio a snap it is easy to move money between specific asset classes such as stocks bonds or commodities investors can efficiently get their allocation into the investments they want in an hour and then change their allocation in the next hour that is not something i recommend but it can be done making changes to traditional openend mutual funds is more challenging and can take several days first there is typically a  pm eastern standard time cutoff for placing openend share trades that means you do not know what the nav price will be at the end of the day it is impossible to know exactly how much you will receive when selling shares of one openend fund or know how much you should buy of another openend fund the trade order flexibility of etfs also gives investors the benefit of making timely investment decisions and placing orders in a variety of ways investing in etf shares has all the trade combinations of investing in common stocks including limit orders and stoplimit orders etfs can also be purchased on margin by borrowing money from a broker every brokerage firm has tutorials on trade order types and requirements for borrowing on margin short selling is also available to etf investors shorting entails borrowing securities from your brokerage firm and simultaneously selling those securities on the market the hope is that the price of the borrowed securities will drop and you can buy them back at a lower price at a later time portfolio diversification and risk management investors may wish to quickly gain portfolio exposure to specific sectors styles industries or countries but do not have expertise in those areas given the wide variety of sector style industry and country categories available etf shares may be able to provide an investor easy exposure to a specific desired market segment etfs are now traded on virtually every major asset class commodity and currency in the world moreover innovative new etf structures embody a particular investment or trading strategy for example through etfs an investor can buy or sell stock market volatility or invest on a continuous basis in the highest yielding currencies in the world in certain situations an investor may have significant risk in a particular sector but cannot diversify that risk because of restrictions or taxes in that case the person can short an industrysector etf or buy an etf that shorts an industry for him or her for example an investor may have a large number of restricted shares in the semiconductor industry in that situation the person may want to short shares of the standard  poor’s sp spdr semiconductor symbol xsd that would reduce one’s overall risk exposure to a downturn in that sector xsd is an equalweighted market cap index of semiconductor stocks listed on the new york stock exchange american stock exchange nasdaq national market and nasdaq small cap exchanges lower costs operating expenses are incurred by all managed funds regardless of the structure those costs include but are not limited to portfolio management fees custody costs administrative expenses marketing expenses and distribution costs historically have been very important in forecasting returns in general the lower the cost of investing in a fund the higher the expected return for that fund etf operation costs can be streamlined compared to openend mutual funds lower costs are a result of client service–related expenses being passed on to the brokerage firms that hold the exchangetraded securities in customer accounts fund administrative costs can go down for etfs when a firm does not have to staff a call center to answer questions from thousands of individual investors etfs also have lower expenses in the area of monthly statements notifications and transfers traditional openend fund companies are required to send statements and reports to shareholders on a regular basis not so with etfs fund sponsors are responsible for providing that information only to authorized participants who are the direct owners of creation units individual investors buy and sell individual shares of like stocks through brokerage firms and the brokerage firm becomes responsible for servicing those investors not the etf companies brokerage companies issue monthly statements annual tax reports quarterly reports and s the reduced administrative burden of service and record keeping for thousands of individual clients means etf companies have a lower overhead and at least part of that savings is passed on to individual investors in the form of lower fund expenses another cost savings for etf shares is the absence of mutual fund redemption fees shareholders in etfs avoid the shortterm redemption fees that are charged on some openend funds for example the vanguard reit index fund investor shares symbol vgsix has a redemption fee of  percent if held for less than one year the vanguard reit etf symbol vnq is the exact same portfolio and has no redemption fee tax benefits etfs have two major tax advantages compared to mutual funds due to structural differences mutual funds typically incur more capital gains taxes than etfs moreover capital gains tax on an etf is incurred only upon the sale of the etf by the investor whereas mutual funds pass on capital gains taxes to investors through the life of the investment in short etfs have lower capital gains and they are payable only upon sales of the etf the tax situation regarding dividends is less advantageous for etfs there are two kinds of dividends issued by etfs qualified and unqualified in order for a dividend to be classified as qualified the etf needs to be held by an investor for at least  days prior to the dividend payout date the tax rate for qualified dividends varies from  depending on the investors income tax rate unqualified dividends are taxed at the investor’s income tax rate exchange traded notes which are thought of as a subset of exchange traded funds are structured to avoid dividend taxation dividends are not issued by etns however the value of dividends is reflected in the price of the etn investors may wish to quickly gain portfolio exposure to specific sectors styles industries or countries but do not have expertise
