data source advanced semiconductor engineering what happened with ase this quarter ases revenues rose  year over year in local currency currency exchange effects added another  growth in us dollar terms the company reported solid yearoveryear sales growth in the three largest of its five business segments electronic manufacturing services led the way with  higher sales in local currency followed by  gains in the testing and packaging divisions bottomline earnings fell despite strong sales growth mainly due to a  million noncash charge to account for valuation changes in ases financial assets and liabilities the pending merger with industry rival siliconware precision industries nasdaqspil moved closer to completion this quarter in april chinas ministry of commerce formally accepted the merger contract with no objections the companies hope to close this deal as soon as possible awaiting a final rubber stamp from the us federal trade commission management provided guidance for the next quarter in sweeping terms for electronic manufacturing services the business should be similar to the average of q and q levels that would work out to segment revenue near  million and gross margins for that segment in the  range down from  million and  in the first quarter together the remaining four segments should deliver results similar to the first quarter thats  billion in combined segment sales at a gross margin of roughly  total sales growth based on these targets would work out to approximately  in local currencies and gross profit margins are holding steady in general image source getty images what management had to say in a conference call with analysts company representative ken hsiang offered an overview of how the semiconductor industry is shaping up around ase right now according to a transcript from seeking alpha hsiang said we believe that some of our customers are actively controlling component inventory related to smartphones in china this seems to indicate that the china smartphone market is taking sometime to digest inventory after showing surprising resilience during  further we also have noted that some end products have adjusted their launch timing not matching their previous generations launch times some of these times are off by weeks some by potentially months we believe these product launch shifts have created timing shifts in various smartphone manufacturing cycles looking ahead positioned at the center of the semiconductor manufacturing process flow ase can be a useful barometer for the state of the chip industry and other markets hsiangs comments point to delayed smartphone designs in china and elsewhere but the sales growth curve remains strong despite that caveat that being said the
