why targa resources is a target targa resources and its mlp targa resources partners were rumored to be involved in a takeover deal it’s the company’s similarities to enterprise products partners that made it targeted for takeover matthew dilallo tmfmd jun   at am according to a report thursday by bloomberg targa resources nysetrgp and its mlp targa resources partners nysengls were being targeted for a takeover while targa resources issued a press release saying the takeover talks have ceased without a deal its no surprise to see that the company was targeted in the first place further while enterprise products partners nyseepd wasnt the rumored buyer its targa resources partners similarities to enterprise products partners that made it an ideal takeover target in the first place strong platform as the following slide points out targa resources partners owns a very diverse portfolio of midstream assets source targa resources partners investor presentation link opens a pdf  as that map shows the company has field gathering and processing assets in both the bakken shale region as well as in the permian basin both of these areas are important oil rich growth areas that are currently in need of infrastructure assets because of that targa resources partners assets are in high demand and it has steady growth prospects further the company owns gathering and processing assets along the gulf coast as well as logistic assets in the gulf it also has a leading position in the mont belvieu ngl hub as it owns the second largest fractionation position in mont belvieu trailing only enterprise products partners given that the gulf coast is home to americas petrochemical industry these assets are also well positioned one often overlooked asset in addition to its strong footprints in leading shale basins and a leading position in mont belvieu targa resources partners has one asset thats often overlooked the company owns one of the two commercially operating ngl export facilities on the gulf coast thats linked to mont belvieu the other ngl export facility just happens to be operated by enterprise products partners as the following slide notes targa resources partners galena park marine importexport terminal is very strategically well positioned in the gulf coast source targa resources partners because of this targa resources partners is in the midst of expanding its galena park marine terminal to take advantage of its strategic position to increase its capacity to export propane and other ngls out of the facility the facility can currently export about  million barrels per month but once its second expansion phase is complete in the third quarter the company will be able to export  million barrels per month while thats a far cry from enterprise products partners plan to grow its export capacity from  million barrels per month to  million by the end of next year its a vitally important asset to targa resources partners in fact by already having an operational export facility targa resources partners is well ahead of other planned facilities as its peers reposition for energy exports making the company a valuable target for a company looking to access the export market investor takeaway clearly targa resources partners has the asset base that would make it a prime takeover target in acquiring targa resources a rival to enterprise products partners would gain access to the second largest fractionation capacity in mont belvieu as well as the only other ngl export facility connected to that ngl hub while targa resources partners recently rumored deal is said to have fallen apart its strong asset base is likely to bring another suitor very soon in fact an ideal candidate in my opinion is enterprise products partners as it could really consolidate its position at mont belvieu as well as in energy exports while at the same time adding bakken shale assets to its portfolio with targa resources now back on the market it might be time for enterprise products partners to take a look   matt dilallo owns shares of enterprise products partners the motley fool recommends enterprise products partners try any
