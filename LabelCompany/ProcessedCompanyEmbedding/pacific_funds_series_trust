don’ts of setting up a trust fund setting up a trust fund what you should never consider doing parents tend to make mistakes it kind of goes with the job when you become one no parent is going to be perfect this also goes for setting up a trust fund for their kids there are many parents who have made quite a few mistakes with this you are here so you can learn from these mistakes learn what not to do when setting up a trust who is going to be in charge of their kid’s trust fundthis is probably the number one mistake parents make when setting up a trust fund for their kids they fail to select the appropriate trustee for their kids there are two different types of trustees there is the single trustee there is also the cotrustee this one offers more of a checksandbalances protocol in the system it really doesn’t matter who you pick just make sure it’s someone you trust  and beyond what is going to happen once you are no longer there the trustee can say or go along with anything you want as long as you are still alive once you are dead and gone this person might just take the reins this can be both good and bad please make sure you are selecting someone you really do have faith in think about the path of the money this is the second mistake many parents make they set up a trust however they fail to set up a direction for the trust guys you have to do this figure out how and when the money should be dispersed out do you really want to leave this up to a neutral party this can and will happen when it does you might not be happy with the results this is your money these are your kids set up some goalsa list of beneficiaries setting up the trust and the trustee are the first steps afterwards you have to set up a small list of beneficiaries this way the money goes back and forth where it’s intended to be you have to have protocols in place to make sure all your plans are happening as well as people to do the job you cannot leave this up to chance too many parents have left it up to chance the kids ended up suffering because of it a trust fund is not just about money it’s about your kids and their future please make sound choices here part of providing well for your kids is making good choices with the people involved go with your gut if your gut says to not trust someone with this charge than listen to it tweet recent posts  mistakes to avoid when setting up a
