contacts industry conferences sec filings quarterly conference callstranscripts sellside research reports our existing holdings’ customers competitors or suppliers andor a myriad of industry publications critical to our investment discipline is to initiate positions only when we deem a prospective security to be severely undervalued naturally the next step in our process is our proprietary “fair value appraisal” in order to establish a conservative estimate of fair value we conduct an analysis of a company’s historical performance an estimate of discounted cash flow comparable company trading multiples and comparable company private market transaction multiples we employ a private equity mentality towards public equity investing and therefore analyze each stock as if we are buying the entire company focusing on the cashoncash return of the investment we also evaluate sales ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and free cash flow production over an extended time frame avoiding an overreliance on any one particularly good or bad year when warranted we will assess the value of a company’s other assets such as excess real estate net operating losses or liabilities such as an underfunded pension plan the next step of the process is “investment execution” we remain patient and disciplined in our initial acquisition of a company’s shares and invest incrementally position sizes are determined by estimated total return potential perceived riskreward ratio and liquidity we typically ease into positions on negative pulses and ease out of positions into strength the final and ongoing step of the investment process is “portfolio management” we manage a concentrated portfolio of  to  positions and continuously reevaluate our assumptions to maintain what we believe to be appropriate position sizes we monitor quarterly conference calls and other presentations made by the companies we hold as well as their competitors positions are sold for three primary reasons if a security approaches or exceeds estimated fair value if a superior investment opportunity emerges or if our fundamental investment thesis proves

typically  to  mim invests globally with foreign holdings representing  of our portfolios on average although we have no intentional focus on any particular size of company nor do we operate with any restrictions in this regard the average market capitalization of our holdings has historically been small simply because that is where we’ve usually found the greatest disparities between market price and fair value we do buy stock in large capitalization companies as well when they are priced attractively enough to warrant inclusion in our portfolios our ability to go wherever the best riskreward ratios appear to be available in companies small and large domestic and international gives us an advantage over other investment managers who operate within a more constrained investment universe we seek to invest when the security of a favored company is available for purchase at an extreme discount to our conservative appraisal of its fair value our process of security selection is research intensive and we rely on our own analysis to make buysell decisions and fair value determinations we invest primarily in common stocks of both domestically and internationally domiciled companies of any size or market capitalization exchangelisted shares as well as unlisted overthecounter securities are considered we may also invest in debt or hybrid securities or other financial instruments which in our opinion present special opportunities including securities of distressed companies and companies already operating under chapter  bankruptcy protection an important consideration in our investment process is whether or not management has a meaningful amount of their net worth invested in the stock of the company they manage the partners of mittleman brothers llc have made substantial investments in the same stocks in which we’ve invested for our clients’ accounts and we like to see that the management teams of our portfolio holdings are willing to eat their own cooking as well after identifying situations that meet our investment criteria we wait patiently for shares of a chosen company to trade at what we perceive to be an extremely low valuation before making purchases this aspect of our investment discipline is best described by a quote attributed to joe rosenberg successful valueoriented investment manager for the tisch family’s loews corp in barron’s magazine in the early s “have opinions at extremes and wait for extreme moments” we believe that the difference between mediocre investment returns and aboveaverage results is the adherence to a proven investment discipline and the difference between aboveaverage results and outstanding investment returns stems mainly from the degree of selectivity and patience employed in the application of that discipline that patience being most critical during the humbling down cycles like the particularly brutal one we endured most recently from may  until march  the key rules are don’t swing the bat unless it’s a slow pitch right down the middle of the plate and don’t be bullied by the market into doing something irrational whether buying or selling this may sound obvious or clichéd to some and perhaps confusingly ironic to others but the ability to sit and do nothing may be the most rare and valuable investing skill of all inevitably extreme price dislocations occur that create real opportunities for action and only the patient and prepared investor can recognize such ideal situations and take full advantage we work relentlessly to do just that likeminded investors are welcome to join us

implicit confirmation of mittleman brothers llc sees carmike cinemas delay of special meeting as implicit confirmation of overwhelming opposition to amc entertainments buyout offer of  per share amendment to bylaws circumventive and disconcerting news provided by mittleman brothers llc jun    et share this article new york june   prnewswire  mittleman brothers llc one of the largest shareholders of carmike cinemas inc nasdaq ckec which currently controls approximately  million ckec shares  of the total shares outstanding expressed its disappointment with the decision to delay the special meeting of shareholders the meeting which had been scheduled for today june th  presumably given this decision to delay the vote carmikes board has been unable to gather enough votes to adjourn the meeting via ballots a far less onerous voting threshold to achieve than required for approval of the merger itself  we believe this action is implicit confirmation that carmikes shareholders overwhelmingly oppose amc entertainments amc  per share cash takeover offer carmikes shareholders have had more than enough time to consider amcs offer with  days having passed since the deal was first announced on march    carmikes board took only  days to negotiate and approve this lowball offer from the first phone call from amcs new ceo to carmikes ceo on january   to the signing and announcement date on march rd  but now clearly lacking votes to approve and cement this blatant undervaluation of carmikes shares amc and carmikes board are choosing to draw out the process rather than allowing the vote to occur on schedule and properly heeding the will of the companys shareholders to terminate this fatally flawed transaction  furthermore that carmikes board beyond their obligations in the merger agreement yesterday amended their bylaws to potentially permit further delays is unconscionable  carmikes shareholders clearly recognize that selling the best performing major movie theater chain in north america over the past seven years for less than x ebitda makes no sense whatsoever as its lesserperforming peers trade in excess of x ebitda in the open market today with no control premium  despite amcs laughable assertions to the contrary even a  per share valuation of ckec in any combination of cash andor amc stock would still be immensely accretive to amcs intrinsic value per share and for amc to imply otherwise is a misleading statement  at  per share even if screenvision is valued at  amc would be paying an enterprise value of x ckecs synergyadjusted ebitda of m s adj ebitda of m  m in projected cost synergies that is less than the cost of amc buying back their own stock in the open market today and does not include the massive windfall benefit amc would receive in additional founders shares of national cinemedia inc estimated to be worth about m which pays hearty dividends to offset much of the likely associated makewhole payments  so let us repeat this easily discernible truth  even at  per share the acquisition of ckec by amc would be immensely accretive to amcs intrinsic value per share mittleman brothers again encourages all carmike cinemas shareholders to review our most recently filed presentation highlighting the gross deficiencies in both process and price reflected in carmikes proposed sale to amc  as we point out in the presentation httpwwwmittlemanbrotherscomckecamcopposition ckec has outperformed its peer group over the past seven years under current management in sales ebitda attendance and concessions growth and yet merely valuing ckec at the mean evebitda trading multiple of the peer group yields a stock price in excess of  without even considering a control premium or the immense synergy value that amc would solely retain in this unusually rare consolidation opportunity pairing the second and fourth largest movie theaters chains in the us mittleman brothers again urges all carmike cinemas
