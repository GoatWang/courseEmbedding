economic conditions        domestic and foreign demand for fuel products especially in the united states china and india        worldwide political conditions particularly in significant oil producing regions such as the middle east west africa and latin america        the level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil and refined products and the volume of crude oil feedstock and

maintenance and energy costs our predominant variable direct operating cost is energy which is comprised primarily of fuel and other utility services the volatility in costs of fuel principally natural gas and other utility services principally electricity used by our refinery and other operations affect our operating costs fuel and utility prices have been and will continue to be affected by factors outside our control such as supply and demand for fuel and utility services in both local and regional markets natural gas prices have historically been volatile and typically electricity prices fluctuate with natural gas prices future increases in fuel and utility prices may have a negative effect on our earnings and cash flows all subsequent written and oral forward looking

for the second quarter ending february   averaged bbl a  increase from the average for the first quarter of fiscal  nymex crude fluctuated during the first quarter of fiscal  from a low of bbl to a

and capital resources we operate in an environment where our liquidity and capital resources are impacted by changes in the price of crude oil and refined petroleum products availability of credit market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control included in such factors are among others the level of customer product demand weather conditions governmental regulations worldwide political conditions and overall market and economic conditions the following table summarizes selected measures of liquidity and capital resources in thousands        november     cash and cash equivalents         shortterm investments         working capital         current ratio          debt                     table of contents primary sources of liquidity have been cash and cash equivalents and borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility the amended and restated revolving credit facility with pnc bank na as administrator the agent bank we believe available capital resources are adequate to meet our working capital debt service and capital expenditure requirements for existing operations our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds these investments have staggered maturity dates none of which exceed three months they have a high degree of liquidity since the securities are traded in public markets significant uses of cash the changes in cash for the three months ended november   are described below the cash used in working capital is shown below        three months  endednovember

which is susceptible to large variations during the year resulting from purchases of inventory and seasonal demands inventory purchasing activity is a function of sales activity and turnaround cycles for the different refinery units maintenance and nondiscretionary capital expenditures have averaged approximately  million annually over the last three years for the refining and marketing operations management does not foresee any material increase in these maintenance and nondiscretionary capital expenditures during fiscal year  at this time future liquidity both short and longterm will continue to be primarily dependent on realizing a refinery margin sufficient to cover fixed and variable expenses including planned capital expenditures we expect to be able to meet our working capital capital expenditure contractual obligations letter of credit and debt service requirements out of cash flow from operations cash on hand and borrowings under our credit agreement of  this provides the company with flexibility relative to its cash flow requirements in light of market fluctuations particularly involving crude oil prices and seasonal business cycles and will assist the company in meeting its working capital ongoing capital expenditure needs and for general corporate purposes    table of contents on october   urc united refining company of pennsylvania kiantone united refining company of new york inc united biofuels inc country fair inc and kwikfill corporation collectively the borrowers entered into the credit agreement with a group of lenders led by pnc bank national association and pnc capital markets llc as sole lead arranger and bookrunner the credit agreement amends and restates the existing credit facility the credit agreement will terminate on october   until the expiration date the company may borrow on the new revolving credit facility as defined below on a borrowing base formula set forth in the credit agreement pursuant to the credit agreement the company increased its existing senior secured revolving credit facility from  to  the new revolving credit facility may be increased by an amount not to exceed  without additional approval from the lenders named in the credit agreement if existing lenders agree to increase their commitments or additional lenders commit to fund such increase interest under the new revolving credit facility is calculated as follows a for domestic rate borrowings at i the greater of the agents prime rate federal funds rate plus  or the daily libor rate plus  plus ii an applicable margin of  to  and b for eurorate borrowings at the libor rate plus an applicable margin of  to  the applicable margin will vary depending on a formula calculating the companys average unused availability under the facility in addition pursuant to the credit agreement the company entered into a term loan in the amount of  which was made in a single drawing on the closing date term loan and together with the new revolving credit facility the credit obligations under the term loan interest is calculated as follows a for domestic rate borrowings at i the greater of the agents prime rate federal funds rate plus  or the daily libor rate plus  plus ii an applicable margin of  to  and b for eurorate borrowings at the libor rate plus an applicable margin of  to  the applicable margin will vary depending on a formula calculating the companys average unused availability under the facility the term loan is prepayable in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty the term loan shall be paid in full on or prior to the expiration date and shall be paid in equal quarterly amounts based on a tenyear straight line amortization schedule prepayment of the term loan in whole or in part may be made at any time without premium or penalty the credit obligations are secured by a first priority security interest in certain cash accounts accounts receivable inventory the refinery including a related tank farm and the capital stock of kiantone at such time as the term loan is repaid in full and provided no event of default exists the security interest in the refinery and the equity interests in kiantone shall be released until maturity we may borrow on a borrowing base formula as set forth in the facility we had standby letters of credit of  million as of november   and there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement resulting in net availability of  million as of january   there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and there were standby letters of credit in the amount of  million resulting in a net availability of  million and the company had full access to it although we are not aware of any pending circumstances which would change our expectation changes in the tax laws the imposition of and changes in federal and state clean air and clean fuel requirements and other changes in environmental laws and regulations may also increase future capital expenditure levels future capital expenditures are also subject to business conditions affecting the industry we continue to investigate strategic acquisitions and capital improvements to our existing facilities federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment affect nearly all of our operations as is the case with all the companies engaged in similar industries we face significant exposure from actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters future expenditures related to environmental matters cannot be reasonably quantified in many circumstances due to the uncertainties as to required remediation methods and related cleanup cost estimates we cannot predict what additional environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted or become effective in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to products or activities to which they have not been previously applied    table of contents seasonal factors seasonal factors affecting the companys business may cause variation in the prices and margins of some of the companys products for example demand for gasoline tends to be highest in spring and summer months while demand for home heating oil and kerosene tends to be highest in winter months as a result the margin on gasoline prices versus crude oil costs generally tends to increase in the spring and summer while margins on home heating oil and kerosene tend to increase in the winter inflation the effect of inflation on the company has not been significant during the last five fiscal years   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses its amended and restated revolving credit facility to finance a portion of its operations this onbalance sheet financial instrument to the extent it provides for variable rates exposes the company to interest rate risk resulting from changes in the agent banks prime rate the federal funds or libor rate as of january   there were no outstanding borrowings under the amended and restated revolving credit facility from time to time the company uses derivatives to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in crude oil purchase costs and refining margins derivative products specifically crude oil option contracts and crack spread option contracts are used to hedge the volatility of these items the company accounts for changes in the fair value of its contracts by marking them to market and recognizing any resulting gains or losses in its consolidated statements of operations there has been no derivative activity in fiscal    item  controls and procedures our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of november   the term disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de under the
