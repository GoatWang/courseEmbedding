canadian financial life insurance and wealth management company with businesses located in canada the us and asia sun life is well positioned to thrive as interest rates continue their climb over the next few years over the past five years life and health sales have grown at a compound annual growth rate cagr of about  with wealth sales growing at a  cagr net income has grown at a  cagr and it appears that the positive momentum is likely to continue in the years going forward as we gradually leave an environment with rockbottom interest rates like its peer manulife financial corp tsxmfcnysemfc sun life has also seen weakness from its us business manulife’s us business john hancock hasn’t been living up to expectations and shareholders have been pushing for the company to sell the lagging segment manulife has expressed interest in starting an ipo or spinning off its us business with the hopes of boosting longterm returns for shareholders the canadian and asian businesses are doing really well after all but unfortunately the impressive growth is being dragged down by the weakness in the us segment could sun life follow manulife by spinning off its us business it’s possible and shareholders would probably be all for it but i think now would be a bad time to sell the us business interest rates are on their way up and as the us economy strengthens under trump’s agenda it’s very likely that we’ll see consumers spend more on insurance products let’s face it insurance is probably the last thing on our minds especially if we can barely afford it it’s another expense and it’s usually one of the first things to cut when times get tough this is a major reason why insurance companies like sun life and manulife have still yet to recover from the financial crisis over the next few years it’s quite possible that we could see life insurance companies move into the green again as the environment becomes more favourable sun life also offers exposure its investors exposure to the developing countries like india vietnam and the philippines all of which are expected to see their middle classes grow by a substantial amount over the next few years valuation sun life pays a very attractive  yield that patient income investors are sure to appreciate shares also look fairly valued at current levels especially when you consider the tailwind of an increasing interest rate environment the stock currently trades at a  pricetoearnings multiple and a  pricetocash flow multiple both of which are lower than the company’s fiveyear historical average multiples of  and  respectively if you’re looking for a nonbank financial with international exposure an attractive dividend and some positive longterm catalysts then sun life looks like a solid bet
