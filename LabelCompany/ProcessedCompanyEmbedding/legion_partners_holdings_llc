our competitive advantage stems from an ability to combine the strengths and reputations of institutional partners and high net worth investors with a wellaligned active management strategy in corporate governance legion partners is committed to executing a corporate governance or activism style of investing this strategy generally incorporates deep value security selection a longterm oriented ownership horizon and some form of active engagement or eventdriven catalyst to ultimately realize additional value for the benefit and interests of longerterm shareholders activist strategies may involve obtaining representation on a portfolio companys board of directors implementing various efforts to impact a portfolio company’s policies or strategic direction or in some cases simply advocating specific business activities for the fundamental benefit of a portfolio company we believe that in certain circumstances poor governance and ineffective corporate leadership have led to considerable deterioration of longterm value these instances include individual company situations sectors and industries and to an extent the broader capital markets appropriate corporate governance and proper oversight from longterm oriented equity owners have meaningful potential to protect value by lowering risk and in fact provide a major catalyst to reverse value destruction under select conditions responsible activism has historically been able to unlock significant shareholder value and generate highly attractive returns for investors our private equity approach to investing in public markets is distinctly efficient and well aligned with the interests of longterm shareholders in addition our active involvement with and extensive due diligence on each target portfolio

legion partners holdings llc together with its affiliates legion partners and the california state teachers retirement system calstrs today announced the withdrawal of their slate of director nominees for election to the board and their proposal to appoint an independent chairman at the companys upcoming  annual meeting of shareholders annual meeting  calstrs a proposal to declassify the board will continue to be presented for a vote at the annual meeting  legion partners and calstrs beneficially own in the aggregate approximately  of perry ellis outstanding common stock we are pleased with perry ellis decision to nominate bruce j klatsky and michael w rayden to the board to replace two longserving incumbent directors said chris kiper of legion partners we believe their relevant experience and record of building value at other companies will bring positive change to the boardroom in recognition of the company moving in the overall direction of our recommendations we are withdrawing our slate of director nominees for election to the board at the annual meeting with the election of messrs klatsky and rayden at the annual meeting the board will have replaced five longtenured directors with five new independent directors in the past  months – an outcome we do not believe would have resulted without our active and ongoing involvement on behalf of all shareholders while we believe more must be done to build value for shareholders we are encouraged by the steps taken to date and stand ready to help this reconstituted board move the company in the right direction said anne sheehan calstrs director of corporate governance legion partners and calstrs last year filed a schedule d and commenced a number of private and public communications in which legion partners and calstrs expressed significant concerns regarding the companys historical underperformance poor corporate governance practices high level of relatedparty transactions and need for the addition of truly independent directors to the board since that process began the board announced among other things a substantially reconstituted board comprising five new independent directors on a board of seven the resignation of george feldenkreis as ceo the appointment of a new lead independent director with less than one year of tenure on the board the reassessment of all relatedparty transactions and termination of certain relatedparty transactions the adoption of a majority voting requirement for the election of directors in uncontested elections the implementation of restrictions on pledging and hedging of the companys common stock for executives and employees and the adoption of a stock ownership policy for directors as the changes recommended by legion partners and calstrs have been implemented the company stock price has increased  since the date of legion partners and calstrs original schedule d filing  as significant holders of perry ellis legion partners and calstrs are hopeful the reconstituted board will continue to make changes that benefit all shareholders  specifically legion partners and calstrs hope that the company will move to among other things  undertake a robust search process to find the right ceo for the company rather than continue the feldenkreis family domination  agree to destagger the board such that directors will be elected annually  appoint a truly independent chairman  terminate all related party transactions and  undertake a strategic review process said mr kiper we remain excited about the opportunity ahead for the company and will continue to encourage the reconstituted board and management to embrace the strategic initiatives that we have advanced but that have not yet been adopted  we sincerely hope that the reconstituted board and management will be amenable to considering alternative views expressed by shareholders to maximize value for all shareholders  going forward we will continue to hold the board and management accountable for achieving the companys currentyear ebitda margin target of  and the  ebitda margin target of   we believe the company needs to implement a plan to achieve ebitda margins well above the  target of  and that a new ceo will likely be required to make this a reality about legion partners legion partners is a longtermoriented activist fund focused on producing superior
