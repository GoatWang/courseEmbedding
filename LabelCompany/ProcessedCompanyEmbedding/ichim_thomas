dual role for ido immune system and ido autoimmune disorders and ido cancer and ido clinical interventions clinical trials future actions for molecular dx and targeted therapies conclusion references table  ido clinical trials table  kyn induced genes table  possible biomarkers and molecular diagnostics targets table  current interventions  abstract overall purpose is to find a method to manipulate ido for clinical applications mainly the focus of this review is is cancer prevention and treatment  the first study proving the connection between ido and immune response came from a very natural event a protection of pregnancy in human this led to discover that high ido expression is a common factor in cancer tumors thus attention promoted investigations on ido’s role in various disease states immune disorders transplantation inflammation women health mood disorders many approaches vaccines and adjuvants are underway to find new immunotherapies by combining the power of dcs in immune response regulation and specific direction of sirna  as a result with this unique qualities of ido dcs and sirna we orchestrated a novel intervention for immunomodulation of ido by inhibiting with small interference rna called sirnaidodcvax  proven that our dcvax created a delay and regression of tumor growth without changing the natural structure and characterization of dcs in melanoma and breast cancers in vivo  the shrna ido dcvax is developed by regen biophrama san diego ca   thomas ichim phd cso and david koos ceo  doubleedged sword of ido the good and the bad for clinical intervention and developments ido almost has a dual role there is a positive side of high expression of ido during pregnancy    transplants      infectious diseases  and but this tolerance is negative during autoimmunedisorders    tumors of cancer         and mood disorders  the increased ido expression has a doubleedged sword in human physiology provides a positive role during protection of fetus and grafts after transplantations but becomes a negative factor during autoimmune disorders cancer sepsis and mood disorders prevention of allogeneic fetal rejection is possible by tryptophan metabolism  rejecting with lack of ido but allocating if ido present    these studies lead to find “the natural regulation mechanism” for protecting the transplants from graft versus host disease gvhd  and getting rid of tumors the plasticity of  mammary and uterus during reproduction may hold some more answers to prevent gvhd and tumors of cancer with good understanding of ido and tryptophan mechanism   after allogeneic bone marrow transplants the risk of solid tumor development increased about  among  patients even with a greater risk among patients under  years old   the adaptation of tolerance against host mechanism is connected to the ido expression  during implantation and early pregnancy ido has a role by making cdcdfoxp regulatory t cells tregs and expressing in dcs and  mqs     clonal deletion mechanism prevents mother to react with paternal products since female mice accepted the paternal mhc antigenexpressing tumor graft during pregnancy and rejected three weeks after delivery  ctlaig gene therapy alleviates abortion through regulation of apoptosis and inhibition of spleen lymphocytes     immune system and ido dcs are the orchestrator of the immune response    with list of functions in uptake processing and presentation of antigens activation of effector cells such as tcells and nkcells and secretion of cytokines and other immunemodulating molecules to direct the immune response the differential regulation of ido in distinct dc subsets is widely studied to delineate and correct immune homeostasis during autoimmunity infection and cancer and the associated immunological outcomes genesis of antigen presenting cells apcs eventually the immune system require migration of monocytes mos which is originated in bone marrow then these mos move from bloodstream to other tissues to become macrophages and dcs   initiation of immune response requires apcs to link resting helper tcell with the matching antigen to protect body dcs are superior to mqs and mos in their immune action model when dcs are first described  and classified their role is determined as a highly potent antigenpresenting cell apc subset with  to times more effective than macrophages and bcells in priming tcells both mqs and monocytes phagocytize the pathogen and their cell structure contains very large nucleus and many internal vesicles however there is a nuance between mq and dcs since dcs has a wider capacity of stimulation because mqs activates only memory t cells yet dcs can activate both naïve and memory t cells dcs are potent activators of t cells and they also have well controlled regulatory roles dc properties determine the regulation regardless of their origin or the subset of the dcs dcs reacts after identification of the signals or influencers for their inhibitory stimulatory or regulatory roles before they express a complex repertoire of positive and negative cytokines transmembrane proteins and other molecules thus “two signal theory” gains support with a defined rule  the combination of two signals their interaction with types of cells and time are critical in short specificity and time are matter for a proper response when ido mrna expression is activated with ctl ligand and ifngamma ido results inhibition of t cell production   however if dcs are inhibited by mt an inhibitor of ido the response stop but igg has no affect   in addition if the stimulation is started by a tryptophan metabolite which is downstream of ido such as hydroxyantranilic or quinolinic acids it only inhibits th but not th subset of t cells  furthermore inclusion of signal molecules such as fas ligand cytochrome c and pathways also differ in the t cell differentiation mechanisms due to combination time and specificity of twosignals  the coculture experiments are great tool to identify specific stimuli in disease specific microenvironment    for discovering the mechanism and interactions between molecules in gene regulation biochemical mechanism and physiological function during cell differentiation as a result the simplest differential cell development from the early development of dcs impact the outcome of the data for example collection of mos from peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs with il and gmcsf leads to immature dcs idcs on next step treatment of idcs with tumor necrosis factor tnf or other plausible cytokines tgfb ifngamma ifnalpha  ifnbeta il etc based on the desired outcome differentiate idcs  into mature dcs mdcs dcs live only up to a week but mos and generated mqs can live up to a month in the given tissue b cells inhibit t cell dependent immune responses in tumors  autoimmune disorders the balance of ido expression becomes necessary to prevent overactive immune response selfdestruction so modulation in tryptophan and nda metabolisms maybe essential  when splenic idoexpressing cdb  dcs from tolerized animals applied they suppressed the development of arthritis increased the tregth cell ratio and decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines in the spleen  the role of nicotinamide prevention on type  diabetes and ameliorates multiple sclerosis in animal model presented with activities of  ndas stimulating gpcra to produce prostaglandins to induce ido expression then these pges and pgds converted to the antiinflammatory prostaglandin dpgj     thus these events promotes endogenous signaling mechanisms involving the gpcrs ep ep and dp along with ppargamma  modulating the immune response at noncanonical at canonocal pathway while keeping the noncanonical nfkb intact may help to mend immune disorders as a result the targeted blocking in canonical at associated kinase ikkβ and leaving noncanonocal nfkb pathway intact dcs tips the balance towards immune supression hence noncanonical nfκb pathway for regulatory functions in dcs required effective ido induction directly or indirectly by endogenous ligand kyn and negative regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production as a result this may help to treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis type  diabetes inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis or allergy or transplant rejection while the opposite action needs to be taken during prevention of tumors that is inhibition of noncanonical pathway  inflammation induces not only relaxation of veins and lowering blood pressure but also stimulate coagulopathies that worsen the microenvironment and decrease survival rate of patients after radio or chemotherapiescancer generating tumor vaccines and using adjuvants underway  clinical correlation and genetic responses also compared in several studies to diagnose and target the system for cancer therapies     the recent surveys on ido expression and human cancers showed that ido targeting is a candidate for cancer therapy since ido expression recruiting tregs downregulates mhc class i and creating negative immune microenvironment for protection of development of tumors     inhibition of ido expression can make advances in immunotherapy and chemotherapy fields     ido has a great importance on prevention of cancer development  there are many approaches to create the homeostasis of immune response by immunotherapy  however given the complexity of immune regulations immunomodulation is a better approach to correct and relieve the system from the disease  some of the current ido targeted immunotherapy or immmunomodulations with rna technology for cancer prevention       or applied on human or animals         or chemical   or  radiological   the targeted cell type in immune system generally dcs monocytes t cells  and neutrophils   on this paper we will concentrate on dcvax on cancer treatments treg regulatory t cells th t helper ctla cytotoxic t lymphocyteassociated antigen  tcr t cell receptor ido indoleamine dioxygenase refernece httpwwwpnasorgcontentsuppldc ido and the downstream enzymes in tryptophan pathway produce a series of immunosuppressive tryptophan metabolites that may lead into tregs proliferation or increase in t cell apoptosis     and some can affect nk cell function  the interesting part of the mechanism is even without presence of ido itself downstream enzymes of ido in the kynurenine tryptophan degradation still show immunosuppressive outcome   due to not only kyn but also tgfbeta stimulated long term responses dc vaccination with ido plausible  due to its power in immune response changes and longevity in the bloodstream for reversing the system for th production  clinical interventions are taking advantage of the dc’s central role and combining with enhancing molecules for induction of immunity may overcome tolerogenic dcs in tumors of cancers   the first successful application of dc vaccine used against advanced melanoma after loading dcs with tumor peptides or autologous cell lysate in presence of adjuvants keyhole limpet hematocyanin klh   previous animal and clinical studies show use of dcs against tumors created success    as well as some problems due to heterogeneity of dc populations in one study supporting tumor growth rather than diminishing  dc vaccination applied onto over four thousand clinical trial but none of them used sirnaido dc vaccination method clinical trials evaluating dcs loaded ex vivo with purified taas as an anticancer immunotherapeutic interventions also did not include ido table from  this table presented the data from  clinical trials  of which discontinued evaluating dcs loaded ex vivo with taas as an anticancer immunotherapy for  types of cancer aml breast cancer  glioblastoma  glioma  hepatocellular carcinoma  hematological malignancies  melanoma  neuroblastoma sarcoma  nsclc  ovarian cancer  pancreatic cancer  prostate cancer  at phase i ii or iii tipping the balance between treg and th ratio has a therapeutic advantage for restoring the health that is also shown in ovarian cancer by dc vaccination with adjuvants   this rebalancing of the immune system towards immunogenicity may restore tregth ratio   but it is complicated the stimulation of il and il induce treg produce less th and inhibiting ctl activation and its function    while animals treated with antitgfb before vaccination increase the plasma levels of il for tumor specific t cell survival in vivo   ovarian cancer studies after human papilloma virus infection present an increase of il  opposing signal mechanism downregulates the tgfb to activate ctl and th population with il and il expression    the effects of il on antitumor properties observed by unique subset of cd t cells  called also cd t cells secrete even more il  using cytokines as adjuvants during vaccination may improve the efficacy of vaccination since cancer vaccines unlike infections vaccines applied after the infection or disease started against the established adoptive immune response  adjuvants are used to improve the responses of the given therapies commonly in immunotherapy applications as a combination therapy  enhancing cancer vaccine efficacy via modulation of the microenvironment is a plausible solution if only know who are the players  several molecules can be used to initiate and lengthen the activity of intervention to stimulate ido expression without compromising the mechanism   the system is complicated so generally induction is completed exvivo stimulation of dcs in cell lysates whole tumor lysates to create the microenvironment and natural stimulatory agents introduction of molecules as an adjuvants on genetic regulation on modulation of dcs are critical because order and time of the signals specific location tissue and heterogeneity of personal needs    these studies demonstrated that il with low tgfb stimulates ctl and th whereas elevated tgfb with il increases th and tregs in cancer microenvironments for example retpeptide antitumor vaccine contains an extracellular fragment of ret protein and th polarized immunoregulator cpg oligonucleotide  with mt a potent inhibitor of ido brought a powerful as well as specific cellular and humoral immune responses in mice  the main idea of choosing ret to produce vaccine in ret related carcinomas fall in two criterion first choosing patients selfantigens for cancer therapy with a nonmutated gene second there is no evidence of genetic mutations in ret amino acids  demonstration of proliferating hemangiomas benign endothelial tumors and often referred as hemangiomas of infancy appearing at head or neck express ido and slowly regressed as a result of immune mediated process after large scale of genomic analysis show insulin like growth factor  as the key regulator of hematoma growth ritter et al  we set out to develop new technology with our previous expertise in immunotherapy and immunomodulation     correcting thth ratio  and sirna technology    we developed sirnaidodcvax patented two technologies “immunomodulation using altered dcs patent no us a and method of cancer treatments using sirna silencing patent no us a in melanoma cancer dcs were preconditioned with whole tumor lysate but in breast cancer model pretreatment completed with tumor cell lysate before sirnaidodcvax applied both of these studies was a success without modifying the autanticity of dcs but decreasing the ido expression to restore immunegenity by delaying tumor growth in breast cancer  and in melanoma   thus our dcvax specifically interfere with ido without disturbing natural structure and content of the dcs in vivo showed that it is possible to carry on this technology to clinical applications furthermore our method of intervention is more sophisticated since it has a direct interaction mechanism with exvivo dc modulation without creating long term metabolism imbalance in trpkyn metabolite mechanisms since the action is corrective and noninvasive refence httpwwwmedscapecomviewarticle there were several reasons first prevention of tumor development studies targeting nonenzymatic pathway initiated by pdcs conditioned with tgfbeta is specific to ido  second ido upregulation in antigen presenting cells allowing metastasis show that most human tumors express ido at high levels   third tolerogenic dcs secretes several molecules some of them are transforming growth factor beta tgfb interleukin il human leukocyte antigen g hlag and leukemia inhibitory factor lif and nonsecreted program cell death ligand  pd l and ido indolamine dioxygenase which promote tumor tolerance thus we took advantage of dcs properties and ido specificity to prevent the tolerogenicity with sirnaido dc vaccine in both melanoma and breast cancer fourth ido expression in dcs make them even more potent against tumor antigens and create more t cells against tumors idos are expressed at different levels by both in broad range of tumor cells and many subtypes of dcs including monocytederived dcs  plasmacytoid dcs  cda dcs  ido compotent dcs  ifngammaactivated dcs used in dc vaccination  these dcs suppress immune responses through several mechanisms for induction of apoptosis towards activated t cells  to mediate antigenspecific t cell anergy in vivo  and for enhancement of treg cells production at sites of vaccination with idopositive dcs in human patients       if dcs are preconditioned with tumor lysate with mt vaccination they increase dcvax effectiveness unlike dcs originated from “normal” healthy lysate with mt in pancreatic cancer   as a result we concluded that the immunesupressive effect of ido can be reversed by sirna because treg cells enhances dc vaccinemediated antitumorimmunity in cancer patients gene silencing is a promising technology regardless of advantages simplicity for finding gene interaction mechanisms in vitro and disadvantages of the technology is utilizing the system with specificity in vivo    sirna technology is one of the newest solution for the treatment of diseases as human genomics is only producing about  genes by representing  of its genome thus utilizing the rna open the doors for more comprehensive and less invasive effects on interventions thus this technology is still improving and using adjuvants silencing of kras inhibit the growth of tumors in human pancreatic cancers  silencing of betacatenin in colon cancers causes tumor regression in mouse models  silencing of vascular endothelial growth factor vgef decreased angiogenesis and inhibit tumor growth  combining sirna ido and dcvax from adult stem cell is a novel technology for regression of tumors in melanoma and breast cancers in vivo our data showed that idosirna reduced tumor derived t cell apoptosis and tumor derived inhibition of t cell proliferation  in addition silencing ido made dcs more potent against tumors since treated or pretreated animals showed a delay or decreased the tumor growth     clinical trials first fda approved dcbased cancer therapies for treatment of hormonerefractory prostate cancer as autologous cellular immunotherapy    however there are many probabilities to iron out for a predictive outcome in patients table  demonstrates the current summary of clinical trials report  this table shows

specific cell type selected inhibitionactivation sequence based on patient’s genomic profile may improve the efficacy of clinical interventions on cancer treatments targeted therapies for specific gene regulation through signal transduction is necessary but there are few studies with genomics based approach on the other hand there are surveys observational or evaluations listed in clinical trials section registered with wwwclinicaltrialsgov that will provide a valuable shortlist of molecules  preventing stimulation of ido as well as tgfbgene expression by modulating receptor mediated phosphorylation between tgfbsmad either at madhomology  mh or madhomology  mh domains maybe possible    within smads are the conserved madhomology  mh domain which is a dna binding module contains tightly bound zinc atom smad mh domain is well conserved and one the most diverse proteinsignal interacting molecule during signal transduction due to two important serine residues located extreme distal ctermini at servalser in smad  or at pserxpser in rsmads  kyn activated orphan g protein–coupled receptor gpr with unknown function with a distinct expression pattern that collides with ido sites since its expression at high levels of the immune system and the gut      the first study to connect ido with cancer shows that group   the directly targeting to regulate ido expression is another method through modulating isres in its promoter with rnapeptide combination technology indirectly ido can be regulated through bin gene expression control over ido since bin is a negative regulator of ido and prevents ido expression  ido is under negative genetic control of bin bar adapter–encoding gene bin also known as amphiphysin bin functions in cancer suppression since attenuation of bin observed in many human malignancies          null bin mice showed that when there is lack of bin upregulation of ido through stat and nfkbdependent expression of ido makes tumor cells to escape from t cell–dependent antitumor immunity this pathway lies in nonenzymatic signal transducer function of ido after stimulation of dcs by tgfb  the detail study on bin gene by alternative spicing also provided that bin is a tumor suppressor  its activities also depends on these spliced outcome such as  exon  in muscle in turn exon  in mice has importance in role for regulating growth when bin is deleted or mutated cc myoblasts interrupted due to its missing myc cyclind or growth factor inhibiting genes like pwaf   on the other hand alternative spliced exona contributing brain cell differentiation   myc as a target at the junction between ido gene interaction and trp metabolism  bin interacts with myc either earlydependent on myc or lateindependent on myc when myc is not present this gene regulation also interfered by the long term signaling mechanism related to kynurenine kyn acting as an endogenous ligand to ahr in trp metabolite and tgfb andor ifnalpha and ifnbeta up regulation of dcs to induce ido in noncanonical pathway for nfkb and myc gene activations    hence trpkyn kyntrp thth ratios are important to be observed in patients peripheral blood these direct and indirect gene interactions place bin to function in cell differentiation    table  contains the microarray analysis for kyn affect showed that there are  genes affected by kyn two of which are upregulated and  of them downregulated  this list of genes and additional knowledge based on studies creating the diagnostics panel with these genes as a biomarker may help to analyze the outcomes of given interventions and therapies some of these molecules are great candidate to seek as an adjuvant or costimulation agents  these are myc nfkb at ikka ccd crebl gpr il il il and ilb mir rna nfkb tgfb rela and shrf in addition lip foxp ctla bin and impact should be monitored in addition table  presents the other possible mechanisms the highlights of possible targetbiomarkers are specific tlrs conserved sequences of ido across its homologous structures ccr ccr rorgammat isres of ido jak stat irfs mh and mh domains of smads endothelial cell coagulation activation mechanism and pdc maturation or immigration from lymph nodes to bloodstream should marry to control not only ido expression but also genesis of preferred dc subsets stromal mesenchymal cells are also activated by these modulation at vascular system and interferes with metastasis of cancer first thrombin human factor ii is a well regulated protein in coagulation hemostasis has a role in cell differentiation and angiogenesis protein kinase activated receptors pars type of gpcrs moderate the actions second during hematopoietic response endothelial cells produce hematopoietic growth factors   third components of bone marrow stroma cells include monocytes adipocytes and mesenchymal stem cells  as a result addressing this issue will prevent occurrence of coagulapathologies namely dic bleeding thrombosis so that patients may also improve response rate towards therapies personal genomic profiles are powerful tool to improve efficacy in immunotherapies since there is an influence of age young vs adult state of immune system innate vs adopted or acquired immunity table  includes some of the current studies directly with ido and indirectly effecting its mechanisms via gene therapy dna vaccine gene silencing and adjuvant applications as an intervention method to prevent various cancer types conclusion ido has a confined function in immune system through complex interactions to maintain hemostasis of immune responses the genesis of ido stem from duplication of bacterial idolike genes  inhibition of microbial infection and invasion by depleting tryptophan limits and kills the invader but during starvation of trp the host may pass the twilight zone since trp required by host’s t cells  thus the host cells in these small pockets adopt to new microenvironment with depleted trp and oxygen poor conditions hence the cell metabolism differentiate to generate new cellular structure like nodules and tumors under the protection of constitutively expressed ido in tumors dcs and inhibited t cell proliferation on the other hand having a dichotomy in ido function can be a potential limiting factor that means is that idos impact on biological system could be variable based on several issues such as target cells ido’s capacity pathologic state of the disease and conditions of the microenvironment thus close monitoring is necessary to analyze the outcome to prevent conspiracies since previous studies generated paradoxical results current therapies through chemotherapies radiotherapies are costly and effectiveness shown that the clinical interventions require immunotherapies as well as coagulation and vascular biology manipulations for a higher efficacy and survival rate in cancer patients our sirna and dc technologies based on stem cell modulation will provide at least prevention of cancer
