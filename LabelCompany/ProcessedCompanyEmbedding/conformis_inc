conformis investors imagetoimplant® process products faq patient id card the opinions expressed in this video represent the experiences of those interviewed and not the opinions of conformis customized knee replacement implants there’s a reason  in  patients are not satisfied with their traditional total knee replacementi in traditional knee replacement surgery the surgeon selects an “offtheshelf” implant from a range of standard fixed sizes and then has to make the necessary adjustments to fit the implant to the patient during the procedure because offtheshelf knee replacements aren’t designed to your specific anatomy surgeons have to compromise on implant fit this compromise may result in having implant overhang implant hangs over the bone or underhang the implant is too small leaving the bone exposed and uncovered it could also result in an implant that isn’t aligned properly surgeons  things to know not all patientspecific systems are created equal learn more » clinical studies have demonstrated that these compromises on fit can cause residual pain after surgery at conformis we design partial and total knee implants to fit the patient not the other way around we combine proven elements of standard knee replacement with our ifit imagetoimplant® technology to create customized knee implants and surgical instrumentation that are designed to fit your knee’s natural shape and curves with this patientspecific approach the conformis knee replacement systems offer unique advantages we believe are not possible with traditional offtheshelf implants including individualized fit that reduces sizing compromises common with offtheshelf implants and associated with residual pain after surgeryii designed to follow the shape and contour of each patient’s knee which provides an increased potential for a more natural feeling knee designed for optimal bone preservationiii reproducible surgical technique using disposable prenavigated ijig® instrumentation and iview surgical planning images with detailed resection values that can be used to verify accuracy throughout the surgery imagetoimplant® process products the itotal cr knee replacement system is intended for use as a total knee replacement in patients with knee joint pain and disability whose conditions cannot be solely addressed by the use of a prosthetic device that treats only one or two of the three knee compartments such as a unicondylar patellofemoral or bicompartmental prosthesis only a licensed physician can help you determine the appropriate medical treatment there are potential risks to knee replacement surgery and individual results may vary before making any decisions concerning medical treatment consult your physician regarding your options and the risks of those options the longevity performance and feel of any knee implant will depend on various factors including your physical condition your activity level adherence to your physicians instructions and other factors the indications for use include painful joint disease due to osteoarthritis traumatic arthritis rheumatoid arthritis or osteonecrosis of the knee post traumatic loss of joint function moderate varus valgus or flexion deformity in which the ligamentous structures can be returned to adequate function and stability failed osteotomies hemiarthroplasties and unicondylar patellofemoral or bicompartmental implants revision procedures provided that anatomic landmarks necessary for alignment and positioning of the implant are identifiable on patient imaging scans the implant is intended for cemented use only caution federal law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a physician i according to a study of  patients published by bourne in  in the peerreviewed journal clinical orthopaedics and related research in this study entitled patient satisfaction after total knee arthroplasty who is satisfied and who is not “the overall satisfaction question was used to determine a two category satisfaction outcome by combining patients who answered very dissatisfied dissatisfied or neutral into one group and patients who answered satisfied or very satisfied into the second group” ii mahoney et al overhang of the femoral component in total knee arthroplasty risk factors and clinical consequences the journal of bone and joint surgery    iii
