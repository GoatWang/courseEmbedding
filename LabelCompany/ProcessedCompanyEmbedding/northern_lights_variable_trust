by searching for the file number or for an applicant using the company name box at httpwwwsecgov​searchhtm or by calling   applicants representations  the fund was organized as a delaware statutory trust on november   and is registered under the  act as an openend management investment company file no  the fund is a series investment company as defined by rule f under the  act and is currently comprised of fourteen portfolios managed by seven different investment advisers and three subadvisers the portfolios share a single board of trustees “board” and service providers for example auditors and fund counsel the investment advisers are not affiliated with gemini and may or may not be affiliated with each other  shares of the portfolios will not be sold to the general public but will be offered to separate accounts of a participating insurance company qualified plans the adviser for seed money and general accounts  gemini provides administrative fund accounting and transfer agent services to the portfolios subject to the supervision of the board gemini may provide individuals to serve as officers of the insurance funds which officers may be directors officers or employees of gemini or its affiliates gemini is paid a fee for its services which may consist of a base fee a per account fee andor an assetbased fee  the insurance funds may offer their shares to separate accounts of participating insurance companies to serve as an investment medium to support variable life insurance contracts “vli contracts” and variable annuity contracts “va contracts” together “variable contracts” issued through such accounts if a separate account is registered as an investment company under the  act or is exempt from such registration under section c of the  act it will be a “separate account” as defined by rule e or any successor rule under the  act for purposes of the act the participating insurance company that start printed page establishes such a separate account is the depositor and sponsor of the account as those terms have been interpreted by the commission with respect to variable life insurance and variable annuity separate accounts  as described more fully below the insurance funds will sell shares to separate accounts only if each participating insurance company sponsoring such a separate account enters into a participation agreement a “participation agreement” with such insurance fund the participation agreement will govern participation by the participating insurance company in such insurance fund and will memorialize among other matters the fact that the participating insurance company will remain responsible for establishing and maintaining any separate account covered by the participation agreement and for complying with all applicable requirements of state and federal law pertaining to such accounts and to the sale and distribution of variable contracts issued through such accounts the role of the insurance funds under this arrangement insofar as federal securities laws are applicable will consist of offering shares to the separate accounts and fulfilling any conditions that the commission may impose upon granting the order  the use of a common management investment company or investment portfolio thereof as an investment medium for both vli accounts and va accounts of the same participating insurance company or of two or more insurance companies that are affiliated persons of each other is referred to herein as “mixed funding” the use of a common management investment company or investment portfolio thereof as an investment medium for vli accounts andor va accounts of two or more participating insurance companies that are not affiliated persons of each other is referred to herein as “shared funding”  applicants propose that the insurance funds be permitted to offer and sell shares to qualified plans administered by a trustee federal tax law permits investment companies to increase their net assets by selling shares to qualified plans  qualified plans may invest in shares of an investment company as the sole investment under the qualified plan or as one of several investments qualified plan participants may or may not be given an investment choice depending on the terms of the qualified plan itself the trustees or other fiduciaries of a qualified plan may vote investment company shares held by the qualified plan in their own discretion or if the applicable qualified plan so provides vote such shares in accordance with instructions from participants in such qualified plans applicants have no control over whether trustees or other fiduciaries of qualified plans rather than participants in the qualified plans have the right to vote under any particular qualified plan each qualified plan must be administered in accordance with the terms of the qualified plan and as determined by its trustee or trustees  applicants propose that the insurance funds may also sell shares to its adviser for the purpose of providing seed capital to a portfolio the treasury regulations permit such sales as long as the return on shares held by the adviser or an affiliate is computed in the same manner as shares held by separate accounts the adviser or an affiliate does not intend to sell the shares to the public and sales to an investment adviser or affiliate are only made in connection with the creation of a series of an investment company applicants propose that the insurance funds also be permitted to offer andor sell shares to the general accounts of participating insurance companies the treasury regulations permit sales to general accounts as long as the return on shares held by general accounts is computed in the same manner as for shares held by separate accounts and the participating insurance company does not intend to sell the shares to the public  the use of a common management investment company or investment portfolio thereof as an investment medium for vli accounts va accounts investment advisers a general account and qualified plans is referred to herein as “extended mixed funding” applicants legal analysis  section a of the  act makes it unlawful for any company to serve as an investment adviser or principal underwriter of any investment company including a unit investment trust if an affiliated person of that company is subject to disqualification enumerated in section a or  of the act sections a a and b of the  act have been deemed by the commission to require “passthrough” voting with respect to an underlying investment companys shares  rule eb under the  act provides partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the act to vli accounts organized as unit investment trusts “uits” supporting scheduled premium vli contracts and to their life insurance company depositors the exemptions granted by the rule are available however only where a fund offers its shares exclusively to vli accounts of the same participating insurance company andor of participating insurance companies that are affiliated persons of the same participating insurance company and then only where scheduled premium vli contracts are issued through such vli accounts therefore vli accounts their depositors and their principal underwriters may not rely on the exemptions provided by rule eb if shares of a portfolio are held by a vli account through which flexible premium vli contracts are issued a vli account of an unaffiliated participating insurance company an unaffiliated investment adviser any va account or a qualified plan in other words rule eb does not provide exemptions when a scheduled premium vli account invests in shares of a management investment company that serves as a vehicle for mixed funding extended mixed funding or shared funding  rule etb under the  act provides partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the act to vli accounts organized as uits supporting flexible premium variable life insurance contracts and their life insurance company depositors the exemptions granted by the rule are available however only where a fund offers its shares exclusively to vli accounts through which either scheduled premium or flexible premium vli contracts are issued of the same participating insurance company andor of participating insurance companies that are affiliated persons of the same participating insurance company va accounts of the same participating insurance company or of affiliated participating insurance companies or the general account of the same participating insurance company or of affiliated participating insurance companies therefore vli accounts their depositors and their principal underwriters may not rely on the exemptions provided by rule etb if shares of a portfolio are held by a vli account of an unaffiliated participating insurance company a va account of an unaffiliated participating insurance company an unaffiliated investment adviser the general account of an unaffiliated participating insurance company or a qualified plan in other words rule etb provides exemptions when a vli account supporting flexible premium start printed page vli contracts invests in shares of a management investment company that serves as a vehicle for mixed funding but does not provide exemptions when such a vli account invests in shares of a management investment company that serves as a vehicle for extended mixed funding or shared funding  as explained below applicants maintain that there is no policy reason for the sale of shares to qualified plans to prohibit or otherwise limit a vli account and its participating insurance company depositor from relying on the relief provided by rules eb and etb notwithstanding rule e and rule et each specifically provides that the relief granted thereunder is available only where shares of the underlying fund are offered exclusively to insurance company separate accounts in this regard applicants request exemptive relief in cases where vli accounts hold shares when such shares are also sold to qualified plans  applicants are not aware of any reason for excluding separate accounts and investment companies engaged in shared funding from the exemptive relief provided under rules eb and etb or for excluding separate accounts and investment companies engaged in mixed funding from the exemptive relief provided under rule eb similarly applicants are not aware of any reason for excluding participating insurance companies from the exemptive relief requested because the insurance funds may also sell their shares to qualified plans rather applicants assert that the proposed sale of shares to qualified plans in fact may allow for the development of larger pools of assets resulting in the potential for greater investment and diversification opportunities and for decreased expenses at higher asset levels resulting in greater cost efficiencies  for the reasons explained below applicants have concluded that investment by qualified plans in the insurance funds should not increase the risk of material irreconcilable conflicts between owners of vli contracts and other types of investors or between owners of vli contracts issued by unaffiliated participating insurance companies  consistent with the commissions authority under section c of the  act to grant exemptive orders to a class or classes of persons and transactions applicants request exemptions for a class consisting of vli accounts investing in shares of existing and future portfolios of insurance funds their participating insurance company depositors and their principal underwriters  section c of the  act provides in part that the commission by order upon application may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from any provision or provisions of the act or the rules or regulations thereunder if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act applicants submit that the exemptions requested are appropriate and in the public interest consistent with the protection of investors and consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act  section a of the  act provides among other things that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser or principal underwriter of any registered openend investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in sections a or  rules ebi and ii and rules etbi and ii under the act provide exemptions from section a under certain circumstances subject to the limitations discussed above on mixed funding extended mixed funding and shared funding these exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate in management of the underlying investment company  the relief provided by rules ebi and etbi permits a person that is disqualified under sections a or  of the  act to serve as an officer director or employee of the life insurance company or any of its affiliates so long as that person does not participate directly in the management or administration of the underlying investment company the relief provided by rules ebii and etbii under the  act permits the life insurance company to serve as the underlying investment companys investment adviser or principal underwriter provided that none of the insurers personnel who are ineligible pursuant to section a participates in the management or administration of the investment company  in effect the partial relief granted in rules eb and etb under the  act from the requirements of section  of the act limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with section  to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of section  those rules recognize that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act to apply the provisions of section a to all individuals in a large insurance complex most of whom will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies in that organization applicants assert that it is also unnecessary to apply section a of the  act to the many individuals in various unaffiliated insurance companies or affiliated companies of participating insurance companies that may utilize the insurance funds as investment vehicles for separate accounts there is no regulatory purpose served in extending the monitoring requirements to embrace a full application of section as eligibility restrictions because of mixed funding extended mixed funding or shared funding the participating insurance companies and qualified plans are not expected to play any role in the management of the insurance funds those individuals who participate in the management of the insurance funds will remain the same regardless of which va accounts vli accounts insurance companies investment advisers or qualified plans invest in the insurance funds applying the monitoring requirements of section a of the  act because of investment by vli accounts and qualified plans would be unjustified and would not serve any regulatory purpose furthermore the increased monitoring costs could reduce the net rates of return realized by owners of vli contracts and qualified plan participants moreover qualified plans unlike separate accounts are not themselves investment companies and therefore are not subject to section  of the  act furthermore it is not anticipated that a qualified plan would be an affiliated person of an insurance fund except by virtue of its holding  or more of an insurance funds shares  rules ebiii and etbiii under the  act provide exemptions from passthrough voting requirements with respect to several significant matters assuming the limitations on mixed funding extended mixed funding and shared funding are observed rules ebiiia and etbiiia provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its variable life insurance contract owners with respect to the investments of an underlying start printed page investment company or any contract between such an investment company and its investment adviser when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority subject to the provisions of paragraphs bi and biia of rules e and et  rules ebiiib and etbiiia provide that an insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of owners of its variable life insurance contracts if such owners initiate any change in an underlying investment companys investment policies principal underwriter or any investment adviser provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs bii biib and biic of rules e and et  in the case of a change in the investment policies of the underlying investment company the insurance company in order to disregard contract owner voting instructions must make a good faith determination that such a change either would  violate state law or  result in investments that either a would not be consistent with the investment objectives of its separate account or b would vary from the general quality and nature of investments and investment techniques used by other separate accounts of the company or of an affiliated life insurance company with similar investment objectives  both rule e and rule et generally recognize that a variable life insurance contract is primarily a life insurance contract containing many important elements unique to life insurance contracts and is subject to extensive state insurance regulation in adopting subparagraph biii of these rules the commission implicitly recognized that state insurance regulators have authority pursuant to state insurance laws or regulations to disapprove or require changes in investment policies investment advisers or principal underwriters  the sale of shares to qualified plans or the adviser will not have any impact on the exemptions requested herein regarding the disregard of passthrough voting rights shares sold to qualified plans will be held by such qualified plans not insurance companies the exercise of voting rights by qualified plans whether by trustees other fiduciaries participants beneficiaries or investment managers engaged by the qualified plans does not raise the type of issues respecting disregard of voting rights that are raised by vli accounts with respect to qualified plans which are not registered as investment companies under the  act there is no requirement to pass through voting rights to qualified plan participants indeed to the contrary applicable law expressly reserves voting rights associated with qualified plan assets to certain specified persons  if a named fiduciary to a qualified plan appoints an investment manager the investment manager has the responsibility to vote the shares held unless the right to vote such shares is reserved to the trustees or another named fiduciary the qualified plans may have their trustees or other fiduciaries exercise voting rights attributable to investment securities held by the qualified plans in their discretion some qualified plans however may provide for the trustees an investment adviser or advisers or another named fiduciary to exercise voting rights in accordance with instructions from qualified plan participants  where a qualified plan does not provide participants with the right to give voting instructions applicants do not see any potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among the variable contract owners and qualified plan participants with respect to voting shares accordingly unlike the circumstances surrounding separate accounts because qualified plans are not required to pass through voting rights to participants the issue of resolution of material irreconcilable conflicts of interest should not arise with respect to voting shares  in addition if a qualified plan were to hold a controlling interest in an insurance fund applicants do not believe that such control would disadvantage other investors in such insurance fund to any greater extent than is the case when any institutional shareholder holds a majority of the shares of any openend management investment company in this regard applicants submit that investment in a portfolio by a qualified plan will not create any of the voting complications occasioned by vli account investments in the portfolio unlike vli account investments qualified plan investor voting rights cannot be frustrated by veto rights of participating insurance companies or state insurance regulators  where a qualified plan provides participants with the right to instruct the trustees how to vote portfolio shares applicants see no reason why such participants generally or those in a particular qualified plan either as a single group or in combination with participants in other qualified plans would vote in a manner that would disadvantage vli contract owners the purchase of shares by qualified plans that provide voting rights does not present any complications not otherwise occasioned by mixed or shared funding  applicants recognize that the prohibitions on mixed and shared funding might reflect concern regarding possible different investment motivations among investors when rule e was first adopted variable annuity separate accounts could invest in mutual funds whose shares were also offered to the general public therefore the commission staff may have been concerned with the potentially different investment motivations of public shareholders and owners of variable life insurance contracts there also may have been some concern with respect to the problems of permitting a state insurance regulatory authority to affect the operations of a publicly available mutual fund and the investment decisions of public shareholders  for reasons unrelated to the  act however internal revenue service ruling  sept   effectively deprived va contracts funded by publicly available mutual funds of their taxbenefited status the tax reform act of  codified the prohibition against the use of publicly available mutual funds as an investment vehicle for variable contracts in particular section h of the code in effect requires that the investments made by both vli accounts and va accounts be “adequately diversified” if such a separate account is organized as part of a “twotiered” arrangement where the account invests in shares of an underlying openend investment company ie an underlying fund the diversification test will be applied to the underlying fund or to each of several underlying funds rather than to the separate account itself but only if “all of the beneficial interests” in the underlying fund “are held by one or more insurance companies or affiliated companies in their general account or in segregated asset accounts” accordingly a separate account that invests in a publicly available mutual fund will not be adequately diversified for these purposes in addition any underlying fund including an insurance fund that sells shares to separate accounts would in effect be precluded from also selling its shares to the public consequently the insurance fund may not sell shares directly to the public  applicants assert that the rights of an insurance company or a state insurance regulator to disregard the voting instructions of owners of start printed page variable contracts is not inconsistent with either mixed funding or shared funding the national association of insurance commissioners variable life insurance model regulation the “naic model regulation” suggests that it is unlikely that insurance regulators would find an underlying funds investment policy investment adviser or principal underwriter objectionable for one type of variable contract but not another type the naic model regulation has long permitted the use of a single underlying fund for different separate accounts moreover article vi section  of the naic model regulation has been amended to remove a previous prohibition on one separate account investing in another separate account lastly the naic model regulation does not distinguish between scheduled premium and flexible premium variable life insurance contracts the naic model regulation therefore reflects the naics apparent confidence that such combined funding is appropriate and that state insurance regulators can adequately protect the interests of owners of all variable contracts  applicants assert that shared funding by unaffiliated insurance companies does not present any issues that do not already exist where a single insurance company is licensed to do business in several or all states a particular state insurance regulator could require action that is inconsistent with the requirements of other states in which the insurance company offers its contracts however the fact that different insurers may be domiciled in different states does not create a significantly different or enlarged problem  shared funding by unaffiliated insurers in this respect is no different than the use of the same investment company as the funding vehicle for affiliated insurers which rules eb and etb permit under the  act affiliated insurers may be domiciled in different states and be subject to differing state law requirements affiliation does not reduce the potential if any exists for differences in state regulatory requirements in any event the conditions set forth below are designed to safeguard against and provide procedures for resolving any adverse effects that differences among state regulatory requirements may produce if a particular state insurance regulators decision conflicts with the majority of other state regulators then the affected participating insurance company will be required to withdraw its separate account investments in the relevant portfolio this requirement will be provided for in the participation agreement that will be entered into by participating insurance companies with an insurance fund  rules eb and etb under the  act give participating insurance companies the right to disregard the voting instructions of vli contract owners in certain circumstances this right derives from the authority of state insurance regulators over vli accounts and va accounts under rules eb and etb a participating insurance company may disregard vli contract owner voting instructions only with respect to certain specified items affiliation does not eliminate the potential if any exists for divergent judgments as to the advisability or legality of a change in investment policies principal underwriter or investment adviser initiated by such contract owners the potential for disagreement is limited by the requirements in rules e and et under the  act that the participating insurance companys disregard of voting instructions be reasonable and based on specific good faith determinations  a particular participating insurance companys disregard of voting instructions nevertheless could conflict with the voting instructions of a majority of vli contract owners the participating insurance companys action possibly could be different than the determination of all or some of the other participating insurance companies including affiliated insurers that the voting instructions of vli contract owners should prevail and either could preclude a majority vote approving the change or could represent a minority view if the participating insurance companys judgment represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote then the participating insurance company may be required at the insurance funds election to withdraw its vli accounts and va accounts investments in the relevant portfolio no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal this requirement will be provided for in the participation agreement entered into between the participating insurance company and the insurance fund  applicants assert that there is no reason why the investment policies of a portfolio would or should be materially different from what these policies would or should be if the portfolio supported only va accounts or vli accounts whether flexible premium or scheduled premium vli contracts each type of insurance contract is designed as a longterm investment program  each portfolio will be managed to attempt to achieve its specified investment objective and not favor or disfavor any particular participating insurance company or type of insurance contract there is no reason to believe that different features of various types of variable contracts will lead to different investment policies for each or for different separate accounts the sale of all variable contracts and ultimate success of all separate accounts depends at least in part on satisfactory investment performance which provides an incentive for each participating insurance company to seek optimal investment performance  furthermore no single investment strategy can be identified as appropriate to a particular variable contract each “pool” of vli contract and va contract owners is composed of individuals of diverse financial status age insurance needs and investment goals a portfolio supporting even one type of variable contract must accommodate these diverse factors in order to attract and retain purchasers permitting mixed and shared funding will provide economic support for the continuation of the portfolios mixed and shared funding will broaden the base of potential variable contract owner investors which may facilitate the establishment of additional portfolios serving diverse goals  applicants do not believe that the sale of shares to qualified plans will increase the potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among different types of investors in particular applicants see very little potential for such conflicts beyond those that would otherwise exist between owners of vli contracts and va contracts applicants submit that either there are no conflicts of interest or that there exists the ability by the affected parties to resolve potential conflicts consistent with the best interests of variable contract owners and qualified plan participants  applicants considered whether there are any issues raised under the code treasury regulations or revenue rulings thereunder if qualified plans va accounts and vli accounts all invest in the same portfolio applicants have concluded that neither the code nor the treasury regulations nor revenue rulings thereunder present any inherent conflicts of interest if qualified plans vli accounts and va accounts all invest in the same portfolio  applicants note that while there are differences in the manner in which start printed page distributions from vli accounts and qualified plans are taxed these differences have no impact on the portfolios when distributions are to be made and a vli account or qualified plan is unable to net purchase payments to make distributions the vli account or qualified plan will redeem shares of the relevant portfolio at its net asset values in conformity with rule c under the  act without the imposition of any sales charge to provide proceeds to meet distribution needs a participating insurance company will then make distributions in accordance with the terms of the qualified plan  applicants considered whether it is possible to provide an equitable means of giving voting rights to vli contract owners and qualified plans in connection with any meeting of an insurance funds shareholders the relevant transfer agent will inform each participating insurance company adviser and qualified plan of their share holdings and provide other information necessary for such shareholders to participate in the meeting eg proxy materials each participating insurance company then will solicit voting instructions from owners of vli contracts and va contracts as required by either rules e or et or section deiiiaa of the  act as applicable and its participation agreement with an insurance fund shares held by a general account of a participating insurance company will be voted by the participating insurance company in the same proportion as shares for which it receives voting instructions from its variable contract owners shares held by qualified plans will be voted in accordance with applicable law the voting rights provided to qualified plans with respect to the shares would be no different from the voting rights that are provided to qualified plans with respect to shares of mutual funds sold to the general public furthermore if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a qualified plans decision to disregard qualified plan participant voting instructions if applicable and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote the qualified plan may be required at the election of the relevant insurance fund to withdraw its investment in a portfolio and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal  applicants do not believe that the ability of an insurance fund to sell shares directly to its adviser qualified plans or general account gives rise to a senior security “senior security” is defined in section g of the  act to include “any stock of a class having priority over any other class as to distribution of assets or payment of dividends” as noted above regardless of the rights and benefits of participants under qualified plans and owners of vli contracts vli accounts va accounts participating insurance companies qualified plans and the adviser only have or will only have rights with respect to their respective shares these parties can only redeem such shares at net asset value no shareholder of a portfolio has any preference over any other shareholder with respect to distribution of assets or payment of dividends  applicants do not believe that the veto power of state insurance commissioners over certain potential changes to portfolio investment objectives approved by owners of vli contracts creates conflicts between the interests of such owners and the interests of qualified plan participants applicants note that a basic premise of corporate democracy and shareholder voting is that not all shareholders may agree with a particular proposal their interests and opinions may differ but this does not mean that inherent conflicts of interest exist between or among such shareholders or that occasional conflicts of interest that do occur between or among them are likely to be irreconcilable  although participating insurance companies may have to overcome regulatory impediments in redeeming shares of a portfolio held by their vli accounts the qualified plans and the participants in participantdirected qualified plans can make decisions quickly and redeem their shares and reinvest in another investment company or other funding vehicle without impediments or as is the case with most qualified plans hold cash pending suitable investment as a result conflicts between the interests of vli contract owners and the interests of qualified plans and qualified plan participants can usually be resolved quickly since the qualified plans can on their own redeem their shares  finally applicants considered whether there is a potential for future conflicts of interest between participating insurance companies and qualified plans created by future changes in the tax laws applicants do not see any greater potential for material irreconcilable conflicts arising between the interests of vli contract owners or for that matter va contract owners and qualified plan participants from future changes in the federal tax laws than that which already exists between variable contract owners  applicants assert that permitting an insurance fund to sell shares to its adviser for the purpose of obtaining seed money or to the general account will enhance management of the insurance fund without raising significant concerns regarding material irreconcilable conflicts among different types of investors a potential source of initial capital is the adviser or a participating insurance company however the provision of seed capital by the adviser or by a participating insurance company may be deemed to violate the exclusivity requirement of rule eb andor rule etb given the conditions of treasury regulation section f and the harmony of interest between a portfolio on the one hand and its adviser or a participating insurance company on the other applicants assert that little incentive for overreaching exists furthermore such investment should not implicate the concerns discussed above regarding the creation of material irreconcilable conflicts instead investments by an adviser or by general accounts will permit the orderly and efficient creation and operation of a portfolio and reduce the expense and uncertainty of using outside parties at the early stages of the portfolios operations  various factors have limited the number of insurance companies that offer variable contracts these factors include the costs of organizing and operating a funding vehicle certain insurers lack of experience with respect to investment management and the lack of name recognition by the public of certain insurance companies as investment experts in particular some smaller life insurance companies may not find it economically feasible or within their investment or administrative expertise to enter the variable contract business on their own use of a portfolio as a common investment vehicle for vli accounts would reduce or eliminate these concerns mixed and shared funding should also provide several benefits to owners of vli contracts by eliminating a significant portion of the costs of establishing and administering separate underlying funds  participating insurance companies will benefit not only from the investment expertise of the adviser but also from the potential cost efficiencies and investment flexibility afforded by larger pools of funds mixed and shared funding also would permit a greater amount of assets available for investment by a portfolio thereby start printed page promoting economies of scale by permitting increased safety through greater diversification or by making the addition of new portfolios more feasible therefore mixed and shared funding will encourage more insurance companies to offer vli accounts this should result in increased competition with respect to both vli account design and pricing which can in turn be expected to result in more product variety  applicants also submit that regardless of the type of shareholder in a portfolio the adviser is or would be contractually and otherwise obligated to manage the portfolio solely and exclusively in accordance with that portfolios investment objectives policies and restrictions as well as any guidelines established by the board thus each portfolio will be managed in the same manner as any other mutual fund  applicants note that vli accounts historically have been employed to accumulate shares of mutual funds that are not affiliated with the depositor or sponsor of the vli account in particular applicants assert that sales of shares as described above will not have any adverse federal income tax consequences to other investors in the portfolios  in addition applicants assert that granting the exemptions requested herein is in the public interest and will not compromise the regulatory purposes of sections a a a or b of the  act or rules e or et thereunder applicants conditions applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions which shall apply to each insurance fund  a majority of the board will consist of persons who are not “interested persons” of an insurance fund as defined by section a of the  act and the rules thereunder and as modified by any applicable orders of the commission except that if this condition is not met by reason of death

board b for a period of  days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies or c for such longer period as the commission may prescribe by order upon application or by future rule  the board will monitor an insurance fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between and among the interests of the owners of all vli contracts and va contracts and participants of all qualified plans investing in the insurance fund and determine what action if any should be taken in response to such conflicts a material irreconcilable conflict may arise for a variety of reasons including a an action by any state insurance regulatory authority b a change in applicable federal or state insurance tax or securities laws or regulations or a public ruling

the assets allocable to some or all of their vli accounts or va accounts from the relevant portfolio and reinvesting such assets in a different investment vehicle including another portfolio b in the case of a participating insurance company submitting the question as to whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected variable contract owners and as appropriate segregating

declined by vote of a majority of the variable contract owners materially and adversely affected by the material irreconcilable conflict further no qualified plan will be required by this condition

are intended to be funding vehicles for variable annuity contracts and flexible premium variable life insurance policies offered by the separate accounts of various insurance companies the assets of

on april    significant accounting policies the following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the portfolios in the preparation of their financial statements these policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap securities valuation  securities listed on an exchange are valued at the last reported sale price at the close of the regular trading session of the exchange on the business day the value is being determined or in the case of securities listed on nasdaq at the nasdaq official closing price nocp  in the absence of a sale such securities shall be valued at the last bid price on the day of valuation   shortterm debt obligations having  days or less remaining until maturity at time of purchase are valued at amortized cost  investments in openend investment companies are valued at net asset value   in unusual circumstances instead of valuing securities in the usual manner securities will be valued at their fair market value as determined in good faith by the trusts fair value committee and in accordance with the trusts portfolio securities valuation procedures the procedures the board of trustees the board will review the fair value method in use for securities requiring a fair market value determination at least quarterly the procedures consider among others the following factors to determine a securitys fair value the nature and pricing history if any of the security whether any dealer quotations for the security are available and possible valuation methodologies that could be used to determine the fair value of the security   bcm decathlon portfolios notes to financial statements continued june   unaudited valuation of fund of funds  the portfolios may invest in portfolios of openend investment companies the underlying funds  openend funds are valued at their respective net asset values as reported by such investment companies openend funds value securities in their portfolios for which market quotations are readily available at their market values generally the last reported sale price and all other securities and assets at their fair value based on the methods established by the board of directors of the openend funds   each portfolio utilizes various methods to measure the fair value of all of its investments on a recurring basis gaap establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation methods the three levels of input are level   unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the portfolio has the ability to access level   observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly these inputs may include quoted prices for the identical instrument in an inactive market prices for similar instruments interest rates prepayment speeds credit risk yield curves default rates and similar data level   unobservable inputs for the asset or liability to the extent relevant observable inputs are not available representing the portfolios own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability and would be based on the best information available the availability of observable inputs can vary from security to security and is affected by a wide variety of factors including for example the type of security whether the security is new and not yet established in the marketplace the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the security to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market the determination of fair value requires more judgment  accordingly the degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy  in such cases for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety the inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those

are accounted for on trade date interest income is recognized on an accrual basis  discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized on securities purchased over the lives of the respective securities dividend income is recorded on the exdividend date realized gains or losses from sales of securities are determined by comparing the identified cost of the security lot sold with the net sales proceeds dividends and distributions to shareholders  dividends from net investment income and distributions from net realized capital gains if any are declared and paid annually dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded on exdate and are determined in accordance with federal income tax regulations which may differ from gaap these booktax differences are considered either temporary eg deferred losses capital loss carryforwards or permanent in nature to the extent these differences are permanent in nature such amounts are reclassified within the composition of net

applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income and net realized gains to shareholders therefore no federal income tax provision is required each

transaction costs including sales charges loads on purchases and  ongoing costs including management fees distribution andor service b fees and other fund expenses  this example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs in dollars of investing in the bcm decathlon portfolios and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds the example is based on an investment of  invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period from january   through june   actual expenses the actual expenses line in the table below provides information about actual account values and actual expenses  you may use the information below together with the amount you invested to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period simply divide your account value by  for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number in the table under the heading entitled expenses paid during period to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period hypothetical example for comparison purposes the hypothetical line in the table below provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the power income funds actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of  per year before expenses which is not the funds actual return the hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balances or expenses you paid for the period you may use this information to compare this  hypothetical example with the  hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of other funds please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs such as sales charges loads therefore the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds  in addition if these transactional costs were included your costs would have been higher   funds beginning ending expenses paid   annualized expense account value account value during period  actual

period  divided by the number of days in the fiscal year   please note that while class  shares commenced operations on april   the hypothetical expenses paid during the period reflect projected

consider the portfolios investment performance  however the board including the independent trustees considered backtested past performance of the aim decathlon indices compared to various benchmarks

accounts it currently manages  the trustees concluded that each of the bcm portfolios advisory fees as well as its overall expense ratio was reasonable economies of scale   the board considered whether economies of scale will emerge with respect to the management of the bcm portfolios and whether potential exists for realization of any further economies of scale  the trustees noted that the adviser has agreed a breakpoint reduction to  will be appropriate once the portfolios reach economies of scale  after discussion it was the consensus of the board including the independent trustees

considered the anticipated profits to be realized by the adviser in connection with the operation of the bcm portfolios based on materials provided to the board and whether the amount of profit is a fair entrepreneurial profit for the management of the bcm portfolios  they also considered that b fees  however the board noted that the adviser expects that  all b fees will be paid  to insurance platforms or used for other marketing or distribution costs  the trustees including the independent trustees concluded that because of the bcm portfolios expense limitation agreements and expected asset levels the board was satisfied that the advisers level of profitability from its relationship with bcm portfolios would not be excessive conclusion  having requested and received such
