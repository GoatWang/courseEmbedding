value corral friday july     register   login you are here articles and opinion » distributor sales ideas » valuebased selling  shootout at the value corral web site     a bit of explanation malcolm mills is a wellknown canadian business advisor and consultant to the purchasing and procurement world  he is the author of its a tough world out there ways to lose a customer  ways to fix it malcolm and frank hurtte wrote a series of articles where in the spirit of “pointcounter point” they debated important issues facing distributor sales people  malcolm’s book can be purchased by contacting malcolm at toughworldeastlinkca           riding for the brand – shoot out at the value corral they rode into town from the east as a crimson sun poured blood on the mountains west of crossroads city  ten thousand foreign head plugged the stock yards and pens “hellonwheelsfrank” rolled the slender cigar between tobacco stained teeth before drawing it slowly from his mouth and spitting on the parched dust at his feet  he was fed up and so were the other distributors  it wasn’t fair  they’d worked for years building up their supply from nothing scratching a living from a bald industrial prairie fighting recessions and procurement drought for years only to have it stripped from their grasp by outsiders undercutting their price and flooding the market with inferior stock he loosened the sixgun on his hip and pushed his way through the batwing doors into the reality saloon  he’d had just about enough of these donothing box pushing distributors breezing into town and plugging the market with cheap inventory from the east it was time to take a stand  but how  how many others would stand with him and fight  if it was a fight they wanted he frank hurtte was ready for them  he’d already spread the news  there was going to be a showdown tonight at the value corral and even the law was planning on being out of town  the distributors of crossroads city were going to show the buyers from the east exactly what value they were made of  they had value … and they’d prove it        measuring and selling value  a shoot out at the value corral by frank hurtte  malcolm mills malcolm mills and frank hurtte are at it again – this time it’s all about measuring value  are you listening  north america is losing out  companies in the asian rim the indian subcontinent and other diverse locations are joining together in tight clusters of partnership and winning customers and markets  toyota famous for seamlessly moving value from vendor partners to their own production lines continues to throw a wide loop over all competition and based on a number of comments from readers many companies in north america just haven’t figured out how to imitate this successfully yet  we may have invented the rodeo but measuring the value between vender and customer salesperson and procurement still falls in the “needs work” category  for instance here’s a situation frank i just had a conversation with a midwestern purchasing manager who told me it was his formal objective to reduce his product cost by  during   he went on to state “every single bonus and perk in my department will be based on my staff’s ability to meet this goal”  i asked if this was an objective he felt was reasonable and fair  he said “yeah i believe my people will have their hands full because we will need to swap out some well established long time suppliers”  when pressed about value services and quality of product it became clear that was talking price cuts – not cost reduction  malcolm do you purchasing people ever think of anything besides price malcolm frank “product cost” can mean different things to different people  but traditionally purchasing folk think in terms of “price” because that’s what they’ve all been taught and have used as a measurement for value for eons  the boy’s upstairs typically look at the bottom line and so must the buyer or pa  either that or be replaced  only fairly recently have the gutsy and intuitive among purchasing managers and buyers begun to break out “value” as a part of the item price  unfortunately for the most part no one else in the company really gives a damn or cares to measure what buyers instinctively know  sorry that’s life  but what are you calling “value” anyway  if it’s not tangible and reportable frank you’re wasting your precious breath  if it can’t be measured and broken out of the price it’s all just smoke to buyers at the moment purchasing eyes see “price” as including the value you promote  whatever the po states be it shipping certification or documentation test reports msds’ warrantees packaging shelf life certification mtr’s labeling etc these are al expected to be part of the quoted price  it’s not an extra unless these “value” items are stated as separate po line items  you can’t put a line item for “quality of product” or “talking on the phone time”  you may or may not charge for certs and mtr’s frank but don’t some of these get sacrificed to the “god of price” the first time anybody says corporate reengineering  the big  automakers perfected the old “i like you  we are partners  and let’s work closer together  just as soon as you give me a  across the board price chop” back in the ’s  i pushed back with offers to increase service outsource work they did with expensive union maintenance workers and a lot of other great ideas  we didn’t measure it in dollars and cents back then but we were pretty specific  just how well does it need to be spelled out for you to take it for real numbers malcolm generally speaking purchasing managers want to show via an accurate report where last year they spent x number of dollars purchasing “widgets” from abc supplier  this year they are only spending x minus  dollars for the same amount of product  quality doesn’t show up on the report frank  neither does technical information or expertise  to purchasing people bean counters and ownersstock holders the total price on the report includes all of the “value added” features you talk about frank when you and i were young when we reached an agreement we’d look each other in the eye shake hands and we’d have a solid deal which wouldn’t be broken for love nor money  we went the extra mile for our friends and business partners providing dedicated service and reliable performance  well we don’t live in that world anymore frank  we’re very much “international” now  our corporations are often owned and directed by hard nosed and tight fisted business people from across the pond  even north american companies cannot operate on trust or personal relationships today  instead we operate via spreadsheets and way too much backroom politics  again that’s just reality  today we can’t just “throw that in” because somewhere it has a cost  with the price of fuel and everything else that “extra mile” costs you  you just can’t absorb or provide for free what you have a cost to obtain  it’s not reasonable  you guys have to learn that and that is the mess your team is in  unfortunately your international competitors have already learned to quote the item alone in many cases without that added value which drives north american prices up frank an area that often is talked about is “soft” savings – those which affect the use of internal people  i believe that freeing people up from one task to be used in another task is indeed a value to most organizations with over  employees  the companies who recommend and provide automation equipment are really in the business of selling “soft” savings  aren’t they malcolm frank you were talking earlier about turning “soft” savings into “hard” savings when you made recommendations to your customer to outsource some of their internal work to lower costs  today “hard savings” are the rule  it’s up to you to turn the soft savings you offer into “hard” savings buyers can recognize and quantify  promoting automation is only a part of that  promoting “quality” “technical expertise” and other things suppliers consider to be “added value” must also become measurable and hard  but to most buyers and purchasing managers this added “value” is no more than your own “costs of doing business” and they don’t believe you can’t do better because the competition tells them that they can do better … and they often do  the fact that your product is north american made better quality and good for the local economy doesn’t make it under the “hard savings” ledger column  frank salespeople are only now beginning to think about measuring their service using that five thousand year old standard for doing so – money  increasingly my clients are asking questions about how to transform their actions into cold hard cash for customers but this is a very new concept for the sales community malcolm frank buyers and other purchasing types listen to sales pitches from competing suppliers all day long  the stories are similar but their interpretations and cost of “value” are sometimes quite different  and when the interpretation of “added value” is different often so is the price  i’ve seen brand new iso  factories in china smack in the middle of rice fields producing acceptable quality goods for the hungry american market  what kind of value do you suppose they are offering frank  there’s one thing that will change the way things are being done today and that is to actually prove in black and white to every customer the significance of soft savings as related to price  what it will probably take is for every manufacturer or distributor to do their homework and price the product they are in jeopardy of losing without freight in without technical advice without documentation without packaging without qa extras and whatever else makes up the cost and then offer that to the buyer as an option  if you sincerely want to change the way customersbuyers view price quotes in america that’s pretty much what it will take  frank malcolm typical purchasing mentality is as archaic and as one sided as it’s always been but at least we agree on one thing identification and documentation are the key  further these values need to be clearly visible and understood by the customer  it’s time you and i took this bull by the horns… to make this real i want to suggest a minicase study i am a sales professional calling on your company  i know the engineering department is concerned about the high cost of energy  gasoline has pushed past the two dollar point and has on occasion surpassed the three dollar point  the cost to operate the vehicles used by your company has grown dramatically and everyone is concerned after hearing about your troubles i bring in a new technology flying carpet to replace your vehicles  i know the average vehicle cost your organization  to maintain and  for gasoline during  the magic carpet runs on genie dust which will cost you  dollars per year additionally magic carpets require only  a year to maintain rug shampoo  all other costs of operation are the same and finally the magic carpet costs about  more than the vehicles you are currently buying  the expected life is  years for both the vehicle and the magic carpet financial analysis model  magic carpet   traditional vehicle   fuel costs    fuel costs    maintenance cost    maintenance cost    annual cost    annual cost         purchase price    purchase price         total cost of ownership over  year life tco     operation cost  annual cost x years of life     magic carpet    traditional vehicle    purchase price    purchase price   tco  tco  malcolm based on a compelling story like this it would seem that every purchasing guy on the planet would say “wow this company brought us some value  their suggestion just put  grand and some change in our pocket  we’ve got to get them more involved with our company”  instead the message often delivered is “thanks for the suggestion now as long as nobody beats your price on magic carpets by a dime i’ll let you keep the business”  give me your thoughts… malcolm looks like you plugged me frank  you’re a straight shooter and i took one for the old purchasing association  in today’s world you’re probably right  depending on the industry they may not even have the will or inclination to listen  and worse yet there’s many the purchasing guru who would listen but has neither the time training nor procedure to record the savings  you see maintenance and overhead are coded differently from “purchase price”  sorry frank  you winged me but there was a ricochet and procedures don’t account for ricochets frank  but frank because i am a progressive purchasing manager i actually do see the value in what you’re proposing and i’ll go to the matt for you  you see i’m a customer who listens  we aren’t really extinct you know  in summary what you’re saying is possible but it will take work on both sides by the way can i get that magic carpet in blue with white pinstripes and aluminum tassels  give me the sporty model with the leather interior dvd player and cup holders okay  i presume they all come with air  can you throw in a genie named barbara oh and i need it by next week frank fob our plant a full tank of magic dust a  year tassel to tassel warrantee and …     the end        your browser does not support inline frames
