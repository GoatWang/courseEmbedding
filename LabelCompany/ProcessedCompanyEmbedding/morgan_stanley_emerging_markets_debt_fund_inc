rate movements   wal is the weighted average life of the portfolio the wal calculation utilizes a securitys stated final maturity date or when relevant the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest such as a put feature accordingly wal reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit widening spreads or tightening liquidity
