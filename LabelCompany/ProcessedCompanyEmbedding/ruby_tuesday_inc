florence south carolina  note i contacted ruby tuesdays corporate headquarters regarding this experience i had at the so carolina ruby tuesdays i even sent them a video showing the horrible food we were served i was not looking for any kind of freebies nor even my money back  just asking that someone do something about the place over a month and i have heard nothing so  here i go my wife and i stopped at the florence sc ruby tuesdays off i on american drive my wife ordered soup when it came she took one sip and said it tasted like chemicals we sent it right back i then realized that we would not enjoy our dinner there so i asked the waiter to wrap mine to go i ordered a strip steak when i got the steak it looked as if someone put it on a grill and sat on it it was cooked all the way through i ordered medium rare and it was tough as shoe leather we took a video of the food the baked potato had butter on it but it would not melt because the potato was cold since i have had family in the restaurant business including my daughter i realized talking to the manager would be a waste of time once in the car we took a video and i sent it to the corporate headquarters asking them to do something about the restaurant i explained that if i did not hear from them i was going to post the video online i have not heard anything so this week i am going to post it do not eat at this location helpfulyesno replies review link advertisement best service ive had by andrea   rating  georgetown kentucky  im from the lima oh area and only went to the ruby tuesdays on occasion because their staff usually wasnt friendly or the salad bar was borderline rancid however we are in the process of moving from ohio to georgia and decided to try the ruby tuesdays in georgetown kentucky the food including the salad bar was amazing but didnt touch the servers hospitality he made the whole experience enjoyable we didnt have to ask for anything unlike in lima and was willing to answer any questions we had and had no problem finding out answers he was unsure of of course i raved about him to the manager who was just as enjoyable as his serving team who all greeted us with an actual smile im a difficult person to impress when it comes to dining services due to almost  years working in the food industry and being a business major however i am completely blown away by their food service and hospitality helpfulyesno replies review link rancid burgers by v   montgomery alabama  i was shocked by what was the worst experience i have ever had anywhere let alone ruby tuesdays at eastchase loop montgomery alabama i have eaten at your restaurants for years in various cities i have lived i had come to rely on the consistency of the food and service quality that made anywhere i am feel like home today the order was not taken correctly took long despite that it was not crowded i had to ask for refill on my drink despite the server seeing it was empty for about  minutes but the worst part is that after all this i was served meat that was rancid i threw up before i left and have been sick ever since i got home threw up again and slept all day i am so upset i cannot even express my anger and disappointment my sister was with me and when i told her my burger was not good she smelled hers and backed away i was very hungry when i arrived and by the time the food got to us i tried to eat it but less than halfway through i realized it was not me  the meat really was bad my sister ordered the minis and had not gotten to the meat part because its mostly bread on those but when she smelled mine she lifted the bun on hers took one sniff and put it down it was disgusting the texture was spongy as if frozen and then improperly defrosted it was not pink but i think that was not due to being cooked it felt like the color was due to it being not fresh the question it raises for me is about food handling at your restaurants is your meat frozen until ready to be cooked is it handled safely clearly the answer has to be no judging from our experience and both of us having the same problem this was at approx noon it is now almost  pm and its just now that i feel well enough to even write to you the server and asst mgr offered me another dish as if i could even think of eating another bite in your restaurant she said i dont want you to leave hungry trust me leaving hungry was not possible i have not been able to eat since that i was even too sick to go to primed which i considered because i thought i was food poisoned just writing to you is like reliving that horrible ordeal and sickens me to recall the odor and taste of the burger we were not charged for our meals  thank you for not charging us for food poisoning but i swear by all i hold dear that i will never eat at any ruby tuesdays again and will warn my friends and family about what happened to us today and the indications that the food handling at rubys needs to be looked into a former ruby tuesdays customer helpfulyesno replies review link georgetown ky needs to train their cooks by pendleton   georgetown kentucky  i eat at ruby tuesday in lexington louisville and georgetown often when i am on the road for workrelated travel i have always received service that is at least acceptable but my last two visits to the georgetown ky store have guaranteed that i will never return to this location i would not suggest this store to anyone that i know when i arrived at the door i was greeted by a manager who suggested the bar area because of your new happy hour so i was seated at the bar didnt like the happy hour choices so i instead ordered a ribeye the food was brought to my table by the same manager who greeted me at the door i think he said his name was  when he sat my plate down i could tell that the meat was overcooked so i immediately asked him if my steak was medium rare as i ordered he assured me that it was and informed me that the kitchen staff takes the temp of every steak before it is taken off the grill when i cut into the steak it was obvious that he did not know what he was talking about because this meat was way past medium well when i brought it to the attention of my server he immediately apologizes and takes the plate off my table within seconds  the manager comes to my table apologizes and tells me he will get me another one cooked fresh and made to order this time i watched him speak to the cooks i overheard him tell them that this was the th steak in the last  minutes that had to be recooked the cook a mexican man immediately started to argue with  and told him he had taken the temp of the meat and the steak was right the first time i watched  talk to him or at least two minutes before they finally listened to him and put another steak on the grill about  minutes later another steak arrives at my table delivered once again by  he was very nice offered me a discount on my meal for the trouble offered me a free desert i declined his offer and once again began to eat my steak i cut into it directly in the center and this time the steak was more well done than the first one keep in mind i ordered a medium rare steak that was medium well the first time and has now come to my table well done the second time i carry the plate to  and you can tell he is embarrassed by the mistake he immediately apologizes and tells me if i am willing to eat the overcooked steak he will take it off my ticket completely and that my meal will be free i agreed but i then saw  go back to the cooks and talk to them about the situation again the cooks were not willing to listen to him and started sticking a thermometer into steaks sitting in the window to show the manager that they were cooked correctly the cook touched three steaks in the window without gloves on while the manager seemed to be a hard worker and was very nice and willing to work with me on the problem it was obvious he had no control over the kitchen staff one cook had no hat or hair net on another cook that was sticking the thermometer into the meat in the window had no gloves on sitting at the bar i saw this cook touch several pieces of hamburger and a couple steaks without gloves on then touches cooked meat without gloves or washing his hands thats nasty i was pleased with everything about this location except for the cooks actions and attitudes if i had been  i would have fired the employee on the spot for the way he argued over the problem instead of trying to fix the problem everyone at the bar could see this take place and i hope they also recognized the unsanitary way the cooks handle food next time i am in the georgetown area i will eat at applebees up the road or will spend the extra time and money to travel to lexington instead of giving my business to a store that had rude cooks who do not care about my health i would suggest that anyone who read this do the same before these guys kill someone with their unsanitary conditions helpfulyesno replies review link advertisement ignorant and moronic management accompanied by terrible food by jubin   louisville kentucky  i am the general manager of the hampton inn  suites in very closeness to the restaurant location listed above  bluegrass pkwy louisville ky  for a couple years now the hotel has done business with the bluegrass pkwy franchise and the bluegrass pkwy franchise had offered delivery service down the street to local hotels in the area recently some new idiot of a manager named  had taken over i guess this is the first dealing i have had with him after several managers have failed there and i guess he had decided to cut off the delivery service which isnt a big deal but to not tell anybody is ridiculous especially when the staff says mixed things each time so as the hotel refers customers down to the area the manager out of all people is getting rude with my customers saying they do not deliver with a terrible attitude then i feel like we have a problem when i called down to question the status of the delivery method from now on  the idiot made no attempt at reconciliation but went on the defensive and after that nothing but ignorance came out of his mouth not only is he losing business for his company with the lack of personability but he is looking like a moron to these guests who will in turn not eat at another ruby tuesdays in their hometown wherever they may be from because of his terrible service and response and he has lost the referral business of our property when the delivery status changes some days they do some days they dont it gets confusing but yet again they do not post any times nor do they give any effort to try to help or notify any participating hotels so why should we recommend this restaurant because of their lack of organization and consistency the manager tries to displace his anger towards my guests is completely irresponsible and not manager worthy behavior i have officially told that manager  that as long as he is there there will be no referrals for his business as well as we will no longer carry any of the menus affiliated with that property until the manager  gets his act together or leaves i have notified my entire staff to not participate with the ruby tuesdays nor will we recommend or even bring the name ruby tuesdays up in conversation other than to bad mouth the restaurant due to poor management and conduct i have had issues with this property before with the accuracy of the deliveries now it is gotten to the point to where i have a bad taste in my mouth thinking about the restaurant because of the service for the manager to not try and fix the problem or try and resolve the issue in a better manner especially with one of the top occupancy hotels in the area is absurd and almost shows how well the ownership really cares for their repeat business which is not at all we referred that property for deliveries dinners meetings etc but not anymore again until this matter is resolved or i am contacted by somebody this franchise on  bluegrass pkwy will receive no support or recommendations from this hotel as well as others in the area who feel the same way about their service and attitudes helpfulyesno replies review link rubys served rotten food by ate rotten food at rubys   raleigh north carolina  first of all i want to get this out and may take this public as

it my stomach was hurting and i already felt nausea there were witnesses to the incident and the management was informed the waiter came and promptly removed the meal and stated we would not be charged for the meal the management did not come to the table to check on me and instead stated all they needed was information on the way out i promptly informed the manager that he was unprofessional and noted his lack of checking on the customer his name is  i went to the emergency room and was seen by a physician i was given some antibacteria medicine and prescriptions for pain medicine i was unable to get the prescription filled due to financial reasons i called ruby tuesdays for their assistance in my medical treatment and was told their potato did not get me sick they are crazy i would encourage the management staff at ruby tuesdays to order up a rotten potato and eat it and see how they feel afterwards ive had stomach pain all week as one antibacteria pill did not kill all the germs i called ruby tuesdays to ask some specifications on how the potato was cooked i was asked in a rude manner if this was a joke and they could not give me any information later they did tell me it was cooked at  degrees in oven and not wrapped in foil they went on to say that i would not get anything from this and they would not pay any medical bills im still working on this issue but i wanted to let people know just how ruby tuesdays handles their customers i know i will never dine there again im also considering painting a vehicle with slogan do not eat at ruby tuesdays they service rotten food they dont realize i am a consumer who will not stop until they admit their mistake the cook should have caught that the potato was rotten when they cut it anyone reading this if you know of a good attorney please let me know again dont take your business to ruby tuesdays also wanted to add there were witnesses to the incident   am helpfulyesno replies review link cant

was a customer that came into the ruby tuesday on blakenbaker pkwy in louisville ky and she seemed like a normal customer with the exception of overasking for little extras it was fine i even interacted with her grandson was very nice to him because well she was just rude and walked in with a chip on her shoulder from the getgo i even spoke to my manager before i even placed her order letting him know that i had a feeling she was going to try to get free food her actions were divalike and unacceptable even though i knew this i still gave her excellent service her and her grandson

a different total as she gave me the payment for her bill she stated to me dont expect a tip you need to read your bible you dont even know what that number means i was blown away i replied that is not acceptable and im getting my manager to take care of you i went and got my manager he came out quickly and tried to talk to her about her ticket but she was rude to him as well and kept cutting him off he kindly asked her to leave to which she did to my surprise i come on here and see that this woman left a false statement about what happened that day on here wow the only thing i have to say to this woman is grow up and dont expect a company to take care of your bill because you dont like the total lol using your religious beliefs to get out of paying is blasphemy you should be ashamed of
