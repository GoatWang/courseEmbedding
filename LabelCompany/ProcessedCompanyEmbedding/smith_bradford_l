microsoft’s top lawyer is the tech world’s envoy by nick wingfieldjuly   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story photo bradford smith microsoft’s general counsel worked as a lawyer in washington and has cultivated relationships there credit jordan stead for the new york times redmond wash — bradford l smith microsoft’s general counsel was in berlin meeting with government officials this spring when a case kept popping up unexpectedlyhow would the company respond the officials demanded to know to a judge’s ruling in new york that would give the american government access to a customer’s email sitting in an irish data center germans were already furious about revelations that americans spied on the country’s chancellor angela merkel and unless the ruling was reversed one official told mr smith the german government would never rely on an american company like microsoft to store its data in the cloudafter his conversations about the case in germany microsoft subsequently challenged the judge’s ruling in court the first time an american company is believed to have fought back against a domestic warrant for data held overseas a hearing on the case is planned for july such are the decisions regularly faced by mr smith  who has become the elder statesman of microsoft and a de facto ambassador for the technology industry at large as microsoft’s chief representative on public policy matters including privacy — an issue under close scrutiny around the world — mr smith plays a significant role in many of the most critical decisions affecting the company’s fortunes advertisement continue reading the main story mr smith said he told the german official about the case “we’ve taken this on with a complete commitment to persevere and to do everything we can appropriately to win” continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story the promise to the german officials carried weight mr smith is one of the most influential voices inside microsoft partly because he has been in his job since  which makes him the longest serving member of the senior leadership teamhis influence has only increased in recent years while microsoft has churned through top executives and made other major changes all in an effort to keep pace with competitors in the marketplace last week in another major change microsoft said it planned to eliminate up to  jobs or about  percent of its total work force over the next  months in an effort to thin out layers of bureaucracy at the company and move more quicklybut mr smith’s weight extends to the wider tech industry as well partly because of his understanding of washington mr smith worked for years as a lawyer there before moving to microsoft’s headquarters here outside seattle while much of the tech industry looks upon government with a strong sense of skepticism if not disdain he has cultivated relationships there for years“he brings a much more washington sensibility to the west coast than many of his peers” said annemarie slaughter a former state department official who now runs the new america foundation and attended princeton university with mr smith “he recognizes the necessity of government engagement government is not just an entity for favors it has to be part of the solution”mr smith’s political skills have led to some speculation that he will pursue elected office for now though he is putting those skills to use for microsoft and the technology industry particularly after the disclosures by edward j snowden of government efforts to collect private data from online services operated by microsoft google and others without search warrants and subpoenas the leaks shook executives throughout the industry many of whom worry about damage to the appeal of their productslast year mr smith equated government snooping with other serious threats like malware and cyberattacks and he also led an industry push for changes in how the government collects data“people won’t use technology they don’t trust and we need to take the kinds of steps to sustain that trust” he said in an interview last week advertisement continue reading the main story an earlier policy issue facing microsoft suggests how mr smith likes to handle problems with pragmatism when he interviewed for the general counsel job in  with bill gates and other senior leaders of the company microsoft was facing a litany of penalties in its antitrust battle with the justice department narrowly avoiding a governmentordered breakup of the

from private companies loomed during his interview mr smith showed the executives a single slide declaring that microsoft needed to make peace with its foesat the time microsoft was widely seen as a bully people who know mr smith said that changing the company’s legal stance in the antitrust case as well as later legal stances the company has taken helped soften the company’s public image microsoft’s repeated stumbles with important products have also made the company seem less fearsomeafter the snowden disclosures mr smith pursued an industrywide effort to limit the damage in july of last year mr smith picked up the phone and called his counterpart at google kent walker to explore whether the companies could gain strength by working together on a settlement with the government on data collectionthe overture was remarkable considering microsoft and google are ferocious business competitors and microsoft has denounced google’s privacy practices through its “scroogled” advertising campaign but the two companies put aside their hostilities and in january they and other technology companies reached a deal with the obama administration leslie miller a spokeswoman for google declined to comment“kent and i talk frequently” mr smith said “sometimes we’re on the same side sometimes we’re on opposite sides”and in the fall of  mr smith and erika rottenberg the general counsel of linkedin the social media company organized a meeting of general counsels from a half dozen or so major technology companies to talk about further unifying their efforts to press for government change the meeting in a private dining room of a restaurant in palo alto calif eventually led to the formation of the reform government surveillance coalition which counts google facebook twitter apple microsoft and linkedin as members“he’s good glue for those kinds of groups because of his policy skills and general intelligence” bruce sewell the general counsel of apple said of mr smithsome of microsoft’s positions have continued to upset privacy advocates putting mr smith in the cross hairs of their objections in march a legal filing in a criminal case against a former microsoft employee revealed that microsoft snooped on the email and instant messaging accounts of a french blogger the spying into the microsoftoperated services was part of an internal investigation into leaks by the former employee who received a threemonth prison sentence advertisement continue reading the main story marc rotenberg president of the electronic privacy information center a nonprofit advocacy group said his view of microsoft’s actions on privacy was “mostly favorable” while he criticized microsoft’s snooping he commended mr smith for quickly vowing to hand off similar cases to law enforcement officials in the futuremr smith has experienced disappointments in his job after a twoyear investigation into google the federal trade commission last year found that the company did not violate antitrust laws in the way it handles web search results as microsoft had argueded lazowska a professor of computer science at the university of washington said mr smith has also used his bully pulpit at microsoft to advocate investments in education and changes in immigration policy both important issues for microsoft and the technology industry“there are very few people for whom i have as much admiration” mr lazowska wrote in email “imagine me saying this about a lawyer” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you

first indepth look at a smallboat maritime rescue by the us coast guard this book is also the first to describe the role of those at smallboat rescue stations and of the policy setters at coast guard

its current problems have developed and what effect they have on the services operations as the story unfolds the views of senior enlisted personnel at the station paint a picture of an overworked smallboat rescue force and their feelings toward what they perceive as a distant and in many cases unaware officer corps noble contrasts these perspectives with those voiced by the investigating

preferred light duty commercial electric model  dels view more product data × not enough room weve recently added extra insulation to many of our water heaters to meet the new federal efficiency regulations we have only added an inch or two to most models but the new larger size may pose a problem when choosing a replacement if your water heater is installed in a tight space if the new model just wont fit into your available space you may consider installing a smaller capacity model depending on how much hot water you actually use you might not even notice the loss in capacity if you notice the reduction in hot water capacity or anticipate that it will be noticeable you can increase the tank temperature from the factory setting of ° degrees to offset the loss in capacity in most installations scalding risk higher temperatures increase the risk of scalding even at °f hot water can scald if you choose a higher temperature setting or to reduce the risk of scaling at any setting
