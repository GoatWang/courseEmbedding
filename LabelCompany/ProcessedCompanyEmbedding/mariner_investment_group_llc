member i couldn’t have asked for better lawyers or a better law firm  deepwater horizon crew member practice areas  helpful information maritime  offshore information we at arnold  itkin have seen the level of devastation that offshore accidents can cause from the explosion of oil rigs to maritime employers who place workers in dangerous conditions we have seen and handled it all offshore injuries learn more in  the cdc released a study looking into the frequency of fatal offshore injuries  at the conclusion they noted that someone who is working in the offshore oil  gas industry is  times more likely to die than any other worker as officially the most dangerous industry in the country it is no surprise that maritime workers find themselves suffering from devastating and even lifealtering injuries all too often you as an injured worker have rights and ways to seek just compensation we can help you take the necessary steps to fight for the compensation you need offshore injuriesoffshore fatalitiescase evaluation seaman injury learn more if you qualify as a seaman there are specific laws that deal with how you can recover compensation for example maritime law permits injured seaman to recover compensation to cover lost wages living expenses and medical care in some cases the seaman can file a case for further compensation so how does the court determine who is and who is not a seaman first the individual must be working on a vessel second they must contribute to that vessels function andor the accomplishment of its mission third they must be connected to the vessel seaman injuryseamen rightscase evaluation jones act learn more in june of  the us congress adopted the merchant marine act the passing of this act commonly referred to as the jones act helped provide formalized protection for seamen the most wellknown sections deal with the protection for injured seamen for example seamen can take legal action for unseaworthiness under the jones act a seaman can file a claim for damages this law has gone a long way in helping give seamen paths to recovery in the wake of a serious accident it however is not simple it is important to have a knowledgeable attorney who can help you navigate it jones actunseaworthinessjones act rights harbor workers learn more harbor workers are not seamen however they are still heavily involved in the maritime industry these workers can be involved in many different maritime functions including construction conversion or dry docking still because they do not meet seaman requirements they do not benefit from the same laws instead harbor workers receive protection from the lhwca the lhwca operates similarly to workers compensation for example it does not matter who was at fault for the accident—compensation can be recovered either way under the lhwca a harbor worker can recover just compensation if they were working in a ship or boat yard located on navigable waters harbor workersshorebased injuriescase evaluation types of accidents learn more any accident that occurs to someone who is aboard a vessel in open waters is referred to as an offshore accident this however is where similarities end as the types of accidents that can occur are deeply varied accidents may be tied into the type of vessel the worker is aboard or related to the type of work they do no matter how you were injured you deserve to have a compassionate lawyer at arnold  itkin we have years of experience and have successfully recovered billions of dollars on behalf of our clients to learn more about how we can help please give

evaluation maritime law learn more laws that govern offshore activities are commonly referred to as maritime or admiralty law there are many different branches of this law that look specifically into different functions situations and more general maritime law was created to provide adequate protection for seamen under this law injured seaman benefit from maintenance and cure this is a doctrine that permits injured seamen to recover compensation to cover living expenses lost wages and medical care the maritime employer is also required to cure a seaman by providing room and board and medical care other laws and acts include the jones act the lhwca and the dohsa—all of which can be used to help injured workers maritime lawdeath on the high seasdo you need a lawyer longshoreman rights learn more not all maritime workers work in open water in fact a common maritime job involves longshoremen—individuals who are employed in the port and are largely responsible for the loading and unloading of cargo as they are not considered traditional seamen there are laws that deal specifically with these individuals the most wellknown is the longshore and harbor workers compensation act the lhwca provides protection from employmentinjury and occupationaldisease and is similar to workers compensation laws as it does not matter who was at fault for the accident regardless longshoremen and their families can recover financial compensation to cover everything from medical payments to rehab longshoreman rightsharbor workersfree case evaluation types of injuries learn more no two accidents are the same neither are the injuries in some cases a maritime accident could lead to something minor like a contusion shallow laceration or a bump this however is not always the case all too often the

an injured worker have rights and ways to seek just compensation we can help you take the necessary steps to fight for the compensation you need offshore injuriesoffshore fatalitiescase evaluation seaman injury learn more if you qualify as a seaman there are specific laws that deal with how you can recover compensation for example maritime law permits injured seaman to recover compensation to cover lost wages living expenses and medical care in some cases the seaman can file a case for further compensation so how does the court determine who is and who is not a seaman first the individual must be working on a vessel second they must contribute to that vessels function andor the accomplishment of its mission third they must be connected to the vessel seaman injuryseamen rightscase evaluation jones act learn more in june of  the us congress adopted the merchant marine act the passing of this act commonly referred to as the jones act helped provide formalized protection for seamen the most wellknown sections deal with the protection for injured seamen for example seamen can take legal action for unseaworthiness under the jones act a seaman can file a claim for damages this law has gone a long way in helping give seamen paths to recovery in the wake of a serious accident it however is not simple it is important to have a knowledgeable attorney who can help you navigate it jones actunseaworthinessjones act rights harbor workers learn more harbor workers are not seamen however they are still heavily involved in the maritime industry these workers can be involved in many different maritime functions including construction conversion or dry docking still because they do not meet seaman requirements they do not benefit from the same laws instead harbor workers receive protection from the lhwca the lhwca operates similarly to workers compensation for example it does not matter who was at fault for the accident—compensation can be recovered either way under the lhwca a harbor worker can recover just compensation if they were working in a ship or boat yard located on navigable waters harbor workersshorebased injuriescase evaluation types of accidents learn more any accident that occurs to someone who is aboard a vessel in open waters is referred to as an offshore accident this however is where similarities end as the types of accidents
