performance of a benchmark index this strategy generally requires less frequent turnover of holdings within the fund so fund fees tend to be lower  the tax cost of the average active mutual fund when you sell your mutual fund or etf at a gain you will have to pay taxes on that gain but capital gains taxes can be incurred even if you don’t sell your shares due to trading activity within your fund active mutual funds that frequently buy and sell securities are often subject to higher capital gains distributions because most etfs track an index they tend to generate fewer undesirable capital gains distributions only  of active managers beat their benchmarks after fees over the last five years because of the more frequent trading and complex strategies in activelymanaged funds fund
