be described with the term controversial he is the man who mysteriously and perhaps suspiciously rose to the rank of general in the failed revolt against the romans an elevation in rank that was just as quickly followed by his surrender to them under the most unusual circumstances the numerous rewards he received from the romans did not gain him any adoration from his fellow jews and yet this enigmatic man is also one of the most passionate defenders of the jews against antisemitism he is praised as a careful writer of history though contradictions regularly appear between his accounts of the jewish war and his jewish antiquities but in spite of all of the unusual circumstances of his life and writings flavius josephus is perhaps our best source for history in the first century and his paraphrase of the old testament represents an important and essential resource for old testament textual criticism being one thousand years earlier than our most complete manuscripts of the hebrew bible and on top of that his discussions of jewish religious practice and culture in the first century provide essential information available nowhere else for all these reasons these studies provide an essential look at how josephus writings interface with judaism christianity and scripture with astute and valuable research that takes a close look at josephus relationship to the old testament text septuagint jewish culture the new testament and even the church fathers the brill josephus and the bible collection is an essential tool for both students and scholars that becomes even more

           studies in josephus rewritten bible consists of  studies of various portions of josephus jewish antiquities by louis h feldman the volume is an attempt to examine the oldest systematic commentary on the historical books of the bible that has come down to us it considers how josephus resolves apparent contradictions obscurities and other theological questions as well as the historicity of biblical events which have puzzled classical commentators on the bible the volume attempts to explain cases notably ahab hezekiah jehoiachin and zedekiah where josephus seems to change the biblical text radically included are josephus interpretations of several prophets women and nonjewish leaders all of these studies have previously appeared in print over a period of almost three decades in thirtythree different publications however they have been edited corrected and updated in many ways at least one article has been translated into english from another language for the first

historical figure sits at the intersection of history before him christianity begins second temple judaism evolves into rabbinic judaism with the destruction of the temple and east meets west as the romans crush the jewish revolts of 0s and 0s ad it is among these intersections that josephus wrote with josephus unique position in mind louis h feldman and gohei hata have gathered together a group

testament and ancient judaism passover in the work of josephus author federico m colautti publisher brill academic publication date  pages 0 sample pages              this superb volume examines flavius josephus presentation of the feast of passover in his works the first part is an analysis of the texts in which flavius josephus mentions this feast in his paraphrase of the bible in the second part the references to passover in the rest of his works are considered the third part is an attempt to contextualize the results of the first two parts in his contemporaneous literature and historical events flavius josephus is normally referred to in a fragmentary way often with somewhat scattered references to his statements of specific subjects and their relation to the new testament this study goes beyond that normal approach and seeks to present a complete survey of his writing on this important jewish feast both new testament and early judaism scholars will benefit by acquiring a more comprehensive insight of this subject and its context passover in the work of josephus takes a close look at how the passover is presented in josephus and then compares it not only the biblical text but also the celebration of the festival in the second temple period this makes federico moisés colauttis research into the passover an essential resource for students and scholars of old testament studies second temple judaism and josephus the manner in which colautti deals with the passover in josephus and the old testament as well as in the second temple period and beyond illuminates the potential strengths for working across disciplines be they josephus old testament or judaic studies federico m colautti has produced a very thorough monograph on the celebration of passover as recorded in scriptures both mt and lxx and the written accounts of josephus    his conclusions are well balanced and convincingly argued — a turton journal for the study of the old testament  federico moisés colautti phd in biblical theology is professor at our lady of the new advent in denver the brill company home furniture seating tables finishes at the brill company we value
