the call    proved to be a transformative year for t  operationally strategically and financially we made significant progress against our priorities throughout the year  growing our customer base expanding our partnership pipeline and highlighting the power of our technology through customer success stories and realworld data we are well on our way towards demonstrating the power of the t technology to improve patient health and deliver strong economic returns to healthcare institutions   we exited the year with strong momentum  led by a solid performance in the fourth quarter  and we expect that momentum to continue in  which i will cover further in a bit but first let me walk you through some of the operational and strategic highlights from the quarter and the year     in the fourth quarter we secured commitments that will provide us access to an estimated  additional patients annually considered to be at high risk for sepsis infections this number represents  new hospitals in the us and europe  four contracts representing  hospitals in the us and four in europe this result also represents  of our target of  new highrisk patients by september   as a result of this strong performance today we are increasing that target to  highrisk patients over the same period   our performance in europe in  exceeded our expectations our goal was to enter four european markets and by the end of the year we expanded our european presence to eight countries via contracts with international distributors europe will continue to be a key focus in  as we add more hospitals to our customer base and as those hospitals rollout and commence testing of patients   at the end of  the worldwide installed base of hospitals with access to the tdx® instrument grew to  hospitals representing an estimated  symptomatic patients annually who are considered to be at high risk of sepsis infections  an approximate  percent yearoveryear increase in highrisk patients   importantly during the fourth quarter we continued to make strong progress with the tbacteria program and we remain ontrack for completing the clinical trial and filing for market clearance with the fda by mid   we recently completed a detailed market research survey conducted by an independent market research firm that assessed the overall market needs in sepsis diagnostics the research included interviews and surveys of leaders in hospitals labs infectious disease and hospital administration and in part focused on their views of tcandida and our product candidate tbacteria   we thought it would be helpful to share with you a few highlights from the research                  lab directors will be over times more likely to recommend adopting the t technology with both tcandida and tbacteria  validating our belief that tbacteria will be a gamechanger for our business                  two thirds of the critical clinical decisions are made in the first  hours of when patients are initially tested  demonstrating the critical need for faster and more accurate tests as blood culture results extend beyond the hour period the ideal time to result is  hours and the most important test result is species identification not susceptibility results to our knowledge only the t platform can deliver results in the ideal timeframe of  hours or less and for that matter within the first hour timeframe                    infectious disease doctors are strong supporters of the t platform with tcandida on a standalone basis and are even more positive when you add tbacteria                  economic customer success stories are important in driving market adoption   the survey results are consistent with our own experiences in the market and further demonstrate the need for and power of our platform and products   switching to other product pipeline development we are also making good progress with tlyme and remain ontrack to complete preclinical studies in  which will lead to an fda clinical trial in    we recently received issuance of a key patent related to tmr in the field of hemostasis this patent covers the tmr measurement of multiple factors directly in blood these new claims in combination with issued claims from other issued patents demonstrate our innovations and protect the multiple tmr hemostasis measurements associated with assessing the risk of patients bleeding or clotting   in  we strengthened our balance sheet and formed important strategic alliances that position us for longterm sustainable growth   ·                   in july we announced a multiyear agreement will bayer to provide our tmr for bayers research and development efforts and blood coagulation disorders   ·                   in september we announced a  million equity investment by canon usa that will fund the companys continued growth through the launch of the tbacteria panel   ·                   in november we announced a collaboration with allergan to develop a novel diagnostic panel to detect gramnegative bacterial species and antibiotic resistance for patients with serious bacterial infections including infections that lead to sepsis   ·                   and in december we secured a new  million debt facility with crg with an initial draw of  million that delays the payment of principal payments for at least  years further improving our capital position   we enter  with the financial resources and important partnerships that not only drive new opportunities but also represent important thirdparty endorsements of our technology and ts strategic direction during the quarter we continued to expand our partnership pipeline and while we will remain selective in our approach we are hopeful to expand our partnerships in    additionally and perhaps most importantly during the year the value of our products were demonstrated at customer sites throughout the us and europe four of our     customers presented or published data at industry conferences from their use of tcandida that highlight the patient and economic impact of testing patients   the most notable one came from the henry ford health system in detroit which presented a statistically significant study reporting approximately  million in savings through the implementation of the tcandida technology these savings were realized by significant reductions in icu and hospital length of stay for patients along with a reduction in the use of antifungal drugs   other customers included riverside hospital in california huntsville hospital in alabama and the lee memorial health systems in florida  all of whom demonstrated outstanding economic returns for their respective hospitals   on that note i would now like to turn the call over briefly to tom lowery chief scientific officer to provide some further color on successes that customers have had as a result of our technology tom   tom lowery   thanks john   we continue to see case studies where tcandida is detecting tissue based infections also known as deepseated candidiasis where blood culture is missing these infections   just to remind you in our original pivotal study we had one case that was positive with tcandida but negative for over  blood cultures in this patient  days after the tcandida positive result an intraabdominal abscess was discovered that was subsequently sampled by surgically obtained tissue culture and confirmed to be the same candida species that was detected days earlier by tcandida we now know this was the first of many such cases   to date there have been dozens of clinical cases that we are aware of where blood culture was negative tcandida was positive and confirmed via other microbiological methods   in europe for example a hospital reported that tcandida identified four patients that were blood culture negative but had confirmed lung infections from the same species of candida using culture from a bronchial lavage another example is from a large us hospital where multiple cancer patients suffered from invasive intraabdominal candida infections that were missed by blood culture but identified by tcandida and confirmed by imaging and followon microbiology testing     additionally customers have shared several other patient case studies where blood culture was negative but nonblood culture specimens such as wound swabs and respiratory samples were positive and matched the tcandida results the inability of blood culture to detect deepseated tissue infections and the challenges associated with obtaining high quality tissue samples swabs and lung washes for culture are well understood by microbiology directors   its been exciting to hear the enthusiasm from customers that experience cases like these we expect more cases of deep seated candidiasis will be detected by tcandida further demonstrating the ability of the test to help physicians and labs to appropriately manage patients with invasive candidiasis who with blood culture alone are being missed   john mcdonough   thanks tom as you can see our products truly are transformational and these success stories are and will continue to be an important driver going forward in securing our next phase of growth there have been a lot of developments in the field of sepsis diagnostics but to our knowledge all products in the market or coming into the market that detect species or susceptibility require a positive blood culture first we know the problem of a blood culture taking one to five days to go positive but the biggest problem may be the  to  of patients that are positive with infections but declared negative by blood culture tcandida today and we believe tbacteria soon may detect patients days faster but may also detect patients that are missed by blood culture providing this information to clinicians can be critical in the survival and recovery of patients and the hospital costs associated with these infections   with that let me turn the call over to shawn to take you through the quarterly and fullyear financial results and our  outlook shawn   shawn lynch   thanks john   total revenue for the fourth quarter was  which consisted of  of product revenue compared to  of product revenue in the fourth quarter of  results were driven by an increase in tcandida panel sales due to increased patient testing across the installed base   total revenue for the fullyear was  million which consisted of  of product revenue compared to  of product revenue for the fullyear of   an     increase of approximately  product revenue for the fullyear was primarily derived from a combination of instrument and consumable sales   total operating expenses excluding costs of product revenue for the fourth quarter of  were  million compared to  million for the fourth quarter of    fullyear total operating expenses excluding costs of product revenue were  million compared to  million for  due to an expansion of commercial activities and continued investments in the product pipeline including tbacteria and tlyme   we continue to focus on cost control ahead of the tbacteria launch however our operating expenses will fluctuate quartertoquarter based on the level of clinical studies we are running   the net loss applicable to common shareholders for the fourth quarter was  million or a  loss per share compared to  million or a  loss per share for the fourth quarter of  as a result of an increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding   the net loss applicable to common shareholders for the fullyear of  was  million or a  loss per share compared to  million or a  loss per share due to an expansion of commercial activities and the continued investment in our product pipeline   we closed the year with a cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately  million this strong position will only be further buoyed by the debt refinancing we executed at the end of the quarter the agreement positively impacted our cash flow as we secured a minimum of three years of interestonly payments while extending the companys borrowing limit to  million with the potential option to draw an additional  million and extend the interestonly period further upon the tbacteria panel achieving fda clearance   as we move into  as john stated earlier we are now targeting an increase in the number of highrisk patients at customer facilities of  patients or an additional  to the number closed in q by the end of the third quarter of  ahead of the launch of tbacteria   additionally we are anticipating higher product revenue in the first quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of  from an increase in tcandida sales due to increased patient testing across the installed base     total operating expenses for the first quarter of  are expected to be between  million and  million of which approximately  million is noncash expenses which are primarily depreciation and stock compensation expenses we are also forecasting weighted average shares for the first quarter to be  million and  million for the fullyear   with that i would like to turn the call back over to john for some closing remarks   john mcdonough   thanks shawn   our priorities entering  are clear and unchanged and our square focus is on execution   priority one  continue to expand and gain access to patients at large hospitals and hospital systems in the us and europe who are at highrisk of sepsis infection we had previously stated a month goal through september  of adding  high risk patients and we are taking that number up to  high risk patients based on our strong performance in the fourth quarter   two  introduce new products to expand current suite of solutions we are running patient samples at clinical sites and expect to complete the clinical trial for tbacteria and file for market clearance with the fda by mid we also intend to communicate the results of our clinical study with you after completion for our other products in the pipeline we intend to complete preclinical studies for tlyme in  which will lead to an expected fda clinical trial in  while commencing preclinical studies for the gram negative resistance panel in    three  expand our partnership pipeline to help accelerate our growth profile in november we announced our partnership with allergan and we are working to grow our pipeline of other partnership opportunities   and finally  we expect to see more customer success stories that may continue to demonstrate the power of ts technology and the impact it is having at healthcare institutions this will be an important driver of the future success of t   as i have stated before and continue to believeat the core of t we are working to deliver diagnostic products that fundamentally change clinical decisions in a way that     saves the lives of the patients and delivers a strong economic return to the hospital system   our technology continues to help our customers be at the forefront of the paradigm shift occurring within hospitals with regards to how they approach patient care we remain committed to and are excited to see the impact of our products on the lives of patients and the economics of hospitals in  and beyond   with that id like to turn the call over to the operator for questions operator      qa      operator   thank you at this time we have no further questions i will turn the call back over to john mcdonough for closing comments   john mcdonough   thank you for joining us today the future of t is bright and our number one focus for  is on execution   if people have additional questions well certainly be around   thank you all for dialing in   operator   thank you this does conclude todays

millions of dollars each year tcandida is the only fdacleared sepsis pathogen detection panel requiring no blood culture delivering faster easier and more accurate results in  to  hours from a simple blood draw run on the fully automated tdx instrument the tcandida panel identifies the five clinically relevant species of candida directly from whole blood this enables physicians to initiate

year the fdacleared tcandida® panel is available in over  hospitals and our european presence now includes  countries  at t biosystems we focus on critical unmet needs in healthcare diagnostics choosing targets based on the prevalence and frequency of ineffective treatment due to shortcomings in current diagnostics this approach made sepsis one of the deadliest and the most expensive conditions in hospitals today a natural first choice  the tsepsis solution™ starts with thetcandida panel that runs on the tdx® instrument and can detect the five most clinically relevant species of

hospitals like henry ford health system in michigan and lee health system in florida both of which use t products are reporting that patients are getting on the right therapy—and off unnecessary

accurate with a proven sensitivity of over  while blood culture is only  in comparison  the specificity of t panels is over  so doctors can have confidence in a negative result  tmr technology is now detecting complex conditions that blood culture often misses such as fungal lung infections  in cases where doctors had no actionable information on which to base their decisions tmr technology is now enabling the lab and physicians to partner to provide more targeted treatment  the rapid and accurate t results are critical weapons in the hospital’s fight against antimicrobial resistance  t results reduce the overuse of antimicrobial therapies by getting doctors and hospitals specific pathogen identification information faster than ever before positive results enable targeted treatment and negative results may allow physicians to limit or eliminate the use of unnecessary drugs  this responsible stewardship combats drug resistance and superbugs helping ensure these crucial treatments are available for generations to come what’s next the tbacteria® panel we are building on our tmr technology to provide the tsepsis solution to hospitals our next panel tbacteria is undergoing clinical trials and will be submitted to the fda mid the tbacteria ruo panel is currently available for research use only ruo in the us in the eu performance evaluation studies are in progress and the

antimicrobial therapy within a hour window but the limitations of current diagnostic technology leaves about  of patients waiting too long for the right diagnosis and treatment help is on the way  with t tests for candida and key bacterial species hospitals will be able to treat  of patients appropriately within the first  hours of the critical care window  other ongoing development efforts in our pipeline include bacterial resistance panels and a hemostasis diagnostic as well as lyme disease panel through a partnership with canon usa why does it matter that t tests can be done from whole blood that is without blood culture t’s nobloodculturerequired approach to sepsis pathogen detection means hospitals get results in hours not days when research tells us the mortality rate for sepsis rises by  every hour waiting days for results is just not good enough and because t products do not require the growth of cells like blood culture tests over  of infections are detected—instead of the  to  detection rate for blood culture hospitals know that delivering the appropriate care for sepsis in less than  hours and ideally  hours is critical for their patients t has the only fdacleared and ce marked products that can do that   how does the technology behind the t test work t tests are powered by our proprietary tmr technology platform tmr combines proven magnetic resonance with innovative nanotechnology to accurately identify pathogens in whole blood faster and easier than bloodculturebased diagnostics  tmr works by measuring how water molecules react in the presence of magnetic fields utilizing the same magneticresonancebased approach found in mri but on a miniaturized scale  over  studies published in peerreviewed journals have featured tmr technology in a breadth of applications  with limits of detection as low as  cfuml we believe tmr technology will drive the next generation of in vitro diagnostics t biosystems’ use of tmr technology to help get patients on
