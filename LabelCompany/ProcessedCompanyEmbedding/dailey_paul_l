was using it in the shower i tried different amounts to see if i was putting too much or too little on and nothing seemed to help my hair would look wet and feel greasy until i washed it again which would then repeat the process it somehow made my hair feel much less clean than before i washed it every time i really tried this many times before finally giving up and returning it luckily that was a quick and easy process so i can have good hair care again only plus side was the conditioner did detangle and slightly reversed some of the super greasyheavy feeling left by the shampoohair typewavy

brown boston mass for appellee before aldrich chief judge mcentee circuit judge and caffrey district judge mcentee circuit judge  plaintiff paul l flanagan dba paul l flanagan and sons is a trucker and hauler of sand gravel stone and other similar materials in the spring of  defendant sylvania electric products inc engaged a general contractor to construct a parking lot for it at its plant in needham massachusetts there was a hill or ledge on this site which had to be removed at the beginning of the job although the general contractor was obliged to level off the hill he was not required under his contract to truck the ledge material away plaintiff alleges that on may   which is the date the parking lot job was commenced the defendant made an oral agreement with him whereby he agreed to supply the trucks and haul this ledge material away and the defendant agreed to pay him for this work at the rate of  per hour per truck plaintiff proceeded immediately with the hauling operation which extended over two periods may  to june   and june  to july   in the performance of this work he used his own trucks and trucks rented from others as was his practice on jobs of this size plaintiff claimed that the entire job took a total of   truck hours work for which he billed defendant at the rate of  an hour this amount plus an item of  for bulldozer hire which was not disputed came to  defendant refused to pay this bill whereupon plaintiff brought suit in the massachusetts superior court for breach of contract the case was removed to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts on the ground of diversity the jury found for the plaintiff in the full amount of his claim this is an appeal by the defendant from the judgment entered by the district court based on the jury verdict defendants principal ground of appeal is that the district court erred in admitting certain evidence in violation of the best evidence rule that this evidence should have been excluded and a verdict should have been directed for the defendant  plaintiff offered the following evidence in support of his claim all of which he alleged is based on daily truck hour slips on tally sheets made at the site of the job which recorded the number of trucks on the job and the number of hours worked by each truck  exhibit a in the declaration filed in this case which he says is a summary of the data contained in the invoices and the tally sheets  a number of photostatic copies of bills and invoices sent to plaintiff by other truckers for the rental of their trucks on this job  copies of two bills sent by plaintiff to defendant one in the amount of  for work done during the first period and the other reflecting the total amount of  due for both periods the contents of these two bills is identical with the claim set forth in schedule a of the plaintiffs declaration supra  plaintiff testified that the data contained in the above exhibits is the same as that contained in the tally sheets in the course of the trial when plaintiff was asked whether the information contained in these exhibits was the same as that contained in the tally sheets defendant objected on the ground that this was secondary evidence and thus was barred by the best evidence rule at this point the trial court inquired as to whether the plaintiff had those tally sheets to which he replied that he knew he had some at home but was not sure whether he had them all the court then suggested that he bring in those that he had later in the course of the trial this line of inquiry was resumed by plaintiffs counsel and again defendant objected the court allowed plaintiffs testimony that the information contained in the invoices checked out with that contained in the tally sheets the defendant adequately objected none of the tally sheets were ever produced at the trial  it is well settled that the best evidence that is obtainable in the circumstances of the case must be adduced to prove any disputed fact united states v alexander  fd  th cir  here the plaintiffs claim is based on performance of the work the best evidence of his performance is the truck hour records tally sheets those records were made for the very purpose of recording this performance instead of producing these records plaintiff offered the secondary evidence of their content enumerated above in proving the terms of a writing which terms are material to the issues in the case the original writing must be produced unless it is shown to be unavailable for some reason other than the serious fault of the proponent mccormick evidence   upon a proper showing of the unavailability of the original writing secondary evidence of its contents may be received however secondary evidence of the content of the original is not admissible unless the proponent of the testimony shows that a reasonable and diligent search has been made for the original without success see simpson  co v dall  wall   us    l ed   toho bussan kaisha ltd v american pres lines ltd  fd   d cir  see also fauci v mulready  mass    ned    from a careful examination of the evidence in this case we feel there is not sufficient proof that the original tally sheets in question were in fact unavailable or that a reasonable search had been made to find them although plaintiff stated that it was not his practice to keep these tally sheets after checking them with the truckers invoices he did testify on several occasions that he knew he had some of them at home and that he would bring into court what he had this he did not do it is also apparent from the evidence that plaintiff had tally sheets in his possession when he conferred with officials of the defendant in june  at which time he knew there was a dispute concerning the work and payment for it although plaintiff stated in open court that he would make a search for the tally sheets there is little if any evidence that he in fact made such a search and there is no evidence at all as to the extent of any such search there is no universal or fixed rule that determines the sufficiency of the proof required to show that a reasonable or diligent search has been made each case is governed in large measure by its own particular facts and circumstances he who seeks to introduce secondary evidence must show that he has used all reasonable means to obtain the original ie such search as the nature of the case would suggest simpson  co v dall supra  wall   us at  rash v peoples deposit bank  trust co  f supp   dcedky affirmed  fd   cir  the best evidence rule should not be applied as a mere technicality but where the missing original writings in dispute are the very foundation of the claim which is the situation in this case more strictness in proof is required than where the writings are only involved collaterally see a cjs evidence  and cases cited thereunder plaintiff failed to satisfy this requirement  moreover under the best evidence rule in order to permit

through the fault of the proponent of the testimony and that reasonable search had been made for it fauci v mulreadysupra  mass at   ned  the record in this case does not reveal that the trial court

error with respect to damages should require that the new trial be on damages only however in this case the whole case depended largely upon plaintiffs credibility the record was left in such condition that he was never called upon to explain the absence of his records his search if any therefor or why when he knew from the beginning that there was a dispute he had not preserved them if in fact he had not actually plaintiff has never denied that the records no longer exist in view of the fact that examination of the records might well corroborate the defendants account rather than plaintiffs as to other issues between the parties we believe that justice would be best served by ordering an entirely new trial  we find it unnecessary to decide any other questions raised in the case  the judgment of the district court will be vacated the verdict set aside and the case remanded for a new trial consistent with this opinion daily kos » · trump · donaldtrump · community ·

syndrome ods seen in the spew and spittle mouthed by the insecure and egomaniacal occupant of the white house is not simply a trumpian affliction we watched republicans dig in to subvert and block “the black guy” from the moment he took office joe wilson’s “you lie” hurled at president obama during a joint session of congress ditching decades of decorum was more than a dog whistle it was a signal to a significant number of americans that a black man in the “white” house would not be accepted that’s ironic given that this nation is now headed to hell in a hand basket led by the most lying liar in our history ods continued to play out during obama’s presidential years culminating in the blocking of merrick garland as a supreme court nominee no longer in office president obama is now trump’s excuse for whatever ills he and his crimeklan have brought upon themselves but frankly it has less to do with barack obama himself or his wife than it does with what i’d call “uppity negroitis had any other black person male or female been elected to the most powerful position in the world their fate would have been the same barack obama is simply the most visible global symbol of black achievement and from the point of view of those who hold onto white supremacist thinking all black achievement must be stifled smashed trashed and vilified don’t buy the “economic anxiety” argument you read about daily in newspapers and hear about from pundits and bloggers that just masks the deeprooted fear and loathing of all things black that don’t stay where they are supposed to be

one term that gets left out all too often when describing trump sure he’s a pompous jackass absolutely he’s a knownothing idiot who has not the first clue about history or science or the lives that are lived by people who weren’t born with a silver spoon in every orifice but there’s one term that sums donald trump up better than all the rest he’s a coward nine months after the election trump is

coddled and protected who never had to face the results of any decision without a whipping boy kept handy someone whose tiny finger always points anywhere but at himself this week sean spicer opted out of daily defending the indefensible so did mark corallo the spokesperson for trump’s legal team and while trump found at least one more person willing to stand between himself and acknowledging

of the antitrump resistance movement the womens march originated with the idea of one woman retired attorney teresa shook of hawaii who created a facebook page the day after the  election calling for

said something like let me just say something about the message management he didnt have reporters with him he didnt have a press pool he didnt do a press conference while he was on the ground either in afghanistan or iraq what youre seeing is not reporters brought in youre seeing selected pictures taken by the military questions by the military and what some would call fake interviews because theyre not interviews from a journalist interesting point andreas right when she says the military ought not to be in the business of journalism and we should be skeptical of what we are seeing im sure this emphasis on skepticism is exactly what she said when reporters were embedded during the war and when the statue of saddam came down the wide shot showing hardly anyone there but the closeup

article    theodore r daviss illustration of president johnsons impeachment trial in the senate in  as published in harpers weekly theodore r daviss illustration of president johnsons impeachment trial in the senate in  as published in harpers weekly there is a cancer growing on us democracy and despite what gop lawmakers might say publicly plenty of them are spooked about it as more and more evidence piles up for the good of the nation a president facing such a storm should leave office until he is acquitted or convicted ideally he would put the country above his own immediate advantage and leave voluntarily if so that’s well and good—we have a tried and true line of succession and it’s been used in the past more than once but this is donald trump he will deny and defy any congressional findings or fbi conclusions marshal his followers in support pardon himself and any family members who are implicated fire investigators and precipitate a fullon constitutional crisis it will be a crisis that can only be resolved by forcibly removing him and that will not go over well with his more ardent followers a new public policy polling survey shows as if we needed any more evidence of this that trump voters live in an alternate reality that completely ignores the facts this is especially true on the russia matter where more than ths of them don’t believe what donald trump jr has publicly admitted to   there are only two ways to stop this clown before a hypothetical sweep in  and by then the damage to our democracy could be irreversible that means that at least

would ban faculty from training their resident physicians in abortion care the journalsentinel reports jacque’s bill introduced in april would prohibit uwmadison employees from performing abortions as well as training others or receiving training in performing abortions anywhere other than a hospital since the training requires participating in abortions and government dollars can’t be used to facilitate abortions the training can’t take place at the university hospital that would leave nowhere for uwmadison residents to obtain it they would have to join another residency program if they wanted to become a certified obgyn if passed into law this would exacerbate the current obgyn shortage in the state according to local medical groups calvin bruce a retired family doctor testified on the behalf of the wisconsin academy of family physicians our academy is neither prochoice nor prolife we have members who have strongly held beliefs on both sides of that issue we are strongly

president of the eric trump foundation for a highlevel spot in the governments housing and urban development agency may not lead to competent government decisionmaking lynne patton a former event planner for the trump family whose nomination to a hud position drew criticism from policy experts and housing advocates last month reversed hud’s position on westchester’s zoning laws on tuesday the agency had rejected  previous versions of the county’s “analysis of impediments” a document which hud grantees must submit to demonstrate their use of taxpayer money will not get spent into systems that tacitly reinforce racial segregation in housing westchester’s fight with hud originated from a lawsuit brought by the antidiscrimination center the county struck a settlement with hud in  but has failed to comply fully with it for close to a decade despite being once again rejected just last april westchester county new york was able to finally skirt the hud regulations requiring the county to demonstrate hud funds would not be used for projects that encourage segregation with a devious plan indeed westchester waited a few weeks once patton was put in charge of the hud office with jurisdiction over the county then officials resubmitted the same analysis that was insufficient in april patton accepted the same figures her predecessors had rejected patton has never worked in housing policy decisionmaking in her life up until trump put her in charge of these things coincidentally resubmitting the same report that prior experts had rejected as insufficient turned out to be just fine when she thumbed through it conveniently for the trump family however weakening oversight of hud programs will likely benefit them financially the trump organization is coowner of the largest federally subsidized housing complex in the nation in brooklyn and relaxation of antidiscrimination regulations for that and similar new york properties will be a boon to landlords who want to

care more than six months into trump’s presidency republicans have no legislative accomplishments other than the confirmation of supreme court justice neil gorsuch a confusing foreign policy and a white house that is perpetually in damagecontrol mode from lawmakers and governors to donors and foreign policy experts a certain realization is sinking in within the party based on more than a dozen interviews in recent days donald trump has been a historically weak and ineffective president that it took six months to start wondering whether the man who talked about grabbing women who discussed his penis size during a presidential debate who sent his press secretary to baldly lie about the size of the crowds on his inauguration day and who is currently engaged in a public defense of his campaign team openly seeking the assistance of the russian government during a period of unprecedented assault on our election systems by that government is perhaps not the brilliant worldshaping genius he made himself out to be this is the problem with the republican party they dont catch on too quick even the president’s top backers are losing patience billionaire trump patrons rebekah and

that isn’t one the healthcare plan paul ryan proposed is actually a tax break for the very top and the number of people that were going to be cut out of healthcare was staggering the whole point of healthcare is to figure out how to cover people not how to exclude people with every new republican proposal threatening to deprive millions more americans of healthcare coverage now may be the best
