bargain but a closer look is warranted maxx chatsko tmfblackngold jan   at am shares of natural gas transportation fuels leader clean energy fuels nasdaqclne have lost  of their value since september  in fact the stock is threatening its week  and alltime  low of just  per share then again youre always told to buy low investors wondering if now is a good time to buy should answer another question first how risky is clean energy fuels image source getty images by the numbers the company has several attractive attributes sales volumes have grown like clockwork in recent years in the first nine months of last year clean energy fuels sold  million gasoline gallon equivalents or gge compared to  million gge in the yearago period thats a remarkable change from  when only  million gge were sold for the entire year the market potential is large and the market is largely untapped  something the company has been able to exploit  despite increasing volumes of product sold depressed selling prices have taken a toll on revenue fullyear revenue slipped in  compared to the prior year and although  revenue will likely be higher than the previous year it will be unlikely to match the watermark set in  but management is banking on a turnaround it slashed capital expenditures last year to help boost the bottom line to a net loss of just  per share through the first nine months much

comparisons but we can stack the company up against other alternative fuel stocks that have had a similarly rough going since commodity prices tanked in late   company price to book price to sales beta clean energy fuels    renewable energy group nasdaqregi     pacific ethanol nasdaqpeix    data source yahoo finance  all three companies trade below book value with clean energy fuels presenting a decent bargain this hints that investors could see upside from current prices barring a sudden decrease in assets or increase in debt however investors need to consider that moneyburning operations mean the companys cash could disappear in several quarters  dragging down the total asset balance the only way for the company to get its hands on more cash is through a debt or share offering which has gotten investors into the current mess clean energy fuels is also the most expensive company of the three based on pricetosales ratio although that shouldnt be too surprising given that it has grown revenue the fastest and growth usually comes at a premium plus the other two stocks boast an unusually low ratio beta or the measure of a stocks volatility relative to the overall market is also the highest for the natural gas transportation fuels leader but only slightly overall these metrics provide a murky view of clean energy fuels risk level moving forward whats telling is that both renewable energy group and pacific ethanol have handily beaten the stock market in the past year and should be profitable in  while our stock in question has lagged the market and isnt expected to post profits this year that in the end could say enough about where the stock is headed clne data by ycharts what does it mean for investors while traditional valuation metrics are important investors also need to keep their eyes on developments in the real world that ultimately influence a stock for instance the recent increase in natural gas prices could result in an increase in clean energy fuels input costs if the increase in costs isnt offset by an increase in selling prices then the company could see margins shrink and losses widen that could lead to a further deterioration of the share price and jeopardize an already fragile balance sheet market unknowns coupled with mediocre financial metrics  book value is the only positive  make the stock appear to be relatively risky and certainly too risky for me maxx chatsko has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool owns shares of and recommends clean energy fuels the motley fool has a disclosure policy author maxx

orders reviews amanda b california has a slight citrus taste gave me the boost i needed without the crash much rather drink this than red bull rockstar or monster as this is organic found my new favorite energy drink preworkout or just when im dragging on certain days also it doesnt have a ton of calories big plus would you purchase again  yes original review yin c california i like the taste  but bi dont drink energy drunk too often thats why im not going to purchase the product but i do recommend people to try and then they can decide for themselves would you purchase again  no original review erick l california this product was tasting and refreshing it helped provide energy im not sure of the importance of it being vegan for an energy drink though would you purchase again  yes original review kiven c california the good things i like about this energy drink is very low in calorie and it is organic which i really love because i dont really see any energy drink that is organic would you purchase again  yes original review vianey g california unfortunately i did not receive the coupon for this in the mail however i did try it when i saw it at sprouts i liked the flavor but i am not so sure if it helped with my levels of energy would you purchase again  no original review soila g california the taste is good but the price to get it is so expensive and is hard to get this product isnt easy to find it in the stores and when you find it dont have to many flavors would you purchase again  no original review jeremy g california i dont usually drink energy drinks but this one is an exception to the rule its organic low calorie nongmo and contains ingredients that i can actually trust i did not experience a crash afterwards i read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturallyoccurring caffeine from green tea and guarana i dont know why you would drink any other energy drink than this definitely loading up on these again soon great price not expensive at all would you purchase again  yes original review erob j california great taste and quite a boost perfect for tired driving or late night study have quite a few friends that love guru also and its organic would you purchase again  yes original review tiffany m california definitely better tasting than something like red bulland just as importantly better smelling i cant be the only person who gags at the smell of red bull in contrast this stuff is much more palatable less artificially sweet and doesnt leave that horrendous aftertaste coating your tongue its harder to find than red bull so when you see it stock up would you purchase again  yes original review cybastian d california it gave me a great boost to start my day for it was very energizing and what really

because they dont typically taste great and i drink coffee already however i was impressed with guru i couldnt put my finger on the flavor at first but reading the ingredients it was the green tea that leaves a mild aftertaste kind of like matcha the nose is citrusy and refreshing that said although i stayed perky after drinking it i would say its safe for people who only drink caffeine moderately to drink it too and if youre dead tired it might not make much of a difference it only has caffeine from the tea so not at all the crack type of artificial energy drink like a monster or red bull which i think taste gross and are horrible for you would you purchase again  yes original review mark w california this brand really holds up to the competition it has great flavor and

and thought it was a step above the usual red bull or monster drinks upon reading the list of ingredients i was pleased to see that they were all natural i was surprised to see echinacea listed as an ingredient which i felt was a nice alternative to unpleasant tasting vitamin supplements my store did not carry the sugar free variety so i had to settle for the  grams of sugar that came with the regular version it was very sweet but the actual taste was good and i liked the level of carbonation i didnt get the jitters nor did i have the crash and burn that i would have expected with this type of drink i did not drink it all at once but rather had it throughout the second half of the day which is usually when i start feeling tired if i can find the sugar free version i will definitely try it i do have to limit my caffeine intake but for those occasions when i absolutely must have an extra boost a cold sparkly guru sounds like a great alternative to an iced coffee or tea would you

forms so i decided to try guru i was pleasantly surprised because it has wonderful taste it is not as overwhelming as redbull it is more natural fruity and refreshing and the energy in it brought some muracles  on lazy and rainy sunday afternoon i did not have much hope to achieve anything but with guru i completed tasks and chores i was procrastinating about for weeks the only thing to be aware of

purchase again  yes original review jack d california this product tastes great i absolutely loved it and felt very energetic about  minutes after drinking it it tastes great when chilled although i would think it probably tastes good at room temperature as well if i ever feel the need for some energy i would definitely purchase this product recommended would you purchase again  yes original review victoria h california i personally am a connoisseur of energy drinks i rely on caffeine for most of my projects at school and for late night coding sessions as well as marathon gaming although energy drinks can be considered a crutch its a lifestyle decision that many many people embrace rather than attempt to avoid i am one of these people that said guru energy is fairly cheap usdcan if you buy it here off amazon it comes in the redbull standard  floz cans and is shipped in a surprisingly lightweight and compact case compare this to monster rockstar or any other brand with standard  floz cans the taste like gurus website describes is very indescribable it is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation the caffeine buzz is more natural it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out which is arguably awesome too in its own respect then big crash sort of feeling this is because the caffeine in guru is derived from mg of guaranine guarana herb rather than synthetically separated then added there is no mention about how much of the mg of guaranine is real caffeine but since red bull checks in at mg  oz it seems that guru is in pretty good shape i think a particular good feature of guru is that it uses cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup i appreciate a good quality soda particularly microbrew colas and they often exclusively contain cane sugar so in summary this energy drink is fairly cheap good buzz all natural and great for coding gaming or studying would you purchase again  yes original review sangeeta m california nice drink for a pickmeup  refreshing and pleasant tasting ideal replacement for a soda  the carbonation without all the sugar was perfectly satisfying zero guilt would you purchase again  no original review ashley b california the biggest question is does it work the answer to your question is yes i was busy all day long and had the best energy ive had in awhile it feels a lot better than using redbull im very sensitive to caffeine so drinking it gives me a lot of energy i have no question about that but this energy felt like ive slept the whole night without waking up and best bed ever so pretty much i felt really good the taste isnt the best but it not a lot you drink so if you hate it a lot then just chug it its a little herbaly but not bad just different would you purchase again  yes original review christine f california i love it its sweet kind of tastes like this other energy drink brand ive tried before it tastes very good and not nasty or smell like alcohol like others do sure would rebuy again totally recommend this brand would you purchase again  yes original review cindy w california im a big fan of energy drinks so i consider myself somewhat of an expert and i must say this perticular energy drinkguru was quite surprising so if you get a chance to try one like i did please doyou wont be sorry trynatural would you purchase again  yes original review angela a california the taste was good i dont feel like it gave me more energy but it tasted good it was a good size as well would recommend and buy again for sure would you purchase again  yes original review milo s california coming from someone who at one point drank a decent amount of monster energy drinks i can say that the guru organic energy drink definitely makes me feel

if they are available the next time i want one would you purchase again  yes original review sarah h california i really enjoyed this energy drink it kept me alert but not at all jittery so many

calories this is the lite version my store did not carry the original it has a pleasant taste not great but not bad when i need an energy drink again i will definitely buy this one would you purchase

sugar content then dont get the lite because the normal one is pretty good too the can packs a decent punch and the organic components of the product make me feel like im not wiring myself up on some

energy drink i have tried still not my favorite flavor but not bad i love that it is organic and does not have all of the artificial ingredients many other energy drinks have would you purchase again  yes original review valerie f california i dont usually buy traditional energy drinks because i prefer clean ingredients this guru energy drink is very clean its organic too and has very low calories i actually liked the taste a lot better than i thought i would but you can definitely taste the stevia its a little bitter but the lemon juice and added sugar help to balance that out i did not notice a huge lift in energy but it did perk me up at work id probably purchase this in the future to drink after lunchearly afternoon at work would you purchase again  yes original review courtney s california i really enjoyed the sustained healthy energy this drink provided other energy drinks contain scary amounts of caffeine and vitamin b like it could give you irregular heart rhythms scary which causes an energy crash this one takes a more natural approach the result is a productive pep that does not make you feel or seem like youre on crack and it doesnt cause a sudden drop in energy either the energizing ingredients are green tea extract guarana seed and ginseng there is also echinacea which is great for the immune system at first i found the stevia to be overwhelming but the berry flavor presumably from the luo han guo fruit kept me sipping i have a suspicion i would like the nonlite version a bit more but this drink is great for those who are used to the powerful sweetness of stevia would you purchase again  yes original review laura w california this seems to be a rarity of an energy drink that does not have awful additives in it it has no color and has a light refreshing texture and slightly sweet taste without being too much it has natural organic ingredients that provide energy rather than artificial ones and no sugar alcohols erythritol etc which usually cause me problems i therefore felt a nice natural energy boost without any discomfort loved it would you purchase again  yes original review alison e california it was easy to drink and i really like that the ingredients are organic the flavor is good with a slight vitamin aftertaste it has comparable amounts of caffeine to other brands of energy drinks with nonnatural ingredients overall it tasted good and i would buy it again would you purchase again  yes original review sheila t kansas while i occasionally consume energy drinks i often worry about the ingredients in conventional varieties which are often made up of chemicals that i can hardly pronounce and rarely recognize i wonder about the safety and potential effects on my health from those products and im also not particularly fond of the often strongly artificial taste as such i was really interested in learning about and trying out guru organic energy which is made up of organic ingredients and naturally occurring caffeine given that i avoid calories in drinks i chose the lite version to try and i was pleasantly surprised the flavor was different and although i wouldnt say it was delicious it was refreshing and not as aversive as other energy drinks ive tried i didnt feel a huge kick of energy but caffeine rarely has a tremendous effect on me and i did feel alert if not energetic overall i think the guru organic energy drink is a preferable choice for those looking for energy beverages over the typical energy drink laden with artificial ingredients although im not a regular connoisseur of energy drinks the next time i want one i will choose guru organic trynatural would you purchase again  yes original review ashley z california surprisingly good i wasnt expecting this drink to be lightly carbonatedit was a nice surprise flavor was good and it definitely gave noticeable energy i tried it before a workout in place of my preworkout drink i wouldnt replace my preworkout supplement it gave me a less focused energy but i would drink it if i needed a little pick me up throughout the day would you purchase again  yes original review phyllis c california i love the fruity fizzy taste and the amazing list of organic and natural ingredients best of all it doesnt give me the jitters like coffee would i could concentrate and get a lot of work done as im trying to eat clean and stay away from sugar an unsweetened version would be awesome as it is im pretty happy with guru energy drink would you purchase again  yes original review stephany c california i got the original guru and what i liked about this drink was that it didnt taste like a energy drink it was light and it didnt have that strong caffeine aftertaste the price is reasonable for bein g a usda verified drino which i think is very important i have already told my friends who lik energy drinks and they sell this product at my local bristol farms which is great thanks for the drink would you purchase again  yes original review tirza v california great taste and good energy level i did not feel jittery or have a crash afterwards like i have experienced with other products so glad theres no artificial ingredients stevia is the way to go would you purchase again  yes original review janet l california its pretty tasty i have tried many energy drinks in the past that have really bad

the sparkling water blended with the organic ingredients of cane sugargrape juicecitric and apple acid along with the vital nutrients of organic green tea leafguarana seedechinacea flower and panax

from most energy drinks i like the strong lemon juice taste it has for a drink that has less calories then the original it does work kept me going all day through work which is awesome overall great stuff for only  calories a must buytrynatural would you purchase again  yes original review cooper q california grate tasting and very good product kept me focused awith no crash all day the flavor was crisp and clean no funny afertaste thanks for letting me try it would you purchase again  yes original review albert c california guru lite is very tasty and refreshing especially on a hot day unlike most stevia sweetened drinks the taste is well balanced with no bitter aftertaste theres a nice lemony flavor and the carbonation is onpoint i dont usually drink energy drinks but this one is an exception to the rule its organic low calorie nongmo and contains ingredients that i can actually trust another big bonus i noticed is that i did not experience a crash afterwards i read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturallyoccurring caffeine from green tea and guarana i dont know why you would drink any other energy drink than this definitely loading up on these again soon would you purchase again  yes original review rebecca h california this product is packed with good natural ingredients unlike most energy drinks out there and still packs the same amount of caffeine the flavor of this drink is somewhat like a gummy bear although just slightly watered down from the flavors of other energy drinks which i didnt mind i have tried other natural energy drinks in the past which did not agree with me however i did not have the same issues with this drink i really enjoyed it if there is one thing i could say about it is there wasnt any selection at the store i went to they had one flavor of the drink in one size the drink was also about a dollar more than comparable energy drinks i would be most likely to buy this product if they offered a multipack with a small discount would you purchase again  yes original review debbie z california good taste and no jittery feeling i will definitely recommend this drink to my friends only problem is that it should be

good tasting product the thing that stood out to me was that it tasted somewhat like redbull but with a more pleasing aftertaste it reminded me of cane sugar soda but much healthier there are g of

red bull fan but i got to try the guru energy drink it tastes a bit better than red bull but the crashes are way weaker the price is cheaper than red bull there are basically no downsides when compared to other energy drinks all in all  would buy again would you purchase again  yes original review flora r california this has to be the best energy drink that i have ever tasted it is a light crisp tangy citrus flavor that doesnt have a large aftertaste and gives me enough energy in the morning on my slow days would you purchase again  yes original review sophia h california i dont usually drink energy drinks or coffee because they make my heart race and i get shaky but with half a can of this drink i didnt feel overcaffeinated i liked that it is low in calories and organic but that also limits where i can buy it in the future i dont usually shop at sprouts or whole foods so this would only be something i would get when i rarely make it into those stores would you purchase again  yes original review laura c california the taste like gurus website describes is very indescribable it is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation the caffeine buzz is more natural it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out which is arguably awesome too in its own respect then big crash sort of feeling this is because the caffeine in guru is derived from mg of guaranine guarana herb rather than synthetically separated then added there is no mention about how much of the mg of guaranine is real caffeine but since red bull checks in at mg  oz it seems that guru is in pretty good shape would you purchase again  yes original review mary c california i tried the lite version and it has a nice fruity taste it tastes much better than other energy drinks on the market the price in the market is comparable to other brands would you purchase again  yes original review keyvan a california the drink tastes very good but the package is too smallneeds to be much bigger and fatterlike the size of a monster drink but a bit bigger would you purchase again  yes original review claudia c california guru energy drink has a good taste is

jasmine k california love the taste i didnt know wat i wouldve thought about this drink because its organic but its in my opinion better than a cup of coffee would you purchase again  yes original review juliana n california i usually dont like energy drinks because i cant deal with the carbonation guru organic energy drink was a nice surprise because the carbonation isnt that bad  i actually let it sit a little and it got a lot better the taste is very fruity and mild and i really like how sweet it is i tried it on a day when i had to be out early and it really helped me feeling up while

definitely worked for him  i felt better knowing that it has better ingredients for him i was really against him drinking energy drinks but thankful that this product is a lot safer for him i would recommend this product to any  all energy drinkers would you purchase again  yes original review walter s california i love these when i cant get to coffee in the am i have one during my lunch break

drinks every now and again i break down and purchase one as an alternative to my usual coffee but im not a big energy drink person i think of them as having a rather off taste and an unpleasant effect on my heartbeat this one surprisingly seemed to have neither of those it was fresh tasting if you can believe it and i found myself actually enjoying the flavor instead of merely tolerating it the one detractor is that it did not seem to supply quite the same kick as a normal energy drink the energy it did supply however came without heart palpitations or other unfortunate side effects and for that i am quite grateful i may not buy it often but next time i reach for an energy drink ill definitely reach for guru and i will not hesitate to suggest it to friends would you purchase again  yes

original review zin l california great taste i love organic energy drinks very low calories and vegan also gluten free so whoever needs the gluten free energy drinks its here would you purchase again  yes original review deborah r california i dont drink energy drinks often mostly because they dont typically taste great and i drink coffee already however i was impressed with guru i couldnt put my finger on the flavor at first but reading the ingredients it was the green tea that leaves a mild aftertaste kind of like matcha the nose is citrusy and refreshing that said although i stayed perky after drinking it i would say its safe for people who only drink caffeine moderately to drink it too and if youre dead tired it might not make much of a difference it only has caffeine from the tea so not at all the crack type of artificial energy drink like a monster or red bull which i think taste gross and are horrible for you would you purchase again  yes original review mark w california this brand really holds up to the competition it has great flavor and balance plus its better for you then any other energy drink i would definitely recommend this product would you purchase again  yes

kind of like a citrus apple cider with tea but there was a little too much sugar i pay attention to carb intake as i am type  diabetic and there was quite a bit of sugartoo much for my taste i dont even think it needed it but it was still yummy would you purchase again  yes original review la c california im not big on mainstream energy drinks so im happy that theres a more natural organic

and thought it was a step above the usual red bull or monster drinks upon reading the list of ingredients i was pleased to see that they were all natural i was surprised to see echinacea listed as an ingredient which i felt was a nice alternative to unpleasant tasting vitamin supplements my store did not carry the sugar free variety so i had to settle for the  grams of sugar that came with the regular version it was very sweet but the actual taste was good and i liked the level of carbonation i didnt get the jitters nor did i have the crash and burn that i would have expected with this type of drink i did not drink it all at once but rather had it throughout the second half of the day which is usually when i start feeling tired if i can find the sugar free version i will definitely try

muracles  on lazy and rainy sunday afternoon i did not have much hope to achieve anything but with guru i completed tasks and chores i was procrastinating about for weeks the only thing to be aware of

purchase again  yes original review jack d california this product tastes great i absolutely loved it and felt very energetic about  minutes after drinking it it tastes great when chilled although i would think it probably tastes good at room temperature as well if i ever feel the need for some energy i would definitely purchase this product recommended would you purchase again  yes original review victoria h california i personally am a connoisseur of energy drinks i rely on caffeine for most of my projects at school and for late night coding sessions as well as marathon gaming although energy drinks can be considered a crutch its a lifestyle decision that many many people embrace rather than attempt to avoid i am one of these people that said guru energy is fairly cheap usdcan if you buy it here off amazon it comes in the redbull standard  floz cans and is shipped in a surprisingly lightweight and compact case compare this to monster rockstar or any other brand with standard  floz cans the taste like gurus website describes is very indescribable it is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation the caffeine buzz is more natural it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out which is arguably awesome too in its own respect then big crash sort of feeling this is because the caffeine in guru is derived from mg of guaranine guarana herb rather than synthetically separated then added there is no mention about how much of the mg of guaranine is real caffeine but since red bull checks in at mg  oz it seems that guru is in pretty good shape i think a particular good feature of guru is that it uses cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup i appreciate a good quality soda particularly microbrew colas and they often exclusively contain cane sugar so in summary this energy drink is fairly cheap good buzz all natural and great for coding gaming or studying would you purchase again  yes original review sangeeta m california nice drink for a pickmeup  refreshing and pleasant tasting ideal replacement for a soda  the carbonation without all the sugar was perfectly satisfying zero guilt would you purchase again  no original review ashley b california the biggest question is does it work the answer to your question is yes i was busy all day long and had the best energy ive had in awhile it feels a lot better than using redbull im very sensitive to caffeine so drinking it gives me a lot of energy i have no question about that but this energy felt like ive slept the whole night without waking up and best bed ever so pretty much i felt really good the taste isnt the best but it not a lot you drink so if you hate it a lot then just chug it its a little herbaly but not bad just different would you purchase again  yes original review christine f california i love it its sweet kind of tastes like this other energy drink brand ive tried before it tastes very good and not nasty or smell like alcohol like others do sure would rebuy again totally recommend this brand would you purchase again  yes original review cindy w california im a big fan of energy drinks so i consider myself somewhat of an expert and i must say this perticular energy drinkguru was quite surprising so if you get a chance to try one like i did please doyou wont be sorry trynatural would you purchase again  yes original review angela a california the taste was good i dont feel like it gave me more energy but it tasted good it was a good size as well would recommend and buy again for sure would you purchase

sugar content then dont get the lite because the normal one is pretty good too the can packs a decent punch and the organic components of the product make me feel like im not wiring myself up on some synthetic creation that tastes like plastic the product isnt priced the most competitively but maybe that is because i purchased it at bristol farms i wouldnt be surprised if whole foods had it for a bit less i enjoyed my guru chilled but i totally see how it could be fine on the go at room temperature overall im happy with my guru experience would you purchase again  yes original review eliazar r

energy drink i have tried still not my favorite flavor but not bad i love that it is organic and does not have all of the artificial ingredients many other energy drinks have would you purchase again  yes original review valerie f california i dont usually buy traditional energy drinks because i prefer clean ingredients this guru energy drink is very clean its organic too and has very low calories i actually liked the taste a lot better than i thought i would but you can definitely taste the stevia its a little bitter but the lemon juice and added sugar help to balance that out i did not notice a huge lift in energy but it did perk me up at work id probably purchase this in the future to drink after lunchearly afternoon at work would you purchase again  yes original review courtney s california i really enjoyed the sustained healthy energy this drink provided other energy drinks contain scary amounts of caffeine and vitamin b like it could give you irregular heart rhythms scary which causes an energy crash this one takes a more natural approach the result is a productive pep that does not make you feel or seem like youre on crack and it doesnt cause a sudden drop in energy either the energizing ingredients are green tea extract guarana seed and ginseng there is also echinacea which is great for the immune system at first i found the stevia to be overwhelming but the berry flavor presumably from the luo han guo fruit kept me sipping i have a suspicion i would like the nonlite version a bit more but this drink is great for those who are used to the powerful sweetness of stevia would you purchase again  yes original review laura w california this seems to be a rarity of an energy drink that does not have awful additives in it it has no color and has a light refreshing texture and slightly sweet taste without being too much it has natural organic ingredients that provide energy rather than artificial ones and no sugar alcohols erythritol etc which usually cause me problems i therefore felt a nice natural energy boost without any discomfort loved it would you purchase again  yes original review alison e california it was easy to drink and i really like that the ingredients are organic the flavor is good with a slight vitamin aftertaste it has comparable amounts of caffeine to other brands of energy drinks with nonnatural ingredients overall it tasted good and i would buy it again would you purchase again  yes original review sheila t kansas while i occasionally consume energy drinks i often worry about the ingredients in conventional varieties which are often made up of chemicals that i can hardly pronounce and rarely recognize i wonder about the safety and potential effects on my health from those products and im also not particularly fond of the often strongly artificial taste as such i was really interested in learning about and trying out guru organic energy which is made up of organic ingredients and naturally occurring caffeine given that i avoid calories in drinks i chose the lite version to try and i was pleasantly surprised the flavor was different and although i wouldnt say it was delicious it was refreshing and not as aversive as other energy drinks ive tried i didnt feel a huge kick of energy but caffeine rarely has a tremendous effect on me and i did feel alert if not energetic overall i think the guru organic energy drink is a preferable choice for those looking for energy beverages over the typical energy drink laden with artificial ingredients although im not a regular connoisseur of energy drinks the next time i want one i will choose guru organic trynatural would you purchase again  yes original review ashley z california surprisingly good i wasnt expecting this drink to be lightly carbonatedit was a nice surprise flavor was good and it definitely gave noticeable energy i tried it before a workout in place of my preworkout drink i wouldnt replace my preworkout supplement it gave me a less focused energy but i would drink it if i needed a little pick me up throughout the day would you purchase again  yes original review phyllis c california i love the fruity fizzy taste and the amazing list of organic and natural ingredients best of all it doesnt give me the jitters like coffee would i could concentrate and get a lot of work done as im trying to eat clean and stay away from sugar an unsweetened version would be awesome as it is im pretty happy with guru energy drink would you purchase again  yes original review stephany c california i got the original guru and what i liked about this drink was that it didnt taste like a energy drink it was light and it didnt have that strong caffeine aftertaste the price is reasonable for bein g a usda verified drino which i think is very important i have already told my friends who lik energy drinks and they sell this product at my local bristol farms which is great thanks for the drink would you purchase again  yes original review tirza v california great taste and good energy level i did not feel jittery or have a crash afterwards like i have experienced with other products so glad theres no artificial ingredients stevia is the way to go would you purchase again  yes original review janet l california its pretty tasty i have tried many energy drinks in the past that have really bad

the sparkling water blended with the organic ingredients of cane sugargrape juicecitric and apple acid along with the vital nutrients of organic green tea leafguarana seedechinacea flower and panax

unlike most stevia sweetened drinks the taste is well balanced with no bitter aftertaste theres a nice lemony flavor and the carbonation is onpoint i dont usually drink energy drinks but this one is an exception to the rule its organic low calorie nongmo and contains ingredients that i can actually trust another big bonus i noticed is that i did not experience a crash afterwards i read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturallyoccurring caffeine from green tea and guarana i dont know why you would drink any other energy drink than this definitely loading up on these again soon would you purchase again  yes original review rebecca h california this product is packed with good natural ingredients unlike most energy drinks out there and still packs the same amount of caffeine the flavor of this drink is somewhat like a gummy bear although just slightly watered down from the flavors of other energy drinks which i didnt mind i have tried other natural energy drinks in the past which did not agree with me however i did not have the same issues with this drink i really enjoyed it if there is one thing i could say about it is there wasnt any selection at the store i went to they had one flavor of the drink in one size the drink was also about a dollar more than comparable energy drinks i would be most likely to buy this product if they offered a multipack with a small discount would you purchase again  yes original review debbie z california good taste and no jittery feeling i will definitely recommend this drink to my friends only problem is that it should be

good tasting product the thing that stood out to me was that it tasted somewhat like redbull but with a more pleasing aftertaste it reminded me of cane sugar soda but much healthier there are g of

am not a huge energy drink fan due to the usual caffeinated cough syrup taste and often shakey feeling afterwards however with guru i was actually pleasantly surprised it tasted much better than other

red bull fan but i got to try the guru energy drink it tastes a bit better than red bull but the crashes are way weaker the price is cheaper than red bull there are basically no downsides when compared to other energy drinks all in all  would buy again would you purchase again  yes original review flora r california this has to be the best energy drink that i have ever tasted it is a light crisp tangy citrus flavor that doesnt have a large aftertaste and gives me enough energy in the morning on my slow days would you purchase again  yes original review sophia h california i dont usually drink energy drinks or coffee because they make my heart race and i get shaky but with half a can of this drink i didnt feel overcaffeinated i liked that it is low in calories and organic but that also limits where i can buy it in the future i dont usually shop at sprouts or whole foods so this would only be something i would get when i rarely make it into those stores would you purchase again  yes original review laura c california the taste like gurus website describes is very indescribable it is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation the caffeine buzz is more natural it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out which is arguably awesome too in its own respect then big crash sort of feeling this is because the caffeine in guru is derived from mg of guaranine guarana herb rather than synthetically separated then added there is no mention about how much of the mg of guaranine is real caffeine but since red bull checks in at mg  oz it seems that guru is in pretty good shape would you purchase again  yes original review mary c california i tried the lite version and it has a nice fruity taste it tastes much better than other energy drinks on the market the price in the market is comparable to other brands would you purchase again  yes original review keyvan a california the drink tastes very good but the package is too smallneeds to be much bigger and fatterlike the size of a monster drink but a bit bigger would you purchase again  yes original review claudia c california guru energy drink has a good taste is

jasmine k california love the taste i didnt know wat i wouldve thought about this drink because its organic but its in my opinion better than a cup of coffee would you purchase again  yes original review juliana n california i usually dont like energy drinks because i cant deal with the carbonation guru organic energy drink was a nice surprise because the carbonation isnt that bad  i actually let it sit a little and it got a lot better the taste is very fruity and mild and i really like how sweet it is i tried it on a day when i had to be out early and it really helped me feeling up while running errands id recommend it and buy it again would you purchase again  yes original review elizabeth k california theres two sizes i used the larger sugar free one before starting my am shift i drank it throughout my shift i absolutely loved the taste of it the price isnt to bad either with some of the energy drinks out there at least this one you know is organic and better for you so its worth it energy wise i def felt it when i first started drinking it it wasnt overpowering but the right amount of energy i usually sip it throughout my shift the only problem i had with it was that

drinks every now and again i break down and purchase one as an alternative to my usual coffee but im not a big energy drink person i think of them as having a rather off taste and an unpleasant effect on my heartbeat this one surprisingly seemed to have neither of those it was fresh tasting if you can believe it and i found myself actually enjoying the flavor instead of merely tolerating it the one detractor is that it did not seem to supply quite the same kick as a normal energy drink the energy it did supply however came without heart palpitations or other unfortunate side effects and for that i am quite grateful i may not buy it often but next time i reach for an energy drink ill definitely reach for guru and i will not hesitate to suggest it to friends would you purchase again  yes
