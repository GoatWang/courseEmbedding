plan portfolio construction plan execution ongoing review and communication  gathering information we begin by listening to our clients we take the time to thoroughly understand our clients’ financial background investment objectives income needs growth needs risk tolerance and time horizon next step  developing the plan every client has a customized investment policy statement ips this ips details how the portfolio should be managed given the client’s unique investment objectives and constraints the ips details how the portfolio should be allocated among various asset classes while also outlining the other key pieces of a client’s financial plan this can include tax and estate planning issues college funding longterm care life and disability insurance details and charitable giving to name a few the ips is updated at least once a year or more often if client circumstances change materially next step prev step  portfolio construction each portfolio is allocated to satisfy specific investment objectives and constraints client portfolios often have a targeted weight for cash equity and fixed income investments these allocations are continually monitored and portfolios are dynamically rebalanced when significant deviations occur equity investments consist of exchange traded funds etfs and when appropriate individual common stocks fixed income investments commonly consist of a diversified ladder of individual bonds however fixed income etfs are used when cost effective diversification cannot be obtained using individual bonds next step prev step  plan execution plan execution includes portfolio management but can also consist of various other aspects of a client’s financial life this can include retirement plan funding for small business owners making sure that various types of insurance policies life disability longterm care are adequate and appropriate or making sure that an estate plan is in place to facilitate efficient generational wealth transfer
