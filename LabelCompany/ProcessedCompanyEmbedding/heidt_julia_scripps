february   by tim stautberg share tweet share   cincinnati  charles e scripps scion of a legendary media family and the board chairman of the e w scripps company for more than four decades died today of natural causes at the age  near his home in naples fla charles scripps long tenure as head of the company founded in  by his grandfather edward w scripps was marked by dramatic expansion into new businesses and impressive financial growth as board chairman from  until  he presided over the companys growth as a newspaper publisher and the companys entry into other forms of media including broadcast television cable tv systems cable tv networks and the internet in  the company brought cousin john p scripps seven west coast newspapers into the family fold with a merger agreement and two years later initiated a public stock offering that provided family members with a way to diversify their holdings simultaneously scripps served as trustee of the edward w scripps trust  controlling shareholder of the company  and was chairman of the trust from  until  to carry the family name is to carry the responsibility for quality and innovation in an everchanging media environment scripps said in a  interview the ew scripps company has survived  years because it embodies the entrepreneurial spirit of its founding father it was that spirit which fostered development of scripps networks  the division that operates hgtv food network diy network fine living and gac great american country of which scripps was especially proud this company our community and the entire media industry are affected by the loss of charles scripps said kenneth w lowe president and chief executive officer of the e w scripps company charles set the tone for this companys fearless journalism unquestioned integrity and restless innovation those are legacies that continue to influence our approach to operating the business that carries his familys name when once asked about a guiding principle scripps said its simple really just look at the direction youre going and ask can we be proud of that charles scripps provided the glue that bonded the scripps enterprise together for a halfcentury said william r burleigh chairman of the e w scripps company he stepped forward as the familys representative when he was only  and served continuously until  presiding over a period of unprecedented growth and success this sense of responsibility and wise counsel animated everything he did  the company in his family and in the community often described as a newspapermans newspaperman scripps regularly asked editors what are you doing for your communities when the newspaper division was introducing its total quality program to news and business leaders in the late s scripps was asked for a slogan he responded with just three words quality reflects character he later explained i remember getting a note from a disgruntled reader about an error in one of our newspapers i checked it out and i was told it was just a minor error i remember saying that theres no such thing as a minor error an error is an advertisement of poor workmanship and we simply cant tolerate that in our newspapers to be in journalism is to be in the business of credibility scripps was born jan   in san diego to robert paine and margaret culbertson scripps he and his three brothers and two sisters grew up at nearby miramar their grandfather edward willis scripps acre ranch scripps attended william  mary college in williamsburg va but returned to california and entered pomona college after his father  the sole

worked with his father just as scripps inherited his grandfathers passion for publishing the two also shared a love of sailing it came as no surprise when young scripps enlisted with the us coast guard during world war ii he was stationed in the pacific and rose to the rank of lieutenant before returning to the family business after the war scripps was  when he became chairman of the family
