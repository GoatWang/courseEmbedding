thank youfeedback avondale asset management skip to main content menu welcome to avondale our values who we are what we offer wealth management investment management research company notes digest company notes database contact us click here to receive our weekly earnings call notes   dear reader   i founded avondale in  because i couldn’t find the right home to pursue my passion for investing i loved the craft of investing and wanted to dedicate my professional life to learning how to be the best investor i possibly could but i knew that this type of thinking has little place in the investment industry as it stands today at avondale we think long term care about our clients and are driven by a basic desire to never stop learning these couldn’t be further from the values of wall street on wall street greed hubris and reckless selfinterest reign supreme and so i knew that if i wanted a home to pursue my passion in the right way i would have to build it which is why i created avondale our mission is to be the investment industry’s answer to the organic food movement financial markets are like grocery stores and the shelves have been stocked by wall street wall street’s products are sugary fatty and bad for your long term financial health we’re not the first to realize that wall street is producing junk food over the last decade many individuals have adopted index funds as a low cost way to avoid many of wall street’s tricks but we think that this is the equivalent of saying “rather than try to figure out what’s healthy i’m just going to buy the whole store” that’s not a great approach when the store is filled with junk at avondale we take a different approach we have trained ourselves to identify only the best organic ingredients and prepare a farmtotable investment meal that is not only good for you but tastes good too we embrace the fact that doing this in the right way takes hard work it takes developing a truly unique supply chain interviewing farmers and learning about how they produce their crops it takes building processes and relationships that are completely off the beaten path it takes being open minded about new methods and embracing old ones above all it takes a relentless commitment to doing what’s best for the customer we view investing as a fundamentally human pursuit we’re not about algorithms derivatives or sharpe ratios we are about building long term relationships we want to fundamentally change the way that the investment industry conducts business and we are always looking for partners who share our mission whether you are an individual advisor or professional investor if this letter makes sense to you then we are interested in hearing from you welcome home   sincerely scott krisiloff cfa ceo
