required a robust nextgeneration application performance management solution able to cope with the scale of its infrastructure and high volumes of daily trafficthe organization first engaged appdynamics in may  deciding to run a proofofconcept across its main security scanners using appdynamics in a performance environment to spot issues nitin thakur technical operations manager cisco security technology group said “from our initial evaluation it was clear appdynamics was able to provide the functionality we required to cope with the sheer volume of transactions we handle on a daily basis we evaluated other products on the market but for us appdynamics provided true endtoend visibility and we were impressed with the ease of deployment crucially its future roadmap meant the company was best placed to help us scale for future growth” after a successful proofofconcept appdynamics was rolled out globally across the organization’s  data centers — deploying a total of  agents — in just one week and all reporting into a single appdynamicshosted saas controller  appdynamics has enabled us to move towards datadriven troubleshooting rather than ‘gutfeels’ the solution gives us the application intelligence to know when things aren’t functioning optimallybenefits increased performance collaboration and visibilitypreviously cisco received  alerts a year from standard monitoring tools of which only  were genuine alerts requiring remedial action through implementing appdynamics cisco has been able to dramatically reduce false positives over the past twelve months “prior to appdynamics our network operations center team was working overtime looking in the wrong places at the wrong problems even if the noc team only spent an average of five minutes looking at each erroneous alert that amounts to over  man hours per year of effort that could be better spent either working on critical issues or helping to drive innovation forward since introducing the appdynamics platform we have been able to identify problems we weren’t even looking for appdynamics has enabled us to move towards datadriven troubleshooting rather than ‘gutfeels’ the solution gives us visibility when we need it and the application intelligence to know when things aren’t functioning optimally” said thakur since introducing appdynamics cisco has identified unique slow business transactions affecting services as well as addressing multiple configuration errors for example thakur explained “we spotted a configuration issue which meant  million requests were being sent back to our central hub unnecessarily with appdynamics it took just five minutes to find and fix this issue we were not even looking for this problem and only identified it when it was presented to us” among other benefits this has resulted in a fourtofive percent increase in memory utilization across the entire platform appdynamics gives us great visibility into what is happening on the estate helping us to dramatically reduce the number of escalations“appdynamics provides a common language between operations development and test introducing the platform has helped enable us to move towards a devops model which in turn had a positive impact on employee collaboration” said thakur “the visibility gleaned from appdynamics has made employees feel more empowered to reach problem resolution and able to influence business outcomes “because we make application releases so frequently for us it was critical to have apm in production appdynamics gives us great visibility into what is happening on the estate helping us to dramatically reduce the number of escalations and continue delivering a seamless service to our customers” future planscisco sees application runbook automation rba as a critical part of the monitoring solution and intends to roll this out extensively in the near future “the goal is have no alerts that humans interact with directly ensuring issues are automatically remediated and routed to development teams where necessary” said thakur “my goal is to be able to let chaos monkey loose and sit back to watch appdynamics monitor and automate the required remediation” added thakur appdynamics provides the functionality required to cope with the sheer volume of transactions we handle on a daily basiscisco also plans to further integrate

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
