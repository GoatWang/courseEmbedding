campaigns created by a procession of advertising agencies continued for the next two decades in  burger king hired the miamibased advertising agency crispin porter  bogusky cpb who completely reorganized its advertising with a series of new campaigns centered on a redesigned burger king character nicknamed the king accompanied by a new online presence while highly successful some of cpbs

the – male demographic with larger products that often carried correspondingly large amounts of unhealthy fats and transfats this tactic would eventually damage the companys financial underpinnings

two pieces of equipment called instamachines opened their first restaurants their production model was based on one of the machines they had acquired an oven called the instabroiler this strategy proved to be so successful that they later required all of their franchises to use the device after the company faltered in  it was purchased by its miami florida franchisees james mclamore and david r edgerton they initiated a corporate restructuring of the chain first renaming the company burger king they ran the company as an independent entity for eight years eventually expanding to over  locations in the united states before selling it to the pillsbury company in  pillsburys management tried several times to restructure burger king during the late s and the early s the most prominent change came in  when burger king hired mcdonalds executive donald n smith to help revamp the company in a plan called operation phoenix smith restructured corporate business practices at all levels of the company changes included updated franchise agreements a broader menu and new standardized restaurant designs smith left burger king for pepsico in  shortly before a systemwide decline in sales pillsburys executive vice president of restaurant operations norman e brinker was tasked with turning the brand around and strengthening its position against its main rival mcdonalds one of his initiatives was a new advertising campaign featuring a series of attack ads against its major competitors this campaign started a competitive period between burger king mcdonalds and top burger chains known as the burger wars brinker left burger king in  to take over dallasbased gourmet burger chain chilis smith and brinkers efforts were initially effective but after their respective departures pillsbury relaxed or discarded many of their changes and scaled back on construction of new locations these actions stalled corporate growth and sales declined again eventually resulting in a damaging fiscal slump for burger king and pillsbury poor operation and ineffectual leadership continued to bog down the company for many years pillsbury was eventually acquired by the british entertainment conglomerate grand metropolitan in  initially grand met attempted to bring the chain top profitability under newly minted ceo barry gibbons the changes he initiated during his twoyear tenure were hit or miss successful new product introductions and tieins with the walt disney company were offset by continuing image problems and ineffectual advertising programs additionally gibbons sold off several of the companys assets in attempt to profit from their sale and laid off many of its staff members after gibbons departure a series of ceos each tried to repair the companys brand by changing the menu bringing in new ad agencies and many other changes the parental disregard of the burger king brand continued with grand metropolitans merger with guinness in  when the two organizations formed the holding company diageo eventually the ongoing systematic institutional neglect of the brand through a string of owners damaged the company to the point where major franchises were driven out of business and its total value was significantly decreased diageo eventually decided to divest itself of the moneylosing chain and put the company up for sale in  an example of the  concept interior at a burger king in cork ireland the twentyfirst century saw the company return to independence when it was purchased from diageo by a group of investment firms led by tpg capital for us billion in  the new owners rapidly moved to revitalize and reorganize the company culminating with the company being taken public in  with a highly successful initial public offering the firms strategy for turning the chain around included a new advertising agency and new ad campaigns a revamped menu strategy a series of programs designed to revamp individual stores a new restaurant concept called the bk whopper bar and a new design format called  these changes successfully reenergized the company leading to a score of profitable quarters yet despite the successes of the new owners the effects of the financial crisis of – weakened the companys financial outlooks while those of its immediate competitor mcdonalds grew the falling value of burger king eventually led to tpg and its partners divesting their interest in the chain in a us billion sale to g capital of brazil analysts from financial firms ubs and stifel nicolaus agreed that g would have to invest heavily in the company to help reverse its fortunes after the deal was completed the companys stock was removed from the new york stock exchange ending a fouryear period as a public company the delisting of its stock was designed to help the company repair its fundamental business structures and continue working to close the gap with mcdonalds without having to worry about pleasing shareholders in the united states domestic market the chain has fallen to third place in terms of same store sales behind ohiobased wendys the decline is the result of  consecutive quarters of same store sales decline in august  g announced that it planned to acquire the canadian restaurant and coffee shop chain tim hortons and merge it with burger king with backing from warren buffetts berkshire hathaway the two chains will retain separate operations postmerger with burger king remaining in its miami headquarters a tim hortons representative stated that the proposed merger would allow tim hortons to leverage burger kings resources for international growth the combined company will be the thirdlargest international chain of fast food restaurants the deal lead to a controversy over the practice of tax inversions in which a company decreases the amount of taxes it pays by moving its headquarters to a tax haven a country with lower rates but maintains the majority of their operations in their previous location as a highprofile instance of tax inversion news of the merger was criticized by us politicians who felt that the move would result in a loss of tax revenue to foreign interests and could result in further government

franchises main article burger king franchises burger king restaurant in leicester square london united kingdom when burger king corporation began franchising in  it used a regional model where franchisees purchased the right to open stores within a geographic region these franchise agreements granted bkc very little oversight control of its franchisees and resulted in issues of product quality control store image and design and operational procedures during the s structural deficiencies in burger kings franchise system became increasingly problematic for pillsbury a major example was the relationship between burger king and louisianabased franchisee chart house burger kings largest franchisee group at the time with over  locations in the united states the companys owners william and james trotter made several moves to take over or acquire burger king during the s all of which were spurned by pillsbury after the failed attempts to acquire the company the relationship between chart house and burger king soured and eventually devolved into a lawsuit chart house eventually spun off its burger king operations in the early s into a holding company called diversifoods which in turn was acquired by pillsbury in  and absorbed into burger kings operations as part of the franchising reorganization segment of operation phoenix donald n smith initiated a restructuring of future franchising agreements in  under this new franchise agreement new owners were disallowed from living more than one hour from their restaurants – restricting them to smaller individuals or ownership groups and preventing large multistate corporations from owning franchises franchisee were also now prohibited from operating other chains preventing them from diverting funds away from their burger king holdings this new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging burger king corporation as chart house had smith also sought to have bkc be the primary owner of new locations and rent or lease the restaurants to its franchises this policy would allow the company to take over the operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would not conform to the company guidelines and policies by  parent company pillsbury had relaxed many of smiths changes scaled back on the construction of new locations which resulted in

straining relations between the parties a burger king franchise adapted to operate in the historic district of oaxaca mexico by  and after nearly  years of stagnant growth the state of its franchises was beginning to affect the value of the company one of the franchises most heavily affected by the lack of growth was the nearly store ameriking by  the franchise owner which until this point had been struggling under a nearly us million debt load and been shedding stores across the us was forced to enter chapter  bankruptcy the failure of ameriking deeply affected the value of burger king and put negotiations between diaego and the tpc capitalled group on hold the developments eventually forced diaego to lower the total selling price of the chain by almost  million after the sale newly

chicago and the upper midwest region from the failed company for a price of  million approximately  percent of their original value the new company which started out as core value partners and eventually became heartland foods also purchased  additional stores from distressed owners and revamped them the resulting purchases made cabrera the largest minority franchisee of burger king and

its founding in  depending on the ownership and executive staff at the time of these incidents the companys responses to these challenges have ranged from a conciliatory dialog with its critics and litigants to a more aggressive opposition with questionable tactics and negative consequences the companys response to these various issues has drawn praise as well as accusations of political appeasement from different parties over the years a trademark dispute involving the owners of the identically named burger king in mattoon illinois led to a federal lawsuit the cases outcome helped

business licenses within the member states territories a related issue involving members of the islamic faith over the interpretation of the muslim version of canon law shariah regarding the

first opened in jacksonville in  its menu consisted predominantly of basic hamburgers french fries soft drinks milkshakes and desserts after being acquired by its miami florida franchisees and renamed to its current moniker in  bk began expanding the breadth of its menu by adding the whopper sandwich in  this quarterpound  oz  g hamburger was created by burger kings new owners james mclamore and david edgerton as a way to differentiate bk from other burger outlets at the time since its inception the whopper has become synonymous with burger king and has become the focus of much of its advertising the company even named its new kioskstyle restaurants whopper bars the menu component of donald smiths operation phoenix was initiated in  and led to the addition of the burger king specialty sandwich line in  the new product line significantly expanded the breadth of the bk menu with many nonhamburger sandwiches including new chicken and fish offerings the new specialty sandwich line was one of the first attempts to target a specific demographic in this case adults – who would be willing to spend more on a higher quality product one of smiths other significant contributions to the menu was the addition of a breakfast product line which until this time was not a market burger king had entered besides the addition of the croissanwich in  the breakfast menu remained almost identical to the mcdonalds offerings until a menu revamp in  this expansion introduced bks am express product line which added new products such as french toast sticks and minimuffins as the company expanded both inside and outside the us it introduced localized versions of its products that conform to regional tastes and cultural or religious beliefs international variations add ingredients such as teriyaki or beetroot and fried egg to the whopper beer in germany italy and spain and halal or kosher products in the middle east and israel to generate additional sales bk will occasionally introduce limited time offers ltos that are versions of its core products or new products intended for either long or short term sales items such as the texas double whopper and various sandwiches made with mushrooms and swiss cheese have been rotated in and out of its menu for several years while products such as its  meatloaf specialty sandwich offering and accompanying limited table service along with special dinner platters failed to generate interest and were discontinued a meal including small french fries a whopper jr a drink and packets of heinz ketchup in order to appeal to as many demographic groups as possible and better compete with its competitor wendys burger king added a multitiered value menu in  with items priced at ¢ us and  the additions part of then ceo james adamsons back to basics program also called operation phoenix were an attempt to add not only a value menu but also a line of value meals the tiered menu was replaced with a more standard value menu in  while the value meals were separated into their own menu segment this value menu featured seven products whopper jr fivepiece chicken tenders a bacon cheeseburger mediumsized french fries medium soft drink medium onion rings and small shake in  and  bk revamped its value menu adding and removing several different products such as chili and its rodeo cheeseburger many of these items have since been discontinued modified or relegated to a regional menu option to better appeal to a more adult palate and demographic bk introduced several new products to its menu in  including several new or revamped chicken products a new salad line and its bk joe brand of coffee some of the new products including its enormous omelet sandwich line and the bk stacker line brought negative attention due to the large portion size and amounts of unhealthy fats and transfats many of these products featured higher quality ingredients like whole chicken breast angus beef and natural cheeses such as cheddar and pepper jack again not all these products such as the bk baguette line have met corporate sales expectations with the purchase of the company in  g began a program to restructure its menu designed to move away from the maleoriented menu that had dominated under the previous ownership the first major item to be introduced was a reformulation of its bk chicken tenders product in march  over the next few months approximately  new products were researched and developed while others were reformulated including its chefs choice burger eventually pruned down to  items burger king began deploying the items in the united states throughout – with the official roll out beginning april  the changes included new ice cream products smoothies frappés and chicken strips the whopper was the most prominently reformulated product in this round of introductions with a new type of cheese and packaging at the end of  burger kings parent company restaurant brands international announced that none of its subsidiaries would use chicken that had been fed antibiotics that are critically important” to human health that announcement referred only to a small class of antibiotics for which there is only one drug that kill a kind of bacteria and the announcement was described as a small step by advocates for stopping all antibiotic use in livestock equipment food being prepared in a burger king kitchen in italy like its menu the equipment the company cooks its hamburgers with has also evolved as the company expanded the burgers have always been broiled mechanically the original unit called an instabroiler was one of two pieces of equipment the founders of instaburger king purchased before opening their new restaurant the instabroiler worked by cooking  burger patties in a wire basket allowing the patties to be cooked from both sides simultaneously when mclamore and edgerton took over the company besides dropping the insta prefix they switched to an improved unit which they called a flame broiler designed by the two and featuring stationary burners that cooked the meat on a moving chain the unit broke down less often while maintaining a similar cooking rate the company would stay with that format for the next  years until burger king began developing a variable speed broiler that could handle multiple items with different cooking rates and times these new units began testing in  and eventually evolved into the two models the company deployed systemwide in – accompanying these new broilers was new foodholding equipment accompanied with a computerbased product monitoring system for its cooked products the monitoring system allows for more concise tracking of product quality while giving the company and its franchisees a method to streamline costs by more precisely projecting sales and product usage advertising main articles burger king advertising and list of burger king ad programs the burger king crown worn by nick van eede since its foundation in  burger king has employed varied advertising programs both successful and unsuccessful during the s output included its hold the pickles hold the lettuce jingle the inspiration for its current mascot the burger king and several well known and parodied slogans such as have it your way and it takes two hands to handle a whopper burger king introduced the first attack ad in the fast food industry with a preteen sarah michelle gellar in  the television spot which claimed bk burgers were larger and better tasting than competitor mcdonalds so enraged executives at mcdonalds parent company that they sued all parties involved starting in the early s and running through approximately  bk engaged a series of ad agencies that produced many unsuccessful slogans and programs including its biggest advertising flop wheres herb burger king was a pioneer in the advertising practice known as the product tiein with a successful partnership with george lucas lucasfilm ltd to promote the  film star wars in which bk sold a set of glasses featuring the main characters from the movie this promotion was one of the first in the fast food industry and set the pattern that continues to the present bks early success in the field was overshadowed by a  deal between mcdonalds and the walt disney company to promote disneys animated films beginning in the mids and running through the early s in  disney switched from mcdonalds to burger king signing a movie promotional contract which would include such top  films as aladdin  beauty and the beast  the lion king  and toy story  a partnership in association with the pokémon franchise at the height of its popularity in  was tremendously successful for the company with many locations rapidly selling out of the toys and the replacements shortly after the acquisition of burger king by tpg capital lp in  its new ceo brad blum set about turning around the fortunes of the company by initiating an overhaul of its flailing advertising programs one of the first moves by the company was to reinstate its famous have it your way slogan as the corporate motto bk handed the effort off to its new advertising agency miamibased crispin porter  bogusky abbreviated as cpb cpb was known for having a hip subversive tack when creating campaigns for its clients exactly what bk was looking for one of cpb strategies was to revive the burger king character used during bks ss burger king kingdom childrens advertising campaign as a caricatured variation now simply called the king the farcical nature of the burger king centered advertisements inspired an internet meme where the king is edited into unusual situations that are either comical or menacing many times followed with the phrase where is your god now additionally cpb created a series of new characters like the subservient chicken and the faux nu metal band coq roq featured in a series of viral webbased advertisements on sites such as myspace and various bk corporate pages to complement various television and print promotional campaigns one of the more successful promotions that cpb devised was the creation of a series of three advergames for the xbox  created by ukbased blitz games and featuring company celebrity spokesman brooke burke the games sold more than  million copies placing them as one of the top selling games along with another xbox  hit gears of war these ad campaigns coupled with other new promotions and a series of new product introductions drew positive and negative attention to bk and helped tpg and its partners realize about us million in dividends with the lates recession hitting the – demographic targeted by the cpb created ads particularly hard the company saw its market share decline and the company move into the red after the completion of the sale of the company in late  the new ownership group terminated burger kings sevenyear relationship with cpb and hired rival firm mcgarrybowen to create a new campaign with an expanded market reach as part of the new campaign mcgarrybowen terminated the use of the burger king in the companys advertising program in favor of a new program that focused on the food and ingredients in its new

burger king logo the predecessor to burger king was founded in  in jacksonville florida as instaburger king after visiting the mcdonald brothers original store location in san bernardino california the founders and owners keith j kramer and his wifes uncle matthew burns who had purchased the rights to two pieces of equipment called instamachines opened their first restaurants their production model was based on one of the machines they had acquired an oven called the instabroiler this strategy proved to be so successful that they later required all of their franchises to use the device after the company faltered in  it was purchased by its miami florida franchisees james mclamore and david r edgerton they initiated a corporate restructuring of the chain first renaming the company burger king they ran the company as an independent entity for eight years eventually expanding to over  locations in the united states before selling it to the pillsbury company in  pillsburys management tried several times to restructure burger king during the late s and the early s the most prominent change came in  when burger king hired mcdonalds executive donald n smith to help revamp the company in a plan called operation phoenix smith restructured corporate business practices at all levels of the company changes included updated franchise agreements a broader menu and new standardized restaurant designs smith left burger king for pepsico in  shortly before a systemwide decline in sales pillsburys executive vice president of restaurant operations norman e brinker was tasked with turning the brand around and strengthening its position against its main rival mcdonalds one of his initiatives was a new advertising campaign featuring a series of attack ads against its major competitors this campaign started a competitive period between burger king mcdonalds and top burger chains known as the burger wars brinker left burger king in  to take over dallasbased gourmet burger chain chilis smith and brinkers efforts were initially effective but after their respective departures pillsbury relaxed or discarded many of their changes and scaled back on construction of new locations these actions stalled corporate growth and sales declined again eventually resulting in a damaging fiscal slump for burger king and pillsbury poor operation and ineffectual leadership continued to bog down the company for many years pillsbury was eventually acquired by the british entertainment conglomerate grand metropolitan in  initially grand met attempted to bring the chain top profitability under newly minted ceo barry gibbons the changes he initiated during his twoyear tenure were hit or miss successful new product introductions and tieins with the walt disney company were offset by continuing image problems and ineffectual advertising programs additionally gibbons sold off several of the companys assets in attempt to profit from their sale and laid off many of its staff members after gibbons departure a series of ceos each tried to repair the companys brand by changing the menu bringing in new ad agencies and many other changes the parental disregard of the burger king brand continued with grand metropolitans merger with guinness in  when the two organizations formed the holding company diageo eventually the ongoing systematic institutional neglect of the brand through a string of owners damaged the company to the point where major franchises were driven out of business and its total value was significantly decreased diageo eventually decided to divest itself of the moneylosing chain and put the company up for sale in  an example of the  concept interior at a burger king in cork ireland the twentyfirst century saw the company return to independence when it was purchased from diageo by a group of investment firms led by tpg capital for us billion in  the new owners rapidly moved to revitalize and reorganize the company culminating with the company being taken public in  with a highly successful initial public offering the firms strategy for turning the chain around included a new advertising agency and new ad campaigns a revamped menu strategy a series of programs designed to revamp individual stores a new restaurant concept called the bk whopper bar and a new design format called  these changes successfully reenergized the company leading to a score of profitable quarters yet despite the successes of the new owners the effects of the financial crisis of – weakened the companys financial outlooks while those of its immediate competitor mcdonalds grew the falling value of burger king eventually led to tpg and its partners divesting their interest in the chain in a us billion sale to g capital of brazil analysts from financial firms ubs and stifel nicolaus agreed that g would have to invest heavily in the company to help reverse its fortunes after the deal was completed the companys stock was removed from the new york stock exchange ending a fouryear period as a public company the delisting of its stock was designed to help the company repair its fundamental business structures and continue working to close the gap with mcdonalds without having to worry about pleasing shareholders in the united states domestic market the chain has fallen to third place in terms of same store sales behind ohiobased wendys the decline is the result of  consecutive quarters of same store sales decline in august  g announced that it planned to acquire the canadian restaurant and coffee shop chain tim hortons and merge it with burger king with backing from warren buffetts berkshire hathaway the two chains will retain separate operations postmerger with burger king remaining in its miami headquarters a tim hortons representative stated that the proposed merger would allow tim hortons to leverage burger kings resources for international growth the combined company will be the thirdlargest international chain of fast food restaurants the deal lead to a controversy over the practice of tax inversions in which a company decreases the amount of taxes it pays by moving its headquarters to a tax haven a country with lower rates but maintains the majority of their operations in their previous location as a highprofile instance of tax inversion news of the merger was criticized by us politicians who felt that the move would result in a loss of tax revenue to foreign interests and could result in further government pressure against inversions structure and

restaurant in leicester square london united kingdom when burger king corporation began franchising in  it used a regional model where franchisees purchased the right to open stores within a geographic region these franchise agreements granted bkc very little oversight control of its franchisees and resulted in issues of product quality control store image and design and operational procedures during the s structural deficiencies in burger kings franchise system became increasingly problematic for pillsbury a major example was the relationship between burger king and louisianabased franchisee chart house burger kings largest franchisee group at the time with over  locations in the united states the companys owners william and james trotter made several moves to take over or acquire burger king during the s all of which were spurned by pillsbury after the failed attempts to acquire the company the relationship between chart house and burger king soured and eventually devolved into a lawsuit chart house eventually spun off its burger king operations in the early s into a holding company called diversifoods which in turn was acquired by pillsbury in  and absorbed into burger kings operations as part of the franchising reorganization segment of operation phoenix donald n smith initiated a restructuring of future franchising agreements in  under this new franchise agreement new owners were disallowed from living more than one hour from their restaurants – restricting them to smaller individuals or ownership groups and preventing large multistate corporations from owning franchises franchisee were also now prohibited from operating other chains preventing them from diverting funds away from their burger king holdings this new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging burger king corporation as chart house had smith also sought to have bkc be the primary owner of new locations and rent or lease the restaurants to its franchises this policy would allow the company to take over the operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would not conform to the company guidelines and policies by  parent company pillsbury had relaxed many of smiths changes scaled back on the construction of new locations which resulted in stalled growth of the brand neglect of burger king by new owner grand met and its successor diageo further hurt the standing of the brand causing significant financial damage to bk franchises and straining relations between the parties a burger king franchise adapted to operate in the historic district of oaxaca mexico by  and after nearly  years of stagnant growth the state of its franchises was beginning to affect the value of the company one of the franchises most heavily affected by the lack of growth was the nearly store ameriking by  the franchise owner which until this point had been struggling under a nearly us million debt load and been shedding stores across the us was forced to enter chapter  bankruptcy the failure of ameriking deeply affected the value of burger king and put negotiations between diaego and the tpc capitalled group on hold the developments eventually forced diaego to lower the total selling price of the chain by almost  million after the sale newly appointed ceo brad blum initiated a program to help roughly  percent of its franchises including its four largest who were in financial distress bankruptcy or had ceased operations altogether partnering with californiabased trinity capital llc the company established the franchisee financial restructuring initiative a program to address the financial issues facing bks financially distressed franchisees the initiative was designed to assist

price of  million approximately  percent of their original value the new company which started out as core value partners and eventually became heartland foods also purchased  additional stores from

king burger king has been involved in several legal disputes and cases as both plaintiff and defendant in the years since its founding in  depending on the ownership and executive staff at the time of these incidents the companys responses to these challenges have ranged from a conciliatory dialog with its critics and litigants to a more aggressive opposition with questionable tactics and negative consequences the companys response to these various issues has drawn praise as well as accusations of political appeasement from different parties over the years a trademark dispute involving the owners of the identically named burger king in mattoon illinois led to a federal lawsuit the cases outcome helped define the scope of the lanham act and trademark law in the united states an existing

and social agencies and unions and trade groups over various topics these situations have touched on legal and moral concepts such as animal rights corporate responsibility ethics and social justice while the majority of the disputes did not result in lawsuits in many of the cases the situations raised legal questions dealt with legal compliance or resulted in legal remedies such as changes in contractual procedure or binding agreements between parties the resolutions to these legal matters have often altered the way the company interacts and negotiates contracts with its suppliers and franchisees or how it does business with the public further controversies have occurred during the companys expansion in the middle east the opening of a burger king location in maaleh adumim an israeli settlement in the israelioccupied palestinian territories led to a breach of contract dispute between burger king and its israeli franchise due to the hotly contested international dispute

groups on multiple continents over the application of and adherence to international law the case eventually elicited reactions from the members of the nation arab league the islamic countries within the league made a joint threat to the company of legal sanctions including the revocation of burger kings business licenses within the member states territories a related issue involving members of the islamic faith over the interpretation of the muslim version of canon law shariah regarding the promotional artwork on a dessert package in the united kingdom raised issues of cultural sensitivity

hamburgers french fries soft drinks milkshakes and desserts after being acquired by its miami florida franchisees and renamed to its current moniker in  bk began expanding the breadth of its menu by adding the whopper sandwich in  this quarterpound  oz  g hamburger was created by burger kings new owners james mclamore and david edgerton as a way to differentiate bk from other burger outlets at the time since its inception the whopper has become synonymous with burger king and has become the focus of much of its advertising the company even named its new kioskstyle restaurants whopper bars the menu component of donald smiths operation phoenix was initiated in  and led to the addition of the burger king specialty sandwich line in  the new product line significantly expanded the breadth of the bk menu with many nonhamburger sandwiches including new chicken and fish offerings the new specialty sandwich line was one of the first attempts to target a specific demographic in this case adults – who would be willing to spend more on a higher quality product one of smiths other significant contributions to the menu was the addition of a breakfast product line which until this time was not a market burger king had entered besides the addition of the croissanwich in  the breakfast menu remained almost identical to the mcdonalds offerings until a menu revamp in  this expansion introduced bks am express product line which added new products such as french toast sticks and minimuffins as the company expanded both inside and outside the us it introduced localized versions of its products that conform to regional tastes and cultural or religious beliefs international variations add ingredients such as teriyaki or beetroot and fried egg to the whopper beer in germany italy and spain and halal or kosher products in the middle east and israel to generate additional sales bk will occasionally introduce limited time offers ltos that are versions of its core products or new products intended for either long or short term sales items such as the texas double whopper and various sandwiches made with mushrooms and swiss cheese have been rotated in and out of its menu for

wendys burger king added a multitiered value menu in  with items priced at ¢ us and  the additions part of then ceo james adamsons back to basics program also called operation phoenix were an attempt to add not only a value menu but also a line of value meals the tiered menu was replaced with a more standard value menu in  while the value meals were separated into their own menu segment this value menu featured seven products whopper jr fivepiece chicken tenders a bacon cheeseburger mediumsized french fries medium soft drink medium onion rings and small shake in  and  bk revamped its value menu adding and removing several different products such as chili and its rodeo cheeseburger many of these items have since been discontinued modified or relegated to a regional menu option to better appeal to a more adult palate and demographic bk introduced several new products to its menu in  including several new or revamped chicken products a new salad line and its bk joe brand of coffee some of the new products including its enormous omelet sandwich line and the bk stacker line brought negative attention due to the large portion size and amounts of unhealthy fats and transfats many of these products featured higher quality ingredients like whole chicken breast angus beef and natural cheeses such as cheddar and pepper jack again not all these products such as the bk baguette line have met corporate sales expectations with the purchase of the company in  g began a program to restructure its menu designed to move away from the maleoriented menu that had dominated under the

mclamore and edgerton took over the company besides dropping the insta prefix they switched to an improved unit which they called a flame broiler designed by the two and featuring stationary burners that cooked the meat on a moving chain the unit broke down less often while maintaining a similar cooking rate the company would stay with that format for the next  years until burger king began developing a variable speed broiler that could handle multiple items with different cooking rates and times these new units began testing in  and eventually evolved into the two models the company deployed systemwide in – accompanying these new broilers was new foodholding equipment accompanied with a computerbased product monitoring system for its cooked products the monitoring system allows

famous have it your way slogan as the corporate motto bk handed the effort off to its new advertising agency miamibased crispin porter  bogusky abbreviated as cpb cpb was known for having a hip subversive tack when creating campaigns for its clients exactly what bk was looking for one of cpb strategies was to revive the burger king character used during bks ss burger king kingdom childrens

unusual situations that are either comical or menacing many times followed with the phrase where is your god now additionally cpb created a series of new characters like the subservient chicken and the faux nu metal band coq roq featured in a series of viral webbased advertisements on sites such as myspace and various bk corporate pages to complement various television and print promotional campaigns one of the more successful promotions that cpb devised was the creation of a series of three advergames for the xbox  created by ukbased blitz games and featuring company celebrity spokesman

series of new product introductions drew positive and negative attention to bk and helped tpg and its partners realize about us million in dividends with the lates recession hitting the – demographic

burger king they ran the company as an independent entity for eight years eventually expanding to over  locations in the united states before selling it to the pillsbury company in  pillsburys management tried several times to restructure burger king during the late s and the early s the most prominent change came in  when burger king hired mcdonalds executive donald n smith to help revamp the company in a plan called operation phoenix smith restructured corporate business practices at all levels of the company changes included updated franchise agreements a broader menu and new standardized restaurant designs smith left burger king for pepsico in  shortly before a systemwide decline in sales pillsburys executive vice president of restaurant operations norman e brinker was tasked with turning the brand around and strengthening its position against its main rival mcdonalds one of his initiatives was a new advertising campaign featuring a series of attack ads against its major competitors this campaign started a competitive period between burger king mcdonalds and top burger chains known as the burger wars brinker left burger king in  to take over dallasbased gourmet burger chain chilis smith and brinkers efforts were initially effective but after their respective departures pillsbury relaxed or discarded many of their changes and scaled back on construction of new locations these actions stalled corporate growth and sales declined again eventually resulting in a damaging fiscal slump for burger king and pillsbury poor operation and ineffectual leadership continued to bog down the company for many years pillsbury was eventually acquired by the british entertainment conglomerate grand metropolitan in  initially grand met attempted to bring the chain top profitability under newly minted ceo barry gibbons the changes he initiated during his twoyear tenure were hit or miss successful new product introductions and tieins with the walt disney company were offset by continuing image problems and ineffectual advertising programs additionally gibbons sold off several of the companys assets in attempt to profit from their sale and laid off many of its staff members after gibbons departure a series of ceos each tried to repair the companys brand by changing the menu bringing in new ad agencies and many other changes the parental disregard of the burger king brand continued with grand metropolitans merger with guinness in  when the two organizations formed the holding company diageo eventually the ongoing systematic institutional neglect of the brand through a string of owners damaged the company to the point where major franchises were driven out of business and its total value was significantly decreased diageo eventually decided to divest itself of the moneylosing chain and put the company up for sale in  an example of the  concept interior at a burger king in cork ireland the twentyfirst century saw the company return to

sales behind ohiobased wendys the decline is the result of  consecutive quarters of same store sales decline in august  g announced that it planned to acquire the canadian restaurant and coffee shop chain tim hortons and merge it with burger king with backing from warren buffetts berkshire hathaway the two chains will retain separate operations postmerger with burger king remaining in its miami headquarters a tim hortons representative stated that the proposed merger would allow tim hortons to leverage burger kings resources for international growth the combined company will be the thirdlargest international chain of fast food restaurants the deal lead to a controversy over the practice of tax inversions in which a company decreases the amount of taxes it pays by moving its headquarters to a tax haven a country with lower rates but maintains the majority of their operations in their previous location as a highprofile instance of tax inversion news of the merger was

restaurant in leicester square london united kingdom when burger king corporation began franchising in  it used a regional model where franchisees purchased the right to open stores within a geographic region these franchise agreements granted bkc very little oversight control of its franchisees and resulted in issues of product quality control store image and design and operational procedures during the s structural deficiencies in burger kings franchise system became increasingly problematic for pillsbury a major example was the relationship between burger king and louisianabased franchisee chart house burger kings largest franchisee group at the time with over  locations in the united states the companys owners william and james trotter made several moves to take over or acquire burger king during the s all of which were spurned by pillsbury after the failed attempts to acquire the company the relationship between chart house and burger king soured and eventually devolved into a lawsuit chart house eventually spun off its burger king operations in the early s into a holding company called diversifoods which in turn was acquired by pillsbury in  and absorbed into burger kings operations as part of the franchising reorganization segment of operation phoenix donald n smith initiated a restructuring of future franchising agreements in  under this new franchise agreement new owners were disallowed from living more than one hour from their restaurants – restricting them to smaller individuals or ownership groups and preventing large multistate corporations from owning franchises franchisee were also now prohibited from operating other chains preventing them from diverting funds away from their burger king holdings this new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging burger king corporation as chart house had smith also sought to have bkc be the primary owner of new locations and rent or lease the restaurants to its franchises this policy would allow the company to take over the operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would not conform to the company guidelines and policies by  parent company pillsbury had relaxed many of smiths changes scaled back on the construction of new locations which resulted in stalled growth of the brand neglect

of the bk menu with many nonhamburger sandwiches including new chicken and fish offerings the new specialty sandwich line was one of the first attempts to target a specific demographic in this case adults – who would be willing to spend more on a higher quality product one of smiths other significant contributions to the menu was the addition of a breakfast product line which until this time was

mclamore and edgerton took over the company besides dropping the insta prefix they switched to an improved unit which they called a flame broiler designed by the two and featuring stationary burners that cooked the meat on a moving chain the unit broke down less often while maintaining a similar cooking rate the company would stay with that format for the next  years until burger king began developing a variable speed broiler that could handle multiple items with different cooking rates and times these new units began testing in  and eventually evolved into the two models the company

the founders and owners keith j kramer and his wifes uncle matthew burns who had purchased the rights to two pieces of equipment called instamachines opened their first restaurants their production model was based on one of the machines they had acquired an oven called the instabroiler this strategy proved to be so successful that they later required all of their franchises to use the device after the company faltered in  it was purchased by its miami florida franchisees james mclamore and david r edgerton they initiated a corporate restructuring of the chain first renaming the company burger king they ran the company as an independent entity for eight years eventually expanding to over  locations in the united states before selling it to the pillsbury company in  pillsburys

the company in a plan called operation phoenix smith restructured corporate business practices at all levels of the company changes included updated franchise agreements a broader menu and new standardized restaurant designs smith left burger king for pepsico in  shortly before a systemwide decline in sales pillsburys executive vice president of restaurant operations norman e brinker was tasked with turning the brand around and strengthening its position against its main rival mcdonalds one of his initiatives was a new advertising campaign featuring a series of attack ads against its major competitors this campaign started a competitive period between burger king mcdonalds and top burger chains known as the burger wars brinker left burger king in  to take over dallasbased gourmet burger chain chilis smith and brinkers efforts were initially effective but after their respective departures pillsbury relaxed or discarded many of their changes and scaled back on construction of new locations these actions stalled corporate growth and sales declined again eventually resulting in a damaging fiscal slump for burger king and pillsbury poor operation and ineffectual leadership

restaurant in leicester square london united kingdom when burger king corporation began franchising in  it used a regional model where franchisees purchased the right to open stores within a geographic region these franchise agreements granted bkc very little oversight control of its franchisees and resulted in issues of product quality control store image and design and operational procedures during the s structural deficiencies in burger kings franchise system became increasingly problematic for pillsbury a major example was the relationship between burger king and louisianabased franchisee chart house burger kings largest franchisee group at the time with over  locations in the united states the companys owners william and james trotter made several moves to take over or acquire burger king during the s all of which were spurned by pillsbury after the failed attempts to acquire the company the relationship between chart house and burger king soured and eventually devolved into a lawsuit chart house eventually spun off its burger king operations in the early s into a holding company called diversifoods which in turn was acquired by pillsbury in  and absorbed into burger kings operations as part of the franchising reorganization segment of operation phoenix donald n smith initiated a restructuring of future franchising agreements in  under this new franchise agreement new owners were disallowed from living more than one hour from their restaurants – restricting them to smaller individuals or ownership groups and preventing large multistate corporations from owning franchises franchisee were also now prohibited from operating other chains preventing them from diverting funds away from their burger king holdings this new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging burger king corporation as chart house had smith also sought to have bkc be the primary owner of new locations and rent or lease the restaurants to its franchises this policy would allow the company to take over the operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would not conform to the company guidelines and policies by  parent company pillsbury had relaxed many of smiths changes scaled back on the construction of new locations which resulted in stalled growth of the brand neglect

a burger king franchise adapted to operate in the historic district of oaxaca mexico by  and after nearly  years of stagnant growth the state of its franchises was beginning to affect the value of the company one of the franchises most heavily affected by the lack of growth was the nearly store ameriking by  the franchise owner which until this point had been struggling under a nearly us million debt load and been shedding stores across the us was forced to enter chapter  bankruptcy the failure of ameriking deeply affected the value of burger king and put negotiations between diaego and the tpc capitalled group on hold the developments eventually forced diaego to lower the total selling price of the chain by almost  million after the sale newly appointed ceo brad blum initiated a program to help roughly  percent of its franchises including its four largest who were in financial distress bankruptcy or had ceased operations altogether partnering with californiabased trinity capital llc the company established the franchisee financial restructuring initiative a program to address the financial issues facing bks financially distressed franchisees the initiative was designed to assist

consequences the companys response to these various issues has drawn praise as well as accusations of political appeasement from different parties over the years a trademark dispute involving the owners of the identically named burger king in mattoon illinois led to a federal lawsuit the cases outcome helped define the scope of the lanham act and trademark law in the united states an existing

franchisees or how it does business with the public further controversies have occurred during the companys expansion in the middle east the opening of a burger king location in maaleh adumim an israeli settlement in the israelioccupied palestinian territories led to a breach of contract dispute between burger king and its israeli franchise due to the hotly contested international dispute

the league made a joint threat to the company of legal sanctions including the revocation of burger kings business licenses within the member states territories a related issue involving members of the islamic faith over the interpretation of the muslim version of canon law shariah regarding the promotional artwork on a dessert package in the united kingdom raised issues of cultural sensitivity

adding the whopper sandwich in  this quarterpound  oz  g hamburger was created by burger kings new owners james mclamore and david edgerton as a way to differentiate bk from other burger outlets at the time since its inception the whopper has become synonymous with burger king and has become the focus of much of its advertising the company even named its new kioskstyle restaurants whopper bars the menu component of donald smiths operation phoenix was initiated in  and led to the addition of the burger king specialty sandwich line in  the new product line significantly expanded the breadth of the bk menu with many nonhamburger sandwiches including new chicken and fish offerings the new specialty sandwich line was one of the first attempts to target a specific demographic in this case adults – who would be willing to spend more on a higher quality product one of smiths other significant contributions to the menu was the addition of a breakfast product line which until this time was not a market burger king had entered besides the addition of the croissanwich in  the breakfast menu remained almost identical to the mcdonalds offerings until a menu revamp in  this expansion

mclamore and edgerton took over the company besides dropping the insta prefix they switched to an improved unit which they called a flame broiler designed by the two and featuring stationary burners that cooked the meat on a moving chain the unit broke down less often while maintaining a similar cooking rate the company would stay with that format for the next  years until burger king began developing a variable speed broiler that could handle multiple items with different cooking rates and times these new units began testing in  and eventually evolved into the two models the company deployed systemwide in – accompanying these new broilers was new foodholding equipment accompanied with a computerbased product monitoring system for its cooked products the monitoring system allows

subversive tack when creating campaigns for its clients exactly what bk was looking for one of cpb strategies was to revive the burger king character used during bks ss burger king kingdom childrens

canadianbased doughnut chain tim hortons under the auspices of a new canadianbased parent company named restaurant brands international the s were the golden age of the companys advertising but beginning in the earlys burger king advertising began losing focus a series of less successful advertising campaigns created by a procession of advertising agencies continued for the next two decades in  burger king hired the miamibased advertising agency crispin porter  bogusky cpb who completely reorganized its advertising with a series of new campaigns centered on a redesigned burger king character nicknamed the king accompanied by a new online presence while highly successful some of cpbs commercials were derided for perceived sexism or cultural insensitivity burger kings new owner g capital later terminated the relationship with cpb in  and moved its advertising to mcgarrybowen to begin a new productoriented campaign with expanded demographic targeting burger kings menu has expanded from a basic offering of burgers french fries sodas and milkshakes to a larger and more diverse set of products in  the whopper became the first major addition to the menu and it has become burger kings signature product since conversely bk has introduced many products which failed to catch hold in the marketplace some of these failures in the united states have seen success in foreign markets where bk has also tailored its menu for regional tastes from  to  burger king aggressively targeted the – male demographic with larger products that often carried correspondingly large amounts of unhealthy fats and transfats this tactic would eventually damage the companys financial underpinnings and cast a negative pall on its earnings beginning in  the company began to move away from its

historically used several variations of franchising to expand its operations the manner in which the company licenses its franchisees varies depending on the region with some regional franchises known as master franchises responsible for selling franchise sublicenses on the companys behalf burger kings relationship with its franchises has not always been harmonious occasional spats between the two

burger king logo the predecessor to burger king was founded in  in jacksonville florida as instaburger king after visiting the mcdonald brothers original store location in san bernardino california the founders and owners keith j kramer and his wifes uncle matthew burns who had purchased the rights to two pieces of equipment called instamachines opened their first restaurants their production model was based on one of the machines they had acquired an oven called the instabroiler this strategy proved to be so successful that they later required all of their franchises to use the device after the company faltered in  it was purchased by its miami florida franchisees james mclamore and david r edgerton they initiated a corporate restructuring of the chain first renaming the company burger king they ran the company as an independent entity for eight years eventually expanding to over  locations in the united states before selling it to the pillsbury company in  pillsburys management tried several times to restructure burger king during the late s and the early s the most prominent change came in  when burger king hired mcdonalds executive donald n smith to help revamp the company in a plan called operation phoenix smith restructured corporate business practices at all levels of the company changes included updated franchise agreements a broader menu and new standardized restaurant designs smith left burger king for pepsico in  shortly before a systemwide decline in sales pillsburys executive vice president of restaurant operations norman e brinker was tasked with turning the brand around and strengthening its position against its main rival mcdonalds one of his initiatives was a new advertising campaign featuring a series of attack ads against its major competitors this campaign started a competitive period between burger king mcdonalds and top burger chains known as the burger wars brinker left burger king in  to take over dallasbased gourmet burger chain chilis smith and brinkers efforts were initially effective but after their respective departures pillsbury relaxed or discarded many of their changes and scaled back on construction of new locations these actions stalled corporate growth and sales declined again eventually resulting in a damaging fiscal slump for burger king and pillsbury poor operation and ineffectual leadership continued to bog down the company for many years pillsbury was eventually acquired by the british entertainment conglomerate grand metropolitan in  initially grand met attempted to bring the chain top profitability under newly minted ceo barry gibbons the changes he initiated during his twoyear tenure were hit or miss successful new product introductions and tieins with the walt disney company were offset by continuing image problems and ineffectual advertising programs additionally gibbons sold off several of the companys assets in attempt to profit from their sale and laid off many of its staff members after gibbons departure a series of ceos each tried to repair the companys brand by changing the menu bringing in new ad agencies and many other changes the parental disregard of the burger king brand continued with grand metropolitans merger with guinness in  when the two organizations formed the holding company diageo eventually the ongoing systematic institutional neglect of the brand through a string of owners damaged the company to the point where major franchises were driven out of business and its total value was significantly decreased diageo eventually decided to divest itself of the moneylosing chain and put the company up for sale in  an example of the  concept interior at a burger king in cork ireland the twentyfirst century saw the company return to independence when it was purchased from diageo by a group of investment firms led by tpg capital for us billion in  the new owners rapidly moved to revitalize and reorganize the company culminating with the company being taken public in  with a highly successful initial public offering the firms strategy for turning the chain around included a new advertising agency and new ad campaigns a revamped menu strategy a series of programs designed to revamp individual stores a new restaurant concept called the bk whopper bar and a new design format called  these changes successfully reenergized the company leading to a score of profitable quarters yet despite the successes of the new owners the effects of the financial crisis of – weakened the companys financial outlooks while those of its immediate competitor mcdonalds grew the falling value of burger king eventually led to tpg and its partners divesting their interest in the chain in a us billion sale to g capital of brazil analysts from financial firms ubs and stifel nicolaus agreed that g would have to invest heavily in the company to help reverse its fortunes after the deal was completed the companys stock was removed from the new york stock exchange ending a fouryear period as a public company the delisting of its stock was designed to help the company repair its fundamental business structures and continue working to close the gap with mcdonalds without having to worry about pleasing shareholders in the united states domestic market the chain has fallen to third place in terms of same store sales behind ohiobased wendys the decline is the result of  consecutive quarters of same store sales decline in august  g announced that it planned to acquire the canadian restaurant and coffee shop chain tim hortons and merge it with burger king with backing from warren buffetts berkshire hathaway the two chains will retain separate operations postmerger with burger king remaining in its miami headquarters a tim hortons representative stated that the proposed merger would allow tim hortons to leverage burger kings resources for international growth the combined company will be the thirdlargest international chain of fast food restaurants the deal lead to a controversy over the practice of tax inversions in which a company decreases the amount of taxes it pays by moving its headquarters to a tax haven a country with lower rates but maintains the majority of their operations in their previous location as a highprofile instance of tax inversion news of the merger was criticized by us politicians who felt that the move would result in a loss of tax revenue to foreign interests and could result in further government pressure against inversions structure and

restaurant in leicester square london united kingdom when burger king corporation began franchising in  it used a regional model where franchisees purchased the right to open stores within a geographic region these franchise agreements granted bkc very little oversight control of its franchisees and resulted in issues of product quality control store image and design and operational procedures during the s structural deficiencies in burger kings franchise system became increasingly problematic for pillsbury a major example was the relationship between burger king and louisianabased franchisee chart house burger kings largest franchisee group at the time with over  locations in the united states the companys owners william and james trotter made several moves to take over or acquire burger king during the s all of which were spurned by pillsbury after the failed attempts to acquire the company the relationship between chart house and burger king soured and eventually devolved into a lawsuit chart house eventually spun off its burger king operations in the early s into a holding company called diversifoods which in turn was acquired by pillsbury in  and absorbed into burger kings operations as part of the franchising reorganization segment of operation phoenix donald n smith initiated a restructuring of future franchising agreements in  under this new franchise agreement new owners were disallowed from living more than one hour from their restaurants – restricting them to smaller individuals or ownership groups and preventing large multistate corporations from owning franchises franchisee were also now prohibited from operating other chains preventing them from diverting funds away from their burger king holdings this new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging burger king corporation as chart house had smith also sought to have bkc be the primary owner of new locations and rent or lease the restaurants to its franchises this policy would allow the company to take over the operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would not conform to the company guidelines and policies by  parent company pillsbury had relaxed many of smiths changes scaled back on the construction of new locations which resulted in stalled growth of the brand neglect of burger king by new owner grand met and its successor diageo further hurt the standing of the brand causing significant financial damage to bk franchises and straining relations between the parties a burger king franchise adapted to operate in the historic district of oaxaca mexico by  and after nearly  years of stagnant growth the state of its franchises was beginning to affect the value of the company one of the franchises most heavily affected by the lack of growth was the nearly store ameriking by  the franchise owner which until this point had been struggling under a nearly us million debt load and been shedding stores across the us was forced to enter chapter  bankruptcy the failure of ameriking deeply affected the value of burger king and put negotiations between diaego and the tpc capitalled group on hold the developments eventually forced diaego to lower the total selling price of the chain by almost  million after the sale newly appointed ceo brad blum initiated a program to help roughly  percent of its franchises including its four largest who were in financial distress bankruptcy or had ceased operations altogether partnering with californiabased trinity capital llc the company established the franchisee financial restructuring initiative a program to address the financial issues facing bks financially distressed franchisees the initiative was designed to assist franchisees in restructuring their businesses to meet financial obligations focus on restaurant operational excellence reinvest in their operations and return to profitability individual franchisees took advantage of the ameriking failure one of bks regional owners miamibased al cabrera purchased  stores located primarily in the chicago and the upper midwest region from the failed company for a price of  million approximately  percent of their original value the new company which started out as core value partners and eventually became heartland foods also purchased  additional stores from distressed owners and revamped them the resulting purchases made cabrera the largest minority franchisee of burger king and heartland one of the companys top franchises by  the company was valued at over  million and was sold to new york–based gso capital partners other purchasers included a threeway group of nfl athletes kevin faulk marcus allen and michael strahan who collectively purchased  stores in the cities of norfolk and richmond virginia and cincinnatibased franchisee dave devoy who purchased  ameriking stores after investing in new decor equipment and staff retraining many of the formerly failing stores have shown growth approaching  percent as part of gs restructuring plan the company decided to divest itself of its corporate owned locations by refranchising them to private owners and become a  franchised operation by the end of  the project which began in april  saw the company divest corporateowned locations in florida canada spain germany and other regions the move

australia is the only country in which burger king does not operate under its own name when the company set about establishing operations down under in  it found that its business name was already trademarked by a takeaway food shop in adelaide as a result burger king provided the australian franchisee jack cowin with a list of possible alternative names derived from preexisting trademarks already registered by burger king and its then corporate parent pillsbury that could be used to name the australian restaurants cowin selected the hungry jack brand name one of pillsburys us pancake mixture products and slightly changed the name to a possessive form by adding an apostrophe s forming the new name hungry jacks after the expiration of the trademark in the late s burger king

burger king mattoon illinois and burger king alberta the burger king restaurant in mattoon illinois originally owned by the hoots family this location was one subject of major litigation by burger king burger king has been involved in several legal disputes and cases as both plaintiff and defendant in the years since its founding in  depending on the ownership and executive staff at the time of these incidents the companys responses to these challenges have ranged from a conciliatory dialog with its critics and litigants to a more aggressive opposition with questionable tactics and negative consequences the companys response to these various issues has drawn praise as well as accusations of political appeasement from different parties over the years a trademark dispute involving the owners of the identically named burger king in mattoon illinois led to a federal lawsuit the cases outcome helped define the scope of the lanham act and trademark law in the united states an existing trademark held by a shop of the same name in south australia forced the company to change its name in australia while another state trademark in texas forced the company to abandon its signature product the whopper in several counties around san antonio the company was only able to enter northern alberta in canada in  after it paid the founders of another chain named burger king legal decisions from other suits have set contractual law precedents in regards to longarm statutes the limitations of franchise agreements and ethical business practices many of these decisions have helped define general business dealings that continue to shape the entire marketplace controversies and disputes have arisen with groups such as people for the ethical treatment of animals peta governmental and social agencies and unions and trade groups over various topics these situations have touched on legal and moral concepts such as animal rights corporate responsibility ethics and social justice while the majority of the disputes did not result in lawsuits in many of the cases the situations raised legal questions dealt with legal compliance or resulted in legal remedies such as changes in contractual procedure or binding agreements between parties the resolutions to these legal matters have often altered the way the company interacts and negotiates contracts with its suppliers and franchisees or how it does business with the public further controversies have occurred during the companys expansion in the middle east the opening of a burger king location in maaleh adumim an israeli settlement in the israelioccupied palestinian territories led to a breach of contract dispute between burger king and its israeli franchise due to the hotly contested international dispute over the legality of israeli settlements in the palestinian territories in accordance to international law the controversy eventually erupted into a geopolitical dispute involving muslim and jewish groups on multiple continents over the application of and adherence to international law the case eventually elicited reactions from the members of the nation arab league the islamic countries within the league made a joint threat to the company of legal sanctions including the revocation of burger kings business licenses within the member states territories a related issue involving members of the islamic faith over the interpretation of the muslim version of canon law shariah regarding the promotional artwork on a dessert package in the united kingdom raised issues of cultural sensitivity and with the former example posed a larger question about the lengths that companies must go to to ensure the smooth operation of their businesses in the communities they serve charitable

and list of burger king products the whopper sandwich burger kings signature product when the predecessor of burger king first opened in jacksonville in  its menu consisted predominantly of basic hamburgers french fries soft drinks milkshakes and desserts after being acquired by its miami florida franchisees and renamed to its current moniker in  bk began expanding the breadth of its menu by adding the whopper sandwich in  this quarterpound  oz  g hamburger was created by burger kings new owners james mclamore and david edgerton as a way to differentiate bk from other burger outlets at the time since its inception the whopper has become synonymous with burger king and has become the focus of much of its advertising the company even named its new kioskstyle restaurants whopper bars the menu component of donald smiths operation phoenix was initiated in  and led to the addition of the burger king specialty sandwich line in  the new product line significantly expanded the breadth of the bk menu with many nonhamburger sandwiches including new chicken and fish offerings the new specialty sandwich line was one of the first attempts to target a specific demographic in this case adults – who would be willing to spend more on a higher quality product one of smiths other significant contributions to the menu was the addition of a breakfast product line which until this time was not a market burger king had entered besides the addition of the croissanwich in  the breakfast menu remained almost identical to the mcdonalds offerings until a menu revamp in  this expansion introduced bks am express product line which added new products such as french toast sticks and minimuffins as the company expanded both inside and outside the us it introduced localized versions of its products that conform to regional tastes and cultural or religious beliefs international variations add ingredients such as teriyaki or beetroot and fried egg to the whopper beer in germany italy and spain and halal or kosher products in the middle east and israel to generate additional sales bk will occasionally introduce limited time offers ltos that are versions of its core products or new products intended for either long or short term sales items such as the texas double whopper and various sandwiches made with mushrooms and swiss cheese have been rotated in and out of its menu for several years while products such as its  meatloaf specialty sandwich offering and accompanying limited table service along with special dinner platters failed to generate interest and were discontinued a meal including small french fries a whopper jr a drink and packets of heinz ketchup in order to appeal to as many demographic groups as possible and better compete with its competitor wendys burger king added a multitiered value menu in  with items priced at ¢ us and  the additions part of then ceo james adamsons back to basics program also called operation phoenix were an attempt to add not only a value menu but also a line of value meals the tiered menu was replaced with a more standard value menu in  while the value meals were separated into their own menu segment this value menu featured seven products whopper jr fivepiece chicken tenders a bacon cheeseburger mediumsized french fries medium soft drink medium onion rings and small shake in  and  bk revamped its value menu adding and removing several different products such as chili and its rodeo cheeseburger many of these items have since been discontinued modified or relegated to a regional menu option to better appeal to a more adult palate and demographic bk introduced several new products to its menu in  including several new or revamped chicken products a new salad line and its bk joe brand of coffee some of the new products including its enormous omelet sandwich line and the bk stacker line brought negative attention due to the large portion size and amounts of unhealthy fats and transfats many of these products featured higher quality ingredients like whole chicken breast angus beef and natural cheeses such as cheddar and pepper jack again not all these products such as the bk baguette line have met corporate sales expectations with the purchase of the company in  g began a program to restructure its menu designed to move away from the maleoriented menu that had dominated under the previous ownership the first major item to be introduced was a reformulation of its bk chicken tenders product in march  over the next few months approximately  new products were researched and developed while others were reformulated including its chefs choice burger eventually pruned down to  items burger king began deploying the items in the united states throughout – with the official roll out beginning april  the changes included new ice cream products smoothies frappés and chicken strips the whopper was the most prominently reformulated product in this round of introductions with

described as a small step by advocates for stopping all antibiotic use in livestock equipment food being prepared in a burger king kitchen in italy like its menu the equipment the company cooks its hamburgers with has also evolved as the company expanded the burgers have always been broiled mechanically the original unit called an instabroiler was one of two pieces of equipment the founders of instaburger king purchased before opening their new restaurant the instabroiler worked by cooking  burger patties in a wire basket allowing the patties to be cooked from both sides simultaneously when mclamore and edgerton took over the company besides dropping the insta prefix they switched to an improved unit which they called a flame broiler designed by the two and featuring stationary burners that cooked the meat on a moving chain the unit broke down less often while maintaining a similar cooking rate the company would stay with that format for the next  years until burger king began developing a variable speed broiler that could handle multiple items with different cooking rates and times these new units began testing in  and eventually evolved into the two models the company deployed systemwide in – accompanying these new broilers was new foodholding equipment accompanied with a computerbased product monitoring system for its cooked products the monitoring system allows for more concise tracking of product quality while giving the company and its franchisees a method to streamline costs by more precisely projecting sales and product usage advertising main articles

have it your way and it takes two hands to handle a whopper burger king introduced the first attack ad in the fast food industry with a preteen sarah michelle gellar in  the television spot which claimed bk burgers were larger and better tasting than competitor mcdonalds so enraged executives at mcdonalds parent company that they sued all parties involved starting in the early s and running through approximately  bk engaged a series of ad agencies that produced many unsuccessful slogans and programs including its biggest advertising flop wheres herb burger king was a pioneer in the advertising practice known as the product tiein with a successful partnership with george lucas lucasfilm ltd to promote the  film star wars in which bk sold a set of glasses featuring the main characters from the movie this promotion was one of the first in the fast food industry and set the pattern that continues to the present bks early success in the field was overshadowed by a  deal between mcdonalds and the walt disney company to promote disneys animated films beginning in the mids and running through the early s in  disney switched from mcdonalds to burger king signing a movie promotional contract which would include such top  films as aladdin  beauty and the beast  the lion king  and toy story  a partnership in association with the pokémon franchise at the height of its popularity in  was tremendously successful for the company with many locations rapidly selling out of the toys and the replacements shortly after the acquisition of burger king by tpg capital lp in  its new ceo brad blum set about turning around the fortunes of the company by initiating an overhaul of its flailing advertising programs one of the first moves by the company was to reinstate its famous have it your way slogan as the corporate motto bk handed the effort off to its new advertising agency miamibased crispin porter  bogusky abbreviated as cpb cpb was known for having a hip subversive tack when creating campaigns for its clients exactly what bk was looking for one of cpb strategies was to revive the burger king character used during bks ss burger king kingdom childrens advertising campaign as a caricatured variation now simply called the king the farcical nature of the burger king centered advertisements inspired an internet meme where the king is edited into unusual situations that are either comical or menacing many times followed with the phrase where is your god now additionally cpb created a series of new characters like the subservient chicken and the faux nu metal band coq roq featured in a series of viral webbased advertisements on sites such as myspace and various bk corporate pages to complement various television and print promotional campaigns one of the more successful promotions that cpb devised was the creation of a series of three advergames for the xbox  created by ukbased blitz games and featuring company celebrity spokesman brooke burke the games sold more than  million copies placing them as one of the top selling games along with another xbox  hit gears of war these ad campaigns coupled with other new promotions and a series of new product introductions drew positive and negative attention to bk and helped tpg and its partners realize about us million in dividends with the lates recession hitting the – demographic targeted by the cpb created ads particularly hard the company saw its market share decline and the company move into the red after the completion of the sale of the company in late  the new ownership group terminated burger kings sevenyear relationship with cpb and hired rival firm mcgarrybowen to create a new campaign with an expanded market reach as part of the new campaign mcgarrybowen
