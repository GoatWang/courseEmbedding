after perfection in every note every word that makes the competition look as if it’s not trying hard enough with sondheim life isn’t reducible to boy meets girl or phantom falls for opera starlet with musicals such as a little night music follies and sweeney todd he tackles the big questions who we are how we cope with the business of being alive confusion angst regret ambivalence and the keenest human yearnings are his stock‑in‑trade related articles into the woods new trailer  nov  the  worst musicals of all time  feb  lion king named highestgrossing production of all time  sep  how into the woods conquered disneys fear of the dark  jan  he has won eight tony awards more than any other composer eight grammy awards a pulitzer prize too the world’s most successful producer of musicals cameron mackintosh has described him as “possibly the greatest lyricist ever” in a sense we’re still only coming to grips with his genius despite all this he seems curiously downbeat about the cultural impact of his work “how much effect does the theatre have on life” he asks “in the twenties theatre had an effect on public thinking i think today by the time a show gets on stage the idea has already passed theatre is now a cottage industry and a cottage entertainment – it doesn’t have much influence” still he keeps making it he confirms that he’s now working on an asyetuntitled show with the american playwright david ives that will combine the storylines of two classic surrealist films by luis buñuel the exterminating angel  and the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie  the latter famously centres on the abortive attempts by a group of friends to go out to dinner in the former guests at a swish dinner party find themselves mysteriously trapped in the music room after supper “it’s a notion i’ve had for a long time to take those two films and blend them together into some kind of musical piece because they have a similar plot” he explains “it was prompted by something somebody said which was that one of the major forms of entertainment these days is eating out i thought that was a funny and sharp statement – and i think a correct one” he hopes the project will see the light of day but the frequent revivals of his work around the world ensure that sondheim fans are not going to be deprived of material in the meantime in the spring emma thompson and bryn terfel will bring his sweeney todd to the stage of the eno but before that january will see the release of the hollywood film version of into the woods sondheim and james lapine’s dazzlingly inventive interweaving and deconstruction of familiar fairy tales the disney studios production bodes well on multiple fronts even if sondheim having seen an early cut will only venture that he likes what he has seen so far its director is rob marshall who won an oscar for his film adaptation of chicago and the stellar cast includes meryl streep johnny depp so memorable as the lead in the big screen incarnation of sweeney todd and james corden meryl streep plays the witch in sondheims movie musical into the woods photo disney throughout our conversation sondheim sounds remarkably peppy and still fiercely intelligent yet one of the frustrations – and fascinations – of talking to him is his reluctance to tally what he has produced with what he has experienced he bats away an inquiry as to why misfits and loners crop up so much in his work not an unexpected one given that he spent much of his life romantically unattached wrestled somewhat with his homosexuality and first found love only in his s “from oedipus through hamlet that’s the stuff of drama” he says “it has nothing to do with me” it would take far more getting to know him too to probe his notoriously difficult relationship with his mother “foxy” a fashion designer who became emotionally abusive after her husband herbert a new york dress manufacturer left the marriage when sondheim was  as meryle secrest’s  biography chillingly records his mother once sent him a letter that bore the words “the only regret i have in life is giving you birth” however when they moved to bucks county pennsylvania she introduced him to a hugely influential figure – and almost a surrogate father – oscar hammerstein who lived nearby yet if sondheim refuses to wear his heart on his sleeve he’s more than happy to air his thoughts on his art he considers assassins his most accomplished musical “john weidman the librettist and i knew what we wanted to do and we did it i judge pieces that way how many places are there where you’d say ‘if i only knew how to fix that’ i look at assassins and with a few exceptions it fulfils all my expectations” the show brings together some of america’s bestknown assassins – lee harvey oswald and john wilkes booth – with lesserknown historical figures – charles guiteau samuel byck and sara jane moore played in jamie lloyd’s new revival by andy nyman mike mcshane and catherine tate they’re pitched into eerie at times disconcertingly jaunty dialogue with each other in a fairground shooting booth though the piece won acclaim on its uk premiere by sam mendes at the donmar warehouse in  its chances in new york were scuppered by the upsurge in patriotism during the gulf war “it seemed like the wrong time to question the principles on which america was built” sondheim recalls reasserting its underlying seriousness “every time i saw a reference to the show as ‘singing and dancing assassins’ it would just p‑‑‑ me off pardon the expression sing they do but when they dance they’re not happy about it “nobody at the end of the show should feel that we have been excusing or sentimentalising these people we’re examining the system that causes these horrors the us constitution guarantees the pursuit of happiness it doesn’t guarantee the happiness that’s the difference these are people who feel they’ve been cheated of their happiness each one in a different way” talk turns to the future does it matter how subsequent generations respond to his work “if i get bad reviews after i’m dead do i really care if i get good reviews after i’m dead do i care if you can’t enjoy or complain about them what’s the point” he laughs then seems to change his mind “of course i’d love the work to be done and for what will sound like a very mealymouthed reason i want people to enjoy what i write i’m a product of broadway no matter how pretentious anybody thinks what i write is i’m not writing for myself i’m writing to entertain to make people laugh and cry and think i want as big an audience as possible” assassins is at the menier chocolate factory london se    menierchocolatefactorycom until march  into the woods is out on january  certificate pg theatre culture » dominic
