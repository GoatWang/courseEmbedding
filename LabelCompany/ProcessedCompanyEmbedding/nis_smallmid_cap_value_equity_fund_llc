investment outlook the long cycle continues we expect the long postcrisis economic recovery to continue in  as a base case we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since  from an investment perspective our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets we prefer equities over credit and credit over rates but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given  elevated valuations  limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and  limits to economic growth potential broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt in some respects our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into  the key difference for  revolves around four emerging transitions populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy and concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for deregulation transition will be an evolving theme in  and we will be revisiting it in our publications throughout the year in this investment outlook we highlight specific signposts we will be watching both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions three key questions is it time to derisk is it time to derisk no we think derisking would be premature at least from a purely returngenerating standpoint we expect the macro environment to remain supportive of risk assets during  amid a slowbutsteady expansion in developed markets and an acceleration of growth in some emerging markets view more what’s driving the expansion what’s driving the expansion we believe this is a slowgrowth recovery best explained by cyclical economic drivers we believe the concerns about the developed world being mired in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth— socalled secular stagnation—are overdone view more where do we see opportunities where do we see opportunities in a lowreturn world we look for sources of return beyond conventional stock and bond market approaches we also think rangebound or volatile markets create opportunities for more dynamic investment strategies view more     transitions we’re watching in  globalism to populism the biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend stagnation to inflation we expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the us monetary to fiscal policy the focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability regulation to deregulation we see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive deregulation  gdp forecasts by country region and market  we expect the prolonged expansion phase of the growth cycle to continue in

quarter ended june   our position in expedia inc  portfolio weighting has been a top contributor as investors are recognizing some of the company’s strong underlying fundamentals we think that online travel is an area of secular growth as travel spending expands and bookings activity continues to shift online we’ve long held a position in expedia since it is the leading player in a duopoly of online travel agencies in the us and management has a great track record of creating value for shareholders the portfolio benefitted from our position in ball corp  portfolio weighting the company finally offered positive news to investors which provided comfort that management will deliver on prior promises to generate synergies from the recent acquisition with rexam we continue to have a favorable view of ball corp given its scale in the industry and the lower cyclicality of its earnings pattern relative to basic materials peers stock selection in consumer staples was a performance headwind amidst continued challenges for kroger co  portfolio weighting the combination of increased competition and food deflation has weighed on results despite negative sentiment we still think that kroger is relatively wellpositioned as the premier player in grocery our position in autozone inc  portfolio weighting detracted after the company reported its first negative samestore sales results in four years as both the tax refund delay and impact from a warm winter weighed on results investors reacted negatively to these developments which in our view created an attractive opportunity to add to our position from our perspective longterm industry growth remains intact as the big four players in auto parts retailing continue to take share as the industry consolidates we like the fact that autozone is a rational highmargin highreturn business with barriers to entry in the form of a complex supply chain looking ahead while financials still represent an attractive opportunity set we’d look to trim if we find more compelling opportunities although consumer discretionary remains a large allocation and overweight the composition of this exposure has shifted away from bricks and mortar retail we trimmed tiffany  co  portfolio weighting and ralph lauren corp  portfolio weighting and towards business models that face less competitive pressures from amazon such as autozone and genuine parts co  portfolio weighting while it is challenging for us to find the types of companies we like owning in energy and remain underweight we built our position in williams cos inc  portfolio weighting given sustained underperformance amidst a weak commodity backdrop as retail real estate investment trusts continue to underperform we are finding compelling riskreward opportunities since we don’t think companyspecific fundamentals have deteriorated as much as the multiples have contracted federal realty investment trust  portfolio weighting and brixmor property

measures the performance of the smallcap value segment of the us equity universe it includes those russell  companies that are considered more valueoriented relative to the overall market as defined by russell�s leading style methodology the russell � value index is constructed to provide a comprehensive and unbiased barometer for the smallcap value segment the index is completely reconstituted annually to ensure larger stocks do not distort the performance and characteristics of the true smallcap opportunity set and that the represented companies continue to reflect value characteristicspriceearnings for a stock is the ratio of the companys most recent monthend share price to the companys estimated earnings per share eps for the current fiscal year if a thirdparty estimate for the current year eps is not available morningstar will calculate an internal estimate based on the most recently reported eps and average historical earnings growth rates price earnings is one of the five value factors used to calculate the morningstar style box for portfolios this historical pe data point is calculated by taking an assetweighted average of the earnings yields ep of all the stocks in the portfolio and then taking the reciprocal of the result source morningstarreflects the percentage of a funds movements that can be explained by movements in a particular benchmark an rsquared of  indicates fund movements that are perfectly correlated to those of the benchmark in order to compare funds across general asset classes morningstar calculates rsquared values relative to a standard broadbased market index for example the rsquared of both a small cap domestic equity fund and a domestic technology fund would be determined against the sp  index thus the standard broadbased market index used by morningstar may differ from the funds actual benchmark stated in this factsheet source morningstarbeta is a measure of the systematic risk of a stock or a portfolio and is an indicator of expected return a beta higher than  has higher risk than the overall market has and thus the stock or portfolio can be expected to perform in relation to the overall market in that

countries with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since  from an investment perspective our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets we prefer equities over credit and credit over rates but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given  elevated valuations  limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and  limits to economic growth potential broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt in some respects our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into  the key difference for  revolves around four emerging transitions populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy and concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for deregulation transition will be an evolving theme in  and we will be revisiting it in our publications throughout the year in this investment outlook we highlight specific signposts we will be watching both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions three key questions is it time to derisk is it time to derisk no we think derisking would be premature at least from a purely returngenerating standpoint we expect the macro environment to remain supportive of risk assets during  amid a slowbutsteady expansion in developed markets and an acceleration of growth in some emerging markets view more what’s driving the expansion what’s driving the expansion we believe this is a slowgrowth recovery best explained by cyclical economic drivers we believe the concerns about the developed world being mired in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth— socalled secular stagnation—are overdone view more where do we see opportunities where do we see opportunities in a lowreturn world we look for sources of return beyond conventional stock and bond market approaches we also think rangebound or volatile markets create opportunities for more dynamic investment strategies view more     transitions we’re watching in  globalism to populism the biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend stagnation to inflation we expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the us monetary to fiscal policy the focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability regulation to deregulation we see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive deregulation  gdp forecasts by country region and market  we expect the prolonged expansion phase of the

quarter ended june   our position in expedia inc  portfolio weighting has been a top contributor as investors are recognizing some of the company’s strong underlying fundamentals we think that online travel is an area of secular growth as travel spending expands and bookings activity continues to shift online we’ve long held a position in expedia since it is the leading player in a duopoly of online travel agencies in the us and management has a great track record of creating value for shareholders the portfolio benefitted from our position in ball corp  portfolio weighting the company finally offered positive news to investors which provided comfort that management will deliver on prior promises to generate synergies from the recent acquisition with rexam we continue to have a favorable view of ball corp given its scale in the industry and the lower cyclicality of its earnings pattern relative to basic materials peers stock selection in consumer staples was a performance headwind amidst continued challenges for kroger co  portfolio weighting the combination of increased competition and food deflation has weighed on results despite negative sentiment we still think that kroger is relatively wellpositioned as the premier player in grocery our position in autozone inc  portfolio weighting detracted after the company reported its first negative samestore sales results in four years as both the tax refund delay and impact from a warm winter weighed on results investors reacted negatively to these developments which in our view created an attractive opportunity to add to our position from our perspective longterm industry growth remains intact as the big four players in auto parts retailing continue to take share as the industry consolidates we like the fact that autozone is a rational highmargin highreturn business with barriers to entry in the form of a complex supply chain looking ahead while financials still represent an attractive opportunity set we’d look to trim if we find more compelling opportunities although consumer discretionary remains a large allocation and overweight the composition of this exposure has shifted away from bricks and mortar retail we trimmed tiffany  co  portfolio weighting and ralph lauren corp  portfolio weighting and towards business models that face less competitive pressures from amazon such as autozone and genuine parts co  portfolio weighting while it is challenging for us to find the types of companies we like owning in energy and remain underweight we built our position in williams cos inc  portfolio weighting given sustained underperformance amidst a weak commodity backdrop as retail real estate investment trusts continue to underperform we are finding compelling riskreward
