street transcript twst interviewed howard f hill president  ceo he was a cofounder of celltronics rf industries predecessor company in  the company went public in  and was in the cellular phone industry however they were undercapitalized and could not compete when the industry switched from trunk or automobile mount cellular phones to handhelds in  they bought a coaxial connector company named rf industries then they completely reorganized selling off a couple divisions to avoid bankruptcy and renamed the company rf industries some excerpts from the interview are twst can you tell us something about the products that you are selling mr hill we have two divisions the cash cow the main division is rf connector the sales would be roughly  million a year and theyre involved in rf coaxial connectors we build a wide range of connectors from large ones up to two inches that fit on towers on top of mountains to some small ones which fit on the end of a small finger nail which are used inside of different radios and handhelds connectors continue to get smaller but the frequencies just get higher and higher the second division is neulink which is a valueadded distributor we buy the basic products from contract manufacturers to meet the customers needs these are typically transceivers which are used for wireless data voice and image distribution in data relay or point to point systems twst will there be improvements in the technology that will work to your advantage as the years go by mr hill yes thats one of the more unique things about electronics its almost like a phone book you come out with a product and its obsolete right away so you have a short life span there are some connectors that have been around since  but most of them keep changing and going to higher frequencies and smaller and smaller sizes we have been very successful in keeping up with this technology twst can you see within a few years a major technological jump within wireless mr hill yes i think that more and more technology will be going wireless when we think of wireless today we just think of the cellular phone or the new word which is pcs phones i think that in the future a lot of computers will use wireless local and wide area networks i also think that a lot of common services will be wireless currently the ups or the fedex people have their little handheld units that read the barcodes to keep track of pickups and deliveries i think you are going to see a tie in of bar coding with wireless more and more so that these things will just be scanned and accounted for without human intervention many applications where we always had wires running all over the place will become wireless transcripts of interviews like this in the technology area are available on a
