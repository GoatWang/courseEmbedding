on market timing agreements that allowed certain individuals and entities to make frequent trades in the invesco funds advised by ifg and aim mutual funds advised by aim advisors market timing includes a frequent buying and selling of shares of the same mutual fund or b buying or selling mutual fund shares in order to exploit inefficiencies in mutual fund pricing market timing while not illegal per se can harm other mutual fund shareholders because it can dilute the value of their shares if the market timer is exploiting pricing inefficiencies or disrupt the management of the mutual funds investment portfolio and can cause the targeted mutual fund to incur costs borne by other shareholders to accommodate frequent buying and selling of shares by the market timer respondents and related entity  amvescap plc is a united kingdom holding company whose american depository receipts trade on the new york stock exchange ifg aim advisors and adi are now and at all times relevant to this order were whollyowned subsidiaries of amvescap  ifg a delaware corporation headquartered in denver and its predecessors have been registered with the commission as investment advisers since  during the time period relevant to this order ifg served as an investment adviser to eight registered openended investment companies consisting of over fortyfive series or mutual funds invesco funds aim advisors began assuming responsibility for serving as investment adviser to the invesco funds in  ifg intends to voluntarily withdraw its registration with the commission as an investment adviser as soon as it is practicable on december   the commission filed an action against ifg and its former chief executive officer ceo in federal district court in connection with the matters described herein sec v ifg et al civil action no n pac  aim advisors a delaware corporation headquartered in houston has been registered with the commission as an investment adviser since november  in  and  but after the conduct that is the subject of this order the invesco and aim fund complexes became fully integrated and are now overseen by a single board of directors aim advisors currently serves as an investment adviser to  registered openended investment companies consisting of approximately eightyseven series or mutual funds aim funds five of these registered investment companies were a part of the invesco complex and the individual series within these registered investment companies continue to carry the invesco name  adi a delaware corporation headquartered in houston has been registered with the commission as a brokerdealer since february  adi is the primary distributor and principal underwriter for aim funds facts ifg overview  ifg entered into negotiated but undisclosed market timing agreements with over  individuals and entities the market timers or timers which allowed them to market time certain invesco funds while representing to other shareholders that it did not permit frequent trading in those funds  under the agreements which existed from at least  through july  ifg permitted the market timers to make excessive exchanges and redemptions totaling approximately  billion in select invesco funds some of the timing agreements were entered into with the understanding that the market timer would make longterm investments socalled sticky assets in certain nontimed invesco funds ifg also tolerated markettiming activities by other shareholders with whom it did not have timing agreements from at least  through july  the relevant time period  the market timing agreements financially benefited ifg in that ifg realized additional advisory fees from the timed funds and sticky assets under its management because ifg had reason to believe that the assets brought to the invesco funds under the market timing agreements while serving to increase ifgs advisory fees could be traded in a manner detrimental to the invesco funds ifg had a conflict of interest with the invesco funds ifg failed to disclose the conflict of interest to the board of directors and shareholders of the affected invesco funds thereby breaching ifgs fiduciary duty to the invesco funds  the market timing agreements were also inconsistent with the disclosures made in the invesco funds prospectuses the prospectuses stated that shareholders could make up to four exchanges out of each fund per twelvemonth period the market timing agreements provided for more than the disclosed number of exchanges furthermore while the prospectuses also disclosed that each fund reserved the right to modify the exchange policy if such a modification was determined to be in the best interests of the fund ifg failed to make a determination that each proposed market timing agreement was in the best interest of the fund before entering into the agreement in the aggregate the market timing trades made under the agreements were detrimental to the invesco funds shareholders for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above ifgs market timing agreements  during the relevant time period ifg experienced a dramatic and prolonged decline in its assets under management ifg entered into the market timing agreements to lessen this decline  at their height the market timers held over  billion of the assets invested in the invesco funds and during the relevant time period made excessive exchanges and redemptions totaling approximately  billion frequent trading by investors who timed the invesco funds caused dilution to the affected funds  ifg through its ceo established an internal organizational structure by which it entered into agreements with market timers in most cases the head of what was known as ifgs market timing desk would receive proposals from investors seeking to market time the invesco funds after obtaining information from an investor about its proposed frequent trading model the head of the market timing desk would then orally present that proposal to ifgs chief investment officer cio the cio then approved or rejected the proposed agreement by design none of the market timing agreements was reduced to writing  furthermore ifgs commission structure for its salespeople provided for a separate and distinct payout for investments made in the invesco funds pursuant to the market timing agreements although this commission payout was lower than the payout for ordinary longterm investments the fact that commission payouts on market timing investments were separately designated shows that ifg institutionalized the practice of entering into market timing agreements furthermore this commission structure created an incentive for salespeople to bring market timing proposals to ifg and the commission structure had that effect members of ifgs senior management knew about and approved this structure  on several occasions issues arose within ifg relating to the harmful and disruptive trading activities of the market timers primarily in response to complaints made by invesco fund managers ifgs ceo cio national sales manager and the head of the market timing desk met to respond to the complaints while continuing the operation of ifgs market timing program  with all market timers ifg required that they keep their timed monies within the invesco fund complex when exchanging out of a fund approved for timing with some market timers ifg also required that they maintain sticky assets within the invesco fund complex in exchange for their ability to engage in frequent trading ifg received additional fees from these assets under management  ifg knew that the assets brought to the invesco funds under the market timing agreements while serving to increase ifgs advisory fees could be traded in a manner detrimental to the invesco funds thereby placing ifg in a conflict of interest situation with the invesco funds ifg breached its fiduciary duty to the invesco funds subject to the timing agreements by failing to disclose this conflict of interest to the board of directors of the invesco funds or to the invesco fund shareholders and obtain the board members consent to the agreements ifgs largest timer  according to an internal memorandum between august  and february  ifgs single largest timer canary capital partners llc canary was permitted to make up to  exchanges per year within ten invesco funds with a total trading capacity of  million in those funds  in february  ifgs cio informed other members of ifgs senior management that canarys market timing activities were negatively affecting his ability to manage a particular invesco fund and costing that funds legitimate shareholders due to these activities the cio and another ifg fund manager recommended that ifg terminate canarys market timing privileges however rather than terminating its relationship with canary ifg simply reduced canarys timing capacity and confined canarys trading activities to five particular invesco funds thereafter canary continued to make frequent trades in these funds until july   during  ifg also introduced canary to invescos european offshore fund complex ifg did so with the knowledge and understanding that canary intended to market time the offshore complexs funds and that ifg would receive additional fees as a result of this agreement ultimately ifg assisted the offshore complex in negotiating a final agreement with canary and ifg subsequently received various fees for canarys trading activities in the offshore funds the invesco funds prospectuses prohibited market timing and frequent trading in the funds at the same time ifg allowed investors to market time the funds  during the same period that ifg entered into agreements with market timers the prospectuses for the invesco funds represented that ifg discouraged frequent trading by investors by attempting to limit the number of exchanges a shareholder could make in each invesco fund to that end these prospectuses disclosed that shareholders could make up to four exchanges out of each fund per twelvemonth period the prospectuses further disclosed that each fund reserves the right to reject any exchange request or to modify or terminate the exchange policy if it is in the best interests of the fund  ifg prepared these prospectuses provided them to shareholders and prospective shareholders in the invesco funds and filed registration statements containing these prospectuses with the commission  ifg knew that its agreements with market timers were inconsistent with the invesco funds prospectus disclosure specifically ifg knew that the market timers were being allowed to make more than four exchanges out of certain invesco funds in a twelvemonth period ifg also knew that a determination that each proposed market timing agreement was in the best interest of the fund was not being made before it entered into the agreement in fact ifg knew that the timing activities were harming the invesco funds and their shareholders  ifg also knew that its agreements with market timers were inconsistent with earlier representations ifg had made to the invesco funds board of directors about how ifg would discourage market timing activities within the invesco funds specifically in  ifg represented to the board that ifg would strictly enforce the prospectus language by allowing a maximum of four exchanges or redemptions by an investor in an invesco fund over a twelvemonth period despite this representation ifg subsequently entered into agreements with market timers without informing the board of ifgs unilateral change to the invesco funds market timing policy  furthermore in or about january  the attorney who served as ifgs chief compliance officer prepared a memorandum concerning ifgs market timing activities in the memorandum the chief compliance officer discussed how ifgs tolerance of market timers might not be in the best interests of the invesco funds and their shareholders and explained a number of the potentially detrimental effects of market timing including the portfolio managers increased need for cash positions lower returns in the timed funds capital gain taxes unfairly paid by longterm shareholders and negative impacts to the portfolio managers abilities to carry out their investment strategies ultimately the chief compliance officer recommended that ifg either enforce the existing prospectus language modify the prospectus language to disclose ifgs actual practices or adopt a new policy to limit market timing the chief compliance officer gave the memorandum to ifgs ceo in january  ifgs ceo did not circulate the chief compliance officers memorandum to the board of directors of the invesco funds nor did he follow any of the chief compliance officers recommendations ifg tolerated frequent trading by investors with whom it did not have a specific agreement  in addition to entering into the market timing agreements described above in paragraphs  through  ifg typically did not take action to restrict the trading of invesco fund shareholders whom ifg knew were trading in excess of the fourexchange limit set forth in the invesco funds prospectuses the frequent trading by these shareholders also resulted in substantial dilution in the affected invesco funds aim advisors and adi overview  between january  and september  the relevant period aim funds commissionfiled prospectuses contained a disclosure the disclosure that shareholders were limited to  exchanges per calendar year high level personnel of aim advisors participated in the drafting or review of the disclosure prior to the filing of the prospectuses with the commission  aim advisors entered into  negotiated but undisclosed market timing agreements with individuals and entities the market timers or timers allowing the timers to exceed the peryear exchange limit and to make trades valued collectively at tens of millions of dollars within aim funds one of the timing agreements was entered into with the understanding that the market timer would make a longterm investment or invest socalled sticky assets in certain aim funds  the market timing agreements financially benefited aim advisors in that aim advisors realized additional advisory fees from the timed assets the fact that aim advisors had reason to believe that the assets brought to aim funds under the market timing agreements while effectively increasing aim advisors advisory fees could be traded in a manner detrimental to aim funds gave rise to a conflict of interest between aim advisors and aim funds aim advisors failed to disclose the conflict of interest to the board of trustees or shareholders of aim funds thereby breaching aim advisors fiduciary duty to aim funds and the aim funds shareholders  the market timing agreements were also inconsistent with the aim funds prospectus disclosure which stated that shareholders are limited to  exchanges within each aim funds portfolio per twelvemonth period the market timing agreements provided for more than  exchanges  specifically the disclosure in the aim funds prospectuses stated you are limited to a maximum of  exchanges per calendar year because excessive shortterm trading or market timing activity can hurt fund performance if you exceed that limit or if an aim fund or the distributor determines in its sole discretion that your shortterm trading is excessive or that you are engaging in market timing activity it may reject any additional exchange orders an exchange is the movement out of redemption one aim fund and into purchase another aim fund the disclosure expressly linked the rationale for the peryear exchange limit to the potential harm to the performance of aim funds posed by excessive shortterm trading and market timing generally consequently it is implied in the disclosure that aim advisors would not allow trading it had identified as market timing unless aim advisors had concluded after sufficient analysis that the proposed market timing would not harm the performance of aim funds in fact aim advisors failed to conduct analysis sufficient to determine whether the proposed market timing agreements would harm or whether the actual agreements were harming the performance of aim funds in the aggregate the market timing trades conducted pursuant to the timing agreements were harmful to the performance of aim funds for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above  aim advisors chief equity officer during the relevant period aim advisors officer and the highest ranking adi officer during the relevant period adi officer jointly or individually approved the market timing agreements the adi officer negotiated and approved the sticky asset agreement adi received a financial benefit from the market timing agreements  during the relevant period the aim funds trustees were led to believe by aim advisors and adi that aim advisors was diligently and for the most part successfully enforcing the peryear exchange limit and preventing market timing within aim funds aim advisors market timing agreements  aim advisors delegated to an affiliated entity serving as transfer agent transfer agent to aim funds the duty of monitoring and enforcing compliance with the aim funds peryear exchange limit the transfer agent also processed proposals for market timing agreements by conveying the terms of screened proposals to the aim advisors officer and adi officer for determination by them individually or jointly as to whether aim advisors would accept or reject the proposal the approved timing agreements typically included an agreed maximum number of exchanges or round trips allowed within a given time frame a maximum dollar amount permitted for each exchange and a stipulation as to which aim funds portfolios could be timed  once the market timing agreements were reached employees of aim advisors transfer agent entered the timing agreements terms into a central database in this manner the employees who were generally responsible for monitoring compliance with the exchange prospectus limit were apprised to take no action against an approved market timer for exceeding  exchanges on several occasions the transfer agent employees failed to detect that timers had violated the terms of their timing agreements either by exceeding the exchangenumber limit the timed amount limit or the stipulation as to which portfolios could be timed  one of the  timing agreements included a provision that the prospective timer would maintain approximately  million in sticky assets this sticky assets agreement was approved by the adi officer  in addition to the advisory fees it received from assets invested in aim funds for timing purposes aim advisors also received advisory fees in connection with the sticky assets agreement  aim advisors knew that the assets deposited with aim funds pursuant to the market timing agreements while effectively increasing aim advisors advisory fees could be traded in a manner detrimental to aim funds giving rise thereby to a conflict of interest between aim advisors and aim funds aim advisors breached its fiduciary duty to aim funds and its shareholders by failing to disclose this conflict of interest to the board of trustees of aim funds or to the aim funds shareholders and by failing to obtain the board members consent to the timing agreements aim advisors efforts to control market timing activity  notwithstanding the conduct described above aim advisors through the efforts of the transfer agent and others generally tried to detect deter and prevent market timing in aim funds aim advisors rejected far more proposals from market timers than it accepted and most of the rejected proposals involved more money and more exchanges than the money and exchanges provided for in the market timing agreements aim advisors also implemented through the transfer agent and others policies and practices designed to combat market timing including the daily monitoring of trading activity the placing of stop codes on accounts that reached or exceeded  exchanges within a year the blocking of trades by traders with a pattern of market timing activity and the withholding or rolling back of commission payments to wholesalers on certain timing assets aim advisors largest timers  aim advisors permitted a market timer to trade up to  million per exchange in up to  exchanges per year between the aim funds cash reserve fund and its international equity fund one of the most heavily timed international portfolios at aim funds the market timer actually exceeded the parameters of his timing agreement between january   and june   the timer moved assets in and out of the international equity fund  times or a total of  exchanges  four more than the agreed  exchanges  aim advisors permitted a market timer to trade up to an aggregate  million in up to  exchanges per year in certain aim funds portfolios aim advisors agreement with the timer contained a provision that the timer would maintain  million in other aim funds portfolios the sticky assets arrangement the agreement also allowed the timer to transfer up to  million in up to  exchanges per year in another group of accounts the adi officer negotiated and unilaterally approved this sticky assets agreement and both aim advisors and adi received a financial benefit from the agreement although aim funds prospectuses implicitly prohibited market timing absent a determination that it would not harm aim funds performance aim advisors approved market timing without having made such a determination  throughout the relevant period aim funds public prospectuses contained the abovequoted disclosure expressly linking market timing to potential harm to the performance of aim funds implying thereby that aim advisors would not allow a trader to exceed the peryear exchange limit unless it had determined after sufficient analysis that the activity in question would not harm the performance of aim funds  between january  and september  aim advisors provided to aim funds shareholders and prospective shareholders the prospectuses containing the market timing disclosure and filed with the commission registration statements containing the prospectuses  aim advisors delegated to the transfer agent employees the task of monitoring compliance with the peryear exchange limit and halting exchanges by traders in violation of the prospectus limit at the same time it was policing the exchange limit with respect to the general population of aim funds shareholders aim advisors allowed the market timers pursuant to the timing agreements to exceed the exchange limit  beginning in  aim advisors portfolio managers informed aim advisors that they believed market timing within aim funds was having a deleterious impact on the performance of certain aim funds portfolios on at least three occasions the portfolio manager of the most frequently timed international aim funds portfolio sent emails apprising aim advisors of his belief and concern that market timing was harming the performance of the portfolios he managed despite these warnings and their knowledge of the harm the aim advisors officer and the adi officer continued to authorize market timing agreements  from  through  the board of trustees of aim funds was informed at various times of the negative impact of market timing and of efforts to reduce market timing in aim funds in june of  the adi officer informed the board that the assets of a known market timer had been expelled from aim funds but the adi officer failed to disclose to the board that aim advisors had entered into a market timing agreement with the timer and with other timers allowing them to conduct peryear exchanges in excess of the prospectus limit violations  as a result of the conduct described above ifg and aim advisors willfully violated sections  and  of the advisers act in that while each acted as an investment adviser it employed devices schemes or artifices to defraud clients or prospective clients and engaged in transactions practices or courses of business which operated or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon clients or prospective clients specifically ifg and aim advisors entered into market timing agreements which created a conflict of interest that ifg and aim advisors knowingly or recklessly failed to disclose to the board of directors or shareholders of their respective funds and which were inconsistent with the funds prospectus disclosures  as a result of the conduct described above adi willfully aided and abetted and caused aim advisors violations of sections  and  of the advisers act in that adi negotiated and approved market timing agreements provided materially misleading information about aim advisors market timing monitoring and prevention efforts to the board of trustees of aim funds and financially benefited from the timing agreements  as a result of the conduct described above ifg aim advisors and adi each an affiliated person of its respective timed funds willfully violated section d of the investment company act and rule d thereunder in that while acting as a principal each participated in and effected transactions in connection with joint arrangements in which their respective funds were participants without filing an application with the commission and obtaining a commission order approving the transactions  as a result of the conduct described above ifg and aim advisors willfully violated section b of the investment company act in that each made an untrue statement of material fact in a registration statement application report account record or

distributors inc adi the commission issued an order finding that ifg aim advisors and adi violated the federal securities laws by facilitating widespread market timing trading in mutual funds with which each entity was affiliatedthe settlements require ifg to pay  million in disgorgement and  million in civil penalties and require aim advisors and adi to pay jointly and severally  million in disgorgement and an aggregate  million in civil penaltiesifg a registered investment adviser to the invesco funds aim advisors a registered investment adviser to aim funds and adi a registered brokerdealer to aim funds are whollyowned subsidiaries of amvescap llp a united kingdom holding companyby a separate order the commission also announced a settled enforcement action against raymond r cunningham the former president and chief executive officer of ifg and a former member of the invesco funds’ board of directors for his role in ifg’s market timing program that settlement requires cunningham to pay  in disgorgement and  in civil penaltiesrandall j fons regional director of the sec’s central regional office said “the settlements against ifg and cunningham reflect the commission’s ongoing pursuit of those investment advisers and their employees who chose to compromise their duty of absolute good faith to shareholders in exchange for profits resulting from undisclosed market timing arrangements such entities and individuals will be thoroughly investigated and punished accordingly”harold f degenhardt administrator of the commission’s fort worth office added “aim advisors and its affiliate adi fostered market timing with the knowledge that in doing so they could have been advancing only their own interests – most obviously their interest in additional fees – and not the interests of aim funds and its shareholders in so doing aim advisors became ensnared in a conflict of interest that it failed to disclose despite its duty to do so this conduct is unacceptableamong other things the commission’s orders concerning ifg and cunningham set forth the following factual findingsfrom at least  through july  ifg entered into undisclosed market timing agreements with over  individuals and entities which allowed them to market time certain invesco funds some of the timing agreements were entered into with the understanding that the market timer would maintain longterm investments socalled “sticky assets” in certain nontimed invesco funds at their height the market timers held over  billion of the assets invested in the invesco funds and made excessive exchanges and redemptions totaling approximately  billion in the aggregate the market timing trades made under the agreements were detrimental to the invesco funds’ shareholders ifg financially benefited from these agreements in that it realized additional advisory fees from the assets under management resulting from the timing agreements because ifg had reason to believe that the market timing assets while serving to increase ifg’s advisory fees could be traded in a manner detrimental to the invesco funds ifg had a conflict of interest with the invesco funds however ifg failed to disclose the conflict of interest to the board of directors and shareholders of the affected invesco funds thereby breaching ifg’s duty to the invesco funds during this same time period the invesco funds’ prospectuses represented that shareholders could make up to four exchanges out of each fund per twelvemonth period the funds reserved the right to modify the exchange policy if such a modification was determined to be in the “best interests” of the fund since ifg’s market timing agreements provided for more than the disclosed number of exchanges and since ifg did not make a “best interests” determination before entering into the timing agreements the agreements contravened the prospectus disclosures as ifg’s president and chief executive officer during this time period cunningham was responsible for and approved ifg’s undisclosed market timing program cunningham was aware of the harmful effects the market timers’ trading potentially had on other fund shareholders from his involvement in resolving issues that arose from these activities and from his receipt of information from ifg’s chief compliance officer furthermore although he was responsible for informing the funds’ board of directors about ifg’s operations cunningham never disclosed the existence of the market timing agreements to the boardadditionally the commission’s order concerning aim advisors and adi sets forth the following findingsbetween january  and september  the relevant period aim advisors entered into  negotiated but undisclosed market timing agreements with individuals and entities allowing the timers to exceed aim funds’ peryear exchange limit and to make trades valued collectively at tens of millions of dollars within aim funds one of the timing agreements was entered into with the understanding that the market timer would make a longterm investment or invest socalled “sticky assets” in certain aim funds the market timing agreements financially benefited aim advisors in that aim advisors realized additional advisory fees from the timed assets the fact that aim advisors had reason to believe that the assets brought to aim funds under the market timing agreements while effectively increasing aim advisors advisory fees could be traded in a manner detrimental to aim funds gave rise to a conflict of interest between aim advisors and aim funds aim advisors failed to disclose the conflict of interest to the board of trustees or shareholders of aim funds thereby breaching its fiduciary duty to aim funds and the aim funds shareholders during the relevant period aim funds’ commissionfiled prospectuses contained a disclosure that shareholders were limited to  exchanges per calendar year the disclosure expressly linked the rationale for the exchange limit to the potential harm to the performance of aim funds posed by excessive shortterm trading and market timing generally consequently it is implied in the disclosure that aim advisors would not allow trading it had identified as market timing unless aim advisors had concluded after sufficient analysis that the proposed market timing would not harm the performance of aim funds in fact aim advisors failed to conduct analysis sufficient to determine whether the proposed market timing agreements would harm or whether the actual agreements were harming the performance of aim funds adi negotiated and approved market timing agreements provided materially misleading information about aim advisors market timing monitoring and prevention efforts to the board of trustees of aim funds and financially benefited from the timing agreementsas a result of the conduct described above the orders find that ifg and aim advisors willfully violated and adi aided and abetted aim advisors’ violations of sections  and  of the investment advisers act of  advisers act and ifg aim advisors and adi willfully violated section d of the investment company act of  investment company act and rule d thereunder the order also finds that ifg and aim advisors willfully violated section b of the investment company act in the orders ifg aim advisors and adi are censured in addition cunningham’s order finds that he aided and abetted ifg’s violations of the advisers act and that he violated section b of the investment company act the order requires him to cease and desist from violating or causing future violations of these provisions the order also prohibits him from associating with an investment adviser broker dealer or investment company for a period of two years and further prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of an investment adviser broker dealer or investment company for five years pursuant to their respective offers of settlement ifg aim advisors adi and cunningham consented to entry of the commission’s orders without admitting or denying the findingsthe enforcement action against ifg has been coordinated with the office of the new york attorney general the office of the colorado attorney general and the colorado division of securities the enforcement actions against aim advisors adi and cunningham have also been coordinated
