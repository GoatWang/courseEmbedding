noni that is not certified organic is cultivated without these considerations this means the fruit may have been grown under any variety of conditionsfor hawaiian ola the organic distinction is important because the noni we drink is for health healing and preserving the hawaiian islands we believe that you truly are what you eat and that eating foods grown without harmful pesticides gmo’s or fertilizers is better for your health and the health of the environment today less than  of all ag land in hawaii is certified organic and most of the worlds noni is not grown organicallyby choosing certified organic hawaiian noni you’re feeding your body some of the best fruit on earth and you’re helping hawaiian ola to fulfill our mission to expand the demand for organic gmofree hawaiian goods by manufacturing and exporting healthy products made from sustainably grown islandnative plants like noni are hawaiian ola noni energy and noni immunity shots gmo freeyes as per the usda nop guidelines in order for hawaiian ola to be certified organic all of the ingredients must be gmofreeis there a difference between natural caffeine and synthetic caffeinethe short answer is yes there are important differences between natural and synthetic caffeine sources the distinction has to do with where different kinds of caffeine come from synthetic caffeine is manufactured in manmade production facilities and is carefully isolated from any impurities natural caffeine from plants comes with a variety of plantbased constituents like phytonutrients which can change the way the caffeine interacts with your body to learn more about plantbased caffeine checkout this post on the difference between natural  synthetic caffeine what is an ideal habitat for growing noninoni grows throughout the tropics especially in regions blessed with yearround equatorial weather like hawaii hawaiian noni grows wild throughout many of the islands eleven micro climates some of the largest groves can be found in the puna region where the soil and climate are especially good for noni cultivationthis is not to say noni is a picky plant though in hawaii wild noni can be found growing near the ocean where salt mixes into it’s growing habitat—even more noni is one of the few plants that will grow straight from new lava rock where little water and nutrition are available for vegetationin hawaii the number one agricultural export today is conventionally grown gmo corn which requires a great deal of inputs like water fertilizer and pesticides to grow one of the main reasons we are working to share hawaiian noni with the world is that it can be grown sustainably in hawaii with very few inputs what should i know about pahs in yerba mate and cancer riskyou may have heard some of the recent news about a class of compounds known as pahs found in yerba mate that have been associated with an increased risk of cancer yerba mate is a healthy plantbased source of herbal energy that has been used in south and central america for hundreds of years as a rejuvenating source of traditional medicinewith some exceptions most of the world’s mate leaves are dried in a hightemperature smoky process that involves burning barbacoa wood the upside to this method is that it dries the leaves quickly—between  and  hours unfortunately processing mate leaves in this way has been shown to create mate with heightened levels of pahs or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which are known carcinogens in high concentrationsbecause pahs are found in many common foods and drinks such as water tea and coffee they are almost impossible to avoid completely however there are ways of reducing the quantity that you intake by only consuming goods with the lowest possible amounts of pahsfortunately the yerba mate used to caffeinate hawaiian ola’s noni energy is processed in a way that generates minimal quantities of pahs rather than burning wood to heatdry our mate leaves are airdried which takes longer but produces a final product with much lower quantities of carcinogenic contentin the future hawaiian ola will continue to seek out certified organic sources of mate containing the lowest amounts of pahs available ensuring our consumers are always getting the healthiest product possible still curious keep asking questions for more information on yerba mate or our other caffeine source green tea send your questions to contacthawaiianolacom how many hours of energy will a hawaiian ola noni energy shot give methis is a question we hear often from new hawaiian ola drinkers and the answer usually surprises peopleconsider this you wouldn’t buy five mile gasoline for your car or five hour batteries for a flashlight—right the reason of course is that there are many different kinds of cars and flashlights and not all of them have the same energy needs well humans are the same different bodies prefer different kinds and amounts of energy that work best for each individualhawaiian ola’s noni energy shot contains mg of organic plantbased caffeine the caffeine comes from organic yerba mate and green tea each shot also contains a variety of super fruits and daily vitamins which provide a lasting kind of energy that comes from supporting the whole body nutritionally this unique blend gives drinkers a lift that is sustained and gradual—avoiding the all to common “crash” reported by many energy shot drinkerswhile hawaiian ola believes that educating consumers about caffeine is important many popular alternatives do not disclose things like where their caffeine is sourced and how much caffeine is contained in each bottle this can sometimes make it difficult to understand how much caffeine drinkers are taking and how to compare the effects to other products the result is consumers measuring energy by hours rather than quantitative criteria such as caffeine and overall nutritionnext time you’re looking for a healthy boost of energy try this apart from staying mindful of how many hours your body is feeling energized consider these things as well• how much sugar does your energy shot contain• are there any items on the ingredients list that seem unfamiliar to you• does the shot contain preservatives• what in the product offers lasting nutritional support ingredients such as fruits vegetables and vitamins• where does the caffeine come from a caffeine producing plant or is it synthesized• where are water and sugar on the ingredients listtaking a second look at energy products by asking these questions will help you choose an option that supports your whole body and maybe even the health of the planet too to learn more about what goes into the hawaiian ola noni energy shot visit our product page you can also learn about the hawaiian ola mission to expand the demand for gmofree agriculture in hawaii on our mission page are hawaiian ola’s hawaiian noni shots pasteurizedfor many noni drinkers debates over the best way to drink noni juice are common especially for those who live in hawaii where noni has been grown and prepared traditionally for many years in these debates one of the most common topics talked about is whether or not noni should be pasteurizedat hawaiian ola our choice to pasteurize our noni juice was not an easy one to make the subject is complex and there were many pros and cons to weigh in order to make an informed choice in the end our decision was made to ensure the health safety and well being of our drinkers the fda strongly recommends that fruit juices like noni be pasteurized and we heed their advice in this article we explain our decision to pasteurize in detail we also cite several important sources that helped guide us in our decisionmaking process is noni kahanuola a real personhe’s real in your heart is the kiwano melon the same as noni fruitno sirs madams and smizmars the noni fruit or morinda citrifolia may be known by many names including space fruit cheese fruit indian mulberry and great morinda but alas none make mention of the kiwano we’re not entirely sure why there is so much confusion between these two fruits perhaps it’s due their similar size and preference for warm tropical climates the kiwano aka african horned cucumber cucumis metuliferus or horned melon is a rad fruit that grows on a vine and is sweet noni on the other hand grows on a tree or shrub and is well not really sweet at all for more information on both of these fruits visit the respective wikis for noni and kiwano hawaiian ola wants to hear more of your questionsif you have something

with my hawaiian roots surfing has always played a pivotal role in my family everything we do revolves around it living on an island like kaua’i you grow up with an abundance of amazing waves you’re raised in a lifestyle of being at the beach everyday and surfing until the sun goes down surfing is my passion and life wouldn’t be the same without it  kama the original surfing pig kama the
