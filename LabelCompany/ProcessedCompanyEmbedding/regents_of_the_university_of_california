concurdissent broussard dissent mosk moore v regents of the university of california  cal d   cal rptr   pd  was a landmark supreme court of california decision filed on july   which dealt with the issue of property rights to ones own cells taken in samples by doctors or researchers in  john moore was treated for hairy cell leukemia by physician david golde a cancer researcher at the ucla medical center moores cancer cells were later developed into a cell line that was commercialized by golde and ucla the california supreme court ruled that a hospital patients discarded blood and tissue samples are not his personal property and that individuals do not have rights to a share in the profits earned from commercial products or research derived from their cells contents  history  decision  cultural impact  see also  references  further reading  external links historyedit john moore first visited ucla medical center on october   after he was diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia physician and cancer researcher david golde took samples of moores blood bone marrow and other bodily fluids to confirm the diagnosis and recommended a splenectomy due to the potentially fatal amount of swelling in moores spleen moore signed a written consent form authorizing the procedure that said the hospital could dispose of any severed tissue or member by cremation and his spleen was removed by surgeons not named as defendants at ucla medical center moores blood profile returned to normal after only a few days and further examination of his spleen led golde to discover that moores blood cells were unique in that they produced a protein that stimulated the growth of white blood cells the type of blood cells that help protect the body from infections moore moved to seattle washington after surgery and returned to the ucla medical center for followup visits with golde several times between  and  after a few years of traveling back to los angeles to see golde and to have samples taken of bone marrow blood and semen moore asked about transferring his care to a doctor closer to home in response golde offered to cover the expense of moores airfare and accommodations in los angeles and moore agreed to continue in  moore became suspicious about a new consent form he was asked to sign that said i do do not voluntarily grant to the university of california all rights i or my heirs may have in any cell line or any other potential product which might be developed from the blood andor bone marrow obtained from me moore initially signed the consent but refused at later visits and eventually gave it to an attorney who then discovered a patent on moores cell line dubbed mo that had been issued to the regents of ucla in  naming golde and his research assistant as the inventors under an agreement with genetics institute golde became a paid consultant and acquired the rights to  shares of common stock in the patent genetics institute also agreed to pay golde and the regents at least us over three years in exchange for exclusive access to the materials and research performed on the cell line and products derived from itcitation needed after learning of the patent moore filed a lawsuit for a share in the potential profits from products or research that had been derived from his cell line without his knowledge or consent moores lawsuit alleged that golde had been aware of the potential for financial benefit when he obtained medical consent and had concealed this from moore this claim was rejected by the los angeles superior court but in  the state court of appeal ruled that blood and tissue samples are ones own personal property and that patients may have a right to share in profits derived from them according to the los angeles times moore later negotiated what he called a token settlement with ucla that covered his legal fees based on the fact that he wasnt informed and hadnt agreed to the research decisionedit moore brought suit against defendants dr david w golde golde a physician who attended moore at ucla medical center the regents of the university of california regents who own and operate the university shirley g quan a researcher employed by the regents genetics institute inc genetics institute and sandoz pharmaceuticals corporation and related entities collectively sandoz the court found that moore had no property rights to his discarded cells or any profits made from them however the court concluded that the research physician did have an obligation to reveal his financial interest in the materials harvested from moore and that moore would be allowed to bring a claim for any injury that he sustained as a result of the physicians failure to disclose those circumstances the opinion written by justice edward panelli was joined by three of the seven judges of the supreme court of california the opinion first looked at moores claim of property interests under existing law the court first rejected the argument that a person has an absolute right to the unique products of their body because his products were not unique the cells are no more unique to moore than the number of vertebrae in the spine or the chemical formula of hemoglobin the court then rejected the argument that his spleen should be protected as property in order to protect moores privacy and dignity the court held these interests were already protected by informed consent the court noted laws that required the destruction of human organs as some indication that the legislature had intended to prevent patients from possessing their extracted organs finally the property at issue may not have been moores cells but the cell line created from moores cells the court then looked at the policy behind having moores cells considered property because conversion of property is a strict liability tort the court feared that extending property rights to include organs would have a chilling effect on medical research laboratories doing research receive a large volume of medical samples and could not be expected to know or discover whether somewhere down the line their samples were illegally converted furthermore moores interest in his bodily integrity and privacy are protected by the requirement of informed consent which must also inform about economic interests justice arabian wrote a concurring opinion stating that the deep philosophical moral and religious issues that are presented by this case could not be decided by the court justice broussard concurred in part and dissented in part justice mosk dissented stating that moore could have been denied some property rights and given others mosk would hold that at the very least moore had the right to do with his own tissue what the defendants did with it that is as soon as the tissue was removed moore at least had the right to choose to sell it to a laboratory or have it destroyed thus there would be no necessity to hold labs strictly liable for conversion when property rights can be broken up to allow moore to extract a significant portion of the economic value created by his tissue furthermore in order to prove damages from informed consent moore must prove both that he would not have consented to the procedure had he been properly informed and that a reasonable person would not have consented to the procedure if they had been properly informed thus moores chances of proving damages through informed consent are slim also moore could not consent to the procedure but reserve the right to sell his organs finally moore can only sue his doctor and nobody else for failing to adequately inform him thus moore is unlikely to win could not extract the economic value of his tissue even if he refused consent and could not sue the parties that might be culpable for exploiting him cultural impactedit the michael crichton book next while specifically mentioning the moore case extrapolates possible legal ramifications of the moore

of california jerry brown president website regents website the regents of the university of california is the governing board of the university of california system the board has  voting members the california constitution grants broad institutional autonomy with limited exceptions to the regents according to article ix section  the university shall be entirely independent of all political or sectarian influence and kept free therefrom in the appointment of its regents and in the administration of its affairs as with almost all other public university systems nationwide the board of regents is treated as the real party in interest for all purposes under california law legally speaking the regents are a california corporation administering the university as a public trust under the california constitution all actions of the university are done in their name all degrees are conferred in their name all uc property is held in their name and is marked by signs indicating property of the regents of the university of california all bank accounts are held in their name and all checks must be written as payable to uc regents and all lawsuits involving the university always refer specifically to the regents this is notable because most corporations especially private ones are treated by the law as a legal entity separate from their boards and employees and lawsuits against them are addressed to the corporation or university itself not its board of directors or trusteescitation needed administrative support is provided to the regents by the office of the secretary of the regents of the university of california which shares an office building with the uc office of the president in oaklandcitation needed in may  the san francisco chronicle reported that

products or research derived from their cells contents  history  decision  cultural impact  see also  references  further reading  external links historyedit john moore first visited ucla medical center on october   after he was diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia physician and cancer researcher david golde took samples of moores blood bone marrow and other bodily fluids to confirm the diagnosis and recommended a splenectomy due to the potentially fatal amount of swelling in moores spleen moore signed a written consent form authorizing the procedure that said the hospital could dispose of any severed tissue or member by cremation and his spleen was removed by surgeons not named as defendants at ucla medical center moores blood profile returned to normal after only a few days and further examination of his spleen led golde to discover that moores blood cells were unique in that they produced a protein that stimulated the growth of white blood cells the type of blood cells that help protect the body from infections moore moved to seattle washington after surgery and returned to the ucla medical center for followup visits with golde several times between  and  after a few years of traveling back to los angeles to see golde and to have samples taken of bone marrow blood and semen moore asked about transferring his care to a doctor closer to home in response golde offered to cover the expense of moores airfare and accommodations in los angeles and moore agreed to continue in  moore became suspicious about a new consent form he was asked to sign that said i do do not voluntarily grant to the university of california all rights i or my heirs may have in any cell line or any other potential product which might be developed from the blood andor bone marrow obtained from me moore initially signed the consent but refused at later visits and eventually gave it to an attorney who then discovered a patent on moores cell line dubbed mo that had been issued to the regents of ucla in  naming golde and his research assistant as the inventors under an agreement with genetics institute golde became a paid consultant and acquired the rights to  shares of common stock in the patent genetics institute also agreed to pay golde and the regents at least us over three years in exchange for exclusive access to the materials and research performed on the cell line and products derived from itcitation needed after learning of the patent moore filed a lawsuit for a share in the potential profits from products or research that had been derived from his cell line without his knowledge or consent moores lawsuit alleged that golde had been aware of the potential for financial benefit when he obtained medical consent and had concealed this from moore this claim was rejected by the los angeles superior court but in  the state court of appeal ruled that blood and tissue samples are ones own personal property and that patients may have a right to share in profits derived from them according to the los angeles times moore later negotiated what he called a token settlement with ucla that covered his legal fees based on the fact that he wasnt informed and hadnt agreed to the research decisionedit moore brought suit against defendants dr david w golde golde a physician who attended moore at ucla medical center the regents of the university of california regents who own and operate the university shirley g quan a researcher employed by the regents genetics institute inc genetics institute and sandoz pharmaceuticals corporation and related entities collectively sandoz the court found that moore had no property rights to his discarded cells or any profits made from them however the court concluded that the research physician did have an obligation to reveal his financial interest in the materials harvested from moore and that moore would be allowed to bring a claim for any injury that he sustained as a result of the physicians failure to disclose those circumstances the opinion written by justice edward panelli was joined by three of the seven judges of the supreme court of california the opinion first looked at moores claim of property interests under existing law the court first rejected the argument that a person has an absolute right to the unique products of their body because his products were not unique the cells are no more unique to moore than the number of vertebrae in the spine or the chemical formula of hemoglobin the court then rejected the argument that his spleen should be protected as property in order to protect moores privacy and dignity the court held these interests were already protected by informed consent the court noted laws that required the destruction of human organs as some indication that the legislature had intended to prevent patients from possessing their extracted organs finally the property at issue may not have been moores cells but the cell line created from moores cells the court then looked at the policy behind having moores cells considered property because conversion of property is a strict liability tort the court feared that extending property rights to include organs would have a chilling effect on medical research laboratories doing research receive a large volume of medical samples and could not be expected to know or discover whether somewhere down the line their samples were illegally converted furthermore moores interest in his bodily integrity and privacy are protected by the requirement of informed consent which must also inform about economic interests justice arabian wrote a concurring opinion stating that the deep philosophical moral and religious issues that are presented by this case could not be decided by the court justice broussard concurred in part and dissented in part justice mosk dissented stating that moore could have been denied some property rights and given others mosk would hold that at the very least moore had the right to do with his own tissue what the defendants did with it that is as soon as the tissue was removed moore at least had the right to choose to sell it to a laboratory or have it destroyed thus there would be no necessity to hold labs strictly liable for conversion when property rights can be broken up to allow moore to extract a significant portion of the economic value created by his tissue furthermore in order to prove damages from informed consent moore must prove both that he would not have consented to the procedure had he been properly informed and that a reasonable person would not have consented to the procedure if they had been properly informed thus moores chances of proving damages through informed consent are slim also moore could not consent to the procedure but reserve the right to sell his organs finally moore can only sue his doctor and nobody else for failing to adequately inform him thus moore is unlikely to win could not extract the economic value of his tissue even if he refused consent and could not sue the parties that might be culpable for exploiting him cultural impactedit the michael crichton book next while specifically

stock in the patent genetics institute also agreed to pay golde and the regents at least us over three years in exchange for exclusive access to the materials and research performed on the cell line and products derived from itcitation needed after learning of the patent moore filed a lawsuit for a share in the potential profits from products or research that had been derived from his cell line without his knowledge or consent moores lawsuit alleged that golde had been aware of the potential for financial benefit when he obtained medical consent and had concealed this from moore this claim was rejected by the los angeles superior court but in  the state court of appeal ruled that blood and tissue samples are ones own personal property and that patients may have a right to share in profits derived from them according to the los angeles times moore later negotiated what he called a token settlement with ucla that covered his legal fees based on the fact that he wasnt informed and hadnt agreed to the research decisionedit moore brought suit against defendants dr david w golde golde a physician who attended moore at ucla medical center the regents of the university of california regents who own and operate the university shirley g quan a researcher employed by the regents genetics institute inc genetics institute and sandoz pharmaceuticals corporation and related entities collectively sandoz the court found that moore had no property rights to his discarded cells or any profits made from them however the court concluded that the research physician did have an obligation to reveal his financial interest in the materials harvested from moore and that moore would be allowed to bring a claim for any injury that he sustained as a result of the physicians failure to disclose those circumstances the opinion written by justice edward panelli was joined by three of the seven judges of the supreme court of california the opinion first looked at moores claim of property interests under existing law the court first rejected the argument that a person has an absolute right to the unique products of their body because his products were not unique the cells are no more unique to moore than the number of vertebrae in the spine or the chemical formula of hemoglobin the court then rejected the argument that his spleen should be protected as property in order to protect moores privacy and dignity the court held these interests were already protected by informed consent the court noted laws that required the destruction of human organs as some indication that the legislature had intended to prevent patients from possessing their extracted organs finally the property at issue may not have been moores cells but the cell line created from moores cells the court then looked at the policy behind having moores cells considered property because conversion of property is a strict liability tort the court feared that extending property rights to include organs would have a chilling effect on medical research laboratories doing research receive a large volume of medical samples and could not be expected to know or discover whether somewhere down the line their samples were illegally converted furthermore moores interest in his bodily integrity and privacy are protected by the requirement of informed consent which must also inform about economic interests justice arabian wrote a concurring opinion stating that the deep philosophical moral and religious issues that are presented by this case could not be decided by the court justice broussard concurred in part and dissented in part justice mosk dissented stating that moore could have been denied some property rights and given others mosk would hold that at the very least moore had the right to do with his own tissue what the defendants did with it that is as soon as the tissue was removed moore at least had the right to choose to sell it to a laboratory or have it destroyed thus there would be no necessity to hold labs strictly liable for conversion when property rights can be broken up to allow moore to extract a significant portion of the economic value created by his tissue furthermore in order to prove damages from informed consent moore must prove both that he would not have consented to the procedure had he been properly informed and that a reasonable person would not have consented to the procedure if they had been properly informed thus moores chances of proving damages through informed consent are slim also moore could not consent to the procedure but reserve the right to sell his organs finally moore can only sue his doctor and nobody else for failing to adequately inform him thus moore is unlikely to win could not extract the economic value of his tissue even if he refused consent and could not sue the parties that might be culpable for exploiting him cultural impactedit the michael crichton book next while specifically

cristina quinonesbetancourt figure  general overview of duty to rescue generally american tort law does not impose liability on parties for failing to aid or rescue other parties the restatement second of torts §   states the fact that the actor realizes or should realize that action on his part is necessary for anothers aid or protection does not of itself impose upon him a duty to take such action however the law provides narrow exceptions in some instances when parties owe a specific duty to one another such as when parties have a special relationship special relationships special relationships apply to narrow categories of relationships figure  special relationships under modern tort law special relationships usually refer to those involving dependence or mutual dependence such as therapistpatient relationships see restatement second of torts §  tarasoff v regents of the university of california on october   university of california berkeley graduate student prosenjit poddar sought out berkeley student tatiana tarasoff while she was alone in her home shot her with a pellet gun chased her into the street with a kitchen knife and stabbed her seventeen times causing her death figure  tatiana tarasoff figure  pronsenjit poddar   podder became enamored with tatiana tarasoff and was confused and enraged when she rejected his advances on june   poddar sought and received emergency psychological treatment from dr lawrence moore a psychologist employed by the cowell memorial hospital at the university of california at berkeley figure  cowell memorial hospital poddar saw dr moore seven times  on august   during his th therapy session poddar confessed that he planned to kill tatiana tarasoff  dr moore diagnosed poddar with having an acute and severe paranoid schizophrenic reaction  he and two other doctors determined that poddar should be committed to a psychiatric hospital for observation and contacted the police however the police only briefly detained poddar releasing him after he promised to stay away from tarasoff  following poddar’s release dr harvey powelson dr moore’s superior instructed the police to return the letter from dr moore instructing them to detain poddar ordered that the letter and all notes taken on poddar be destroyed and instructed dr moore to take no further action in detaining poddar  the doctors who examined poddar never notified tarasoff or her family about poddar’s threatening statements  poddar never returned to therapy and killed tatiana tarasoff as planned people v poddar poddars criminal trial at his criminal trial poddar pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity   psychologists who evaluated poddar prior to the murder presented evidence at the trial demonstrating that poddar lacked a culpable mental state at the time of the murder because he was insane and a paranoid schizophrenic figure  normal brain left schizophrenic brain right although the trial court convicted poddar of seconddegree murder the court of appeal reduced the crime to manslaughter  on appeal the california supreme court determined that even the charge of manslaughter was too harsh under the circumstances and reversed the conviction  poddar was never retried and was allowed to return to india where he reportedly married a lawyer and led a normal life tarasoff v regents of the university of california tarasoff ii following poddar’s criminal trial tarasoff’s parents sued the psychiatrists and police who were involved in treating poddar  the charges against the police were ultimately dropped because the police were immune to the suit although the trial court and california court of appeal determined that tarasoff’s parents had no cause of action the california allowed tarasoff’s parents to amend their complaint to state the following regardless of the therapists unsuccessful attempt to confine poddar since they knew that poddar was at large and dangerous their failure to warn tatiana or others likely to apprise her of the danger constituted a breach of the therapists duty to exercise reasonable care to protect tatiana the california supreme court ultimately reversed and remanded the court of appeal’s decision in its holding the california supreme court considered the following factors foreseeability of harm to plaintiff the degree of certainty that plaintiff suffered injury the closeness of the connection between defendents conduct and the injury suffered by plaintiff the moral blame attached to defendents conduct the policy of preventing future harm the extent of the burden to defendent and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach and the availability cost and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved of these factors the california supreme court held that foreseeability was most important when establishing a duty because a defendant generally owes a duty of care to all persons endangered by his or her conduct with respect to all risks that make the conduct unreasonably dangerous moreover when the avoidance of foreseeable harm requires a defendant to control or warn about the conduct of another person a defendant is generally liable only if the defendant had a special relationship with the dangerous person or to the potential victim since the relationship between a therapist and the patient constitutes a special relationship the court determined that the defendanttherapists had a duty to use reasonable care to protect tatiana tarasoff and breached that duty the tarasoff rule when a therapist determines or pursuant to the standards of his profession should determine that his patient presents a serious danger of violence to another he incurs an obligation to use reasonable care to protect the intended victim against such danger the judgment of the therapist in diagnosing emotional disorders and in predicting whether a patient presents a serious danger of violence is comparable to the judgment which doctors and professionals must regularly render under accepted rules of responsibility in other words the court also rejected as entirely speculative the defendanttherapists predictions that imposing a duty to warn on therapists would deter some violent patients from seeking counseling and would disrupt the treatment of other patients  moreover the court concluded that the claim that psychiatric patients could be harmed if their therapist warned their potential victims was uncertain and conjectural social science evidence the difficulties of predicting dangerousness in tarasoff the defendanttherapists urged the court to consider evidence demonstrating that predictions of future dangerousness are inherently unreliable  the evidence presented by the defendants was admissible under the following admissibility tests frye general acceptance test this test states that scientific evidence may be admitted if it is both relevant to the case at bar and is generally accepted as true by the scientific community daubert sound methodology test this test requires that the scientific evidence be relevant and that it reflect good science derived through sound methodology factors that may indicate whether a piece of scientific evidence meets this test include demonstrable error rates testing peerreview and general acceptance in the scientific community federal rule of evidence  if scientific technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge skill experience training or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise if  the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data  the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods and  the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case the defendanttherapists argued that the imposition of a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect third persons was impractical because therapists could not accurately predict whether or not a patient would resort to violence   the american psychiatric association apa and other organizations agreed arguing that imposing a duty to warn on therapists would cause therapists to over predict violence make providers reluctant to treat dangerous patients make violent patients less likely to seek treatment and diminish the effectiveness of treatments the california supreme court cited to dr bernard diamond’s  article psychiatric predictions of dangerousness in which he argues that dangerousness cannot be reliably predicted  diamond’s article referred to several recent studies a study by dr carl p malmquist in which he determined that warning signs and symptoms typically found in violent offenders are also commonly found in people who never commit a violent act another study followed  patients who had previously been confined in a hospital for the criminally insane and were transferred to ordinary civil mental health hospitals after the supreme court ruled that their continued confinement violated the equal protection clause only twentysix patients committed acts serious enough to warrant their return to a maximumsecurity hospital for the criminally insane other studies demonstrate that conditions most clearly recognized as mental illness such as schizophrenia and the other psychoses are not found significantly more often in the criminal population although it agreed with the defendants’ evidence the tarasoff court ultimately held that poddar’s psychiatrists were liable for failure to warn also referred to in this case as failure to protect thompson v county of alameda the claimants brought a wrongful death action against the county of alameda following their release of james f a juvenile offender  the claimants alleged that james f knew that he had latent extremely dangerous and violent propensities regarding young children and that sexual assaults upon young children and violence connected therewith were a likely result of releasing him into the community  the claimants also maintained that james f had stated that he would kill a neighborhood child if released despite this threat the county temporarily released james f into his mother’s custody without warning local police or nearby families almost immediately james f sexually assaulted and murdered the claimant’s five yearold son  after noting that the county has discretionary authority to release james and disposing of other minor matters the court held that the county did not have a duty to warn the community prior to the release the court found that parole and probation decisions do not encourage open dialogue in the same way as psychiatristpatient relationships the court also noted that parole decisions are imprecise and cited to a study showing that that nearly  of parolees nationwide violate their probation before they have served their terms since the county functions as an arm of the public the court held that the public at large bears the cost of failed rehabilitation ultimately the supreme court of california held that the county was immune from suit under cal gov’t code section  because the decision not to warn was a matter of discretion  moreover the county also had immunity under cal gov’t code section a which grants immunity to decisions regarding the release of a prisoner explaining the verdicts at the time when tarasoff and thompson were being decided courts were moving from corrective justice to a more functional ideal in which the courts were risk regulators this functionalism enlarged the scope of tort liability in favor of furthering policy goals such as allocation of risk the california supreme court has held that foreseeability is most important factor when establishing a duty because a defendant generally owes a duty of care to all persons endangered by his conduct  when the avoidance of foreseeable harm requires a defendant to control or warn about the conduct of another person a defendant is generally liable only if the defendant had a special relationship with the dangerous person or to the potential victim  since the relationship between a therapist and his patient is a special relationship the court determined that the defendants in tarasoff had a duty to use reasonable care to protect tatiana tarasoff  moreover since the county in thompson did not have a special relationship with the claimants it was under no obligation to warn them about john f’s release legislative impact in california a psychiatrist’s duty to warn is now labeled as a duty to protect california code §  as amended in  psychotherapists duty to warn of threatened violent behavior of patient immunity from monetary liability a there shall be no monetary liability on the part of and no cause of action shall arise against any person who is a psychotherapist as defined in section  of the evidence code in failing to protect from a patients threatened violent behavior or failing to predict and protect from a patients violent behavior except if the patient has communicated to the psychotherapist a serious threat of physical violence against a reasonably identifiable victim or victims b there shall be no monetary liability on the part of and no cause of action shall arise against a psychotherapist who under the limited circumstances specified in subdivision a discharges his or her duty to protect by making reasonable efforts to communicate the threat to the victim or victims and to a law enforcement agency impact on mental health professionals the number of therapists warning potential victims have doubled therapists are more likely to take more careful and deliberate steps to determine patient dangerousness therapists have a greater awareness of the violent patients potential for acting out and use closer scrutiny and better documentation when treating their patients psychiatrists are now more careful to inform patients at the outset of treatment regarding the limits of their confidentiality studies demonstrate that tarasoff did not have disastrous results on patientspsychiatrist confidentiality as originally predicted see fillmore buckner  marvin firestone where the public peril begins  years after tarasoff  j legal med     how psychiatrists evaluate patients today while psychiatrists still use evaluative tools such as scales to diagnose and treat patients the apa practice guide states that these types of evaluative tools are not allinclusive  specifically the guidelines state rating scales should never be used alone to establish a diagnosis or clinical treatment plan they can augment but not supplant the clinicians evaluation narrative and clinical judgment psychiatrists use mental status examinations to determine whether patients pose a threat to themselves or others  this type of examination typically contains the following elements    appearance and general behavior    motor activity    speech    mood and affect    thought processes    thought content    perceptual disturbances    sensorium and cognition    insight    judgment currently the apa maintains that a psychiatrists default position is to maintain confidentiality unless the patient gives consent to a specific intervention or communication however the psychiatrist is justified in attenuating confidentiality to the extent needed to address the safety of the patient and others conclusion despite the decades since the tarasoff and thompson decisions psychiatrists today are still unable to accurately predict the dangerousness of psychiatric patients  thus in cases where a defendant’s duty to warn may stem from a third party’s potential dangerousness courts will need to continue to determine liability by weighing important policy interests against the risks posed by potentially dangerous persons instead of purely relying on psychiatrists’ predictions of dangerousness  cornell university home topics student projects expert videos about this site uc regents  university of california
