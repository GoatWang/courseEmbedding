which owns dts coffee a wholly owned foreign subsidiary entity wofe organized and existing in shanghai under the laws of the peoples republic of china in march  we completed the incorporation and licensing of dts huzhou which is a wholly owned subsidiary of dts coffee company limited in october  we obtained an exclusive license from coffee holdings company inc to roast market and sell don manuel brand  colombian coffee in the peoples republic of china taiwan thailand vietnam cambodia laos philippines myanmar indonesia east timor hong kong macau malaysia singapore and brunei  we pay a license fee for all coffee sold under the don manuel brand  the license is valid for five  years and will expire november    don manuel brand  colombian coffee beans are grown at higher elevations and

 we market and sell gourmet roasted coffee to our customers in shanghai and other parts of china  we sell gourmet roasted coffee under the dts coffee don manuel and private label brands through distribution channels that reach consumers at restaurants multilocation coffee shops and offices    we have never declared bankruptcy or been in receivership how to communicate with us our principal executive office is located at world trade center  canada place suite  vancouver bc vc e canada and the telephone number is    our registered office is located at  meridian blvd suite h minden nv usa  and that telephone number is   our sales office is located at  xikang road  putuo district shanghai  china and the telephone number is  our electronic mail address is infodtscoffeecom our business our core business revenue is derived from our coffee wholesale operations in china  dts holdings through its subsidiaries dts coffee shanghai co ltd and dts coffee huzhou co ltd is in the business of roasting marketing and selling gourmet roasted coffee to customers in shanghai and other parts of china  we source coffee beans from around the world  we sell several varieties of gourmet roasted coffee under the dts coffee label through distribution channels such as multilocation coffee shops restaurants and offices in china  as of april   approximately  of our revenue was derived from one customer  however we anticipate that our reliance on one customer will decline in the future as we obtain new customers and increase our revenue the don manuel brand is widely distributed and sold in the united states and its addition to our portfolio complements our dts coffee brand which is roasted marketed and sold to customers in shanghai and other parts of china  the combination of the don manuel and dts coffee brands allows for growth opportunities into select channels of distribution in china and different geographic territories and creates potential opportunities for the growth of our business we expect that our continuing and expanding revenue growth will come from bulk roasted coffee sales in china which offers opportunities to develop the dts coffee brand and to penetrate and capture new market segments  more specifically our objectives are to align our coffee roasting strengths and product innovation capabilities to offer a distinctive dts coffee brand experience  our expansion strategy will allow us to grow in a controlled manner by developing our own dts coffee brand and by enhancing our brands image and reputation for quality across china  the combination of our brand differentiated roasted coffee positioning based on superior quality and our strategic expansion into select distribution channels in different geographic territories creates potential opportunities for growth  we believe that our commitment to quality will establish a high degree of repeat business and customer loyalty principal products we believe that our products provide flavor and characteristics suited for chinese consumers  we choose our raw coffee beans for their richness in aroma and flavor from coffee producers throughout the world  our coffee beans are grown by farmers in colombia brazil indonesia kenya guatemala papua new guinea and ethiopia  our coffees are available for sale in standard sizes of g g and kg  in addition to our current three signature blends we also sell don manuel and other blends under inhouse labels  we market our coffees in two main categories gourmet whole bean and private label whole bean  we also roast and market specific blends of roasted coffees on a private label basis  these private label productions are based on individual arrangements with each customer  manufacturing as of the date of this report we own and operate a coffee roasting factory in nanxun town huzhou zhejiang china  we use a probat coffee roasting machine along with a profile roasting system to accurately program the coffee roasting curve by modifying heat levels that are applied at various intervals  it enables the coffees degree of acidity or bitterness to be accurately controlled and several taste profiles can also be created from the same green coffee blend  we use packaging bags made with a freshness valve to allow for a oneway flow of air to ensure that the coffee maintains freshness and remains fresh for a longer period of time coffee bean suppliers coffee is an agricultural crop that undergoes price fluctuations and quality differences depending on the weather and economic and political conditions in coffeeproducing countries  we purchase coffee from coffee brokers who supply us with quality green bean coffees from different countries we depend upon outside trading companies and exporters for their supply of coffee in order to maintain our coffee blends we require a continuous supply of similar coffees  accordingly we routinely negotiate with the exporters or trading companies to purchase coffee tied to the specific new york c futures coffee contract market prices for future deliveries of coffee  the new york c futures coffee contract trades on the new york coffee sugar  cocoa exchange  the quality of the coffee is determined by testing the grades of coffee and by cup tasting for flavor  we do not depend on any one brokerexporter to supply all of our coffee because a disruption in the supply from one brokerexporter may not be able to be remedied quickly or cost effectively potential customers in china of roasted coffee the chinese coffee market is characterized by a gradual shift in demand towards gourmet whole bean and ground coffee products away from instant coffee  the trend towards discovering richer coffee taste can be seen in the current proliferation of coffee cafés across china  the demand for betterquality and richertasting coffee is also increasing at home work and restaurants china continues to experience  to  annual growth in the consumption of coffee  led initially by starbucks consumers in china are learning to drink and appreciate coffee beverages  as a result more gourmet coffee cafe chain stores are opening all over china  we offer consumers in china several varieties of gourmet coffees  our dts coffee is sold in coffee shops restaurants and offices in china  we sell high quality gourmet coffee to individual coffee shops which is roasted in small batches on a private label basis pricing and competition our dts coffee brand of gourmet roasted coffees competes directly against other local and imported coffees sold at coffee retailers discount stores and a growing number of coffee stores  many coffee companies like starbucks costa illy coffee beanery and tea and gloria jean are operating retail outlets and sell whole bean coffees through these channels  the gourmet specialty market is highly competitive and contains competitors with substantially greater financial marketing and operating resources than we have  we are targeting the growing segment of coffee drinkers by offering these consumers the opportunity of drinking quality gourmet coffee we also compete directly against all other coffee brands in the chinese marketplace  we face competition from a number of large multinational consumer product companies like nestle inc as well as local coffee bean companies  competition in the coffee market is becoming increasingly intense as relatively low barriers to entry encourage new competitors to enter the market  we believe that our customers choose based upon the quality and variety of the coffee  we believe consumers differentiate coffee brands based on freshness as an element of coffee quality  to our knowledge few significant competitors focus on custom roasting and product freshness in the same manner as we do  government regulations as of the date of this report our management is unaware of any other federal or state laws and regulations in the united states that would apply to our

make a variety of estimates and assumptions that affect  the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods covered by the financial statements  our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the future resolution of the uncertainties increase these judgments become even more subjective and complex  although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable actual results may differ significantly from these estimates  changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results of operation andor financial condition  we have identified certain accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations  our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note  to the financial statements included in this report revenue recognition we derive our revenue

delivery of coffee to the customers property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost  depreciation is provided using the straightline or accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets  the useful lives of property plant and equipment for purposes of computing depreciation are five to ten years for equipment  we evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired we determine impairment by comparing the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by these assets to their respective carrying amounts  maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred  replacements and betterments are capitalized  the cost and related reserves of assets sold or retired are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in results of operations receivables trade accounts receivable are recorded at the net realizable value and do not bear interest  no allowance for doubtful accounts was made during the years ended april   and  based on managements best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable  we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts based upon knowledge of our customers and their compliance with credit terms the evaluation process includes a review of customers accounts on a regular basis  the

estimates used to prepare the financial statements they may not reflect the financial position cash flows and results of operations of the company in the future or its operations cash flows and

disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published and the reported amounts of revenues goodwill impairment and   expenses during the

normal course of the business the company has incurred material losses from operations at april   the company had a working capital deficit of  in addition to limited cash limited revenue and unprofitable operations for the fiscal year ended april   the company sustained net losses and generated negative cash flows from operations these factors among others raise substantial doubt about

huzhou co ltd all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation use of estimates  in preparing financial statements in conformity with us gaap management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues goodwill impairment and expenses during the reporting periods management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made however actual results could differ materially from those estimates concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable as of april   and  substantially all of the companys cash and cash equivalents were held by major financial institutions located in the peoples republic of china which management believes are of high credit quality with respect to accounts receivable the company extends credit based on an evaluation of the customers financial condition the company generally does not require collateral for accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts of accounts receivable if necessary cash and cash equivalents cash equivalents comprise certain highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased as at april   and  cash and cash equivalents consist of cash only receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value and do not bear interest no allowance for doubtful accounts was made during the years ended april   and  based on managements best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable the company evaluates its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon knowledge of its customers and their compliance with credit terms the evaluation process includes a review of customers accounts on a regular basis the review process evaluates all account balances with amounts outstanding for more than  days and other specific amounts for which information obtained indicates that the balance may be uncollectible as of april   and  there was no allowance for doubtful accounts the company does not have any offbalancesheet credit exposure related to its customers inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market the cost for inventories is determined using the firstin firstout method the cost includes all expenditures incurred in bringing the goods to the point of sale and putting them in a sellable condition in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories the management makes judgments as to future demand requirements compared to  current or committed inventory levels the company estimates the demand requirements based on market conditions forecasts prepared by its customers sales contracts and orders in hand in addition the company estimates net realizable value based on intended use current market value and inventory aging analyses the company writes down inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and their estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions inventories principally consist of green coffee beans roasted coffee beans and packing supplies property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost cost represents the purchase price of the asset and other costs incurred to bring the asset into its existing use depreciation is provided on straightline basis over their estimated useful lives as set out below major remodels and improvements are capitalized maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the life of the respective assets are charged to expense as incurred upon sale or disposition the applicable amounts of asset cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount less proceeds from disposal is charged or credited to income   useful life residue value machinery equipment  years  office equipment  years  production equipment  years  vehicles  years  leasehold improvements  years  impairment of longlived assets the company accounts for impairment of property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets in accordance with asc  accounting for impairment of longlived assets and longlived assets to be disposed of which requires the company to evaluate a longlived asset for recoverability when there is event or circumstance that indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of a longlived asset or asset group is not recoverable when carrying amount exceeds the gross undiscounted cash flows from use and disposition and is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the assets or asset groups fair value there was no impairment of longlived assets for the years ended april   and  fair value of financial instruments asc  fair value measurements and disclosures adopted january   defines fair value establishes a threelevel valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures the companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents current receivables and payables and derivative liabilities these financial instruments are measured at their respective fair values the three levels are defined as follows level   inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets level   inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instruments level   inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value   the company has determined that certain convertible notes covered by these financial statements qualifies as derivative financial instruments under the provisions of fasb asc topic no   derivatives and hedging  contracts in an entitys own stock see note  for more details estimating the fair value of derivative financial instruments requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that may and are likely to change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors the assumptions used to value the companys derivatives will have a direct effect on the fair values in addition valuation techniques are sensitive to changes in the trading market price of the companys common stock and its estimated volatility and interest rate changes and other variables or market conditions not within the companys control that can significantly affect managements estimates of fair value and changes in fair value because derivative financial instruments are initially and  subsequently carried at fair value the companys net income may include significant charges or credits as these estimates and assumptions change the fair value of the derivative liabilities was determined using the blackscholes model with any change in fair value during the period recorded in earnings as change in fair value of derivative liabilities significant inputs used to calculate the fair value of the derivative liabilities include expected volatility riskfree interest rate and dividend yield for cash and cash equivalents accounts receivables prepaid expenses and accounts payable and accruals it is managements opinion that the carrying values are a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and if applicable their stated interest rate approximates current rates available management believes it is not practical to estimate the fair value of related party payables because the transactions cannot be assumed to have been consummated at arms length the terms are not deemed to be market terms there are no quoted values available for these instruments and an independent valuation would not be practical due to the lack of data regarding similar instruments if any and the associated potential costs revenue recognition the company derives its revenue from the sale of roasted coffee revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery occurs the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured coffees are considered delivered when title and risk have been transferred to the customer retail sales are recorded when payment is tendered at the point of sale wholesale sales are recorded upon delivery of coffee to the customers in the peoples republic of china a value added tax vat of  on invoiced amount is collected on behalf of tax authorities revenues represent the invoiced value of goods sold net of vat advertising and promotion costs advertising and promotion costs are expensed as incurred for the years ended april   and  the company did not incur any advertising costs income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes pursuant to asc  income taxes asc  requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes and allows recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years under the asset and liability approach deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the company is able to realize their benefits or that future deductibility is uncertain the provision for income taxes represents current taxes payable net of the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities comprehensive income the company has adopted asc  reporting comprehensive income which requires inclusion of foreign currency translation adjustments reported separately in its statement of stockholders equity in other comprehensive income during the periods presented other comprehensive income includes cumulative translation adjustment from foreign currency translation foreign currency translation the companys functional and reporting currency is united states dollars usd the functional currency of the companys subsidiaries dts coffee and dts huzhou in the peoples republic of china is chinese currency renminbi rmb since rmb is not freely convertible into foreign currencies all foreign exchange transactions involving rmb must take place either through

respective periods  for financial reporting purposes the financial statements of the companys subsidiaries dts coffee and dts huzhou in the peoples republic of china are maintained in rmb and translated into usd balance sheet accounts with the exception of equity are translated using the closing exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date income and expense accounts are translated

that examples included in asc c are not exhaustive lists of items that should be considered management considered all known events and circumstances that could trigger an impairment of goodwill management concluded that events rose indicating impairment of the goodwill during the years ended april   the general economic conditions in shanghai china are considered positive however the events indicating impairment included the companys inability to raise large public or private equity financing in the united states the companys ability to access capital to fund its business operations

losses it requires working capital to fund its business and be successful in generating increased revenue accordingly based on a qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount of the goodwill management carried the second step of the impairment testing procedure it included determining the recoverable amount book value and fair value of the reporting unit estimating fair value is performed by utilizing various valuation techniques with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow the impairment review is highly judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions have a significant impact on the amount of any impairment charge recorded discounted cash flow methods are dependent upon assumptions of future sales trends market conditions and cash flows of each reporting unit over several years actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those previously forecasted other significant assumptions include growth rates and the discount rate applicable to future cash flows  based on this evaluation the recorded goodwill value exceeded the implied value of the goodwill accordingly management recognized  of goodwill impairment loss for the year ended april   it is possible that the assumptions used by management related to the evaluation may change or that actual results may vary significantly from managements estimates    changes in the carrying amount of the goodwill for the years ended april   and  are as

executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting  the internal control process has been designed under our supervision to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states   management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of april   including i the control environment ii risk assessment iii control activities iv information and communication and v monitoring  based on this assessment management has determined that due to the material weaknesses described below our internal control over financial reporting as of april   was not effective our management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting i inadequate segregation of duties ii lack of a functioning audit committee and outside directors on the companys board of directors our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not  prevent or detect misstatements  therefore the systems can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their

of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control of financial reporting established in sec guidance on conducting such assessments based on this evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting has material weaknesses mainly due to the fact we have a sole director   the matter involving internal controls and procedures that the companys management considered to be a material weakness under the standards of the public company accounting oversight board was the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the companys board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls we have established a formal review process of significant accounting transactions that includes participation of the chief executive officer the financial controller and the companys corporate legal counsel and will form an audit committee made up of independent directors to be appointed when funding permits we will then establish policies and procedures that will provide the board of directors a formal review process that will among other things assure that management controls and procedures are in place and being maintained consistently the aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by the companys chief executive officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of april   management believes that the material weakness identified above did not influence the companys financial results however management believes that inadequate segregation of duties and lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the companys board of directors could result in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures in the companys determination to its financial statements for future years we are committed to improving internal control over financial reporting  as part of this commitment we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to the company   in addition we will appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the audit committee of the board of directors resulting in a fully functioning audit committee which will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures management believes that the appointment of outside directors who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on the companys board in addition management believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the material weakness this coupled with the appointment of additional outside directors will greatly decrease any control and procedure issues the company may encounter in the future we will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis
