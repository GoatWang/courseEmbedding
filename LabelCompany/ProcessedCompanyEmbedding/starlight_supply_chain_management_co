result of their utilization of our scm processes recently we entered into an agreement with china postal bank through which our customers will be able to obtain financing if they satisfy the criteria

competitive advantage and will assist our customers to obtain financing which they would otherwise have difficulty obtaining on their own the availability of financing for raw materials and components

offerings pricing delivery times and aftersales support we consider our closest competitor to be shenzhen eternal asia supply chain management ltd as well as the larger trading companies and importers

in our other reports and filings our business financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected by these and other risks risks related to our business our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and results of operations the company is in the process of developing its business and has a limited operating history you should consider our future prospects in light of the risks and uncertainties experienced by early stage companies some of these risks and uncertainties relate to our ability to offer products of sufficient quality to attract and retain a larger customer base attract additional customers and increase spending per customer increase awareness of our products and continue to develop customer loyalty respond to competitive market conditions respond to changes in our regulatory environment maintain effective control of our costs and expenses raise sufficient capital to sustain and expand our business and attract retain and motivate qualified personnel if we are unsuccessful in addressing any of these risks and uncertainties our business may be materially and adversely affected our business is sensitive to general economic conditions our business may be negatively affected by a downturn in general economic conditions in major importing countries and regions and rising labor and material costs in china negative perception or publicity of chinese products may hurt our business any negative perception or publicity of chinese products may cause a decline in demand for chinese products outside of china and in turn negatively affect our sales and revenue we envision a period of rapid growth that may impose a significant burden on our administrative and operational resources which if not effectively managed could impair our growth based upon managements experience with other supply chain management companies and our experience during the six month period ended october   we envision a period of rapid growth that may impose a significant burden on our administrative and operational resources the growth of our business will require significant investments of capital and managements close attention our ability to effectively manage our growth will require us to substantially expand the capabilities of our administrative and operational resources and to attract train manage and retain qualified management it sales and marketing and other personnel we may be unable to do so in addition our failure to successfully manage our growth could result in our sales not increasing commensurately with capital investments if we are unable to successfully manage our growth we may be unable to achieve our goals we may not be able to raise the additional capital necessary to execute our business strategy which could result in the curtailment of our operations we will need to raise additional funds to fully fund our existing operations and for development and expansion of our business we have no current arrangements with respect to sources of additional financing and the needed additional financing may not be available on commercially reasonable terms on a timely basis or at all the inability to obtain additional financing when needed would have a negative effect on us including possibly requiring us to curtail our operations if any future financing involves the sale of equity securities the shares of common stock held by our stockholders could be substantially diluted if we borrow money or issue debt securities the company will be subject to the risks associated with indebtedness including the risk that interest rates may fluctuate and the possibility that it may not be able to pay principal and interest on the indebtedness when due insufficient funds will prevent us from implementing our business plan and will require us to delay scale back or eliminate certain of our operations we will be required to hire and retain skilled managerial personnel it and sales and marketing personnel our continued success depends in large part on our ability to attract train motivate and retain qualified management it sales and marketing personnel any failure to attract and retain the required managerial and technical personnel that are integral to our business may have a negative impact on the operation of sing kong which would have a negative impact on revenues there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain skilled persons and the loss of skilled technical personnel would adversely affect us we are dependent upon our officers and management for direction and the loss of any of these persons could adversely affect our operations and results we are dependent upon our officers for implementation of our proposed strategy and execution of our business plan the loss of any of our officers could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial position we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our officers the loss of any of our officers could delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives we may be sued or become a party to litigation which could require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses and may result in an unfavorable outcome which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we may be subject to a number of lawsuits from time to time arising in the ordinary course of our business the expense of defending ourselves against such litigation may be significant the amount of time to resolve these lawsuits is unpredictable and defending ourselves may divert managements attention from the daytoday operations of our business which could adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows in addition an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud as a result stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures are designed to prevent fraud any failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations ineffective internal control could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in starlight sing konghk and sing kongchina as defined in regulationb under the exchange act a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis specifically we determined that we had the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting i we have limited controls over information processing ii we haveinadequate segregation of duties iiiwe do not have a formal audit committee with a financial expert and iv we do not have sufficient formal written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america or gaap and sec guidelines starlight has in the past and we intend in the future to utilize a third party independent contractor for the preparation of our financial statements in an effort to remediate the deficiency the implementation of this initiative will not fully address any material weakness or other deficiencies that we may have in our internal control over financial reporting although the financial statements and footnotes are reviewed by our management we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment of such transactions the third party independent contractor is not involved in the day to day operations of the company and may not be provided information from management on a timely basis to allow for adequate reportingconsideration of certain transactions even if we develop effective internal controls over financial reporting such controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with such policies or procedures may deteriorate which could result in the discovery of additional material weaknesses and deficiencies in any event the process of determining whether our existing internal control over financial reporting is compliant with section of the sarbanesoxley act section and sufficiently effective requires the investment of substantial time and resources by our senior management as a result this process may divert internal resources and take a significant amount of time and effort to complete in addition we cannot predict the outcome of this process and whether we will need to implement remedial actions in order to establish effective controls over financial reporting the determination of whether or not our internal controls are sufficient and any remedial actions required could result in us incurring additional costs that we did not anticipate including the hiring of additional outside consultants we may also fail to timely complete our evaluation testing and any remediation required to comply with section we are required to section to furnish a report by management on among other things the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting however for as long as we are a smaller reporting company our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting to section while we could be a smaller reporting company for an indefinite amount of time and thus relieved of the abovementioned attestation requirement an independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could detect problems that our managements assessment might not such undetected material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation our independent auditors have issued an audit opinion for our company which includes a statement describing our going concern status our financial status creates a doubt whether we will continue as a going concern our auditors have issued a going concern opinion regarding our company this means there is substantial doubt we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty regarding our ability to continue in business as such we may have to cease operations and investors could lose part or all of their investment in our company risks related to the peoples republic of china our chinese operations subject us to certain risks inherent in conducting business operations in china including political instability and foreign government regulation which could significantly impact our ability to operate in such countries and impact our results of operations we conduct substantially all of our business in chinaour chinese operations are and will be subject to risks generally associated with conducting businesses in foreign countries such as foreign laws and regulations that may be materially different from those of the united states changes in applicable laws and regulations challenges to or failure of title labor and political unrest foreign currency fluctuations changes in foreign economic and political conditions export and import restrictions tariffs customs duties and other trade barriers difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations longer time periods in collecting revenues difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and enforcing agreements possible loss of properties due to nationalization or expropriation and limitations on repatriation of income or capital specifically foreign governments may enact and enforce laws and regulations requiring increased ownership by businesses andor state agencies which could adversely affect our ownership interests in then existing ventures the companys ownership structure may not be adequate to accomplish its business objectives in china foreign governments also may impose additional taxes andor royalties on our business which would adversely affect our profitability in certain locations governments have imposed restrictions controls and taxes and in others political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and our continued presence in those countries internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a foreign government and sing kong or other governments may adversely affect our operations these developments may at times significantly affect our results of operations and must be carefully considered by our management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries chinas economic policies could affect our business substantially all of our assets are located in china and substantially all of our revenue is derived from our operations in china accordingly our results of operations and prospects are subject to a significant extent to economic political and legal developments in china while chinas economy has experienced significant growth in the past twenty years growth has been irregular both geographically and among various sectors of the economy the chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources some of these measures benefit the overall economy of china but may also have a negative effect on us for example our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by the government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations the economy of china has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more marketoriented economy in recent years the chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform and the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of corporate governance in business enterprises however a substantial portion of productive assets in china are still owned by the chinese government in addition the chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies it also exercises significant control over china’s economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currencydenominated obligations setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies fluctuation of the rmb may affect our financial condition by affecting the volume of crossborder money flow the value of the rmb fluctuates and is subject to changes in the prcs political and economic conditions since july  the conversion of rmb into foreign currencies including usd has been based on rates set by the peoples bank of china which are set based upon the interbank foreign exchange market rates and current exchange rates of a basket of currencies on the world financial markets we may face obstacles from the communist system in the prc foreign companies conducting operations in the prc face significant political economic and legal risks the communist regime in the prc including a stifling bureaucracy may hinder western investment we may have difficulty establishing adequate management legal and financial controls in the prc the prc historically has been deficient in western  because our assets and operations are located in china you may have difficulty enforcing any civil liabilities against us under the securities and other laws of the united states or any state we are a holding company and all of our assets are located in the prc in addition our directors and officers are nonresidents of the united states and all or a substantial portion of the assets of these nonresidents are located outside the united states as a result it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the united states upon these nonresidents or to enforce against them judgments obtained in united states courts including judgments based upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state there is uncertainty as to whether courts of the prc would enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us or these nonresidents based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state or in original actions brought in the prc liabilities against us or nonresidents predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state enforcement of a foreign judgment in the prc also may be limited or otherwise affected by applicable bankruptcy insolvency liquidation arrangement moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally and will be subject to a statutory limitation of time within which proceedings may be brought the prc legal system embodies uncertainties which could limit law enforcement availability the prc legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes unlike common law systems decided legal cases have little precedence in  the prc government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general the overall effect of legislation over the past  years has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investment in china our prc operating subsidiary and affiliate is subject to prc laws and regulations however these laws and regulations change frequently and the interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties for instance we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce the legal protection that we are entitled to by law or contract however since prc administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting statutory and contractual terms it may be difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative court proceedings and the level of law enforcement that we would receive in more developed legal systems such uncertainties including the inability to enforce our contracts could affect our business and operation in addition confidentiality protections in china may not be as effective as in the united states or other countries accordingly we cannot predict the effect of future developments in the prc legal system particularly with regard to our business including the promulgation of new laws this may include changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement thereof or the preemption of local regulations by national laws these uncertainties could limit the availability of law enforcement including our ability to enforce our agreements risks related to starlights stock there can be no assurance that a liquid public market for our common stock will exist although starlights shares of common stock are eligible for quotation on the otc markets no shares trade on a regular basis and there may not be a significant market in such stock in the future there can be no assurance that a regular and established market will be developed and maintained for our common stock nor can there be any assurance as to the strength or liquidity of any market for our common stock or the prices at which holders may be able to sell their shares it is likely that there will be significant volatility in the trading price of our common stock in the event that a public market for our common stock is created or maintained in the future market prices for the common stock will be influenced by many factors and will be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in operating results of sing kong and other factors our stock price will also be affected by the trading price of the stock of our competitors investor perceptions of sing kong interest rates general economic conditions and those specific to our industry developments with regard to sing kongs operations and activities our future financial condition and changes in our management risks relating to low priced stocks although starlights common stock currently is quoted and traded on the otc markets the price at which the stock will trade in the future cannot currently be estimated the trading price of the common stock will most likely be below  if our common stock trades below  per share trading in the common stock may be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the exchange act which require additional disclosure by brokerdealers in connection with any trades involving a stock defined as a penny stock generally any nonnasdaq equity security that has a market price share of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions and a two business day cooling off period before brokerdealers can effect transactions in penny stocks for these types of transactions the brokerdealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to the sale the brokerdealer also must disclose the commissions payable to the brokerdealer current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock and if the brokerdealer is the sole marketmaker the brokerdealer must disclose this fact and the brokerdealers presumed control over the market these and the other burdens imposed upon brokerdealers by the penny stock requirements could discourage brokerdealers from effecting transactions in our common stock which could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of holders of our common stock to sell it we do not intend to pay dividends we have not paid any cash dividends on any of our securities since inception and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on any of our securities in the foreseeable future future sales of our securities or the perception in the markets that these sales may occur could depress our stock price following the consummation of the transaction we will have issued and outstanding approximately  shares of common stock of this amount only  shares are unrestricted the balance of  will be eligible for public sale only if registered under the securities act or if the stockholder qualifies for an exemption from registration under rule  or rule  under the securities act or other applicable exemption the market price of our capital stock could drop significantly if the holders of these restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them these factors also could make it more difficult for us to raise capital or make acquisitions through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities the ability of the board of directors of starlight to issue blank check preferred stock and any antitakeover provisions we adopt may depress the value of our common stock the authorized capital of starlight includes  shares of blank check preferred stockthe starlight board has the power to issue any or all of the authorized but unissued shares of its preferred stock including the authority to establish one or more series and to fix the powers preferences rights and limitations of such class or series without seeking stockholder approvalthey may in the future adopt antitakeover measuresthe authority of the starlight board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock and any future antitakeover measures it may adopt may in certain circumstances delay deter or prevent takeover attempts and other changes in control of starlight not approved by its board of directorsas a result starlight stockholders may lose opportunities to dispose of their shares at favorable prices generally available in takeover attempts or that may be available under a merger proposal and the market price of the common stock and the voting and other rights of its stockholders may also be affected risks related to our structure if the prc government deems that the contractual arrangements in relation to our variable interest entity do not comply with prc governmental restrictions on foreign investment or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations changes in the future we could be subject to penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations in order to simplify the acquisition of sing kong we adopted a structure whereby we will provide our services through a prc incorporated variable interest entity the variable interest entity is owned by qu ting ting the chief executive officer of the variable interest entity the contractual arrangements give us effective control over the variable interest entity and enable us to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits arising from the variable interest entity as well as consolidate the financial results of the variable interest entity in our results of operations although the structure we have adopted is consistent with longstanding industry practice and is commonly adopted by comparable companies in china the prc government may not agree that these arrangements comply with prc licensing registration or other regulatory requirements with existing policies or with requirements or policies that may be adopted in the future in addition the contractual arrangements between our whollyforeign owned entity our variable interest entity and our variable interest entity equity holder governed by prc law may be held not to be valid binding and enforceable in accordance with their terms and applicable prc laws and regulations it is uncertain whether any new prc laws rules or regulations relating to variable interest entity structures will be adopted or if adopted what they would provide if we or our variable interest entity is found to be in violation of any existing or future prc laws rules or regulations or fails to obtain or maintain any of the required permits or approvals the relevant prc regulatory authorities would have broad discretion to take action in dealing with such violations or failures including revoking the business and operating license of our prc subsidiary or the variable interest entity requiring us to discontinue or restrict our operations restricting our right to collect revenue requiring us to restructure our operations or taking other regulatory or enforcement actions against us the imposition of any of these measures could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct all or any portion of our business operations in addition it is unclear what impact the prc government actions would have on us and on our ability to consolidate the financial results of our variable interest entity in our consolidated financial statements if the prc government authorities were to find our legal structure and contractual arrangements to be in violation of prc laws rules and regulations if the imposition of any of these government actions causes us to lose our right to direct the activities of our variable interest entity or otherwise separate from that entity and if we are not able to restructure our ownership structure and operations in a satisfactory manner we would no longer be able to consolidate the financial results of our variable interest entity in our consolidated financial statements any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing control over the variable interest entity as direct ownership we rely on contractual arrangements with our variable interest entity to operate our business for a description of these contractual arrangements see contractual arrangements among our whollyforeign owned entity variable interest entity and the variable interest entity equity holder these contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us with control over our variable interest entity if we had direct ownership of the variable interest entity we would be able to exercise our rights as an equity holder directly to effect changes in the board of directors of that entity which could effect changes at the management and operational level under our contractual arrangements we may not be able to directly change the members of the board of directors of that entity and would have to rely on the variable interest entity and the variable interest entity equity holder to perform their obligations in order to exercise our control over the variable interest entity the variable interest entity equity holder may have conflicts of interest with us or our shareholders and she may not act in the best interests of our company or may not perform her obligations under these contracts for example our variable interest entity and its equity holder could breach their contractual arrangements with us by among other things failing to conduct operations in an acceptable manner or taking other actions that are detrimental to our interests to the exclusive option agreement we may replace the equity holder of the variable interest entity at any time to the contractual arrangements however if the equity holder is uncooperative and any dispute relating to the contract or the replacement of the equity holder remains unresolved we will have to enforce our rights under the contractual arrangement through the operations of prc law and arbitral agencies which may be costly and timeconsuming and will be subject to uncertainties in the prc legal system any failure by our variable interest entity or its equity holder to perform their obligations under the contractual arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations consequently the contractual arrangements may not be as effective in ensuring our control over our business operations as direct ownership any failure by our variable interest entity or its equity holder to perform their obligations under the contractual arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if our variable interest entity or its equity holder fails to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangement we may have to incur substantial costs and expend additional resources to enforce such arrangements although we have entered into an option agreement in relation to our variable interest entity which provides that we may exercise an option to acquire or nominate a person to acquire ownership of the equity in that entity to the extent permitted by applicable prc laws rules and regulations the exercise of this option is subject to the review and approval of the relevant prc governmental authorities we have also entered into an equity interest pledge agreement with respect to our variable interest entity to secure certain obligations of such variable interest entity or its equity holder to us under the contractual arrangements however the enforcement of such agreements through arbitral or judicial agencies may be costly and timeconsuming and will be subject to uncertainties in the prc legal system in addition although the terms of the contractual arrangements provide that they will be binding on the successors of the variable interest entity equity holder as those successors are not a party to the agreements it is uncertain whether the successors in case of the death bankruptcy or divorce of the variable interest entity equity holder will be subject to or will be willing to honor the obligations of such variable interest entity equity holder under the contractual arrangements if the variable interest entity or its equity holder or its successor as applicable fails to transfer the shares of the variable interest entity according to the option agreement or equity interest pledge agreement we would need to enforce our rights under the option agreement or equity pledge agreement which may be costly and timeconsuming and may not be successful the contractual arrangements are governed by prc law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in china accordingly these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with prc law and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with prc legal procedures the legal system in the prc is not as developed as in some other jurisdictions such as the united states moreover there are very few precedents and little formal guidance as to how contractual arrangements in the context of a variable interest entity should be interpreted or enforced under prc law and as a result it may be difficult to predict how an arbitration panel would view such contractual arrangements as a result uncertainties in the prc legal system could limit our ability to enforce the contractual arrangements under prc law if the losing parties fail to carry out the arbitration awards within a prescribed time limit the prevailing parties may only enforce the arbitration awards in prc courts which would require additional expense and delay in the event we are unable to enforce the contractual arrangements we may not be able to exert effective control over the variable interest entity and our ability to conduct our business as well as our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected we may lose the ability to use or otherwise benefit from the licenses approvals and assets held by our variable interest entity which could severely disrupt our business render us unable to conduct some or all of our business operations and constrain our growth although the significant majority of our revenues will be generated and the significant majority of our operational assets will be held by our whollyforeign owned entity which is our subsidiary our variable interest entity holds licenses and approvals and assets that are necessary for our business operations the contractual arrangements contain terms that specifically obligate the variable interest entity equity holder to ensure the valid existence of the variable interest entity and restrict the disposal of material assets of the variable interest entity however in the event the variable interest entity equity holder breaches the terms of these contractual arrangements and voluntarily liquidates our variable interest entity or our variable interest entity declares bankruptcy and all or part of its assets become subject to liens or rights of thirdparty creditors or are otherwise disposed of without our consent we may be unable to conduct some or all of our business operations or otherwise benefit from the assets held by the variable interest entity which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore if our variable interest entity undergoes a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding its equity holder or unrelated thirdparty creditors may claim rights to some or all of the assets of such variable interest entity thereby hindering our ability to operate our business as well as constrain our growth the equity holder directors and executive officers of the variable interest entity may have potential conflicts of interest with our company prc laws provide that a director and an executive officer owe a fiduciary duty to the company he or she directs or manages the directors and executive officers of the variable interest entity must act in good faith and in the best interests of the variable interest entity and must not use their respective positions for personal gain we cannot assure you that ms qu will always act in the best interests of our company should any conflicts of interest arise or that any conflicts of interest will always be resolved in our favor we also cannot assure you that ms qu will ensure that the variable interest entity will not breach the existing contractual arrangements if we cannot resolve any such conflicts of interest or any related disputes we would have to rely on legal proceedings to resolve these disputes andor take enforcement action under the contractual arrangements there is substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings see any failure by our variable interest entity or its equity holder to perform its obligations under the contractual arrangements would have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the contractual arrangements with our variable interest entity may be subject to scrutiny by the prc tax authorities any adjustment of related party transaction pricing could lead to additional taxes and therefore substantially reduce our consolidated net income the tax regime in china is rapidly evolving and there is significant uncertainty for taxpayers in china as prc tax laws may be interpreted in significantly different ways the prc tax authorities may assert that we or our subsidiary or the variable interest entity or its equity holder owe andor are required to pay additional taxes on previous or future revenue or income in particular under applicable prc laws rules and regulations arrangements and transactions among related parties such as the contractual arrangements with our variable interest entity may be subject to audit or challenge by the prc tax authorities if the prc tax authorities determine that any contractual arrangements were not entered into on an arms length basis and therefore constitute a favorable transfer pricing the prc tax liabilities of the subsidiary andor variable interest entity andor variable interest entity equity holder could be increased which could increase our overall tax liabilities in addition the prc tax authorities may impose late payment interest our net income may be materially reduced if our tax liabilities increase changes to prc tax laws may subject us to greater taxes we base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various administrative regions and countries in which we have assets or conduct activities however our tax position is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law which may have retroactive effect we cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may require us to pay taxes or make payments in lieu of taxes selected consolidated financial data you should read the summary consolidated financial data set forth below in conjunction

of shares of our common stock to the sing kong stockholders on november   the closing date sing konghk became our whollyowned subsidiary and the sing kong stockholders became the owners of approximately  of our voting stock the acquisition of sing konghk by us will be accounted for as a reverse merger because on a postmerger basis the former shareholders of sing konghk held a majority of our outstanding common stock on a voting and fullydiluted basis as a result sing konghk is deemed to be the acquirer for accounting purposes sing kongchina was incorporated in shenzhen under the

shares of common stock and no shares of preferred stock and immediately after the closing of the transaction our total number of outstanding shares of common stock is approximately  and the number of outstanding shares of preferred stock is nil the holders of the common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor the company has not paid cash dividends in the past and does not expect to pay any within the foreseeable future since any earnings are expected to be reinvested in the company in the event of liquidation dissolution or winding up of the company either voluntarily or involuntarily each outstanding share of common stock is entitled to share equally in the company’s assets each outstanding share of common stock is entitled to equal voting rights consisting of one vote per share our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more classes or series within a class upon authority of the board without further stockholder approval any preferred stock issued in the future may rank senior to the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or amounts upon liquidation dissolution or winding up of us or both in addition any such shares of preferred stock may have class or series voting rights moreover under certain circumstances the issuance of preferred stock or the existence of the unissued preferred stock might tend to discourage or render more difficult a merger or other change in control the issuance of preferred stock while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or of discouraging a third party from acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock market price of and dividends on common equity and related stockholder matters our common stock is not listed on any stock exchange however it is eligible for quotation on the otc pink market under the symbol slsc there has been no trading in the companys common stock however we anticipate that
