insight into his time in the cia beginning in  when he basically set the stage for the us governments policies for cyber security and a new age of espionage hayden says his recent tome is his best effort to show to the american people what their intelligence services actually do on their behalf the title was borrowed from sports terminology referring to how a good athlete will take advantage of the entire field right up to sideline markers and endlines he acknowledges that espionage often proves controversial and i fear we will not be able to do that in the future without our publics deeper

intelligence committee may  credit jim watsonagence francepresse — getty images if michael v hayden were a businessman he might be called a turnaround artist when he was named by president george w bush to take over the central intelligence agency in mid it was in wide disrepute it had failed to break up the  plot it couldn’t find osama bin laden it had rubberstamped phony intelligence about saddam hussein’s nonexistent weapons of mass destruction enabling the catastrophic war in iraq revelations of waterboarding and other “enhanced interrogation techniques” carried out at cia “black sites” had provoked revulsioneven the agency’s seventhfloor executive suite reeked of malfeasance and chaos yellow crimescene tape was draped across the doorway of its thirdranking official who had been arrested on bribery charges other top officers had quit or were heading for the door under the fumbling nearcomical administration of hayden’s predecessor porter goss a former republican congressman adding insult to injuries congress had stripped the cia of its year primacy among the  united states intelligence agencies creating a new überbureaucracy that would supposedly ride herd on them allhayden was undaunted in  he’d become head of a hidebound creaking national security agency shaved off management fat and pumped new muscle into its collection capabilities but the nation’s premier espionage service was in many ways a harder case“the cia deeply engaged in multiple wars was suffering from a kind of battered child syndrome” he writes it needed time on the couch and a housecleaning “when i’d taken over nsa in  it needed to be shaken up now that i would be leading cia i knew it needed to be settled down” he writes in a surprisingly vivid albeit acronymheavy memoir that probably only a beltway insider could truly love advertisement continue reading the main story “playing to the edge” hayden says is his “best effort to show to the american people what their intelligence services actually do on their behalf” but it’s really more about what cia directors spend most of their time doing which in hayden’s case amounted mostly to skirmishing with congress huddling with the white house and flying around the world to meet with his spyservice counterparts continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story during hayden’s tenure trekking to capitol hill rarely ended happily the democrats in particular were on fire over press reports of cia waterboarding secret detention centers and the nsa’s extralegal programs tracking the emails telephone calls webbrowsing habits and financial transactions of american citizens which he had started as its director after the  attacks“hearings often became shouting matches” he recounts “in one session i was asked if i would waterboard my daughter then    i was accused of looking bored during a lengthy lecture    there were moments a lot of them actually when i was convinced that several members were opposed not just to some of the agency’s actions but to its existence”now a fixture on fox news hayden saves special scorn for democrats like former senator jay rockefeller the chairman of the intelligence committee from  to  who he says seemed perfectly ok with torturing the qaeda kingpin khalid shaikh mohammed in  — “i wouldn’t take anything off the table” he told cnn at the time — but who later joined the chorus of democrats who denounced cia methods in their censorious  senate intelligence committee report on torturewhy were the democrats so hostile to the cia they say it was because agency officials hid interrogation abuses and constantly lied to them about their effectiveness hayden however theorizes that they were offloading guilt for their own participation in the system they should have “begun their protest in  — when the trauma” of  “was recent the threat seemed imminent and the future was in doubt” he grouses “not in  when it was not”“in the end” hayden asserts “the congress of the united states had no impact on the shape of the cia interrogation program going forward congress lacked the courage or the consensus to stop it endorse it or amend it” but that’s an overly narrow and legalistic interpretation of what transpired hayden himself admits the cia had to pull back on its most egregious interrogation methods after the outcry in congress over abuses that were exposed by the press“i decided that the cia program as we were recrafting it would be worth the freight and that we could buy down the tariff if we aggressively briefed congress and solicited some public support from it” he writes and “if we briefed the american people in as open a way as possible and if we quietly informed our allies more fully of the parameters and limits of what we were doing”“for general michael hayden playing to the edge means playing so close to the line that you get chalk dust on your cleats” the association of former intelligence officers a procia group said in a recent newsletter except that hayden went well over the chalk with the nsa’s warrantless datamining programs in a nowfamous  showdown with the white house deputy attorney general james comey currently the director of the fbi threatened to resign unless the program was put on a firmer legal foundation when the new york times reporter james risen got wind of the programs hayden took the damagecontrol lead ultimately persuading the paper’s editors to sit on the story for nearly a year — until risen forced its hand by including it in his book “state of war the secret history of the cia and the bush administration” hayden’s wily account of the risen episode as well as his views of other journalists will probably generate media buzz he is mostly disdainful of reporters who lust after “espionage porn” — exposing cia spying foibles no matter the risk to national security he sneers at risen “irresponsible” others who are “hopelessly agendadriven” the former times reporter tim weiner the new yorker’s jane mayer and those who are “consistently antibush” like the former blogger andrew sullivan of course he has nothing but scorn for glenn green­wald and laura poitras boswells to the nsa leaker edward snowden “an incredibly naïve hopelessly narcissistic and insufferably selfimportant defector” nor do i escape his pique for reporting in  that the incoming house intelligence committee chairman silvestre reyes couldn’t tell me whether al qaeda was sunni or shia he says i was “tough and knowledgeable but    specialized in snark” advertisement continue reading the main story hayden is no slouch in that regard either taking multiple shots at barack obama “more hamlet than patton” he calls one of the president’s landmark speeches on combating terrorism when obama visits the cia and urges the assembled work force not to be “discouraged” by the administration’s release of torture memos because “we’ve made some mistakes that’s how we learn” hayden says “the agency consensus” was that obama “sounded a lot like mister rogers” even so he writes the election of the republican senator john mccain would have been “more disruptive to the way america produced intelligence than the election of barack obama” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story book review newsletter sign up to receive a preview of each sunday’s book review

came to the nsa at a time of great trouble in the agency internal government analysis indicated it suffered from a lack of quality management and an outdated it infrastructure in fact soon after he came on board a huge part of the nsa network system crashed and was down for several days part of his plan to revitalize the agency was to introduce more outside contractors induce a lot of old managers to retire and get rid of old management structures part of his plan also included increased openness at the agency it had historically been one of the most secretive organs of government he notably allowed james bamford access for his book body of secrets hayden was also initially extremely concerned with following the laws against domestic surveillance many reports say that after  he became more concerned with stopping terrorism and allegedly softened his stance against domestic surveillance hayden however has said that he believed everything the agency was doing was effective

branch powers in which the president must take care that the laws be faithfully executed overriding legislative branch statutes forbidding warrantless surveillance of domestic calls which included the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa previously this action would have required a warrant from a fisa court the stated purpose of the database was to eavesdrop on international communications

time of great trouble in the agency internal government analysis indicated it suffered from a lack of quality management and an outdated it infrastructure in fact soon after he came on board a huge part of the nsa network system crashed and was down for several days part of his plan to revitalize the agency was to introduce more outside contractors induce a lot of old managers to retire and get

mason university’s schar school of policy and government was director of the national security agency from  to  and the central intelligence agency from  to  president trump’s executive order on immigration was illconceived poorly implemented and illexplained to be fair it would have been hard to explain since it was not the product of intelligence and security professionals demanding change but rather policy political and ideological personalities close to the president fulfilling a campaign promise to deal with a threat they had overhyped i’ve heard from a lot of intelligence professionals who are going to have to live with the consequences they noted that six of the seven countries involved in the ban iran being somewhat an exception are troubled fragmented states where human sources are essential to defeating threats to the united states paradoxically they pointed out how the executive order breached faith with those very sources many of whom they had promised to always protect with the full might of our government and our people sources who had risked much if not all to keep americans safe i understood their angst as cia director i reminded them at their case officer graduations that when they recruited a source they would likely be the only face of america that the source would see and that in the act of recruitment they would assume a powerful and permanent moral responsibility for the wellbeing of the source and his or her loved ones jayne orensteindalton bennettnatalie jenningsthe washington post the case officers believed that they were also empowered to offer the full faith and credit of the american nation for that task now they told me that promise was eroding some will quibble that this at least technically is not really the case that this is a temporary ban maybe and exceptions can be made possibly but as a former station chief told me in the places where intelligence officers operate rumor whisper and conspiratorial chatter rule people’s lives it doesn’t take paranoia to connect the action of the executive order with the hateful antiislamic language of the campaign in the middle east with its honorbased cultures it’s easier to recruit someone we have been shooting at than it is to recruit someone whose society has been insulted as the station chief reminded me the fundamental posture of an intelligence service looking for sources is that “we welcome you you have value our society respects you more than your own” he feared that would no longer be the powerful american message it once was the simple idea of america didn’t hurt either the station chief said that one of the fundamentals of his business was selling the dream the soviets “had a hard time with that we had it easy a lot of intelligence targets — officials military figures african revolutionaries tribal leaders — railed against our policies our interventions many things    but they loved america it was the idea of the country as a special place they didn’t necessarily want to go there but it was a place they kept in their minds where they would be welcome” the station chief and i knew mohammed shahwani an iraqi and american hero shawani carried the iraqi flag at the  rome olympics and later became a war hero as a commander of a special forces unit in the war against iran his popularity grew to a point where saddam hussein viewed him as a threat and he had to flee for his life shahwani settled in leesburg va from where the united states convinced him after the invasion of iraq to return to set up and run iraq’s posthussein intelligence service a sunni he established a nonsectarian service that was a trusted professional partner to the cia and us forces not sectarian enough for shiite prime minister nouri

push us as a nation more toward security michael hayden free liberty security when asked if i miss being in government i usually try to lighten the moment by responding that i awake most days read the paper and then observe that its yet another great day to be the former director of the central intelligence agency michael hayden great intelligence day theres this movie zero dark thirty about the hunt for osama bin laden some have complained that too many secrets were dished out by the intelligence and special operations communities to director kathryn bigelow screenwriter mark boal and their crew part of a broader pattern of using intelligence for political effect michael hayden intelligence dark secrets when i was at the cia i asked my civilian advisory board to tackle some tough questions among the toughest in a political culture that every day demands more transparency and more public accountability from every aspect of national life could american intelligence continue to survive and succeed that jury is still out michael hayden life intelligence day when i was director of the cia i knew that we had been  and im choosing my words very carefully here  effective in our expansion we really had  expansion of government agencies and expansion of use of contractors effective we were efficient we werent and so as director of the cia i went after the inefficiencies part michael hayden words government here my literal responsibility as director of the cia with regard to covert action was to inform the congress  not to seek their approval to inform michael hayden responsibility action global security can be formed or threatened by heads of state whose wisdom folly and obsessions shape global events but often it is the security practitioners those rarely in the headlines but whose craft and energy quietly break new ground who keep us safe or put us in peril michael hayden wisdom energy security i used to have a little saying i used when people said what are your priorities id give them a bit of government alphabet soup id say ctcprow counterterrorism counterproliferation rest of the world michael hayden world government people there is no part of the

demands new ideas and he can never be sure whether he is going to come up with them or not michael hayden fear day new day american political elites feel very empowered to criticize the american intelligence community for not doing enough when they feel in danger and as soon as weve made them feel safe again they feel equally empowered to complain that were doing too much michael hayden community intelligence i enjoyed writing in school i dont know that i was all that good at it in school i worked at it later i feel comfortable writing now i enjoy writing now i suspect like most

fit on a bumper sticker the truth takes longer michael hayden truth fit longer the problem with cyber weapons for a country like ours is the ability to control them michael hayden control problem country when i became director of cia it was just clear to me intuitively without a whole lot of science behind it that we had expanded rapidly and inefficiently so i arbitrarily picked a number  percent and i said over the next  months we are going to reduce our reliance on contractors by  percent michael hayden science me over my personal view is that iran left to its own devices will get itself to that step right below a nuclear weapon that permanent breakout stage so the needle isnt quite in the red for the international community and frankly that will be as destabilizing as their actually having a weapon michael hayden community red step responsibility demands action and dealing with the immediate threat must naturally be a top priority michael hayden responsibility action top

presidential nominee donald trump evan vucciassociated press by michael v hayden by michael v hayden november   michael v hayden a principal at the chertoff group and visiting professor at george mason university’s schar school of policy and government was director of the national security agency from  to  and the central intelligence agency from  to  i know i’m not the first to notice this but donald trump really does sound a lot like vladimir putin there has always been a sympathetic authoritarian chord between the republican presidential nominee and the russian president both are on record as admiring the strong leader they’ve even complimented one another on the trait putin could have been humming along when trump was claiming “i alone can fix it” during his acceptance speech at the republican national convention maybe he was each seems to have a pretty conspiratorial view of the world too putin comes by his naturally he’s a product of a kgb marxist philosophy where “the other” — any other — is reflexively identified as hostile and created by immutable forces of history something to be feared and ultimately crushed at a rally in springfield ohio oct  republican presidential nominee donald trump said he wished the us “actually got along with russia” so they could defeat the islamic state together the washington post trump seems to view business a bit that way at least i don’t recall a lot of winwin vocabulary when he touts his dealmaking skills the only way trump can win at the political level trump sees quite a few powerful “others” in the american electoral process a corrupt media international banks unrestricted immigrants a variety of globalists freetraders and at least some muslims it’s a list putin could second or in some cases jail or worse sounding simultaneously populist and a little bit the conspiratorial marxist trump has claimed that these unseen forces could rig the us election it’s a theme that putin is happy to echo indeed it’s a theme that his intelligence services are happy to actively propagate and in that case the american presidential candidate routinely comes to the defense of his russian soul mate in the face of a highconfidence judgment of the us intelligence community that russia hacked the democratic national committee and then weaponized embarrassing emails to sow confusion here the man who would be president has declared “our country has no idea” “i don’t think anybody knows it was russia that broke into the dnc    it could also be lots of other people” and “they always blame russia” rejecting a factbased intelligence assessment — not because of compelling contrarian data but because it is inconsistent with a preexisting worldview — that’s the stuff of ideological authoritarianism not pragmatic democracy and it is frightening trump also echoes putin when it comes to syria and the islamic state or isis here he follows the moscow line that we and the russians have common purpose and that russia and syrian dictator bashar alassad and iran are “killing isis” actually they are not they are bucking up the assad regime that if anyone is keeping score has killed more innocents than the islamic state and jabhat alnusra the alqaeda affiliate have combined and the attractiveness of the islamic state and alqaeda to sunni muslims is a direct byproduct of the depredations of the assad regime — the regime that russia saved from collapse a year ago here’s how you destroy a democratic republic it’s a little complicated i suppose but not so hard that it explains or justifies the willful ignorance that trump seems to display his second debate formulation — “i don’t like assad at all but assad is killing isis” — is precisely the formulation that the syrian president has been attempting to craft “it’s me or the terrorists” has been his false dilemma it’s hard to explain how the candidate of a major american political party could have gotten there especially after receiving classified intelligence briefings perhaps some of this is explained by the murky ties of some on team trump to things russian there is certainly a history there and perhaps a comfort level as well former campaign manager paul manafort did consulting work for the nowdiscredited but decidedly prorussian regime of viktor yanokovych in ukraine and recent revelations in kiev have stoked questions about whether manafort should have registered here as working on behalf of a foreign power manafort denies any role in july’s successful effort to suppress a republican platform pledge to provide lethal defensive weapons to the ukrainians in their continuing battle against separatists and the russian army although it’s clear that the suppression was initiated by trump staffers trump has denied any personal responsibility for it the whole episode was too quickly forgotten it begs explanation then there’s carter page an adviser with intermittent contacts with the campaign but with deep ties to russian money oil and gas who has blamed aggressive western policies for the mess in the ukraine and what he describes as the “socalled annexation of crimea” socalled dear donald trump i want my  back and what about the money although trump has said “i have zero investments in russia” his son donald jr conceded in  that “russians make up a pretty disproportionate crosssection of a lot of our assets    we see a lot of money pouring in from russia” absent more detailed data such as tax returns who knows we have really never seen anything like this former acting cia director michael morell
