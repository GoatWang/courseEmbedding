working with about the program the interest is always positive due to the past poor housing market and many homeowners losing valuable equity in their homes the idea of an unsecured financing option is very appealing we have found there are many people with excellent credit and income but not a lot of home equity by having this type of program available we have been able to build pools for families that might have otherwise not been able to or at best would have had to waitthe feedback from the customers has all been encouraging they have shared with us that the application process was simple the response time quick and funding sooner than expected one of our customers works for a local bank and had planned to use that bank for the financing as an option they went on our website and used the link to lightstream and applied they said it was quick and easy we built them a pool last summer and it was financed through the lightstream program thanks for having this option available we
