it at market prices and booked a  million profit abg then bought natural gas at market prices and sold it at a premium to dynegy the profits abg booked were then used to repay the loans prosecutors accused olis foster and sharkey of deceiving auditors regulators and other company executives regarding the transactions foster and sharkey plead guilty two months later olis was found guilty in march  and sentenced to  years in prison a year later after a us supreme court ruling in a different case held that mandatory sentencing guidelines violated the constitution olis sentence was reduced to just six years in prison in december  three former executives at nicor energy llc a joint venture of dynegy and nicor were indicted for illegally manipulating that firms income by us million in  to hide losses former chief financial officer robert doty agreed to pay a  fine in october  for his role in helping to conceal the abg gas supply scheme shareholders too were unhappy with dynegys actions during the financial crisis a class action lawsuit was filed against the company in  in april  dynegy agreed to settle the lawsuit shareholders would be paid a total of us million to come up with the money dynegy paid out  million in cash and issued  million in stock to the plaintiffs its insurance companies paid another  million to the plaintiffs recovery and restructuringedit on october   dynegy hired bruce williamson a former duke energy executive as its chief executive officer six weeks later dynegy hired nick j caruso a former chief financial officer at royal dutch shell as its new chief financial officer williamson began a program of cost cutting elimination of unprofitable businesses and financial restructuring as williamson later told the new york times in june  we had businesses in trading in marketing in broadband communications in europe in communications as far as china what we have done is very systematically sell those off shut down offices and concentrate on the two businesses that looked like we had a competitive advantage dynegy sold its telecommunications business in europe in january  restated its income for  and  sold a natural gas terminal in louisiana sold its telecommunications business in north america in april  engaged in a us billion refinancing and other restructuring of its debt sold its illinois power company subsidiary to ameren and nullified a number of contracts in noncore or moneylosing areas in march  wiliamson was named chairman of the company succeeding dan dienstbier who retired dynegy undertook a strategy to move into coalfired and hydroelectric electrical generation in  and out of natural gas distribution and trading in november  the company acquired four natural gasfired and four hydroelectric power generation plants in the northeast united states in march  it agreed to settle a  dispute with the environmental protection agency by spending us million to repair and upgrade coalfired generating plants in illinois to reduce pollutants in mid dynegy hired credit suisse first boston to assist it in finding a buyer for its natural gas transmission businesses the sale of this business came quickly in august  dynegy sold this business to targa resources a company owned by private equity firm warburg pincus in september  dynegy and ls power group agreed to a joint venture in a deal worth us billion under the terms of the agreemnent dynegy gave ls power a  percent stake in dynegy itself while ls power contributed  of its power plants dynegy also agreed to create a  million new class b shares which it turned over to ls power in may  chevrontexaco announced it was selling its  percent stake in dynegy to the public the sale netted chevrontexaco us million by july the joint venture did not last however in august  ls power agreed to buy nine electrical generating plants from dynegy for us billion in cash in order to dissolve the joint venture part of the reason for the joint ventures demise was another collapse in dynegys share price dynegys shares fell  percent in the two years after the deal closed and the company posted a large  million loss in the second quarter of  ls power also agreed to return all its class b shares so that dynegy would only have  million shares of common stock outstanding the dissolution of the joint venture left ls power with a  percent stake in dynegy dynegys move into coalpowered electrical generation was not without controversy in september  new york attorney general andrew cuomo sued dynegy and other utilities arguing that the companies were not properly accounting for the financial risks that pollutants from coalfired generating plants created after a year of negotiations and legal maneuvering dynegy agreed to issue statements to its current and future investors warning that government regulation of carbon emissions and lawsuits over pollution could pose financial risks to the company its move into coalfired electrical generation led the national environmental trust an environmental group to derisively call dynegy the king of coal in  takeover battlesedit on august   the blackstone group announced plans to purchase dynegy for us billion as part of the deal nrg energy would acquire four natural gas plants in california and maine for us billion seneca capital dynegys largest shareholder fought the purchase in a proxy fight dynegy investor carl icahn also promised a proxy battle arguing that blackstone groups offer was too low icahn raised his stake in dynegy to  percent in preparation for the shareholder fight seneca capital nominated former railroad executive e hunter harrison and former energy company executive jeff d hunter for the dynegy board of directors challenging bruce williamson and david biegler a williamson ally a series of maneuvers followed dynegy executives said the offer was a good one as the deal would give dynegy access to lines of credit which would enable it to refinance and restructure its debt with energy prices at cyclical lows the company said it lacked the resources to do so and that its debt burden was destabilizing blackstone group initially said it would not offer more than us per share but then revised its offer later that day to us a share worried that it did not have enough shareholder support to accept the blackstone group offer dynegy proposed postponing its shareholder meeting a few days to november  but postponement did not occur legal counsel advised that delaware law under which dynegy was incorporated considered a postponement a new meeting and that would require notifying shareholders again and giving at least  days notice furthermore dynegys proxy rules did not make it clear that a proxy remained in effect in the event of a postponement which could lead to lawsuits legal counsel also believed that dynegy management would be forced refile resolution with shareholders and resolicit votes which would delay a meeting until early  during the shareholder meeting managements fears proved accurate on november  dynegy was forced to recess its shareholder meeting in an attempt to garner more support for the blackstone bid dynegy was unable to adjourn the meeting because its bylaws did not clearly provide for adjournment to another date and because it was unclear that adjournment could occur without a shareholder vote—a vote the board felt it would lose during the fourday recess dynegy executives said the company would continue to solicit a takeover even if the blackstone group bid failed on november   dynegy management and blackstone agreed to call off the takeover after it became clear there was not enough support for the us a share bid on december   icahn offered a us a share cash bid for dynegy dynegys board asked for other bids but none emerged but icahn too found little support among shareholders he extended his offer by two weeks on january   that same day seneca capital said it would not even entertain a us a share bid dynegys board urged shareholders to accept the icahn bid or risk bankruptcy but by midfebruary even those investors willing to accept the icahn bid had rescinded these offers icahn extended his offer by few days the icahn bid too collapsed on february   bruce williamson resigned as dynegys chairman and announced he would step down as chief executive officer on march  chief financial officer holli c nichols also said she would resign as chief financial officer on march  as well board member thomas w elward was named interim chairman and robert c flexon was appointed interim president and chief executive officer harrison was elected to the board of directors also elected to the board were vincent j intrieri senior managing director of icahn capital and samuel j merksamer an investment analyst for icahn capital  bankruptcyedit the takeover bids all came after one of dynegys largest subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy on november   dynegy holdings the largest of dynegy incs four subsidiaries filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection the bankruptcy was a novel one dynegy had structured itself so that dynegy inc the holding company had little debt nearly all the debt was held by its subsidiary dynegy holdings which also guaranteed debt for the operating divisions dynegy inc created three operating divisions the natural gas group gasco the coal group coalco and a group for all other businesses known as the stub group gasco and coalco were structured so that they would be little affected by any bankruptcy filing by either dynegy inc or dynegy holdings part of the structure meant that few of the natural gascos and coalcos dividends were given to dynegy holdings to separate dynegy holdings from dynegy inc dynegy holdings was transformed from a corporation into a limited liability company llc this legal maneuver took advantage of a delaware supreme court ruling which made it difficult for creditors to sue an llcs board of directors for failing to uphold their fiduciary duty finally gasco and coalco sold themselves to dynegy inc which left dynegy holdings holding us billion in debt but without the ability to seize the assets of gasco and coalco in the event of a default under the structure adopted by dynegy inc the company could meet its debt obligations to dynegy holdings by paying cash or by forgiving debt this provided an incentive for dynegy inc to withhold payment and force dynegy holdings to declare bankruptcy thereby reducing the value of the debt and making it easier to pay off the restructuring plan put dynegys assets which had the worst financial performance into the hands of dynegy holdings the goal was to protect dynegys secured creditors at the expense of its unsecured creditors the plan had already generated one lawsuit in  us bancorp representing bondholders whose investment was secured by leases of two dynegy power plants new newburgh new york the danskammer generating station and the roseton generating station on march   dynegy submitted financial filings with government regulators warning investors that it faced bankruptcy if it could not restructure its debt the company announced a month later that it had hired the restructuring firm lazard and the law firm white  case to advise it on debt restructuring vincent intrieri was named chair of the boards finance and restructuring committee on march   the november  bankruptcy of dynegy holdings ran into difficulty an examiner appointed by the united states bankruptcy court found that the dynegy incs purchase of coalco was fraudulent the examiner found that dynegy holdings was already bankrupt at the time the sale took place and therefore constituted a breach of fiduciary duty by the dynegy holdings board of directors this allowed the dynegy holdings board of directors to sue the dynegy inc board of directors for damages which could run into the billions of dollars this threw the dynegy holdings bankrutpcy filing into doubt and put dynegy inc on the hook for billions in debt the bankruptcy court trustee said she would sue on behalf of dynegy holdings to recover these debts the bankruptcy court examiners finding quickly led to the bankruptcy of dynegy inc itself on april   dynegy inc announced that it had reached an agreement with the us bankruptcy trustee the board of directors of dynegy holdings and its other creditors the agreement which affected us billion in debt gave all creditors  percent of the stock of dynegy inc once it emerged from bankruptcy existing shareholders would get just  percent of the stock in the new company with warrants enabling them to buy up to  of common stock at a set price over the next five years accordingly dynegy inc filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection on july   the bankrutpcy plan filed by dynegy inc also called for a merger with dynegy holdings the bankruptcy filing did not however affect gasco coalco or the stub group and allowed the dynegy holdings bankruptcy to proceed dynegys stock was delisted from the new york stock exchange following the bankruptcy filing us bancorp agreed to drop its lawsuit against the company in exchange for a  million claim against the company in bankruptcy court the bondholders represented by us bancorp would also get a further us million if the danskammer and roseton plants are sold as part of its bankruptcy filing dynegy moved its corporate headquarters in november  the company signed a lease for new principal offices in an office building at  travis street in houston it occupied these quarters early july  dynegy continued to hold leases on several floors of the wells fargo plaza however as part of its bankruptcy filing the bankruptcy court approved a new lease in which dynegy would abandon  square feet  m of space at wells fargo plaza the company asked the court to cancel its lease on the remaining  square feet  m as well dynegy said it hoped to hold a vote on august  at which time its creditors would approve the bankruptcy plan a court hearing on the creditorapproved bankruptcy plan would then be held september  after which the company said it would emerge from bankruptcy protection dynegy inc posted a secondquarter  loss of  billion an increase to  per share from  cents per share a year ago the company blamed among other things markedly lower demand for its electricity much lower prices for its coal and a  million noncash loss caused by the transfer of its coal unit to dynegy holdings the company also said it now hoped to emerge from bankruptcy in september  dynegy agreed to auction off its roseton and danskammer energy plants in new york state in order to emerge from bankruptcy dynegy had signed a saleleaseback agreement in  with public services enterprise group for the roseton and danskammer facilities fifty percent of the proceeds from the auction would be used to pay bondholders up to  million while the remaining  percent would be used to pay unsecured creditors the unsecured creditors would get  million in cash unsecured creditors also would receive  percent of dynegys new stock with the company retaining the rest with warrants to purchase  percent of the stock after five years dynegy also agreed to pay holders of  million in subordinated capital income securities just  million in principal and  million in interest to settle their claims the bankruptcy agreement also settled claims between dynegy holdings and dynegy inc dynegy emerged from bankruptcy on october   and its shares began trading on october  under the dyn symbol postbankruptcyedit on november   the federal energy regulatory commission settled a decadeold lawsuit which alleged that dynegy had manipulated the california energy market while the lawsuit continued dynegy sold its california subsidiary to nrg energy inc nrg energy subsequently agreed to pay  million in refunds to consumers as well as spend more than  million to install  public fastcharging electric vehicle stations and  plugin stations throughout california twenty percent of the stations were required to be in lowincome neighborhoods on january   dynegys chief operating officer kevin howell resigned howell continued as a consultant to the company and agreed to stay on until a successor was named in order to provide an orderly transition on february   dynegys south bay power plant in san diego california was imploded the demolition of the foot  m smokestacks of the outmoded plant was watched by more than  people roseton and danskammer salesedit the sale of the roseton and danskammer plants—a condition of dynegys emergence from bankruptcy—proceeded slowly on november   members of international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew local  struck the roseton and danskammer plants after a contract extension expired and dynegy continued to seek cuts in retirement benefits dynegys bankruptcy also left  million in unpaid property taxes in dutchess county new york this created a budget crisis in the county which threatened to close local schools and create severe cutbacks in county services on december   dynegy announced it would sell the roseton plant to louis dreyfus highbridge energy for  million in cash the sale closed on april   the danskammer plant sale was far more troubled the plant was heavily damaged by hurricane sandy in october  rendering it inoperable on december  dynegy said that ics ny holdings would buy the plant for  million and demolish it but the ics sale stalled under the terms of the auction ics ny had to replace or find a substitute for its credit support agreement and pay its portion of the plants outstanding property taxes but dynegy said the company never did either ics defended itself saying it was making every economically feasible effort to replace the credit agreement on may   dynegy filed suit with the bankruptcy court to force ica to fulfill its obligations the court imposed a july  deadline for ics to close the sale but it did not meet the deadline dynegy subsequently sought another buyer helios power capital a private equity firm agreed to purchase the plant for  million in cash on august  the court approved the sale on september  ameren purchaseedit in midmarch  dynegy purchased three electric generating subsidiaries of ameren an illinois power company the deal worth  million involved amerens ameren energy generating co genco gencos controlling interest in electric energy inc amerenenergy resources generating co and ameren energy marketing co dynegy formed a subsidiary illinois power holdings iph to purchase the ameren subsidiaries no cash changed hands rather iph agreed to assume  million in debt owed by genco and the other subsidiaries ameren also transferred about  million in tax benefits the three subsidiaries would have received in  ameren retained gencos inactive hutsonville and meredosia plants and agreed to buy back from iph for  million three natural gas electrical generating plants dynegy agreed to honor the union collective bargaining agreements in force at all plants under the deal dynegy acquired five coalfired generating plants coffeen in coffeen illinois duck creek in canton illinois ed edwards in bartonville illinois joppa in joppa illinois and newton in newton illinois as the deal worked its way through state and federal regulatory approval dynegy took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced its debt the company obtained  billion in term loan b facilities and  million in revolving credit the company used this income to retire an  million sevenyear line of credit and a  million twoyear line of credit dynegy agreed that the revolving credit line would be paid off and terminate within five years two syndicated loans made up the  billion loan package the  million loan and the  million loan were both due in  this left dynegy with  billion in lines of credit and  million in outstanding bonds the ameren plantsfordebt swap also ran into trouble the federal energy regulatory commission ferc had to approve the deal and ensure that there was no negative impact on consumers from dynegys expanding market share in the midwest but on april  ferc said that the studies submitted by dynegy and ameren were inadequate and it ordered the two firms to rerun the studies and report back to ferc by july  on july  ferc again declined to approve or disapprove the dynegyameren deal the agency said that it dynegys study showed it charging market rates for energy in the midwest but ferc said it worried that transmission bottlenecks in the area would permit dynegy to charge much more furthermore federal regulators were considering an expansion in the market area iph could serve ferc asked dynegy to provide additional information on transmission limitations and market area expansion in august the sierra club formally filed opposition to the dynegyameren deal the environmental group said the transmission bottleneck issue gave dynegy too much market power it also argued that dynegy and ameren had submitted only regional market power data and had not accounted for local impacts which could be very severe another obstacle emerged on june  ameren was required to install pollutionreducing equipment on its five coalfired generating plants in  but because ameren was in financial difficulty it sought and received a waiver from the state of illinois granting it a fiveyear delay ameren sought to transfer this delay to dynegy so that dynegy would not have to immediately install the devices until  either but the illinois pollution control board denied amerens request dynegy filed its own request for a fiveyear waiver in july and warned that the ameren deal would fall apart if it did not receive the waiver but the sierra club the environmental law and policy center and other environmental groups said dynegy had the resources to install the equipment and opposed a waiver acm partners a financial firm hired by the sierra club also argued that dynegy purposefully left iph significantly underfunded and unable to tap into the parent companys resources dynegy disagreed but the firm warned that if iph went bankrupt workers would lose pensions and local communities would have to pay for any environmental remediation the illinois aflcio however supported dynegys request on september  saying that local jobs depended on the waiver the pollution board said it would make a decision by november  foresight energy a major illinois coal mining company said it would install the  million antipollution devices for free if dynegy agreed to sign a longterm contract to accept coal only from foresight energy dynegy declined the offer in part because it already has longterm coal contracts and environmental groups opposed it there was some speculation by financial analysts that the dynegyameren deal was a poor one julien dumoulinsmith executive director of ubs investment research said dynegy is far more likely to shutter all five coalpowered plants rather than add pollution control devices dumoulinsmith pointed out that the united states environmental protection agency epa issued final rules on sulfur dioxide emissions that go into effect in july  because the edwards plant is in an area of low air quality epa is likely to force dynegy to close the plant anyway the remaining four plants are borderline cases with the exception of duck creek station which spent nearly usm on sulfur dioxide removal and may also be forced to close if epa regulations tighten in the future a highly likely possibility he said  acquisitionsedit on august   dynegy announced a deal involving two interdependent transactions to be executed simultaneously dynegy acquired duke’s midwest generation assets and retail business for  billion in cash and the power generating assets of equipower resources for  billion with  billion in cash and  million in stock this increased the companys

power agreed to buy nine electrical generating plants from dynegy for us billion in cash in order to dissolve the joint venture part of the reason for the joint ventures demise was another collapse in

class b shares so that dynegy would only have  million shares of common stock outstanding the dissolution of the joint venture left ls power with a  percent stake in dynegy dynegys move into

accounting for the financial risks that pollutants from coalfired generating plants created after a year of negotiations and legal maneuvering dynegy agreed to issue statements to its current and future investors warning that government regulation of carbon emissions and lawsuits over pollution could pose financial risks to the company its move into coalfired electrical generation led the national environmental trust an environmental group to derisively call dynegy the king of coal in  takeover battlesedit on august   the blackstone group announced plans to purchase dynegy for us billion as part of the deal nrg energy would acquire four natural gas plants in california and maine for us billion seneca capital dynegys largest shareholder fought the purchase in a proxy fight dynegy investor carl icahn also promised a proxy battle arguing that blackstone groups offer was too low icahn raised his stake in dynegy to  percent in preparation for the shareholder fight seneca capital nominated former railroad executive e hunter harrison and former energy company executive jeff d hunter for the dynegy board of directors challenging bruce williamson and david biegler a williamson ally a series of maneuvers followed dynegy executives said the offer was a good one as the deal would give dynegy access to lines of credit which would enable it to refinance and restructure its debt with energy prices at cyclical lows the company said it lacked the resources to do so and that its debt burden was destabilizing blackstone group initially said it would not offer more than us per share but then revised its offer later that day to us a share worried that it did not have enough shareholder support to accept the blackstone group offer dynegy proposed postponing its shareholder meeting a few days to november  but postponement did not occur legal counsel advised that delaware law under which dynegy was incorporated considered a postponement a new meeting and that would require notifying shareholders again and giving at least  days notice furthermore dynegys proxy rules did not make it clear that a proxy remained in effect in the event of a postponement which could lead to lawsuits legal counsel also believed that dynegy management would be forced refile resolution with shareholders and resolicit votes which would delay a meeting until early  during the shareholder meeting managements fears proved accurate on november  dynegy was forced to recess its shareholder meeting in an attempt to garner more support for the blackstone bid dynegy was unable to adjourn the meeting because its bylaws did not clearly provide for adjournment to another date and because it was unclear that adjournment could occur without a shareholder vote—a vote the board felt it would lose during the fourday recess dynegy executives said the company would continue to solicit a takeover even if the blackstone group bid failed on november   dynegy management and blackstone agreed to call off the takeover after it became clear there was not enough support for the us a share bid on december   icahn offered a us a share cash bid for dynegy dynegys board asked for other bids but none emerged but icahn too found little support among shareholders he extended his offer by two weeks on january   that same day seneca capital said it would not even entertain a us a share bid dynegys board urged shareholders to accept the icahn bid or risk bankruptcy but by midfebruary even those investors willing to accept the icahn bid had rescinded these offers icahn extended his offer by few days the icahn bid too collapsed on february   bruce williamson resigned as dynegys chairman and announced he would step down as chief executive officer on march  chief financial officer holli c nichols also said she would resign as chief financial officer on march  as well board member thomas w elward was named interim chairman and robert c flexon was appointed interim president and chief executive officer harrison was elected to the board of directors also elected to the board were vincent j intrieri senior managing director of icahn capital and samuel j merksamer an investment analyst for icahn capital  bankruptcyedit the takeover bids all came after one of dynegys largest subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy on november   dynegy holdings the largest of dynegy incs four subsidiaries filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection the bankruptcy was a novel one dynegy had structured itself so that dynegy inc the holding company had little debt nearly all the debt was held by its subsidiary dynegy holdings which also guaranteed debt for the operating divisions dynegy inc created three operating divisions the natural gas group gasco the coal group coalco and a group for all other businesses known as the stub group gasco and coalco were structured so that they would be little affected by any bankruptcy filing by either dynegy inc or dynegy holdings part of the structure meant that few of the natural gascos and coalcos dividends were given to dynegy holdings to separate dynegy holdings from dynegy inc dynegy holdings was transformed from a corporation into a limited liability company llc this legal maneuver took advantage of a delaware supreme court ruling which made it difficult for creditors to sue an llcs board of directors for failing to uphold their fiduciary duty finally gasco and coalco sold themselves to dynegy inc which left dynegy holdings holding us billion in debt but without the ability to seize the assets of gasco and coalco in the event of a default under the structure adopted by dynegy inc the company could meet its debt obligations to dynegy holdings by paying cash or by forgiving debt this provided an incentive for dynegy inc to withhold payment and force dynegy holdings to declare bankruptcy thereby reducing the value of the debt and making it easier to pay off the restructuring plan put dynegys assets which had the worst financial performance into the hands of dynegy holdings the goal was to protect dynegys secured creditors at the expense of its unsecured creditors the plan had already generated one lawsuit in  us bancorp representing bondholders whose investment was secured by leases of two dynegy power plants new newburgh new york the danskammer generating station and the roseton generating station on march   dynegy submitted financial filings with government regulators warning investors that it faced bankruptcy if it could not restructure its debt the company announced a month later that it had hired the restructuring firm lazard and the law firm white  case to advise it on debt restructuring vincent intrieri was named chair of the boards finance and restructuring committee on march   the november  bankruptcy of dynegy holdings ran into difficulty an examiner appointed by the united states bankruptcy court found that the dynegy incs purchase of coalco was fraudulent the examiner found that dynegy holdings was already bankrupt at the time the sale took place and therefore constituted a breach of fiduciary duty by the dynegy holdings board of directors this allowed the dynegy holdings board of directors to sue the dynegy inc board of directors for damages which could run into the billions of dollars this threw the dynegy holdings bankrutpcy filing into doubt and put dynegy inc on the hook for billions in debt the bankruptcy court trustee said she would sue on behalf of dynegy holdings to recover these debts the bankruptcy court examiners finding quickly led to the bankruptcy of dynegy inc itself on april   dynegy inc announced that it had reached an agreement with the us bankruptcy trustee the board of directors of dynegy holdings and its other creditors the agreement which affected us billion in debt gave all creditors  percent of the stock of dynegy inc once it emerged from bankruptcy existing shareholders would get just  percent of the stock in the new company with warrants enabling them to buy up to  of common stock at a set price over the next five years accordingly dynegy inc filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection on july   the bankrutpcy plan filed by dynegy inc also called for a merger with dynegy holdings the bankruptcy filing did not however affect gasco coalco or the stub group and allowed the dynegy holdings bankruptcy to proceed dynegys stock was delisted from the new york stock exchange following the bankruptcy filing us bancorp agreed to drop its lawsuit against the company in exchange for a  million claim against the company in bankruptcy court the bondholders represented by us bancorp would also get a further us million if the danskammer and roseton plants are sold as part of its bankruptcy filing dynegy moved its corporate headquarters in november  the company signed a lease for new principal offices in an office building at  travis street in houston it occupied these quarters early july  dynegy continued to hold leases on several floors of the wells fargo plaza however as part of its bankruptcy filing the bankruptcy court approved a new lease in which dynegy would abandon  square feet  m of space at wells fargo plaza the company asked the court to cancel its lease on the remaining  square feet  m as well dynegy said it hoped to hold a vote on august  at which time its creditors would approve the bankruptcy plan a court hearing on the creditorapproved bankruptcy plan would then be held september  after which the company said it would emerge from bankruptcy protection dynegy inc posted a secondquarter  loss of  billion an increase to  per share from  cents per share a year ago the company blamed among other things markedly lower demand for its electricity much lower prices for its coal and a  million noncash loss caused by the transfer of its coal unit to dynegy holdings the company also said it now hoped to emerge from bankruptcy in september  dynegy agreed to auction off its roseton and danskammer energy plants in new york state in order to emerge from bankruptcy dynegy had signed a saleleaseback agreement in  with public services enterprise group for the roseton and danskammer facilities fifty percent of the proceeds from the auction would be used to pay bondholders up to  million while the remaining  percent would be used to pay unsecured creditors the unsecured creditors would get  million in cash unsecured creditors also would receive  percent of dynegys new stock with the company retaining the rest with warrants to purchase  percent of the stock after five years dynegy also agreed to pay holders of  million in subordinated capital income securities just  million in principal and  million in interest to settle their claims the bankruptcy agreement also settled claims between dynegy holdings and dynegy inc dynegy emerged from bankruptcy on october   and its shares began trading on october  under the dyn symbol postbankruptcyedit on november   the federal energy regulatory commission settled a decadeold lawsuit which alleged that dynegy had manipulated the california energy market while the lawsuit continued dynegy sold its california subsidiary to nrg energy inc nrg energy subsequently agreed to pay  million in refunds to consumers as well as spend more than  million to install  public fastcharging electric vehicle stations and  plugin stations throughout california twenty percent of the stations were required to be in lowincome neighborhoods on january   dynegys chief operating officer kevin howell resigned howell continued as a consultant to the company and agreed to stay on until a successor was named in order to provide an orderly transition on february   dynegys south bay power plant in san diego california was imploded the demolition of the foot  m smokestacks of the outmoded plant was watched by more than  people roseton and danskammer salesedit the sale of the roseton and danskammer plants—a condition of dynegys emergence from bankruptcy—proceeded slowly on november   members of international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew local  struck the roseton and danskammer plants after a contract extension expired and dynegy continued to seek cuts in retirement benefits dynegys bankruptcy also left  million in unpaid property taxes in dutchess county new york this created a budget crisis in the county which threatened to close local schools and create severe cutbacks in county services on december   dynegy announced it would sell the roseton plant to louis dreyfus highbridge energy for  million in cash the sale closed on april   the danskammer plant sale was far more troubled the plant was heavily damaged by hurricane sandy in october  rendering it inoperable on december  dynegy said that ics ny holdings would buy the plant for  million and demolish it but the ics sale stalled under the terms of the auction ics ny had to replace or find a substitute for its credit support agreement and pay its portion of the plants outstanding property taxes but dynegy said the company never did either ics defended itself saying it was making every economically feasible effort to replace the credit agreement on may   dynegy filed suit with the bankruptcy court to force ica to fulfill its obligations the court imposed a july  deadline for ics to close the sale but it did not meet the deadline dynegy subsequently sought another buyer helios power capital a private equity firm agreed to purchase the plant for  million in cash on august  the court approved the sale on september  ameren purchaseedit in midmarch  dynegy purchased three electric generating subsidiaries of ameren an illinois power company the deal worth  million involved amerens ameren energy generating co genco gencos controlling interest in electric energy inc amerenenergy resources generating co and ameren energy marketing co dynegy formed a subsidiary illinois power holdings iph to purchase the ameren subsidiaries no cash changed hands rather iph agreed to assume  million in debt owed by genco and the other subsidiaries ameren also transferred about  million in tax benefits the three subsidiaries would have received in  ameren retained gencos inactive hutsonville and meredosia plants and agreed to buy back from iph for  million three natural gas electrical generating plants dynegy agreed to honor the union collective bargaining agreements in force at all plants under the deal dynegy acquired five coalfired generating plants coffeen in coffeen illinois duck creek in canton illinois ed edwards in bartonville illinois joppa in joppa illinois and newton in newton illinois as the deal worked its way through state and federal regulatory approval dynegy took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced its debt the company obtained  billion in term loan b facilities and  million in revolving credit the company used this income to retire an  million sevenyear line of credit and a  million twoyear line of credit dynegy agreed that the revolving credit line would be paid off and terminate within five years two syndicated loans made up the  billion loan package the  million loan and the  million loan were both due in  this left dynegy with  billion in lines of credit and  million in outstanding bonds the ameren plantsfordebt swap also ran into trouble the federal energy regulatory commission ferc had to approve the deal and ensure that there was no negative impact on consumers from dynegys expanding market share in the midwest but on april  ferc said that the studies submitted by dynegy and ameren were inadequate and it ordered the two firms to rerun the studies and report back to ferc by july  on july  ferc again declined to approve or disapprove the dynegyameren deal the agency said that it dynegys study showed it charging market rates for energy in the midwest but ferc said it worried that transmission bottlenecks in the area would permit dynegy to charge much more furthermore federal regulators were considering an expansion in the market area iph could serve ferc asked dynegy to provide additional information on transmission limitations and market area expansion in august the sierra club formally filed opposition to the dynegyameren deal the environmental group said the transmission bottleneck issue gave dynegy too much market power it also argued that dynegy and ameren had submitted only regional market power data and had not accounted for local impacts which could be very severe another obstacle emerged on june  ameren was required to install pollutionreducing equipment on its five coalfired generating plants in  but because ameren was in financial difficulty it sought and received a waiver from the state of illinois granting it a fiveyear delay ameren sought to transfer this delay to dynegy so that dynegy would not have to immediately install the devices until  either but the illinois pollution control board denied amerens request dynegy filed its own request for a fiveyear waiver in july and warned that the ameren deal would fall apart if it did not receive the waiver but the sierra club the environmental law and policy center and other environmental groups said dynegy had the resources to install the equipment and opposed a waiver acm partners a financial firm hired by the sierra club also argued that dynegy purposefully left iph significantly underfunded and unable to tap into the parent companys resources dynegy disagreed but the firm warned that if iph went bankrupt workers would lose pensions and local communities would have to pay for any environmental remediation the illinois aflcio however supported dynegys request on september  saying that local jobs depended on the waiver the pollution board said it would make a decision by november  foresight energy a major illinois coal mining company said it would install the  million antipollution devices for free if dynegy agreed to sign a longterm contract to accept coal only from foresight energy dynegy declined the offer in part because it already has longterm coal contracts and environmental groups opposed it there was some speculation by financial analysts that the dynegyameren deal was a poor one julien dumoulinsmith executive director of ubs investment research said dynegy is far more likely to shutter all five coalpowered plants rather than add pollution control devices dumoulinsmith pointed out that the united states environmental protection agency epa issued final rules on sulfur dioxide emissions that go into effect in july  because the edwards plant is in an area of low air quality epa is likely to force dynegy to close the plant anyway the remaining four plants are borderline cases with the exception of duck creek station which spent nearly usm on sulfur dioxide removal and may also be forced to close if epa regulations tighten in the future a highly likely possibility he said  acquisitionsedit on august   dynegy announced a deal involving two interdependent transactions to be executed simultaneously dynegy acquired duke’s midwest generation assets and retail business for  billion in cash and the power generating assets of equipower resources for  billion with  billion in cash and  million in stock this increased the companys

power agreed to buy nine electrical generating plants from dynegy for us billion in cash in order to dissolve the joint venture part of the reason for the joint ventures demise was another collapse in

class b shares so that dynegy would only have  million shares of common stock outstanding the dissolution of the joint venture left ls power with a  percent stake in dynegy dynegys move into

accounting for the financial risks that pollutants from coalfired generating plants created after a year of negotiations and legal maneuvering dynegy agreed to issue statements to its current and future investors warning that government regulation of carbon emissions and lawsuits over pollution could pose financial risks to the company its move into coalfired electrical generation led the national environmental trust an environmental group to derisively call dynegy the king of coal in  takeover battlesedit on august   the blackstone group announced plans to purchase dynegy for us billion as part of the deal nrg energy would acquire four natural gas plants in california and maine for us billion seneca capital dynegys largest shareholder fought the purchase in a proxy fight dynegy investor carl icahn also promised a proxy battle arguing that blackstone groups offer was too low icahn raised his stake in dynegy to  percent in preparation for the shareholder fight seneca capital nominated former railroad executive e hunter harrison and former energy company executive jeff d hunter for the dynegy board of directors challenging bruce williamson and david biegler a williamson ally a series of maneuvers followed dynegy executives said the offer was a good one as the deal would give dynegy access to lines of credit which would enable it to refinance and restructure its debt with energy prices at cyclical lows the company said it lacked the resources to do so and that its debt burden was destabilizing blackstone group initially said it would not offer more than us per share but then revised its offer later that day to us a share worried that it did not have enough shareholder support to accept the blackstone group offer dynegy proposed postponing its shareholder meeting a few days to november  but postponement did not occur legal counsel advised that delaware law under which dynegy was incorporated considered a postponement a new meeting and that would require notifying shareholders again and giving at least  days notice furthermore dynegys proxy rules did not make it clear that a proxy remained in effect in the event of a postponement which could lead to lawsuits legal counsel also believed that dynegy management would be forced refile resolution with shareholders and resolicit votes which would delay a meeting until early  during the shareholder meeting managements fears proved accurate on november  dynegy was forced to recess its shareholder meeting in an attempt to garner more support for the blackstone bid dynegy was unable to adjourn the meeting because its bylaws did not clearly provide for adjournment to another date and because it was unclear that adjournment could occur without a shareholder vote—a vote the board felt it would lose during the fourday recess dynegy executives said the company would continue to solicit a takeover even if the blackstone group bid failed on november   dynegy management and blackstone agreed to call off the takeover after it became clear there was not enough support for the us a share bid on december   icahn offered a us a share cash bid for dynegy dynegys board asked for other bids but none emerged but icahn too found little support among shareholders he extended his offer by two weeks on january   that same day seneca capital said it would not even entertain a us a share bid dynegys board urged shareholders to accept the icahn bid or risk bankruptcy but by midfebruary even those investors willing to accept the icahn bid had rescinded these offers icahn extended his offer by few days the icahn bid too collapsed on february   bruce williamson resigned as dynegys chairman and announced he would step down as chief executive officer on march  chief financial officer holli c nichols also said she would resign as chief financial officer on march  as well board member thomas w elward was named interim chairman and robert c flexon was appointed interim president and chief executive officer harrison was elected to the board of directors also elected to the board were vincent j intrieri senior managing director of icahn capital and samuel j merksamer an investment analyst for icahn capital  bankruptcyedit the takeover bids all came after one of dynegys largest subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy on november   dynegy holdings the largest of dynegy incs four subsidiaries filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection the bankruptcy was a novel one dynegy had structured itself so that dynegy inc the holding company had little debt nearly all the debt was held by its subsidiary dynegy holdings which also guaranteed debt for the operating divisions dynegy inc created three operating divisions the natural gas group gasco the coal group coalco and a group for all other businesses known as the stub group gasco and coalco were structured so that they would be little affected by any bankruptcy filing by either dynegy inc or dynegy holdings part of the structure meant that few of the natural gascos and coalcos dividends were given to dynegy holdings to separate dynegy holdings from dynegy inc dynegy holdings was transformed from a corporation into a limited liability company llc this legal maneuver took advantage of a delaware supreme court ruling which made it difficult for creditors to sue an llcs board of directors for failing to uphold their fiduciary duty finally gasco and coalco sold themselves to dynegy inc which left dynegy holdings holding us billion in debt but without the ability to seize the assets of gasco and coalco in the event of a default under the structure adopted by dynegy inc the company could meet its debt obligations to dynegy holdings by paying cash or by forgiving debt this provided an incentive for dynegy inc to withhold payment and force dynegy holdings to declare bankruptcy thereby reducing the value of the debt and making it easier to pay off the restructuring plan put dynegys assets which had the worst financial performance into the hands of dynegy holdings the goal was to protect dynegys secured creditors at the expense of its unsecured creditors the plan had already generated one lawsuit in  us bancorp representing bondholders whose investment was secured by leases of two dynegy power plants new newburgh new york the danskammer generating station and the roseton generating station on march   dynegy submitted financial filings with government regulators warning investors that it faced bankruptcy if it could not restructure its debt the company announced a month later that it had hired the restructuring firm lazard and the law firm white  case to advise it on debt restructuring vincent intrieri was named chair of the boards finance and restructuring committee on march   the november  bankruptcy of dynegy holdings ran into difficulty an examiner appointed by the united states bankruptcy court found that the dynegy incs purchase of coalco was fraudulent the examiner found that dynegy holdings was already bankrupt at the time the sale took place and therefore constituted a breach of fiduciary duty by the dynegy holdings board of directors this allowed the dynegy holdings board of directors to sue the dynegy inc board of directors for damages which could run into the billions of dollars this threw the dynegy holdings bankrutpcy filing into doubt and put dynegy inc on the hook for billions in debt the bankruptcy court trustee said she would sue on behalf of dynegy holdings to recover these debts the bankruptcy court examiners finding quickly led to the bankruptcy of dynegy inc itself on april   dynegy inc announced that it had reached an agreement with the us bankruptcy trustee the board of directors of dynegy holdings and its other creditors the agreement which affected us billion in debt gave all creditors  percent of the stock of dynegy inc once it emerged from bankruptcy existing shareholders would get just  percent of the stock in the new company with warrants enabling them to buy up to  of common stock at a set price over the next five years accordingly dynegy inc filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection on july   the bankrutpcy plan filed by dynegy inc also called for a merger with dynegy holdings the bankruptcy filing did not however affect gasco coalco or the stub group and allowed the dynegy holdings bankruptcy to proceed dynegys stock was delisted from the new york stock exchange following the bankruptcy filing us bancorp agreed to drop its lawsuit against the company in exchange for a  million claim against the company in bankruptcy court the bondholders represented by us bancorp would also get a further us million if the danskammer and roseton plants are sold as part of its bankruptcy filing dynegy moved its corporate headquarters in november  the company signed a lease for new principal offices in an office building at  travis street in houston it occupied these quarters early july  dynegy continued to hold leases on several floors of the wells fargo plaza however as part of its bankruptcy filing the bankruptcy court approved a new lease in which dynegy would abandon  square feet  m of space at wells fargo plaza the company asked the court to cancel its lease on the remaining  square feet  m as well dynegy said it hoped to hold a vote on august  at which time its creditors would approve the bankruptcy plan a court hearing on the creditorapproved bankruptcy plan would then be held september  after which the company said it would emerge from bankruptcy protection dynegy inc posted a secondquarter  loss of  billion an increase to  per share from  cents per share a year ago the company blamed among other things markedly lower demand for its electricity much lower prices for its coal and a  million noncash loss caused by the transfer of its coal unit to dynegy holdings the company also said it now hoped to emerge from bankruptcy in september  dynegy agreed to auction off its roseton and danskammer energy plants in new york state in order to emerge from bankruptcy dynegy had signed a saleleaseback agreement in  with public services enterprise group for the roseton and danskammer facilities fifty percent of the proceeds from the auction would be used to pay bondholders up to  million while the remaining  percent would be used to pay unsecured creditors the unsecured creditors would get  million in cash unsecured creditors also would receive  percent of dynegys new stock with the company retaining the rest with warrants to purchase  percent of the stock after five years dynegy also agreed to pay holders of  million in subordinated capital income securities just  million in principal and  million in interest to settle their claims the bankruptcy agreement also settled claims between dynegy holdings and dynegy inc dynegy emerged from bankruptcy on october   and its shares began trading on october  under the dyn symbol postbankruptcyedit on november   the federal energy regulatory commission settled a decadeold lawsuit which alleged that dynegy had manipulated the california energy market while the lawsuit continued dynegy sold its california subsidiary to nrg energy inc nrg energy subsequently agreed to pay  million in refunds to consumers as well as spend more than  million to install  public fastcharging electric vehicle stations and  plugin stations throughout california twenty percent of the stations were required to be in lowincome neighborhoods on january   dynegys chief operating officer kevin howell resigned howell continued as a consultant to the company and agreed to stay on until a successor was named in order to provide an orderly transition on february   dynegys south bay power plant in san diego california was imploded the demolition of the foot  m smokestacks of the outmoded plant was watched by more than  people roseton and danskammer salesedit the sale of the roseton and danskammer plants—a condition of dynegys emergence from bankruptcy—proceeded slowly on november   members of international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew local  struck the roseton and danskammer plants after a contract extension expired and dynegy continued to seek cuts in retirement benefits dynegys bankruptcy also left  million in unpaid property taxes in dutchess county new york this created a budget crisis in the county which threatened to close local schools and create severe cutbacks in county services on december   dynegy announced it would sell the roseton plant to louis dreyfus highbridge energy for  million in cash the sale closed on april   the danskammer plant sale was far more troubled the plant was heavily damaged by hurricane sandy in october  rendering it inoperable on december  dynegy said that ics ny holdings would buy the plant for  million and demolish it but the ics sale stalled under the terms of the auction ics ny had to replace or find a substitute for its credit support agreement and pay its portion of the plants outstanding property taxes but dynegy said the company never did either ics defended itself saying it was making every economically feasible effort to replace the credit agreement on may   dynegy filed suit with the bankruptcy court to force ica to fulfill its obligations the court imposed a july  deadline for ics to close the sale but it did not meet the deadline dynegy subsequently sought another buyer helios power capital a private equity firm agreed to purchase the plant for  million in cash on august  the court approved the sale on september  ameren purchaseedit in midmarch  dynegy purchased three electric generating subsidiaries of ameren an illinois power company the deal worth  million involved amerens ameren energy generating co genco gencos controlling interest in electric energy inc amerenenergy resources generating co and ameren energy marketing co dynegy formed a subsidiary illinois power holdings iph to purchase the ameren subsidiaries no cash changed hands rather iph agreed to assume  million in debt owed by genco and the other subsidiaries ameren also transferred about  million in tax benefits the three subsidiaries would have received in  ameren retained gencos inactive hutsonville and meredosia plants and agreed to buy back from iph for  million three natural gas electrical generating plants dynegy agreed to honor the union collective bargaining agreements in force at all plants under the deal dynegy acquired five coalfired generating plants coffeen in coffeen illinois duck creek in canton illinois ed edwards in bartonville illinois joppa in joppa illinois and newton in newton illinois as the deal worked its way through state and federal regulatory approval dynegy took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced its debt the company obtained  billion in term loan b facilities and  million in revolving credit the company used this income to retire an  million sevenyear line of credit and a  million twoyear line of credit dynegy agreed that the revolving credit line would be paid off and terminate within five years two syndicated loans made up the  billion loan package the  million loan and the  million loan were both due in  this left dynegy with  billion in lines of credit and  million in outstanding bonds the ameren plantsfordebt swap also ran into trouble the federal energy regulatory commission ferc had to approve the deal and ensure that there was no negative impact on consumers from dynegys expanding market share in the midwest but on april  ferc said that the studies submitted by dynegy and ameren were inadequate and it ordered the two firms to rerun the studies and report back to ferc by july  on july  ferc again declined to approve or disapprove the dynegyameren deal the agency said that it dynegys study showed it charging market rates for energy in the midwest but ferc said it worried that transmission bottlenecks in the area would permit dynegy to charge much more furthermore federal regulators were considering an expansion in the market area iph could serve ferc asked dynegy to provide additional information on transmission limitations and market area expansion in august the sierra club formally filed opposition to the dynegyameren deal the environmental group said the transmission bottleneck issue gave dynegy too much market power it also argued that dynegy and ameren had submitted only regional market power data and had not accounted for local impacts which could be very severe another obstacle emerged on june  ameren was required to install pollutionreducing equipment on its five coalfired generating plants in  but because ameren was in financial difficulty it sought and received a waiver from the state of illinois granting it a fiveyear delay ameren sought to transfer this delay to dynegy so that dynegy would not have to immediately install the devices until  either but the illinois pollution control board denied amerens request dynegy filed its own request for a fiveyear waiver in july and warned that the ameren deal would fall apart if it did not receive the waiver but the sierra club the environmental law and policy center and other environmental groups said dynegy had the resources to install the equipment and opposed a waiver acm partners a financial firm hired by the sierra club also argued that dynegy purposefully left iph significantly underfunded and unable to tap into the parent companys resources dynegy disagreed but the firm warned that if iph went bankrupt workers would lose pensions and local communities would have to pay for any environmental remediation the illinois aflcio however supported dynegys request on september  saying that local jobs depended on the waiver the pollution board said it would make a decision by november  foresight energy a major illinois coal mining company said it would install the  million antipollution devices for free if dynegy agreed to sign a longterm contract to accept coal only from foresight energy dynegy declined the offer in part because it already has longterm coal contracts and environmental groups opposed it there was some speculation by financial analysts that the dynegyameren deal was a poor one julien dumoulinsmith executive director of ubs investment research said dynegy is far more likely to shutter all five coalpowered plants rather than add pollution control devices dumoulinsmith pointed out that the united states environmental protection agency epa issued final rules on sulfur dioxide emissions that go into effect in july  because the edwards plant is in an area of low air quality epa is likely to force dynegy to close the plant anyway the remaining four plants are borderline cases with the exception of duck creek station which spent nearly usm on sulfur dioxide removal and may also be forced to close if epa regulations tighten in the future a highly likely possibility he said  acquisitionsedit on august   dynegy announced a deal involving two interdependent transactions to be executed simultaneously dynegy acquired duke’s midwest

over california state court actions alleging that several power companies fraudulently failed to deliver reserve energy that might otherwise have helped to avert the states energy crises of  and ifarreaching economic and regulatory changes in one of the largest electric energy markets in the world provide the backdrop to this litigation   we begin with some context necessary to understanding the legal claims before usacalifornia adopted an energy policy in the mids that broke new ground in important respects   prior to the events at issue here california consumers had long relied upon investorowned utilities regulated by the california public utilities commission “cpuc” for the generation transmission and distribution of electricity   the traditional regulatory policy came under review in the mids however as ascendant free market philosophies and “changes in federal law intended to increase competition in the provision of electricity” prompted policymakers to rethink traditional assumptions underlying the markets structure    cal adv legis   serv   deering   perhaps the culmination of this rethinking was californias decision in  to initiate an aggressive market experiment to deregulate and to restructure its electricity markets   noting the energy industry restructuring already underway the california legislature decided that reshaping the market for california energy could help provide competitive lower cost and reliable electricity service while preserving the states commitment to developing diverse environmentally sensitive electricity resources  id assembly bill  “ab ” established the legal structure for the deregulation and restructuring plan  idthat legislation formed two nongovernmental entities to orchestrate the transmission and sale of electricity  the independent system operator “iso” and the independent power exchange “px” both of which are california nonprofit public benefit corporations   see  cal adv legis   serv    at the same time the cpuc authorized the investorowned utilities to sell electricity generation plants to other entities including to some of the parties in this litigation   until it ceased operations in  the px was a crucial hub of the electricity generation market overseeing an auction system for the sale and purchase of electricity on a nondiscriminatory basis to meet the electricity loads of exchange customers   as a public utility under the federal power act “fpa”  usc § a et seq the px was subject to the jurisdiction of the federal energy regulatory commission “ferc” and it operated pursuant to fercapproved tariffs and fercapproved wholesale rate schedulesresponsibility in turn for the efficient functioning of the highvoltage transmission grid fell to the iso which operates to this day   the iso manages the flow of electricity across the grid and balances supply and demand in real time   its operations are governed by a tariff and protocols on file with and approved by ferc to maintain the grid the iso procures both “imbalance energy” energy needed to balance the grid and ancillary services “operating reserves” or “reserve capacity” through various market auction processes   such procurement ensures that generation ie supply and load ie demand remain in balance at all times   producers that seek to sell imbalance energy or ancillary services to the iso enter a standard agreement with the iso the iso also designates and authorizes entities as “scheduling coordinators” which represent producers and purchasers and submit energy schedules to the iso specifying predicted energy production and usage over the next day   the scheduling coordinators enter a standard agreement and are the only entities that can submit bids to sell imbalance energy and ancillary services to the isoimbalance energy and ancillary services are distinct products procured through different market programs   the imbalance energy market is the socalled “real time” market in which bids to supply energy are made no later than  minutes prior to the operating hour   the iso ranks the supply bids and purchases the required energy paying all successful suppliers at the marketclearing price   ancillary services in contrast represent generating capacity that can be converted to energy and delivered to the grid in response to uncertain events such as major plant outages upon receiving an iso dispatch order   the ancillary services supplier warrants that it will comply with iso dispatch orders if the bid is accepted   accordingly it must hold its capacity in reserve during the potential production period and it receives payment for doing so even if no dispatch order is made   thus if the iso orders the producer to supply energy the supplier receives payment both for its withheld capacity and for the energy it was called upon to supply   the isos operations are governed by a tariff on file with and approved by fercbat issue in this litigation are the producers and scheduling coordinators activities in the ancillary services market particularly as brought to light during the electricity crises of  and    according to the state the crises created rolling blackouts endangered citizens health and safety damaged the states economy and were resolved only by the states purchase of expensive alternative longterm energy contracts   california partly blames the allegedly fraudulent business practices of several producers and traders of wholesale electricity including all appellees collectively the “companies” for the crisis and it has filed numerous lawsuits against them of which these are but a few   the cases consolidated before us state californias causes of action against the companies for violating state unfair competition law with respect to the ancillary services marketput succinctly california claims that the producers fraudulently sold energy on the spot market from reserve capacity that they had contracted to hold in reserve   california claims that although the companies received payment for their commitment of reserve capacity they were often unable to respond to iso dispatch orders when called upon to remedy market imbalances   because the grids stability requires that the iso balance electricity supply with demand on the grid on an hourly basis and because the companies were allegedly unable to respond to dispatch orders the iso was forced to attempt to find alternative energy sources during the periods of shortage   according to this theory the companies unauthorized sale of ancillary services energy threatened the stability of the grid system and left residents of the state vulnerable to blackouts and other disruptionscthere are two district court orders now before us on appeal and it is necessary to trace the history of the litigation to understand their significance   the attorney general of california filed lawsuits in san francisco county superior court seeking injunctions restitution disgorgement and civil penalties against multiple companies for doubleselling reserve generation capacity in violation of the california business  professions code see cal bus  prof code §  et seq   the companies removed the cases to the us district court for the northern district of california   california then moved to remand reasoning that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and that california enjoyed sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment which it contends barred the district court from exercising jurisdiction   see  usc § c  us const amend   xi the companies opposed the remand motions and also moved to dismiss   the district court denied the remand motions on august  california filed notices of appeal the “interlocutory appeals” and moved to stay further district court proceedings   in turn the companies moved in district court to certify the interlocutory appeals as frivolous   meanwhile california filed an emergency motion in this court to stay further district court proceedings   that same day a motions panel consolidated californias interlocutory appeals along with several related cases   while our court was in the process of scheduling briefing and hearing of the interlocutory appeals the district court denied the motion to stay and granted the companies motion to certify the interlocutory appeals as frivolous   california then filed a second emergency motion for a temporary stay with this court seeking to prevent the district court from ruling on the pending motions to dismiss   a motions panel denied both pending emergency motionsthe companies next moved to dismiss the interlocutory appeals for lack of appellate jurisdiction or alternatively to strike part of the opening brief   a motions panel denied the motion to dismiss without prejudice and referred the motion to strike to the merits panel   several collateral claims were also settled and dismissed voluntarily   the motions panel set an expedited schedule for briefing and hearing of the interlocutory appealson march   before the briefing of the interlocutory appeals was complete the district court granted the companies motion to dismiss and directed entry of final judgment on the merits california timely appealed and also moved to stay the interlocutory appeals to consolidate them with the appeal from the district courts final judgment on the merits and to expedite briefing and hearing of these appeals   on april   a motions panel granted this motion in its entirety and the consolidated appeals were duly set for expedited argument before us before us then are appeals from two orders  the district courts denial of remand to state court and its dismissal of californias unfair competition claims on the meritsiiwe must first decide whether the district court had removal jurisdiction over this action  see  usc § c  first california contends that the district lacked jurisdiction under  usc §  and  usc § p  and second it urges that the eleventh amendment also bars removal   we consider each issue in turna “the jurisdictional structure at issue in this case has remained basically unchanged for the past century”  franchise tax bd v constr   laborers vacation trust  us    sct   ledd     subject to certain exceptions not applicable here “any civil action brought in a state court of which the

court the district court reasoned simply that the complaint presented no independent state law claim   it was in effect an attempt to enforce federal tariffs   the claims were necessarily federal in

§ ddefining “sale of electric energy at wholesale”   section  of the fpa  usc § p consists in pertinent part of the following jurisdictional provisionthe district courts of the united states ․ shall have exclusive jurisdiction of violations of this chapter or the rules regulations and orders thereunder and of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by or to enjoin any violation of this chapter or any rule regulation or order thereunder usc § p   because a violation of or suit to enforce the tariff which has the same effect as an order or regulation plainly falls within the language of § p the companies contend that our jurisdictional inquiry can end here   see t  e pastorino nursery v duke energy trading  mktg llc  fsuppd   sdcal denying remand of state unfair trade practices claim alleging violations of tariff governing ancillary services marketbwe addressed an analogous question in sparta  sparta interprets a similarly worded jurisdictional provision within the securities exchange act of  “exchange act”   see  usc § aa  the exchange act authorizes the national association of securities dealers “nasd” to adopt rules and bylaws governing its association among which include the decision to list not to list or to delist an offering  sparta  fd at  the plaintiff in sparta filed a state court suit alleging “a variety of state commonlaw claims including breach of express and implied contract breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing gross negligence intentional misrepresentation negligent misrepresentation and interference with economic relations” against nasd and the nasdaq stock market inc “nasdaq”  id at    the gravamen of the allegation was that the nasd and nasdaq had improperly delisted and suspended trading in sparta stock on the opening day of the firms public offering rendering the offering unmarketablethe defendants removed to federal district court which we concluded had properly exercised jurisdiction over the action   we explained that though the plaintiff framed its lawsuit as a state law claim the alleged misconduct in its treatment of offering “must be exclusively determined by federal law” because the viability of the claim “depends on whether the associations rules were violated”  id at    indeed we explained  “if nasds action conformed to the rules there can be no viable cause of action  if its action violated the rules any claim falls under the imperative of  usc § aa which grants the federal courts ‘exclusive jurisdiction of violations of this chapter of the rules and regulations thereunder․’ ” id we reasoned that” the rule that state law claims cannot be alchemized into federal causes of action by incidental reference ․ has no application when relief is partially predicated on a subject matter committed exclusively to federal jurisdiction”  id at  see generally lippitt v raymond james fin servs  fd  th cir “a careful reading of artful pleading cases shows that no specific recipe exists for a court to alchemize a state claim into a federal claima court must look at a complex group of factors in any particular case to decide whether a state claim actually ‘arises under federal law”in the case before us as in sparta relief is “predicated on a subject matter committed exclusively to federal jurisdiction”  id at    the state lawsuit turns entirely upon the defendants compliance with a federal regulation  the tariff defines the companies contractual obligation with respect to the conduct at issue   absent a violation of the fercfiled tariff no state law liability could survive cdespite sparta california argues that no federal jurisdiction lies because there is no statutorily conferred right of action in federal court   ordinarily of course federal jurisdiction does not lie under  usc §  where there is no right of action conferred by federal statute   see merrell dow pharmaceuticals v thompson  us    sct   ledd   “a complaint alleging a violation of a federal statute as an element of a state cause of action when congress has determined that there should be no private federal cause of action for the violation does not state a claim ‘arising under the constitution laws or treaties of the united states’ ” citing  usc §   see also utley v varian assoc  fd   th cir  sparta establishes however that the exclusive jurisdiction provision takes the case outside of the rule of merrell dow and utley which otherwise might bar the action if the only jurisdictional provision implicated were  usc §    because there was no federal cause of action for spartas claim there would have been no jurisdiction predicated solely on  usc §   sparta  fd at    yet the claim lay “not under  usc §  but under  usc § aa”  id “thus neither merrell dow nor utley divested the district court of jurisdiction․” id similarly in the case before us the exclusive jurisdiction provision seemingly falls within our courts sparta exception to merrell dow and utleydcalifornia also argues that pan american petroleum corp v superior court of delaware  us   sct   ledd   requires remand  pan american decided under the natural gas act  usc  et seq addressed a substantially identical exclusive jurisdiction provision  at issue in pan american was a common law contract dispute between a natural gas producer pan american and a pipeline and distribution company cities service   after the parties contracted to transact at an agreedupon price the corporation commission of the state of kansas adopted a minimumrate order that altered the price  pan american  us at   sct    cities service wrote pan american a letter stating that it would pay the higher rate but explained that it would expect a refund if it prevailed in its legal challenge to the minimum rate order   pan american accepted payment on these terms   after this supplemental agreement the federal power commission the predecessor to ferc filed an order requiring independent producers to file rate schedules defined to include basic contracts and all supplements and amendments  id at   sct   see phillips petroleum co v wisconsin  us   sct   led   extending jurisdiction of federal power commission   the original contract was filed though the supplemental letter was not attached   after the kansas rateorder was found invalid see cities service gas co v state corporation comm  us   sct   ledd   cities service sued in delaware state court to recover its overpayment and the court was asked to decide whether the delaware court had jurisdiction over the action  pan american  us at   sct according to the court the state court claim did not fall within the purview of exclusive federal jurisdiction and the state properly exercised jurisdiction   the court explained  “we are not called upon to decide the extent to which the natural gas act reinforces or abrogates the private contract rights here in controversy   the fact that plaintiff sues in contract or quasicontract not the ultimate validity of its arguments is decisive”  pan american  us at   sct    because the complaint merely demanded recovery on alleged contracts to refund overpayment or for restitution of unjust enrichment the court concluded that “no right is asserted under the natural gas act” pan american  us at   sct pan american is distinguishable from the case before us   the pan american courts holding is unremarkable insofar as it held that cases falling outside the scope of the exclusive jurisdiction provision are not subject to it   the court gave only modest attention to whether the contract had been filed in whole or in part pursuant to the federal power commission order   this does not surprise given that the alleged private contract at issuein effect an option contract based on a future litigation eventdid not implicate the federal regulatory regime  pan american  us at   sct “the rights asserted by cities services are traditional commonlaw claims   they do not lose their character because it is common knowledge that there exists a scheme of federal regulation of interstate transmission of natural gas”   and in fact the supplemental letter bore only an attenuated connection to the filed original contract  id at   sct  by contrast the tariffs here directly implicate the federal regulatory regime were filed with ferc and concern obligations directly and exclusively arising under regulations issued pursuant to the fpa californias state claim represented a naked attempt to enforce these federal obligations   accordingly we hold as compelled by sparta that removal jurisdiction lies over a claim to enforce obligations that squarely fall within the exclusive jurisdiction provision of the federal power act see  usc § p b california also claims that eleventh amendment sovereign immunity bars removal of its lawsuit to the federal courts   though the state is a plaintiff in this action rather than a defendant being subject to suit california presents the novel at least in this court contention that principles of sovereign immunity are violated when a plaintiff state voluntarily prosecuting a claim is forced without its consent into a federal forum by operation of the federal removal statute the relationship between the eleventh amendment and state sovereign immunity is not as simple as it may sound while our approach to constitutional interpretation ordinarily requires us to begin with the text of the pertinent provision the supreme court has emphasized that “the sovereign immunity reflected in rather than created by the eleventh amendment transcends the narrow text of the amendment itself”  college sav bank v fla prepaid postsecondary ed expense bd  us    sct   ledd   describing the “whole point” of the supreme courts decision in hans v louisiana  us   sct   led     consistent with this conception the court has repeatedly recognized sovereign immunity outside the literal text of the eleventh amendment   see eg alden v maine  us   sct   ledd   holding state immune from suit brought in state court  seminole tribe of florida v florida  us   sct   ledd   holding state immune from suit involving a federal question  hans v louisiana  us   sct   led   holding state immune from suit brought by its own citizens   thus the supreme court has “understood the eleventh amendment to stand not so much for what it says but for the presupposition ․ which it confirms”  seminole tribe  us at   sct quoting blatchford v native vill of noatak  us    sct   ledd     this presupposition is that sovereign immunity preexisted the amendment  accordingly “the sovereign immunity of the states neither derives from nor is limited by the terms of the eleventh amendment”  alden  us at   sct    indeed as we have often been reminded see alden  us at   sct   hans  us at   sct  the amendments passage represented not the enshrinement of new doctrine but rather correction of the supreme courts misstep in chisholm v georgia  us  dall   led   which occasioned a nationwide “shock of surprise” and led swiftly to the eleventh amendments ratification   see alden  us at   sct   college sav bank  us at   sct  “though its precise terms bar only federal jurisdiction over suits brought against one state by citizens of another state or foreign state we have long recognized that the eleventh amendment accomplished much more  it repudiated the central premise of chisholm that the jurisdictional heads of article iii superseded the sovereign immunity that the states possessed before entering the union”  hans  us at   sct    thus despite the language of the eleventh amendment we have long understood that “the states immunity from suit is a fundamental aspect of the sovereignty which the states enjoyed before the ratification of the constitution and which they retain today ․ except as altered by the plan of the convention or certain constitutional amendments”  alden  us at   sct cognizant that the eleventh amendment can only be understood in this context we turn to its language recognizing that while but a reflection of underlying principle see college sav bank  us at   sct  it can nonetheless prove helpful in answering the question before us   that amendment providesthe judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state or by citizens or subjects of any foreign stateus const amend   xi indisputably the amendment limits the reach of federal judicial power to suits “commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states”  id emphasis added   it plainly protects states from being haled into federal courts as defendants   the state nevertheless urges that sovereign immunity extends even more broadly to litigation commenced by statesas plaintiffs not defendantswhen such suits are removed to federal court without the plaintiff states consent   californias argument in effect is that involuntary removal is the constitutional equivalent of bringing or commencing a suit against it or that sovereign immunity otherwise bars the same actionawhile we have not previously explored the intersection of state sovereign immunity and removal jurisdiction when the state is a plaintiff the supreme court and the constitutional framers have set down ample guideposts to shepherd our analysis   fewer than  years after the eleventh amendments ratification in  the court decided cohens v virginia  us  wheat    led   which posed the question whether certain individuals who had been convicted in virginia state court for selling district of columbia lottery tickets in violation of virginia state law could pursue a writ of error in the supreme court to assert a theory that the supremacy clause barred any prosecution because the lottery had been authorized by congress   virginia urged that it was being sued without its consent and sought to invoke the protections of eleventh amendment sovereign immunity   in addressing virginias eleventh amendment claim chief justice marshall explored what it means to commence or to prosecute a suitto commence a suit is to demand something by the institution of process in a court of justice  and to prosecute the suit is according to the common acceptation of language to continue that demand   by a suit commenced by an individual against a state we should understand process sued out by that individual against the state for the purpose of establishing some claim against it by the judgment of a court  and the prosecution of that suit is its continuance   whatever may be the stages of its progress the actor is still the sameid at  emphasis added   while observing that the judicial power does not “extend to any suit which may be commenced  or prosecuted against a state by the citizen of another state” id emphasis added the court held explicitly that the amendment does not reach suits initiated by states  id at  “the amendment therefore extended to suits commenced or prosecuted by individuals but not to those brought by states” emphasis added   this applied even though virginia initiated its suit in state court  id at  “if a suit brought in one court and carried by legal process to a supervising court be a continuation of the same suit then this suit is not commenced nor prosecuted against a state”   the supreme court accordingly rejected the states claim of sovereign immunitythe defendant who removes a judgment rendered against him by a state court into this court for the purpose of reexamining the question whether that judgment be in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states does not commence or prosecute a suit against the state whatever may be its opinion where the effect of the writ may be to restore the party to the possession of a thing which he demandsid at while addressing the question of appellate jurisdiction cohens counsels strongly that removal does not constitute the commencement or prosecution of a suit   california argues however that cohens not only involved the dissimilar circumstances of writ jurisdiction rather than the involuntary removal provisions not yet enacted but see charles a wright et al federal practice and procedure §  at d ed noting existence of limited removal provisions since the judiciary act of   stat    but also predated a more expansive conception of the eleventh amendment particularly that inaugurated by hans in subsequent eleventh amendment jurisprudence however does little to disturb the principle enunciated by cohens that plaintiff states may not invoke the amendment   in ames v kansas  us   sct   led   addressing the “arising under” removal provision of the act of march   see  stat   the court considered “the question whether a suit brought by a state in one of its own courts against a corporation amenable to its own process to try the right of the corporation to exercise corporate powers within the territorial limits of the state can be removed to the circuit court of the united states․” ames  us at   sct    while it made only a brief explicit mention of the eleventh amendment see id at   sct  the ames court addressed a similar argument to that offered by the state herethe   question we have to consider is therefore whether suits cognizable in the courts of the united states on account of the nature of the controversy and which need not be brought originally in the supreme court may now be brought in or removed to the circuit courts without regard to the character of the parties   all admit that the act does give the requisite jurisdiction in suits where a state is not a party so that the real question is whether the constitution exempts the states from its operationid at   sct    noting that “the same exemption was claimed in cohens v virginia  wheat  to show that the appellate jurisdiction of this court did not extend to the review of the judgments of a state court in a suit by a state against one of its citizens” ames  us at   sct  the court rejected the states claim  id “the argument would have great force if urged to prove that this court could not establish the demand of a citizen upon his state but is not entitled to the same force when urged to prove that this court cannot inquire whether the constitution or laws of the united states protect a citizen from a prosecution instituted against him by a state” quoting cohens  us at   us  marshall cjwhile the ames decision predates hans ames was relied upon by the supreme court in illinois v milwaukee  us    sct   ledd     in that matter the relevant question was whether the federal district court had jurisdiction under  usc § a to entertain suit by the state of illinois against certain nonstate political subdivisions in wisconsin  id at   sct    though amess sovereign immunity analysis was not necessary to the courts holding in illinois the court betrayed no hint that ames had fallen into disfavoras respects the power of a state to bring an action under § a ames v kansas  us    sct   led  is controlling   there kansas had sued a number of corporations in its own courts and since federal rights were involved the defendants had the cases removed to the federal court   kansas resisted saying that the federal court lacked jurisdiction because of art iii §  cl  of the constitution which gives this court “original jurisdiction” in “all cases ․ in which a state shall be party”   the court held that where a state is suing parties who are not other states the original jurisdiction of this court is not exclusive id at   sct  and that those suits “may now be brought in or removed to the circuit courts now the district courts without regard to the character of the parties”  ibid we adhere to that rulingillinois  us at   sct  footnotes omitted alterations in originalbsince ames the court has on several occasions reviewed in detail the meaning purpose and history of sovereign immunity and the eleventh amendment   see eg alden  us at   sct   hans  us   sct   led this history gives little indication that sovereign immunity was ever intended to protect plaintiff states   rather it plainly understands sovereign immunity as protection from being sued   even before what little debate the eleventh amendment stirred the constitutional ratification debate probed in detail the meaning of article iii section  of the constitution which some feared by authorizing federal jurisdiction over cases “between a state and citizens of another state” would subject states to suit by outofstate creditors and infringe their immunity from suit  alden  us at   sct   hans  us at   sct   “although the state conventions which addressed the issue of sovereign immunity in their formal ratification documents sought to clarify the point by constitutional amendment they made clear that they like hamilton madison and marshall understood the constitution as drafted to preserve the states immunity from private suits”   alden  us at   sct  emphasis added   thus for example the ratification documents of new york and rhode island both proclaimed “that the judicial power of the united states in cases in which a state may be a party does not extend to criminal prosecutions or to authorize any suit by any person against a state”  debates on the federal constitution  j elliot d ed  quoted in alden  us at   sct  new york   id at   sct  quoted in alden  us at   sct  mainethe court has in turn

halderman  us    sct   ledd   “the general rule is that a suit is against the sovereign if the judgment sought would expend itself on the public treasury or domain or interfere with the public administration or if the effect of the judgment would be to restrain the government from acting or to compel it to act” internal citations and quotations omittednonetheless the state contends that removal forces a state to appear against its will in the court of another sovereign and that sovereign immunity broadly protects “the states litigation choices” it is longsettled though that “although a state may not be sued without its consent such immunity is a privilege which may be waived” gunter v atl clr co  us    sct   led   “by consenting to suit”  coll sav bank  us at   sct citing clark v barnard  us    sct   led states voluntary appearance in federal court avoids sovereign immunity inquiry “hence where a state voluntarily becomes a party to a cause and submits its rights for judicial determination it will be bound thereby and cannot escape the result of its own voluntary act by invoking the prohibitions of the eleventh amendment”  gunter  us at   sct finding waiver where state sues in federal court   while californias hope was to avoid the federal forum it voluntarily appeared in state court to press its claims against the companies who predictably sought removal to what they perceived to be a more favorable forum for the adjudication of claims involving federal law   waiver by litigation conduct “rests upon the amendments presumed recognition of the judicial need to avoid inconsistency anomaly and unfairness and not upon a states actual preference or desire which might after all favor selective use of ‘immunity’ to achieve litigation advantages”  lapides  us at   sct  citing wis dept of corr v schacht  us    sct   ledd   kennedy j concurring finding waiver when state is involuntarily made a party in state court and subsequently seeks removal to federal court for the foregoing reasons we hold that a state that voluntarily brings suit as a plaintiff in state court cannot invoke the eleventh amendment when the defendant seeks removal to a federal court of competent jurisdiction   in so holding our conclusion is consistent with those of our sister circuits  see oklahoma ex rel edmondson v magnolia marine transp co  fd   th cir “the eleventh amendments abrogation of federal judicial power ‘over any suit ․ commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states does not apply to suits commenced or prosecuted by a state”  regents of univ

shield is unavailingiii having resolved the jurisdictional issues we now turn to the merits   the district court dismissed californias claims as barred by federal preemption and in the alternative the

that californias enforcement of its unfair business practices law may affect rates this effect california asserts is merely an indirect consequence of state regulation whose purpose is to deter fraudulent and unfair conduct not to regulate interstate wholesale power rates in support of its view that the fpa does not preempt such state regulation california points to  usc § af which reserves for states regulatory authority to the extent that it “does not conflict with the exercise of the commissions powers under or relating to subsection e of this section”   we cannot agree with californias theory that the state has regulatory authority over the specific tariffgoverned conduct alleged in this case  as we elaborate more fully below our cases specifying the nature and scope of exclusive ferc jurisdiction make clear that the interstate “transmission” or “sale” of wholesale energy pursuant to a federal tariffnot merely the “rates”falls within fercs exclusive jurisdiction   states do of course have jurisdiction over certain sales but we have enunciated a brightline distinction between wholesale sales which fall within fercs plenary jurisdiction and retail sales over which the states exercise jurisdiction   see duke energy  fd at “retail sales of electricity and wholesale intrastate sales are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the states ․”  see also id  “ ‘interstate power rates filed with ferc or fixed by ferc must be given binding effect’ by state authorities in areas subject to state jurisdiction eg retail sales  hence ferc approved rates preempt conflicting regulations adopted by the states” citing nantahala  us at   sct    nor for example has the court limited the file rate doctrine “to rates per se or ferc orders that deal in terms of prices or volumes or purchases”  duke energy  fd at citing nantahala  us at   sct two leading cases in this area duke energy and tanc both support the view that californias lawsuit falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of ferc in duke energy in response to the same energy crises that form the factual background of this appeal the governor of california declared a state of emergency and commandeered the rights to certain longterm electricity contracts  duke energy  fd at    these wholesale contracts provided for liquidation of collateral in the event of nonperformance and the buyers unable to pass through increased wholesale costs to their customers had defaulted   because the spotmarket price of electricity had skyrocketed the lowerprice longterm contracts had substantial market value that threatened to evaporate   california sought to commandeer the longterm contracts to preserve their value  id at   see cal govt code §    because the commandeering order deprived the seller of financial security protection and assurance of payment we concluded that “the default mitigation and security provisions of the ․ rate schedule with which the governors commandeering orders directly conflict fell well within fercs exclusive jurisdiction over interstate wholesale electricity sales”  duke energy  fd at    the governor had “encroached upon fercs exclusive authority”  idsimilarly to the case before us in duke energy california tried to exert authority over the substantive provisions of a fercapproved tariff   here the tariff governing ancillary services includes explicit remedial provisions over which ferc similarly has exclusive authority   while in duke energy california sought to alter the tariff terms by rendering null and void the liquidation provision here california seeks to impose judicial remedies in addition to those that ferc may impose   in each case california seeks to encroach upon authority entrusted exclusively to ferc by the fpa in tanc we held that the fpa preempted state law tort and property claims regarding the construction and operation of interconnections between various electricity interties in the pacific northwest   the transmission agency of northern california “tanc” alleged that the operation of the alturas intertie damaged or trespassed upon the californiaoregon transmission project  “ferc however approved the operation of the alturas intertie and its connection to” the intertie at issue  tanc  fd at    in finding federal preemption we explained that “tanc cannot obtain state law money damages allegedly resulting from the operation of an interstate electricity intertie expressly approved by ferc where the manner of operation was necessarily contemplated at the time of approval”  id indeed we reasoned that “ferc has approved the construction and operation of the alturas intertie and ferc alone ․ can modify that decision or deal with any party who operates the alturas intertie improperly”  id at    thus tanc like duke energy stands for the proposition that remedies for breach and nonperformance of ferc approved operating agreements in the interstate wholesale electricity market fall within the exclusive domain of ferc californias unfair competition claims are based on the companies agreement to provide ancillary services the terms of which are embodied in and governed by the iso tariff including its remedial provisions   accordingly we conclude that california claims are preempted because they encroach upon the substantive provisions of the tariff an area reserved exclusively to ferc both to enforce and to seek remedy  see duke energy  fd at “it is common ground that if ferc has jurisdiction over a subject the states cannot have jurisdiction over the same subject” quoting miss power  light co v miss power ex rel moore  us    sct   ledd   scalia j concurring b californias challenge to the district courts alternative holding based on the filed rate doctrine presents a closely related issue and we address it separately if briefly because it reinforces our conclusion   see entergy la inc v la psc  us    sct   ledd   “when the filed rate doctrine applies to state regulators it does so as a matter of federal preemption through the supremacy clause”   “at its most basic the filed rate doctrine provides that state law and some federal law ․ may not be used to invalidate a filed rate nor to assume a rate would be charged other than the rate adopted by the federal agency in question”  tanc  fd at    the filed rate doctrine however is “not limited to rates per se”  nantahala power  us at   sct  under the filed rate doctrine the terms of the filed tariff “are considered to be ‘the law’ and to therefore ‘conclusively and exclusively enumerate the rights and liabilities ” of the contracting parties  evanns v at  t corp  fd   th cir citing marcus v at  t co  fd   d cir  see also evanns  fd at  n  as a result “the filed rate doctrine bars all claimsstate and federalthat attempt to challenge the terms of a tariff that a federal agency has reviewed and filed”  county of stanislaus v pacific gas  elec co  fd  th cir  evanns  fd at    see also at  t co v central office tel inc  us    sct   ledd   filed rate doctrine barred state law claims for breach of contract and tortious interference with contractual relations   thus to the extent that california argues that the companies owe “obligations ․ beyond those set out in the filed tariffs ․ such claim is also barred by the filed rate doctrine”  evanns  fd at  “the filed rate doctrines purpose is to ensure that the filed rates are the exclusive source of the terms and conditions by which the regulated entity provides ․ the services covered by the tariff”  brown v mci worldcom network servs inc  fd   th cir internal citations omitted   to the extent that california is seeking to enforce the penalty provisions of the tariff or to have them expanded this conflicts with the filed rate doctrine and the exclusive authority conferred to ferc to enforce its tariff ivfor the foregoing reasons we affirm the district courts denial of the motions for remand and we affirm its dismissal of the substantive claimsaffirmedfootnotes   on may   a motions panel granted the companies motion to have a single merits panel hear several appeals involving other causes of action brought by california arising out of the energy crises   on may   however the motions panel rescinded the order and established an accelerated briefing schedule for the ancillary services appeal before us   the other appeals were assigned to different merits panels   the companies argue that we lack appellate jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeals and ask that the relevant portions of the states brief be struck   see  usc § permitting appeals of “final decisions of the district courts”  digital equip corp v desktop direct  us    sct   ledd   noting that exceptions to the general rule permitting a single appeal are to be interpreted narrowly   now that the interlocutory appeal has been consolidated with the district courts final judgment on the merits this consolidated appeal constitutes the single appeal “in which claims of district court error at any stage of the litigation may be ventilated”   id at   sct    accordingly we deny the motion to strike   we review de novo the denial of a motion to remand an action to state court for want of removal jurisdiction  ethridge  fd at    the complaint claims the iso has an exclusive possessory interest as to “all generating capacity it procures through the ancillary services markets   the isos interest includes the right to determine how much energy if any should be produced out of the capacity it has procured”   the exchange act providesthe district courts of the united states and the united states courts of any territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the united states shall have exclusive jurisdiction of violations of this title or the rules and regulations thereunder and of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this title or the rules and regulations thereunder usc § aa   the very face of californias complaint betrays that the gravamen of the complaint is the companies alleged violations of federal tariff obligations   it repeatedly cites the federal tariff and alleges that the companies violated the agreement embodied within it   while california insists that the district court was obliged to remand if at least one independent state law theory of relief existed see duncan v stuetzle  fd   th cir “if a single statelaw based theory of relief can be offered for each of the three causes of action in the complaint then the exercise of removal jurisdiction was improper” we do not discern any such claim   according to california the state unfair competitions disjunctive phrasing permits relief for practices that are either “unfair unlawful or fraudulent”   see cal bus  prof code §    with respect to unlawfulness california urges that the companies improperly converted property to which the iso had the exclusive right of possession and control   yet this claim is based entirely on alleged tariff obligations i to hold ancillary services capacity in reserve prior to receipt of an iso dispatch instruction and ii to comply with isos dispatch instructions   the federal tariff wholly governs the lawfulness of the companies conduct   similarly with respect to the “unfair” and “fraudulent” terms the claims depend entirely upon the federal tariff   cf celtech communications inc v los angeles cellular telephone co  calth    calrptrd   pd  cal “courts may not simply impose their own notions of the day as to what is fair or unfair”   california also cites lippitt v raymond james fin servs  fd  th cir in which we reversed the district courts decision to retain removal jurisdiction  lippitt involved a private attorney generals lawsuit under cal bus  profcode §  et seq against several brokerage firms for sales and marketing practices associated with certain investment products  lippitt  fd at    in that case however we found clear congressional recognition of state competence in the securities field see lippitt  fd at  citing  us § bb and explicitly distinguished sparta noting that “unlike the situation  in sparta ․ a state court need not inquire into nyse regulations or even refer to federal law in the case before us”  lippitt  fd at    here by contrast the reference to and necessity of relying upon federal law is unavoidable   the fpa and the natural gas act “nga” are similar statutory schemes and that the supreme court has held that the applicable case law for the two acts is often interchangeable   see ark la gas co v hall  us   n   sct   ledd  “the relevant provisions of the two statutes are in all material respects substantially identical․ we therefore follow our established practice of citing interchangeably decisions interpreting the pertinent sections of the two statutes”  permian basin area rate cases  us    sct   ledd    fpc v sierra pacific power co  us    sct   led     the natural gas act provision statesthe district courts of the united states and the united states courts of any territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the united states shall have exclusive jurisdiction of violations of this act or the rules regulations and orders thereunder and of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by or to enjoin any violation of this act or any rule regulation or order thereunder usc § u   as california stresses the pan american court does state that the natural gas acts exclusive jurisdiction provision is not a “generator of jurisdiction” beyond that otherwise arising under the natural gas act pan american  us at   sct   see  usc §    we feel bound however by spartas subsequent interpretation of language substantially identical to that contained within the fpa and its conclusion that “the rule that state law claims cannot be alchemized into federal causes of action by incidental reference has no application when relief is partially predicated on a subject matter committed exclusively to federal jurisdiction”  sparta  fd at  internal citation omitted   because we hold that sparta controls we do not reach the companies other jurisdictional arguments under arco envtl remediation v dept of health and envtl quality  fd   th cir and related cases   we review de novo a partys claimed immunity under the eleventh amendment  california ex rel cal dept of toxic substance control v campbell  fd   th cir   section  providesthe judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this constitution the laws of the united states and treaties made or which shall be made under their authorityto all cases affecting ambassadors other public ministers and consulsto all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdictionto controversies to which the united states shall be a partyto controversies between two or more statesbetween a state and citizens of another statebetween citizens of different statesbetween citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states and between a state or the citizens thereof and foreign states citizens or subjectsus const art iii §    to the extent that california relies on thomas v fag bearings corp  fd  th cir for support that case merely stands for the proposition that involuntary joinder of a state as a party to a litigation can violate eleventh amendment sovereign immunity   california points to two district court opinions which we deem unpersuasive   see california v steelcase inc  fsupp   cdcal offering brief alternative holding that the eleventh amendment provides “immunity from being made an involuntary party to an action in federal court” and “should apply equally to the case where the state is a plaintiff in an action commenced in state court and the action is removed to federal court by the defendant”  moore ex rel mississippi v abbott lab  fsupp   sdmiss relying entirely upon steelcase    we review de novo the district courts fedrcivp b dismissal lipton v pathogenesis corp  fd  th cir including its analysis of preemption transmission agency of california v sierra pacific power co  fd   th cir and the filed rate doctrine  brown v mci worldcom network servs inc  fd   th cir   to the extent that california argues that application of its unfair competition laws merely represents an indirect intrusion into fercs exclusive authority schneidewind v anr pipeline co  us    sct   ledd   “of course every state statute that has some indirect effect on rates and facilities ․ is not preempted” rather than direct interference with that agencys ability to enforce the tariff we are not persuaded   see generally n natural gas co v state corp commn  us    sct   ledd   “the federal regulatory scheme leaves no room either for direct state regulation of the prices of interstate wholesales of natural gas or for state regulations which would indirectly achieve the same result” citation omitted    usc § e provides that upon a determination by ferc that “any rate charge or classification demanded observed charged or collected by any public utility for any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the commission or that any rule regulation practice or contract affecting such rate charge or classification is unjust unreasonable unduly discriminatory or preferential the commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate charge classification rule regulation practice or contract to be thereafter observed and in force and shall fix the same by order”   usc § e   even if california were correct that ferc has exclusive authority over wholesale rates but not sales we observe without deciding that the distinction appears to carry little weight on these facts   according to california by failing to adhere to their tariff obligations to provide reserve energy capacity the companies rendered the iso incapable of maintaining the grids stability by maintaining supply and demand   thus its allegation goes directly to wholesale market activities   while california argues that its unfair competition laws extend broadly beyond mere regulation of interstate wholesale power rates the fact that its claims are founded upon state laws of general applicability does not counsel against preemption   see duke energy  fd at  holding preemption by cal govt code §  a law of general applicability   with respect to fraud we note that we found persuasive in tanc the law of our sister circuits holding that procurement of a filed rate by fraud did not preclude filed rate preemption   see tanc  fd at    we note that proceedings are ongoing before ferc regarding much of the misconduct alleged in californias claim   see order to show cause concerning gaming andor anomalous market behavior  ferc ¶  june     because we conclude that the fpa preempts the field we do not separately address the question of conflict preemption   while the state concedes that the tariff prohibits doubleselling of reserve capacity it contends that restitution and disgorgement of the companies illbegot gains does not conflict with the filed tariff   but the tariff itself specifies the penalties to which companies are subject for violating their reserve capacity commitments   nor does californias citation to arkansas louisiana gas co v hall  us    sct   ledd   hereinafter arkla  require a different result   in arkla the court found a state contract claim to be preempted under the filed rate doctrine concluding that “to permit parties to vary by private agreement the rates filed with the commission would undercut the clear purpose of the congressional scheme  granting the commission an opportunity in every case to judge the reasonableness of the rate”  id while the arkla court did cite to pan american  us at   sct  see arkla  us at  n   sct  as california notes the singular reference to pan americanat its core a case on jurisdiction as discussed above and one whose discussion of filed rate doctrine is limitedstands simply for the proposition that the filed rate doctrine does not abrogate all private contracts such as those for refunds of charges in excess of and not in conflict with the filed rate   see arkla  us at  n   sct    here by contrast california seeks “to alter the terms and conditions provided for in the tariff” central office  us at   sct  rehnquist j concurring particularly with respect to remedies for noncomplianceoscannlain circuit judge
