copper concentrate copper cathodes continuous cast copper rod copper specialty products molybdenum gold copper is an internationally traded commodity and its price is effectively determined by the major metals exchanges — the london metal exchange lme the new york commodity exchange comex and  the shanghai futures exchange shfe prices on these exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand and can be volatile and cyclical in general demand for copper reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth particularly in industrial production and construction according to wood mackenzie a widely followed independent metals market consultant copper’s enduse markets and their estimated shares of total consumption are construction  percent consumer products  percent electrical applications  percent transportation  percent and industrial machinery  percent copper’s physical attributes include superior electrical conductivity corrosion resistance structural capability efficient heat transfer and aesthetics other materials that compete with copper include aluminum plastics stainless steel and fiber optics substitution of competing materials has been modest because it is difficult to duplicate copper’s unique characteristics copper consumption is closely associated with industrial production and therefore tends to follow economic cycles during an expansion demand for copper tends to increase thereby driving up the price as a result copper prices are volatile and cyclical we are one of the worlds leading producers of copper concentrate cathode and continuous cast copper rod copper concentrate copper concentrate is a dry powder that is used as a feedstock for smelters we supply it to our own smelters and to third party smelters copper

search search better buy freeportmcmoran inc vs alcoa which mining and metals company looks better find out here dan caplinger tmfgalagan jun   at pm for investors in natural resources freeportmcmoran nysefcx and alcoa nyseaa have taken different angles at the broader industry freeportmcmoran has gone through several transformative moves over its history starting as an integrated natural resources company later spinning off energy assets to become a mining specialist and then later reintegrating its oil and gas exposure through acquisition to become a larger naturalresources play meanwhile alcoa is now focused solely on its basemetals business after spinning off its engineered products division as a separate publicly traded company now that markets are rebounding investors are looking to find out whether freeport or alcoa is the better pick lets look at the two companies to see how they stack up based on a number of popular metrics stock performance and valuation freeportmcmoran and alcoa have moved in different directions recently alcoa is up  since june  but freeportmcmoran has eased downward falling  over the past  months from a valuation standpoint its tough to evaluate freeport or alcoa based on recent earnings thats because both companies have had depressed bottom lines as they recover from long downturns in their respective industries currently freeport has a trailing earnings multiple of  while alcoas has soared into the triple digits that makes the numbers less than completely meaningful assessing the two companies on a forward basis is simpler based on future earnings projections freeport trades at a forward earnings multiple of less than nine alcoas price of about  times forward earnings is also attractive but it isnt enough to match the copper and gold miner and energy company despite its poor stock performance freeport looks like the better bet from a valuation perspective image source alcoa dividends neither freeportmcmoran nor alcoa pays a dividend currently each of the companies has a history of making dividend payments to shareholders but recent tough times forced them to take a closer look at their dividend policies and make adjustments in order to adapt to adverse conditions freeport hasnt paid a dividend in a couple of years corresponding to when crude oil started to plunge freeport continues to face challenges in its core businesses and even though conditions have gotten better across the commodities markets the recent price drop in crude is just the latest reminder that gains can quickly reverse themselves nevertheless some hope that a recovery for the natural resources stock last year might signal an ability to pay a dividend again in the near future alcoa meanwhile is in a position in which it needs to figure out how to adapt to its new corporate structure alcoas previous dividend was relatively small and financing needs connected to the spinoff required the continuing entity to retain more capital earlier this year alcoas chief financial officer said that restoring a dividend will require reducing leverage levels and that will take time to achieve even once things get better though alcoa could choose stock buybacks or a special dividend rather than instituting a regular quarterly dividend for now investors cant expect any dividend income from either stock in the near future itll take much better conditions for freeport or alcoa to start paying out money again growth prospects and risk the main challenge that freeportmcmoran and alcoa face is that while conditions in their industries have improved they havent gotten back to normal freeport has had to deal with the ongoing tug of war in the energy markets as oil has recently fallen back below the  perbarrel level weak fundamentals in the market for crude suggests that further downside is possible and that would only exacerbate the problems that have led to massive impairment charges for freeport assets meanwhile freeport hopes that its copper and gold business can gain ground but the indonesian government is still a potential impediment as it seeks to put more restrictions and collect more taxes on the miners most important mining asset it will take sustained gains in the commodities markets for freeport to get back to its best possible growth trajectory alcoa has benefited so far from its move to split off its valueadd engineered products unit as the base metals part of the business has done well alcoa has worked hard to cut back on expenses and early signs suggest that the efforts are paying off with better income figures lowcost foreign rivals are still a problem that alcoa has to surmount and the company has substantial obligations that it will have to fund over the long run however as demand for lowerweight metals increases alcoa is likely to become even more important to the overall economic recovery overall alcoa looks like the better buy right now even with its recent shareprice gains freeport is too dependent on the volatile energy market while alcoa can count on being able to do better once levels of activity in the industrial economy perk up freeport will reach its full potential only if energy bounces back sharply dan caplinger has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool owns shares of freeportmcmoran copper  gold the motley fool has a disclosure policy
