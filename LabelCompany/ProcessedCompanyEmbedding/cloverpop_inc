finished i was able to quickly see where we stood as a group people could give their real opinions” “this is an awesome tool i have never experienced more ease making such a decision and its especially effective when your colleagues are more difficult than the decision youre making” “we had been discussing this decision for months without making headway using cloverpop enabled me to glean the proper knowledge to make an informed decision this was an effective efficient way to make a very tough decision” “i like the fact that you could basically hold a business meeting where everyone can attend on their own time” “i felt much more confident making the decision using cloverpop i wasn’t sure where everyone stood and what they thought was best being able to see everyone’s feelings and thoughts when making the decision was invaluable” “cloverpop really gave me insight into where everyone else was with this decision when you are just discussing something in a meeting it is easy to not remember someone’s concerns or misinterpret how much a certain concern means to someone” “i like how cloverpop flows and how easy it is to use it is a simple and straightforward system to help make business decisions easier and to get the input of your team” “while i expected cloverpop might help to brainstorm and call up concerns that may not be particularly obvious what it can also do is show just how much consensus actually exists for a particular solution” “making this decision had become stressful and was putting a strain on interpersonal relationships in the office using cloverpop allowed me to step away from the emotional and look solely at the logic” “i think some of the team do a better job when they are not face to face with everyone else it is easier for them to let everyone know pros and cons without feeling pressured it also helps them brainstorm their ideas and keeps them focused” “cloverpop helped to crystallize my decision i tend to stew on decisions i try to look outwardly confident and put out an attitude of not looking backbut i kind of do im not looking back on this decision at all im really confident that this is the right thing to do” “i like how the cloverpop system flows i added my decision and it helps me go through the pros and cons how i feel about them and what alternatives may exist it is easy to understand as well as being well designed”  reasons cloverpop is for you sometimes people disagree with you approximately 7 percent of managers think disagreements are a problem although  percent disagree about the right solution luckily  percent agree on cloverpop you want to make better decisions than einstein daniel kahneman proved that even nobel prize winners like him take biased shortcuts when making decisions yes even einstein cloverpop helps you make better decisions than einstein how cool is that it’s monday morning the business week is about making things happen decisions make things happen get in the habit of using cloverpop to make things happen or procrastinate until wednesday sometimes decisions take too long we know you don’t want to judge but seriously they’re dragging their feet they’re pushing their own agendas they’re not seeing things objectively what is it with these people you value input from other people humans are social we cooperate to get bigger things done than we can do alone humans are smart we see things from different perspectives none of us are smarter than many of us it’s wednesday it’s hump day there’s still time to salvage your week by making something happen think of it like skiing surfing or doing yoga  it’s fun to do looks cool and good for you too you create presentations presentations actually eat our brains they are digitized zombie spawn they use brainwashing techniques to convince people to do our bidding only brainwash people if you know you are right you create a lot of presentations look we get it presentations are cool it’s just that they eat our brains at least use cloverpop to unscramble everyone’s brains before feeding them to the zombies scrambled brains taste awful you schedule meetings meetings waste like b every year stop having meetings to talk past each other use cloverpop to get the full picture then decidemaybe without any meetings at all you send emails ok so maybe you are a social person and like decision meetings but emails are not social email addiction shrinks our brains help your brain grow use cloverpop you send a lot of emails don’t let emails suck the fun out of work they trick you into taking positions and advocating for decisions before you know what’s right and then there’s unread emails ccing peopleugh you do yoga yoga is like cloverpop for your body we don’t know what that means but yoga is blowing up right now so we want to associate our product with yoga sometimes you’re not sure what to do believe it or not almost  percent of rational people face business decisions that have a high degree of uncertainty never let them see you sweatbut remember they are sweating too you are busy cloverpop is easy it takes about  minutes to save you from  hours of disagreement and speed up decisions by  days you are frickin’ busy you should do it you want better performance reviews and higher raises most managers ignore decision best practices chumps don’t they realize they could boost their performance 0 and increase their pay  hint multiply your salary by  view more  reasons cloverpop is not for you no one disagrees with you ever if you don’t listen to other people do they really exist there’s a fine line between absolute power and always being right and you live on both sides of the line nobel prize winners don’t impress you sure some guy won an award in sweden after spending sixty years proving people take too many biased decision shortcuts what does he know that your gut doesn’t your gut is awesome it’s the weekend decisions are awesome but who wants to build yet another business product that screws up our weekends go do yoga play with your kids take a nap eat a salad pet a dog stakeholders never slow you down some people call it leaping to conclusions you ask what’s wrong with jumping off cliffs alone while everyone else watches from a safe distance you like giving advice off the top of your head you thought about it for a second and vaguely remember a situation in your past that might be relevant no reason to clear your head and look at things objectively just start talking it’s friday when it comes to business decisionsfridays are basically the weekend not the best day to make decisions a pretty good day to do other stuff online shopping anyone office football pool you never make rationalizations what’s the fun in telling stories that make it sound like you’re always right you are eating stop deciding and pay attention to what you’re shoving in your mouth savor your meals take small bites eat superfoods how many times do you have to be told this you are playing with kids kids know more about ipads than you do they know how to use crafting tables in minecraft just hand cloverpop over and put them in charge you feel like taking a nap naps are awesome they make you smarter they make you better looking they make you live longer happier lives please don’t let cloverpop keep you from taking a nap you are petting your dog dogs are pleasers they reduce stress and anxiety they don’t cc people and they don’t care if you mess up and crater your company just throw the ball and rub the belly you are washing your cat you’ve already got your hands full seriously those things are razorclawed armshredding hissing hair bombs you’ve had a few drinks six words that should never be trusted after a six pack “i know what we should do” you don’t like people there is nothing better than using work decisions to torture people arguments confusion uncertainty really well crafted flame emails  the spice of life you are a posteconomic hermit once you have f you money who really gives a s right or you could decide to peel off those pjs and do something useful with the rest of your life just sayin’ view more drive 0 higher performance with 0
