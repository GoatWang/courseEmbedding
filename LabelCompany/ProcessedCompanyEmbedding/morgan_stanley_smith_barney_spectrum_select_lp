by published nov    pm et share edgar online via comtex  item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of september   the percentage of assets allocated to each market sector was approximately as follows interest rate  currency  equity  and commodity  liquidity the partnership deposits its assets with msco as its clearing commodity broker in separate futures forward and option trading accounts established for each trading advisor such assets are used as margin to engage in trading and may be used as margin solely for the partnerships trading the assets are held either in noninterest bearing bank accounts or in securities and instruments permitted by the cftc for investment of customer segregated or secured funds since the partnerships sole purpose is to trade in futures forwards options and us treasury bills it is expected that the partnership will continue to own such liquid assets for margin purposes the partnerships investment in futures forwards options and us treasury bills may from time to time be illiquid most us futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit if the price for a particular futures or options contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit positions in that futures or options contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading these market conditions could prevent the partnership from promptly liquidating its futures or options contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions there is no limitation on daily price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies the markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid which may prevent the partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets subjecting it to substantial losses either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions for the periods covered by this report illiquidity has not materially affected the partnerships assets there are no known material trends demands commitments events or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the partnerships liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way as of september   approximately  of the partnerships total investment exposure is futures contracts which are exchangetraded while approximately  is forward contracts which are offexchange traded capital resources the partnership does not have nor does it expect to have any capital assets the partnerships only assets are its equity in trading accounts consisting of restricted and unrestricted cash net unrealized gain on open contracts and investments in us treasury bills at fair value if applicable redemptions of units in the future will affect the amount of funds available for investments in futures forwards options and us treasury bills in subsequent periods it is not possible to estimate the amount and therefore the impact of future outflows of units there are no known material trends favorable or unfavorable that would affect nor any expected material changes to the partnerships capital resource arrangements at the present time table of contents offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the partnership does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements nor does it have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments that would affect its liquidity or capital resources results of operations general the partnerships results depend on the trading advisors and the ability of each trading advisors trading program to take advantage of price movements in the futures forward and options markets altis trades its global futures portfolio program on behalf of the partnership it is a systematic automated trading program that builds on the market experience of altis principals and employs a unique proprietary advanced asset allocator the advanced asset allocator was specifically developed to manage portfolios of derivative instruments in a robust and scalable manner the portfolio management technology combines original traditional and contrasting investment techniques into one complete and comprehensive trading system investment changes are implemented after considering their effect on the whole portfolio and not just on the individual markets concerned graham currently trades its allocated portion of the partnerships assets pursuant to grahams global diversified program as described below at  leverage the global diversified program features the first trend system that graham developed which began trading client accounts in  it utilizes multiple computerized trading models and offers broad diversification in both financial and nonfinancial markets trading in approximately  global markets the global diversified programs trend system is primarily longterm in nature and is intended to generate significant returns over time with an acceptable degree of risk and volatility the computer models analyze on a daily basis the recent price action the relative strength and the risk characteristics of each market and compare statistically the quantitative results of this data to years of historical data on each market emc currently trades its classic program for the partnership emcs investment strategies are technical rather than fundamental in nature in other words they are developed from analysis of patterns of actual monthly weekly and daily price movements and are not based on analysis of fundamental supply and demand factors general economic factors or anticipated world events emc relies on historical analysis of these price patterns to interpret current market behavior and to evaluate technical indicators for trade initiations and liquidations emcs investment strategies used in its program are trendfollowing this means that initiation and liquidation of positions in a particular market are generally in the direction of the price trend in that market although at times countertrend elements also may be employed emc employs an investment strategy which utilizes a blend of systems or stated another way a number of systems simultaneously the strategies are diversified in that its program follows a number of futures interests and often invests in more than ten different interests at one time rabar trades its investment strategy on behalf of the partnership the objective of rabars investment strategy is to generate capital appreciation over the long run by investing exclusively in futures interests including exchangetraded futures contracts options on futures contracts foreign currency forward contracts and to a very limited extent cash commodities rabar may also engage in exchange for physical transactions more commonly referred to as efps rabars strategy employs a diversified systematic technical and trendfollowing approach utilizing a blend of several separate and distinct quantitative models prior to august   northfield traded the diversified program on behalf of the partnership the diversified program was conceived tested and refined by northfields principals the approach was fully computerized and nondiscretionary money management principles were a critical element of the diversified program and had been carefully constructed and were rigorously applied to minimize risk exposure and to protect asset appreciation table of contents the following chart sets forth the percentage and the amount of the partnerships net assets allocated to each trading advisor as of september   and june   respectively and the change during the three months ended september   allocations as of allocations as of allocations as of allocations as of change september  june  september  june  during the trading advisor         period  altis      graham      rabar       emc      the following presents a summary of the partnerships operations for the three and nine months ended september   and  and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period it is important to note however that the trading advisors trade in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the trading advisors or will be profitable in the future consequently the results of operations of the partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the trading advisors trading activities on behalf of the partnership during the period in question past performance is no guarantee of future results the partnerships results of operations set forth in the financial statements on pages  through  of this report are prepared in accordance with gaap which require the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements including the following the contracts the partnership trades are accounted for on a tradedate basis and marked to market on a daily basis the difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded on the statements of income and expenses as net change in unrealized trading profit loss on open contracts and recorded as net realized trading profit loss when open positions are closed out the sum of these amounts constitutes the partnerships trading results the market value of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day the value of a foreign currency forward contract is based on the spot rate as of approximately  pm et the close of the business day interest income as well as management fees incentive fees brokerage fees general partner fees and ongoing placement agent fees of the partnership are recorded on an accrual basis the general partner believes that based on the nature of the operations of the partnership no assumptions relating to the application of critical accounting policies other than those presently used could reasonably affect reported amounts for the three and nine months ended september   the partnership recorded total trading results including interest income totaling  and expenses totaling

share edgar online via comtex  item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity the partnership deposits its assets with msco as clearing commodity broker in separate futures interests trading accounts established for each trading advisor such assets are used as margin to engage in trading and may be used as margin solely for the partnerships trading the assets are held either in noninterest bearing bank accounts or in securities and instruments permitted by the cftc for investment of customer segregated or secured funds since the partnerships sole purpose is to trade in futures interests it is expected that the partnership will continue to own such liquid assets for margin purposes the partnerships investment in futures interests may from time to time be illiquid most us futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single trading day by regulations referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit if the price for a particular futures or options contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit positions in that futures or options contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading these market conditions could prevent the partnership from promptly liquidating its futures or options contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions there is no limitation on daily price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies the markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid which may prevent the partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets subjecting it to substantial losses either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions for the periods covered by this report illiquidity has not materially affected the partnerships assets there are no known material trends demands commitments events or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the partnerships liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way capital resources the partnership does not have nor does it expect to have any capital assets the partnerships only assets are its i equity in trading account consisting of restricted and unrestricted cash net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts net unrealized appreciation on open forward contracts and investment in us treasury bills at fair value if applicable ii cash at bank and iii interest receivable redemptions of units in the future will affect the amount of funds available for investments in futures interests in subsequent periods it is not possible to estimate the amount and therefore the impact of future outflows of units there are no known material trends favorable or unfavorable that would affect nor any expected material changes to the partnerships capital resource arrangements at the present time results of operations general the partnerships results depend on the trading advisors and the ability of each trading advisors trading program to take advantage of price movements in the futures forwards and options markets graham currently trades its allocated portion of the partnerships assets pursuant to grahams global diversified program as described below at  leverage the global diversified program features the first trend system that graham developed which began trading client accounts in  it utilizes multiple computerized trading models and offers broad diversification in both financial and nonfinancial markets trading in approximately  global markets the global diversified programs trend system is primarily longterm in nature and is intended to generate significant returns over time with an acceptable degree of risk and volatility the computer models analyze on a daily basis the recent price action the relative strength and the risk characteristics of each market and compare statistically the quantitative results of this data to years of historical data on each market emc currently trades its classic program for the partnership emcs investment strategies are technical rather than fundamental in nature in other words they are developed from analysis of patterns of actual monthly weekly and daily price movements and are not based on analysis of fundamental supply and demand factors general economic factors or anticipated world events emc relies on historical analysis of these price patterns to interpret current market behavior and to evaluate technical indicators for trade initiations and liquidations emcs investment strategies used in its program are trendfollowing this means that initiation and liquidation of positions in a particular market are generally in the direction of the price trend in that market although at times countertrend elements also may be employed emc employs an investment strategy which utilizes a blend of systems or stated another way a number of systems simultaneously the strategies are diversified in that its program follows a number of futures interests and often invests in more than ten different interests at one time rabar trades its investment strategy on behalf of the partnership the objective of rabars investment strategy is to generate capital appreciation over the long run by investing exclusively in futures interests including exchangetraded futures contracts options on futures contracts foreign currency forward contracts and to a very limited extent cash commodities rabar may also engage in exchange for physical transactions more commonly referred to as efps rabars strategy employs a diversified systematic technical and trendfollowing approach utilizing a blend of several separate and distinct quantitative models prior to its termination on june   altis traded its global futures portfolio program on behalf of the partnership it was a systematic automated trading program built on the market experience of altis principals and employing a unique proprietary advanced asset allocator the advanced asset allocator was specifically developed to manage portfolios of derivative instruments in a robust and scalable manner the portfolio management technology combined original traditional and contrasting investment techniques into one complete and comprehensive trading system investment changes were implemented after considering their effect on the whole portfolio and not just on the individual markets concerned prior to its termination on august   northfield traded its diversified program on behalf of the partnership the diversified program was conceived tested and refined by northfields principals the approach was fully computerized and nondiscretionary money management principles were a critical element of the diversified program and were carefully constructed and rigorously applied to minimize risk exposure and to protect asset appreciation the following chart sets forth the percentage and the amount of the partnerships net assets allocated to each trading advisor for the periods ended december   and september   respectively and the change during the applicable period allocation as of allocation as of allocation as of allocation as of change december  september  december  september  during the trading advisor         period  graham        rabar      emc      the following presents a summary of the partnerships operations for each of the years ended december    and  and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period it is important to note however that the trading advisors trade in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the trading advisors or will be profitable in the future consequently the results of operations of the partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the trading advisors trading activities on behalf of the partnership during the period in question past performance is no guarantee of future results the partnerships results of operations set forth in the financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which requires the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements including the following the contracts the partnership trades are accounted for on a tradedate basis and marked to market on a daily basis the difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded in the statements of income and expenses as net change in unrealized gains losses on open contracts and recorded as net realized gains losses on closed contracts when open positions are closed out the sum of these amounts constitutes the partnerships trading results the market value of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day the fair value of a foreign currency forward contract is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of approximately  pm et the close of the business day interest income as well as management fees general partner fees ongoing placement fees incentive fees and brokerage fees as applicable of the partnership are recorded on an accrual basis the general partner believes that based on the nature of the operations of the partnership no

 trading results refer to the partnerships annual report to limited partners for the year ended december   which is incorporated by reference to exhibit  of this form k the partnerships gains and losses are allocated among its partners for income tax purposes offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the partnership does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements nor does it have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments that would affect its liquidity or capital resources market risk the partnership is a party to financial instruments with elements of offbalance sheet market and credit risk the partnership trade futures interests including but not limited to foreign currencies financial instruments metals energy and agricultural products in entering into these contracts the partnership are subject to the market risk that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions such as interest rate volatility resulting in such contracts being less valuable if the markets should move against all of the positions held by the partnership at the same time and the trading advisors were unable to offset positions of the partnership the partnership could lose all of its assets and the limited partners would realize a loss equal to  of their capital accounts in addition to the trading advisors internal controls the trading advisors must comply with the partnerships trading policies that include standards for liquidity and leverage that must be maintained the trading advisors and ceres monitor the partnerships trading activities to ensure compliance with the trading policies and ceres can require the trading advisors to modify positions of the partnership if ceres believes they violate the partnerships trading policies credit risk in addition to market risk in entering into futures interests there is a credit risk to the partnership that the counterparty on a contract will not be able to meet its obligations to the partnership the ultimate counterparty or guarantor of the partnership for futures interests traded in the us and most foreign exchanges on which the partnership trade is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange in general a clearinghouse is backed by the membership of the exchange and will act in the event of nonperformance by one of its members or one of its members customers which should significantly reduce this credit risk there is no assurance that a clearinghouse exchange or other exchange member will meet its obligations to the partnership and ceres and the commodity brokers will not indemnify the partnership against a default by such parties further the law is unclear as to whether a commodity broker has any obligation to protect its customers from loss in the event of an exchange or clearinghouse defaulting on trades effected for the brokers customers in cases where the partnership trade offexchange forward contracts with a counterparty the sole recourse of the partnership will be the forward contracts counterparty ceres deals with these credit risks of the partnership in several ways first ceres monitors the partnerships credit exposure to each exchange on a daily basis the commodity brokers inform the partnership as with all of their customers of the partnerships net margin requirements for all of its existing open positions and ceres has installed a system which permits it to monitor the partnerships potential net credit exposure exchange by exchange by adding the unrealized trading gains on each exchange if any to the partnerships margin liability thereon second the partnerships trading policies limit the amount of its net assets that can be committed at any given time to futures contracts and require a minimum amount of diversification in the partnerships trading usually over several different products and exchanges historically the partnerships exposure to any one exchange has typically amounted to only a small percentage of its total net assets and on those relatively few occasions where the partnerships credit exposure climbs above such level ceres deals with the situation on a case by case basis carefully weighing whether the increased level of credit exposure remains appropriate third with respect to forwards and options on forward contract trading the partnership trades with only those counterparties which ceres together with msco has determined to be creditworthy the partnership presently deals with msco as the sole counterparty on all trading of foreign currency forward contracts and options on foreign currency forward contracts material changes to the trading policies may be made only with the prior written approval of the limited partners owning more than  of units then outstanding third with respect to forwards and options on forward contract trading the partnership trades with only those counterparties which ceres together with msco has determined to be creditworthy the partnership presently deals with msco as the sole counterparty on all trading of foreign currency forward contracts for additional information see note  financial instruments under notes to financial statements in the partnerships annual report to limited partners for the year ended december   which is incorporated by reference to exhibit  of this form k inflation has not been a major factor in the partnerships operations critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the general partner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period as a result actual results could differ from these estimates a summary of the partnerships significant accounting policies is described in note  to the partnerships financial statements included in item  financial statements and supplementary data the partnerships most significant accounting policy is the valuation of its investments in futures interests and us treasury bills as applicable the fair value of exchangetraded futures option and forward contracts is determined by the various exchanges and reflects the settlement price for each contract as of the close of business on the last business day of the reporting period the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of approximately  pm et on the last business day of the reporting period from various exchanges the fair value of nonexchangetraded foreign currency option contracts is calculated by applying an industry standard model application for options valuation of foreign currency options using as inputs the spot prices interest rates and option implied volatilities quoted as of approximately  pm et on the last business day of the reporting period us treasury bills are valued at the last available bid price received from independent pricing services as of the close of the last business day of the

and agricultural products futures and forwards represent contracts for delayed delivery of an instrument at a specified date and price risk arises from changes in the value of these contracts and the potential inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of the contracts there are numerous factors which may significantly influence the market value of these contracts including interest rate volatility the market value of contracts is based on closing prices quoted by the exchange bank or clearing firm through which the contracts are traded the partnerships contracts are accounted

exchangetraded futures and futuresstyled options contracts are marked to market on a daily basis with variations in value settled on a daily basis each of morgan stanley dw ms  co and msil as a

the ability of ms  co the sole counterparty on all of such contracts to perform the partnership has a netting agreement with ms  co this agreement which seeks to reduce both the partnerships and ms

analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity the partnership deposits its assets with morgan stanley dw as nonclearing broker and ms  co and msil as clearing brokers in separate futures forwards and options trading accounts established for each trading advisor which assets are used as margin to engage in trading the assets are held in either noninterest bearing bank accounts or in securities and instruments permitted by the cftc for investment of customer segregated or secured funds the partnerships assets held by the commodity brokers may be used as margin solely for the partnerships trading since the partnerships sole purpose is to trade in futures forwards and options it is expected that the partnership will continue to own such liquid assets for margin purposes the partnerships investment in futures forwards and options may from time to time be illiquid most us futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily price fluctuations limits or daily limits trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit if the price for a particular futures or options contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit positions in that futures or options contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading these market conditions could prevent the partnership from promptly liquidating its futures or options contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions there is no limitation on daily price moves in trading forward contracts on foreign currency the markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid which may prevent the partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets subjecting it to substantial losses either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions there are no material trends events or uncertainties known at the present time that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in the partnerships liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way the partnership has never had illiquidity affect a material portion of its assets the partnership has no offbalance sheet arrangements nor contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments that would affect the partnerships liquidity or capital resources the contracts traded by the partnership are accounted for on a tradedate basis and marked to market on a daily basis the value of foreign currency forward contracts is based on the spot rate as of the close of business new york city time on a given day capital resources the partnership does not have nor expect to have any capital assets redemptions exchanges and sales of additional units of limited partnership interest units in the future will affect the amount of funds available for investment in futures forwards and options in subsequent periods it is not possible to estimate the amount and therefore the impact of future redemptions of units there are no known material trends favorable or unfavorable nor any expected material changes to the partnerships capital resource arrangements at the present time results of operations general the partnerships results depend on the trading advisors and the ability of the trading advisors trading programs to take advantage of price movements or other profit opportunities in the futures forwards and options markets the following presents a summary of the partnerships operations for the three and six month periods ended june   and  and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period it is important to note however that the trading advisors trade in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the trading advisors or will be profitable in the future consequently the results of operations of the partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the trading advisors trading activities on behalf of the partnership and how the partnership has performed in the past the partnerships results of operations are set forth in financial statements prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles which require the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements including the following the contracts the partnership trades are accounted for on a tradedate basis and marked to market on a daily basis the difference between their cost and market value is recorded on the statements of operations as net change in unrealized profitloss for open unrealized contracts and recorded as realized profitloss when open positions are closed out and the sum of these amounts constitutes the partnerships trading revenues earned interest income revenue as well as management fees incentive fees and brokerage fees expenses of the partnership are recorded on an accrual basis demeter believes that based on the nature of the operations of the partnership no assumptions other than those presently used relating to the application of critical accounting policies are reasonably plausible that could affect reported amounts for the quarter and six months ended june   for the quarter ended june   the partnership recorded total revenues including interest income of  and posted an increase in net asset value per unit the most significant gains of approximately  were recorded in the currency markets primarily during may and june from previously established long positions in the euro swiss franc and japanese yen relative to the us dollar as the value of these currencies strengthened

futures markets from short positions in us and european stock index futures as prices trended lower on geopolitical concerns and uncertainty surrounding a global economic recovery a portion of the

products as prices moved lower on supply and demand concerns elsewhere in the energy markets losses were recorded in natural gas futures from long positions as prices reversed lower during may on

income of  and posted a decrease in net asset value per unit the most significant losses of approximately  were experienced primarily during april in the global interest rate futures markets as a portion of previously recorded profits was given back from long positions in us and european interest rate futures markets as a portion of previously recorded profits was given back from long positions in us and european interest rate futures as prices reversed sharply downward after trending higher earlier this year as investors deserted fixed income securities in an asset shift to equities losses were also recorded from short positions in us interest rate futures as prices moved higher in a flurry of flighttoquality buying spawned by middle east instability on june nd and in anticipation of the federal reserve interest rate cut in late june additional losses were recorded during the third week of june from short positions in german interest rate futures as prices increased following a drop in german business confidence data and signs that inflation may have peaked in that region strengthening the possibility of european interest rate cuts in the global stock index futures markets losses of approximately  were incurred primarily during the first half of april from short positions in dax index futures as prices reversed higher on renewed hopes that the worst may have been over for badly beaten technology and telecom stocks during may and june additional losses were recorded from dax index futures positions as prices generally moved in an erratic directionless pattern on conflicting economic information and investor sentiment in the currency markets losses of approximately  were recorded primarily during early june from long positions in the british pound as its value weakened relative to the us dollar in reaction to reports that british prime minister blair would push for great britains entry into the european monetary union in the metals markets small losses were experienced primarily during late may from newly established long gold futures positions as gold prices sharply reversed lower after spiking higher earlier in may following the return of more bearish sentiment regarding the outlook for the us economy these losses were partially offset by gains of approximately  recorded primarily during may and june in the

the japanese economy and in both anticipation and reaction to the bank of japans decision to reinstate its zero interest rate policy in the metals markets gains of approximately  were recorded from short copper futures positions as the slowdown in the us economy and weak demand continued to drive prices lower these gains were partially offset by losses of approximately  recorded throughout a

favorable weather in the agricultural markets losses of approximately  were experienced primarily during the first quarter from long corn futures positions as prices moved lower due to favorable south american weather total expenses for the six months ended june   were  resulting in net income of  the net asset value of a unit increased from  at december   to  at june   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk introduction the partnership is a commodity pool engaged primarily in the speculative trading of futures forwards and options the marketsensitive instruments held by the partnership are acquired for speculative trading purposes only and as a result all or substantially all of the partnerships assets are at risk of trading loss unlike an operating company the risk of market sensitive instruments is central not incidental to the partnerships main business activities the futures forwards and options traded by the partnership involve varying degrees of related market risk market risk is often dependent upon changes in the level or volatility of interest rates exchange rates and prices of financial instruments and commodities fluctuations in market risk based upon these factors result in frequent changes in the fair value of the partnerships open positions and consequently in its earnings and cash flow the partnerships total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the diversification among the partnerships open positions the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets at different times each of these factors may act to increase or decrease the market risk associated with the partnership the partnerships past performance is not necessarily indicative of its future results any attempt to numerically quantify the partnerships market risk is limited by the uncertainty of its speculative trading the partnerships speculative trading may cause future losses and volatility ie risk of ruin that far exceed the partnerships experience to date or any reasonable expectations based upon historical changes in market value quantifying the partnerships trading value at risk the following quantitative disclosures regarding the partnerships market risk exposures contain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for such statements by the private securities litigation reform act of  set forth in section a of the securities act of  and section e of the securities exchange act of  all quantitative disclosures in this section are deemed to be forward looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor except for statements of historical fact the partnership accounts for open positions on the basis of mark tomarket accounting principles any loss in the market value of the partnerships open positions is directly reflected in the partnerships earnings whether realized or unrealized and its cash flow profits and losses on open positions of exchange traded futures forwards and options are settled daily through variation margin the partnerships risk exposure in the market sectors traded by the trading advisors is estimated below in terms of value at risk var the var model used by the partnership includes many variables that could change the market value of the partnerships trading portfolio the partnership estimates var using a model based upon historical simulation with a confidence level of  historical simulation involves constructing a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of a trading portfolio the var model takes into account linear exposures to price and interest rate risk market risks that are incorporated in the var model include equity and commodity prices interest rates foreign exchange rates and correlation among these variables the hypothetical changes in portfolio value are based on daily percentage changes observed in key market indices or other market factors market risk factors to which the portfolio is sensitive the historical observation period of the partner ships var is approximately four years the oneday  confidence level of the partnerships var corresponds to the negative change in portfolio value that based on observed market risk factors would have been exceeded once in  trading days in other words oneday var for a portfolio is a number such that losses in this portfolio are estimated to exceed the var only one day in  var is calculated using historical simulation demeter uses approximately four years of daily market data  observations and revalues its portfolio using deltagamma approximations for each of the historical market moves that occurred over the time period this generates a probability distribution of daily simulated profit and loss outcomes the var is the appropriate percentile of this distribution for example the  oneday var would represent the th worst outcome from demeters simulated profit and loss series var models including the partnerships are continuously evolving as trading portfolios become more diverse and modeling techniques and systems capabilities improve please note that the var model is used to numerically quantify market risk for historic reporting purposes only and is not utilized by either demeter or the trading advisors in their daily risk management activities please further note that var as described above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities the partnerships value at risk in different market sectors the following table indicates the var associated with the partnerships open positions as a percentage of total net assets by primary market risk category at june   and  at june   and  the partnerships total capitalization was approximately  million and  million respectively primary market june   june   risk category value at risk value at risk currency   interest rate   equity   commodity   aggregate value at risk   the var for a market category represents the oneday downside risk for the aggregate exposures associated with this market category the aggregate var listed above for the partnership represents the aggregate var of the partnerships open positions across all the market categories and is less than the sum of the vars for all such market categories due to the diversification benefit across asset classes the table above represents the var of the partnerships open positions at june   and  only and is not necessarily representative of either the historic or future risk of an investment in the partnership because the partnerships only business is the speculative trading of futures forwards and options the composition of its trading portfolio can change significantly over any given time period or even within a single trading day any changes in open positions could positively or negatively materially impact market risk as measured by var the table below supplements the quarterend var by presenting the partnerships high low and average var as a percentage of total net assets for the four quarterly reporting periods from july   through june   primary market risk category high low average currency    interest rate    equity    commodity    aggregate value at risk    limitations on value at risk as an assessment of market risk the face value of the market sector instruments held by the partnership is typically many times the applicable margin requirements margin requirements generally range between  and  of contract face value additionally the use of leverage causes the face value of the market sector instruments held by the partnership to typically be many times the total capitalization of the partnership the value of the partnerships open positions thus creates a risk of ruin not typically found in other investments the relative size of the positions held may cause the partnership to incur losses greatly in excess of var within a short period of time given the effects of the leverage employed and market volatility the var tables above as well as the past performance of the partnership give no indication of such risk of ruin in addition var risk measures should be viewed in light of the methodologys limitations which include the following  past changes in market risk factors will not always result in accurate predictions of the distributions and correlations of future market movements  changes in portfolio value caused by market movements may differ from those of the var model  var results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions  var using a oneday time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day and  the historical market risk factor data used for var estimation may provide only limited insight into losses that could be incurred under certain unusual market movements the var tables above present the results of the partnerships var for each of the partnerships market risk exposures and on an aggregate basis at june   and  and for the end of the four quarterly reporting periods from july   through june   since var is based on historical data var should not be viewed as predictive of the partnerships future financial performance or its ability to manage or monitor risk there can be no assurance that the partnerships actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the var amounts indicated above or that such losses will not occur more than once in  trading days nontrading risk the partnership has nontrading market risk on its foreign cash balances not needed for margin these balances and any market risk they may represent are immaterial at june   the partnerships cash balance at morgan stanley dw was approximately  of its total net asset value a decline in shortterm interest rates will result in a decline in the partnerships cash management income this cash flow risk is not considered to be material materiality as used throughout this section is based on an assessment of reasonably possible market movements and any associated potential losses taking into account the leverage optionality and multiplier features of the partnerships market sensitive instruments in relation to the partnerships net assets qualitative disclosures regarding primary trading risk exposures the following qualitative disclosures regarding the partnerships market risk exposures  except for a those disclosures that are statements of historical fact and b the descriptions of how the partnership manages its primary market risk exposures  constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act the partnerships primary market risk exposures as well as the strategies used and to be used by demeter and the trading advisors for managing such exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties contingencies and risks any one of which could cause the actual results of the partnerships risk controls to differ materially from the objectives of such strategies government interventions defaults and expropriations illiquid markets the emergence of dominant fundamental factors political upheavals changes in historical price relationships an influx of new market participants increased regulation and many other factors could result in material losses as well as in material changes to the risk exposures and the risk management strategies of the partnership investors must be prepared to lose all or substantially all of their investment in the partnership the following were the primary trading risk exposures of the partnership at june   by market sector it may be anticipated however that these market exposures will vary materially over time currency the primary market exposure of the partnership at june   was to the currency complex the partnerships currency exposure is to exchange rate fluctuations primarily fluctuations which disrupt the historical pricing relationships between different currencies and currency pairs interest rate changes as well as political and general economic conditions influence these fluctuations the partnership trades a large number of currencies including crossrates  ie positions between two currencies other than the us dollar at june   the partnerships major exposures were to outright us dollar positions outright positions consist of the us dollar vs other currencies these other currencies include major and minor currencies demeter does not anticipate that the risk profile of the partnerships currency sector will change significantly in the future the currency trading var figure includes foreign margin amounts converted into us dollars with an incremental adjustment to reflect the exchange rate risk inherent to the usbased partnership in expressing var in a functional currency other than us dollars interest rate the second largest market exposure of the partnership at june   was to the global interest rate sector the partnerships exposure in the interest rate market complex was primarily spread across the us european and japanese interest rate sectors interest rate movements directly affect the price of the sovereign bond futures positions held by the partnership and indirectly affect the value of its stock index and currency positions interest rate movements in one country as well as relative interest rate movements between countries materially impact the partnerships profitability the partnerships primary interest rate exposure is generally to interest rate fluctuations in the us and the other g countries the g countries consist of france the us britain germany japan italy and canada however the partnership also takes futures positions in the government debt of smaller nations  eg australia demeter anticipates that g  and australian interest rates will remain the primary interest rate exposure of the partnership for the foreseeable future the speculative futures positions held by the partnership may range from short to longterm instruments consequently changes in short medium or longterm interest rates may have an effect on the partnership equity the third largest exposure at june   was to equity price risk in the g countries the stock index futures traded by the partnership are by law limited to futures on broadlybased indices at june   the partnerships primary exposures were to the nasdaq us sp  us nikkei japan and hang seng china stock indices the partnership is primarily exposed to the risk of adverse price trends or static markets in the us and japanese indices static markets would not cause major market changes but would make it difficult for the partnership to avoid being whipsawed into numerous small losses commodity energy at june   the partnerships energy exposure was shared primarily by futures contracts in crude oil and its related products and natural gas price movements in the energy markets result from political developments in the middle east weather patterns and other economic fundamentals significant profits and losses which have been experienced in the past are expected to continue to be experienced in these markets natural gas has exhibited volatility in prices resulting from weather patterns and supply and demand factors and may continue in this choppy pattern soft commodities and agriculturals at june   the partnership had exposure to the markets that comprise these sectors most of the exposure was to cotton coffee sugar corn and soybean markets supply and demand inequalities severe weather disruption and market expectations affect price movements in these markets metals the partnerships metals exposure at june   was to fluctuations in the price of precious metals such as gold and silver and base metals such as copper nickel lead zinc and aluminum economic forces supply and demand inequalities geopolitical factors and market expectations influence price movement in these markets the trading advisors from time to time take positions when market opportunities develop demeter anticipates that the partnership will continue to be exposed to the precious and base metals markets qualitative disclosures regarding nontrading risk exposure the following was the only nontrading risk exposure of the partnership at june   foreign currency balances the partnerships primary foreign currency balances at june   were in hong kong dollars euros and japanese yen the partnership controls the nontrading risk of these balances by regularly converting them back into us dollars upon liquidation of their respective positions qualitative disclosures regarding means of managing risk exposure the partnership and the trading advisors separately attempt to manage the risk of the partnerships open positions in essentially the same manner in all market categories traded demeter attempts to manage market exposure by diversifying the partnerships assets among different trading advisors each of whose strategies focus on different market sectors and trading approaches and monitoring the performance of the trading advisors daily in addition the trading advisors establish diversification guidelines often set in terms of the maximum margin to be committed to positions in any one market sector or marketsensitive instrument demeter monitors and controls the risk of the partnerships non trading instrument cash cash is the only partnership investment directed by demeter rather than the trading advisors brokerage partners   edgar
