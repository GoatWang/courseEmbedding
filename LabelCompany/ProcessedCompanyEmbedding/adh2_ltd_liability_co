management services are intended for use by our insureds  on a limited basis however we will provide products liability risk management services on a feeforservice basis  for more information please contact our risk management department at riskmanagementmedmarccom or at  is the fact that a product is approved by the fda sufficient enough information about the product to obtain a quote from medmarc fda approval of a product is important to the underwriting analysis as is the regulatory history of the company but it is not sufficient information for medmarc’s underwriters to provide a coverage quote in order to understand the company’s risk profile and coverage needs underwriters also will require information about the company’s size financial condition management team operations loss history and other information related to the company’s history and product lines what is medmarc’s capacity for medmarc’s products liability policy our capacity is  million per policy  for our manufacturers’ errors and omissions eo policy our capacity is  million   capacity is subject to underwriting and is not available for all applicants  what is medmarcs target risk medmarc provides coverage for the manufacturers and distributors of medical devices pharmaceuticals biotechnology in vitro diagnostics personal hygiene products and animal care products  we cover both original equipment manufacturers oems and contract manufacturers  we cover companies at every stage of their evolution—from clinical trialstage startups to multinational companies with extensive product lines what risk management services does medmarc provide through our risk management department medmarc helps medical technology and life sciences companies manage their products liability risks  we can identify your potential products liability exposures through our risk assessment process and then help you develop and implement strategies to mitigate your risk   we provide assistance with areas of your operations that tend to give rise to products liability such as supply chains product warnings and instructions for use and manufacturing procedures  there is a close association between regulatory compliance and products liability  for this reason we offer a variety of services designed to help companies comply with fda requirements  we also provide employee training that is designed to heighten awareness about products liability risk and the impact that it can have on your operations and bottom line will medmarc accept other carriers’ applications yes  medmarc is happy to accept applications from other carriers but please be aware that we may require additional information as a distributor do i need products liability coverage we recommend that distributors purchase their own products liability insurance policies  if a distributor is required to repackage or install a product or if the distributor provides training on the use of the product the distributor may have a potential exposure that is not typically covered under the manufacturer’s policy  furthermore independent acts of negligence on the part of the distributor typically would not be covered under the manufacturer’s policy or by contractual indemnification agreements a us distributor that imports products from a manufacturer located outside of the united states should be aware that the foreign manufacturer’s policy may not provide coverage in the us or may not provide coverage for the defense of claims in the us which could become very costly  medmarc’s risk management department has published an article that explains distributor risks the article is titled “why distributors may be more  vulnerable to products liability than they realize” and it is available on medmarc’s website in our resource library does your policy cover sales representatives “sales reps” the actions or omissions of sales reps when acting in the scope of their employment are covered under medmarc’s products liability insurance coverage such circumstances include when sales reps  provide product consultations  make device technical adjustments  are present in operating rooms during surgeries to answer questions deemed essential for patient care or  are present during patient monitoring visits to ensure compliance with clinical trial protocols by surgical staff and nurses for more information see the ask an expert by fran stockwell “do distributors require professional liability insurance coverage in addition to products liability insurance coverage”   does your policy cover explants of implantable devices our products liability policy covers explantations ie the surgical removal of implantable devices only when the product causes the patient harm what is the difference between a claimsmade policy and an occurrence policy insurance coverage can either be on a claims made or occurrence basis these terms refer to what the policy covers during the policy period a claimsmade policy provides insurance for claims made during a policy year or tail period regardless of when the loss occurred and an occurrence policy provides insurance for losses that occurred only during the policy year as specified on the declarations form a claims made policy provides coverage for claims made and reported during the policy term as long as they were made after the retroactive date the retroactive date is the start date of the first claimsmade policy obtained so long as it has been kept active via renewal that date remains the same and is not advanced as long as the policy is renewed for example if a client first obtains claimsmade coverage on october   and it is now  and theyve maintained the same coverage their claimsmade policy covers all incidents since october   if the client no longer has coverage in  and a patient sues in  for an incident that occurred in  the client does not have coverage for that incident unless they purchased tail coverage  an occurrence policy in contrast covers incidents that occur but are not necessarily reported during the term the policy is in force for example if a client obtained an occurrence policy covering  and a patient is injured by the clients product in  but does not sue for their injuries until  the client has coverage from their  policy even if they are no longer insured will medmarc provide coverage for nonmedical products because of our familiarity and longstanding connection with this industry we recognize that life sciences companies sometimes have product lines that include nonmedical products often we can accommodate this coverage need  your medmarc underwriter can answer any questions you might have about covering nonmedical products and will walk you through specific coverage options for your insureds what information do you need to assess a clinical trial risk for clinical trial submissions include the draft or final study protocol and the patient informed consent document in order to expedite our review how do i obtain a quote for manufacturers errors and omissions eo coverage from medmarc the eo application can be found here along with a completed application your medmarc underwriter simply needs a sample of your client’s contracts or purchase orders that they use with their customers how does medmarc calculate minimum premiums minimum premiums differ depending on several factors such as a product’s risk profile and the state in which the company is located  if you have a small account and are interested discussing the cost of coverage in greater detail please

questions do i need to know about securities laws to set up an llc how many people do i need to form an llc who should form an llc how do i form an llc do i need a lawyer to form an llc does my llc need an operating agreement how are llcs taxed what are the differences between a limited liability company and a partnership can i convert my existing business to an llc what is an llc do i need to know about securities laws to set up an llc if youll be the sole owner of your llc and you dont plan to take investments from outsiders your ownership interest in the llc will not be considered a security and you dont have to concern yourself with these lawsfor coowned llcs however the answer to this question is not so clear a security is an investment in a profitmaking enterprise that is not run by the investor if a person invests in a business with the expectation of making money from the efforts of others that persons investment is generally considered a security under federal and state law conversely when a person will rely on his or her own efforts to make a profit that is he or she will be an active owner of an llc that persons ownership interest in the company will not usually be treated as a securityhow does this apply to you generally if all of the owners will actively manage the llc  which is typical in most small startup llcs  the llc ownership interests will not be considered securities but if one or more of your coowners will not work for the company or play an active role in managing the company  as may be true for llcs that accept investments from friends and family or that are run by a special management group  your llcs ownership interests may be treated as securities by your state and by the federal securities and exchange commission secif your ownership interests are considered securities you must qualify for an exemption from the state and federal securities laws before the initial owners of your llc invest their money if you dont fall within an exemption to the securities laws you must register the sale of your llcs ownership interests with the sec and your statefortunately smaller llcs even those that plan to sell memberships to passive investors usually qualify for securities law exemptions for example sec rules exempt the private sale of securities if all owners reside in one state and all sales are made within the state this is called the intrastate offering exemption another federal exemption covers private offerings a private offering is an unadvertised sale that is limited to a small number of people  or fewer or to those who because of their net worth or income earning capacity can reasonably be expected to be able to take care of themselves in the investment process most states have enacted their own versions of these popular federal exemptionsfor more information about sec exemptions visit the sec website at wwwsecgov a quick way to research your states exemption rules is to go to the home page of your states securities agency which typically posts the states exemptions rules and procedures to find your state securities agency go to your secretary of states websiteif your business doesnt qualify for an exemption you may want to explore other ways of raising money see nolos business financing faq for more information how many people do i need to form an llc you can form an llc in any state with just one owner for more information on forming an llc see nolos article how to form an llc who should form an llc you should consider forming an llc if you are concerned about personal exposure to lawsuits or debts arising from your business for example if you decide to open a storefront business that deals directly with the public you may worry that your commercial liability insurance wont fully protect your personal assets from potential slipandfall lawsuits or claims by your suppliers for unpaid bills running your business as an llc may help you sleep better because it gives you personal protection against these and other potential claims against your businessnot all businesses can operate as llcs however businesses in the banking trust and insurance industry for example are typically prohibited from forming llcs in addition some states including california prohibit professionals such as architects accountants doctors and licensed healthcare workers from forming llcsyou can also get limited liability for your business by forming a corporation for information on the differences between these two business structures see nolos article corporations vs llcs for more information on forming an llc read nolos article how to form an llc how do i form an llc in most states you create an llc simply by filing articles of organization with your states llc

state or corporations division home page a few states impose an additional requirement prior to filing your articles of organization you must publish your intention to form an llc in a local newspaper

of the llc usually cannot go after the owners personal assets to pay off llc debts partners on the other hand do not receive this limited liability protection unless they are designated limited partners in their partnership agreementalso owners of limited liability companies must file formal articles of organization with their states llc filing office pay a filing fee and comply with certain other state filing requirements before they open for business by contrast people who form a partnership dont need to file any formal paperwork or pay any special feesllcs and partnerships are almost identical when it comes to taxation however in both types of businesses the owners report business income or losses on their personal tax returns the business itself does not pay tax on this money in fact llc and partnerships file the same informational tax return with the irs form  and distribute the same schedules to the businesss owners schedule k which lists each owners share of incomefor more

llc a limited liability company commonly called an llc is a business structure that combines the passthrough taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the limited liability of a corporation like owners of partnerships or sole proprietorships llc owners report business profits or losses on their personal income tax returns the llc itself is not a separate taxable entity like owners of a corporation however all llc owners are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims  a feature known as limited liability this means that if the business owes money or faces a lawsuit only the assets of the business itself are at risk creditors usually cant reach the personal assets of the llc owners such as a house or car both llc owners and corporate shareholders can lose this protection by acting illegally unethically or irresponsibly for these reasons many people say the llc combines the best features of the partnership and corporate business structures to

riskmanagementmedmarccom or at  is the fact that a product is approved by the fda sufficient enough information about the product to obtain a quote from medmarc fda approval of a product is important to the underwriting analysis as is the regulatory history of the company but it is not sufficient information for medmarc’s underwriters to provide a coverage quote in order to understand the company’s risk profile and coverage needs underwriters also will require information about the company’s size financial condition management team operations loss history and other information related to the company’s history and product lines what is medmarc’s capacity for medmarc’s products liability policy our capacity is  million per policy  for our manufacturers’ errors and omissions eo policy our capacity is  million   capacity is subject to underwriting and is not available for all applicants  what is medmarcs target risk medmarc provides coverage for the manufacturers and distributors of medical devices pharmaceuticals biotechnology in vitro diagnostics personal hygiene products and animal care products  we cover both original equipment manufacturers oems and contract manufacturers  we cover companies at every stage of their evolution—from clinical trialstage startups to multinational companies with extensive product lines what risk management services does medmarc provide through our risk management department medmarc helps medical technology and life sciences companies manage their products liability risks  we can identify your potential products liability exposures through our risk assessment process and then help you develop and implement strategies to mitigate your risk   we provide assistance with areas of your operations that tend to give rise to products liability such as supply chains product warnings and instructions for use and manufacturing procedures  there is a close association between regulatory compliance and products liability  for this reason we offer a variety of services designed to help companies comply with fda requirements  we also provide employee training that is designed to heighten awareness about products liability risk and the impact that it can have on your operations and bottom line will medmarc accept other carriers’ applications yes  medmarc is happy to accept applications from other carriers but please be aware that we may require additional information as a distributor do i need products liability coverage we recommend that distributors purchase their own products liability insurance policies  if a distributor is required to repackage or install a product or if the distributor provides training on the use of the product the distributor may have a potential exposure that is not typically covered under the manufacturer’s policy  furthermore independent acts of negligence on the part of the distributor typically would not be covered under the manufacturer’s policy or by contractual indemnification agreements a us distributor that imports products from a manufacturer located outside of the united states should be aware that the foreign manufacturer’s policy may not provide coverage in the us or may not provide coverage for the defense of claims in the us which could become very costly  medmarc’s risk management department has published an article that explains distributor risks the article is titled “why distributors may be more  vulnerable to products liability than they realize” and it is available on medmarc’s website in our resource library does your policy cover sales representatives “sales reps” the actions or omissions of sales reps when acting in the scope of their employment are covered under medmarc’s products liability insurance coverage such circumstances include when sales reps  provide product consultations  make device technical adjustments  are present in operating rooms during surgeries to answer questions deemed essential for patient care or  are present during patient monitoring visits to ensure compliance with clinical trial protocols by surgical staff and nurses for more information see the ask an expert by fran stockwell “do distributors require professional liability insurance coverage in addition to products liability insurance coverage”   does your policy cover explants of implantable devices our products liability policy covers explantations ie the surgical removal of implantable devices only when the product causes the patient harm what is the difference between a claimsmade policy and an occurrence policy insurance coverage can either be on a claims made or occurrence basis these terms refer to what the policy covers during the policy period a claimsmade policy provides insurance for claims made during a policy year or tail period regardless of when the loss occurred and an occurrence policy provides insurance for losses that occurred only during the policy year as specified on the declarations form a claims made policy provides coverage for claims made and reported during the policy term as long as they were made after the retroactive date the retroactive date is the start date of the first claimsmade policy obtained so long as it has been kept active via renewal that date remains the same and is not advanced as long as the policy is renewed for example if a client first obtains claimsmade coverage on october   and it is now  and theyve maintained the same coverage their claimsmade policy covers all incidents since october   if the client no longer has coverage in  and a patient sues in  for an incident that occurred in  the client does not have coverage for that incident unless they purchased tail coverage  an occurrence policy in contrast covers incidents that occur but are not necessarily reported during the term the policy is in force for example if a client obtained an occurrence policy covering  and a patient is injured by the clients product in  but does not sue for their injuries until  the client has coverage from their  policy even if they are no longer insured will medmarc provide coverage for nonmedical products because of our familiarity and longstanding connection with this industry we recognize that life sciences companies sometimes have product lines that include nonmedical products often we can accommodate this coverage need  your

corporation a limited liability company or llc is a separate and distinct legal entity  this means that an llc can have its own tax identification number and bank account  the primary advantage of an llc is that its owners have limited liability meaning that under most circumstances the owners are not personally liable for the liabilities and debts of the llc  for example if an llc is forced into bankruptcy the owners will not be required to pay the llcs debts with their own money  if the assets of the llc are not enough to cover the debts and liabilities the creditors generally cannot look to the owners managers or officers for relief an llc can be taxed either as a passthrough entity like a sole proprietorship or partnership or as a regular corporation  by default an llc is taxed as a passthrough entity where the owners just pay taxes on the profits of the llc at their individual tax rates  this is different from a regular c corporation which pays a corporate tax on its net income before distributing profits to the stockholders the owners as dividends  when the corporation distributes profits the stockholders also must pay income tax on these dividends  most llc owners choose to have the profits passthrough so that taxes are only paid once on the profits totallegal™ has helped over  million people nationwide make essential personal and business legal documents themselves
