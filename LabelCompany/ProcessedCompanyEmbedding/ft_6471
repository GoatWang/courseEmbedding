used to measure ground resistance step and touch potential multiple ground rod systems and soil resistivity  pole and  pole ground tester selection guide   three pole and four pole grounding instrumentation is chosen based on requirements applications and safety considerations consider the following soil resistivity  point tester ground resistance rods  point tester low ground resistance grids or mats or plates  or  point tester step and touch potential  point tester continuity on bonding or grounding  or  point tester earth coupling  point tester   the national electrical code has established minimum safety values the national electrical code section  states that the “system impedance to ground ground rod is less than  ohms and that facilities with sensitive electrical equipment should be  ohms or less”   a grounding system is designed to provide safety for a variety of conditions that may exist lightening strikes to protect personnel or system components electrical faults static electricity problems voltage regulations for safety      a good grounding system will improve the reliability of equipment and reduce the likelihood of damage due to lightning or fault currents the primary reason that grounding is tested is the fact that resistance to an earth ground rod or system may vary based on changes in climate and temperature and over time such changes can be considerable over time corrosion will degrade ground rods and their connections it is reasonable to consider an annual maintenance program that checks grounds and bonding   features to consider when evaluating your selection for  pole and  pole ground testers types of ground testing to be evaluated number of poles points for tests to be completed display required graphics required memory required and capacity enclosure ip ratings wiring spools and additional rods needed rechargeable battery or field battery supply test current safety rating resolution components of earth ground electrode   resistance of the electrode itself and connections to it including the clamp and wire connection contact resistance between the electrode and the soil adjacent to it resistance of the surrounding earth what affects the ground resistance measured the length and depth of the electrode the diameter of the electrode the number of electrodes the total inherent system design ground testing systems to be tested also include multiple electrodes grounding grids grounding mats and grounding plates   traditional types of methods for ground testing include a three point three pole “fall of potential” for ground rods and grids b four point four pole “soil resistivity” testing c touch potential three pole for electrical safety high ground fault possibility d twopoint and four point tests continuity tests and bonds each method will be discussed briefly a     threepoint “fall of potential”   three point measurements are used when electrodes or grids can be easily disconnected threepoint measurement is used to measure resistance to ground of ground rods and grids the potential difference between rods x and p is measured by a voltmeter and the current flow between rods x and c is measured by an ammeter using ohm’s law r  ei we may obtain the ground electrode resistance r it is not necessary to carry out all the measurements when using a ground tester the ground tester will measure directly by generating its own current and displaying the resistance of the ground electrode under test z earth coupling in order to measure earth coupling a  point system is required it is primarily used to estimate the influence of two earth resistance systems that are not connected to each other   b     fourpoint soil resistivity wenner method the primary purpose of this test is to locate the areas of lowest soil resistivity which is essential for achieving an economical grounding installation for most applications the most accurate method is the point method the point method requires the insertion of four equally spaced electrodes in a test area a known current from a constant current source is passed between the outermost electrodes and a voltage is then measured across the two innermost electrodes most ground resistance instruments will also read the resistance of the rod in test directly in ohms soil resistivity is necessary when determining the design and location of the grounding system especially for new installations to meet acceptable ground resistance requirements   soil resistivity is a determining factor when measuring the resistance of a grounding site this determines the electrode resistance and the depth required for acceptable resistance the resistivity of the soil varies widely throughout the world and changes seasonally soil resistivity is determined largely by its content of electrolytes consisting of moisture minerals and dissolved salts a dry soil has high resistivity if it contains no soluble salts c     touch potential  step potential   touch potential is the term given to the potential difference a person might experience across their body if they were for example standing on the ground outside the perimeter fence of a substation and touching the fence at the time a fault to earth occurred these tests are recommended when the ground cannot be disconnected where ground faults are highly likely to occur or when the “footprint” of grounded equipment the outline of the part of equipment in contact with earth is comparable to the size of the ground to be tested touch potential is defined as the voltage between an energized object and the feet of a person that may be in contact with that object in cases close to power distribution sites and fences the touch potential can be extremely dangerous and hazardous a four pole tester is used for “touch potential” measurements   step potential is the potential difference a person would experience between their feet if they walked over the ground in which a fault current existed a four pole tester is also used for this test   d twopoint and four point tests continuity tests and bonds even though microohmmeters with kelvin probes are suggested to be used for primary accurate bond testing resistance values a simpler and less accurate  quick indication of resistance value may be performed utilizing a  pole  lead method measuring dc resistance with less test current   a  point test may also be used to measure the continuity resistance of any wired system it also measure the integrity of all single or multiple ground system connections   ground testing
