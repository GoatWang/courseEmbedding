of normalized sell hold buy and strong buy ratings each stocks consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score   sell   hold   buy   strong buy marketbeats consensus price

companies we believe that we create portfolios that are highly transparent and simple to understand some level of cash is nearly always present in every portfolio and is kept in a money market fund until a better alternative is found except for these modest amounts of cash however we are nearly always fully invested we have different investment styles to fit every client’s goals and objectives as defined here fhc growth and income portfolios include equities that provide growth at a reasonable valuation portfolios may contain foreign securities but primarily own large usbased companies  growth is the primary consideration income is secondary  the tax implications of selling a security are important fhc equity income includes stocks that provide growth at a reasonable valuation and aboveaverage dividend yields  portfolios may own foreign securities  the key aspect of this style of investing is that income is a primary consideration capital appreciation is secondary  the tax implications of selling a security are important fhc aggressive growth portfolios buy stocks for appreciation and sell stocks short in anticipation of a decline  portfolios may own foreign securities and are not constrained by market capitalization  this style of investing is focused on shortterm trading which may produce volatile results  absolute return drives the process  tax implications are ignored the fhc total return bond portfolios invest in high quality taxable fixed income securities primarily corporate bonds the investment objective is a high level of income consistent with

houston capital takes a valueoriented investment approach sometimes referred to as “growth at a reasonable price” we seek to own proven profitable and predictable companies we like companies that pay cash dividends or have the capacity to do so we own businesses that have barriers to entry against competitors and hold a sizable market share in their products we do not invest in companies with highly cyclical past performances we also do not speculate in futures real estate or “concept” stocks we consider selling stocks when they are overpriced when they fail to meet our objectives or when

accounts individual and joint accounts are generally taxed by the federal government for both income and realized capital gains at first houston capital we manage our portfolios with taxes in mind we do not jump into and out of the market creating lots of shortterm gains and losses rather our focus is longterm our preferred holding period for a stock is forever hopefully creating capital appreciation that may never be taxed when we sell we try to capture the benefits of longterm capital gains selling can also limit losses and offset gains elsewhere in the portfolio we favor companies with a history of paying dividends to shareholders on a regular basis dividend income has historically benefited from a lower tax rate than interest income or ordinary income our portfolios usually hold between  and  stocks among different economic sectors this provides efficient diversification without a portfolio looking like an index fund the ownership of individual stocks allows clients to gift shares to charity or other family members without paying capital gains taxes first houston capital is not a tax advisor but we do try to run individual and joint accounts as tax efficiently as we

companies among numerous industries that are reasonably priced at the time of purchase we try to hold winners for big gains and sell the inevitable losers for small losses one unique tax deferred character of retirement accounts allows us to move into or out of a stock without concern for the tax consequences for example we may sell covered calls against a stock position in retirement accounts to generate extra income and hedge market risk if the stock is “called” away the client has likely had a profitable trade but no tax consequences such buying and selling in a retirement account does not normally have to be reported to the irs retirement accounts are not taxable until the owner begins to make withdrawals often deferred until age   please check with your tax advisor before creating
