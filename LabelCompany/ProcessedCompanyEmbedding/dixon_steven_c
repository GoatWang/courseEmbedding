swivel supports andor also longer support arms referred to as goosenecks the goosenecks typically include a rod or group of wires for flexible support there may or may not be a plastic sleeve or other coating around the support rodmore recently with the explosion in the number of electronics products available for use in automobiles problems can arise when a consumer is using or otherwise needs electrical power for multiple products at the same time there is a limitation with respect to the single powercharger socket in a vehicle while dual charger adaptors are available they are typically made up of a plug and wire array that can result in a wire spaghetti mess and confusionsummaryaccordingly it is an object of the present invention to overcome the foregoing drawbacks and provide a combination mount and charger devicein one example a powered mobile electronics mount system includes a male plug a support arm a connector housing and an interconnecting wire the male plug includes an electrical connector wherein the plug is adapted to be inserted into an automobile electrical socket the support arm is connected on one end to the male plug and on its opposite end to the connector housing the connector housing includes a transformer and a universal electrical connector socket and the connector housing further includes a mount for an electronics product the interconnecting wire is an electrical connection with the automobile electrical socket through the plug and the universal electrical connector in the connector housing the connector housing may include a plurality of universal electrical connectors the voltage input at the automobile electrical socket may be  to  volts the voltage output at the universal electrical connector socket may be  volts or variations thereof the universal electrical connector socket may be a usb socket the plurality of universal electrical connector sockets may be different connection sockets the mount on the connector housing can be selectively removable from the connector housing the connector housing may comprise male mating elements adapted to receive a plurality of different interchangeable mounts the support arm may include a sleeve and the interconnecting wire is positioned inside the sleevebrief description of the drawingsfig  is a perspective view of a powered mobile electronics mount system in accordance with an example of the present inventionfig  is an exploded perspective view of a mount and connector housing fig  is a perspective view of a mount and connecting housingfig  is a bottom view of a mount positioned on a connector housingfig  is an electrical diagram illustrating how the mount system provides power to a plurality of mobile electronics devicesdetailed descriptionthe present invention is directed to a mount that also serves as an electrical connector for poweringrecharging the product positioned on the mount in one example the mount has a plurality of connectors to powerrecharge a plurality of electrical products although one example is shown herein those of skill in the art can design similar mount configurations using the teachings hereinreferring now to figs  there is shown an example of a mount system  that includes a male plug  a support arm  and a connector housing  the male plug  includes a round barrel  with a metal tip  and a side metal ring  the male plug  is insertable in the automobile electrical socket the diameter of the male plug  is only slightly less than the diameter of the electrical socket in the automobile the male plug  may optionally include springs to create a tight interference fit alternatively the plug  may have a compression fitting that once inserted can be manually tightened to create a secure fit within the automobile electrical socket a tight fit is important to achieve the mount purpose of the mount systemthe support arm  includes a rigid metal rod  that is secured on one end  to the plug  and on its opposite end  to the connector housing  in the illustrated example there is a plastic corrugated sleeve  around the rigid metal rod  the sleeve  is loose but could be a tight fit around the rod  or even coated onto the rod an interconnecting wire not shown is electrically connected to the plug and the connector housing the wire is threaded inside the sleeve  the metal rod  may be bent to assume a shape or direction at the desire of a user preferably the rod  is an aluminum rod because it is a firm support but also able to be bent of course other metals andor multiple rods may be used the support arm  can be any length but typically it is  inches in length for most vehicles and usesthe connector housing  comprises a rectangular box  inside the box  is electrical circuitry that is collectively referred to herein as a transformer the transformer converts the  volts of electrical power from a conventional automobile battery to an acceptable voltage and amperage for the electrical products to be mounted on the system the transformer includes conventional circuitry to control and meter the correct amount of electrical flow in the illustrated example universal connector sockets  are shown having the usb configuration of course the universal connector sockets  may have different formats or conventions the electrical device that may be placed on the mount  will have a productspecific adaptor accordingly it is possible to have productspecific adaptors that connect the universal connector sockets  usb ports to the specific product the universal connector housing  further includes male connector prongs  that interchangeably receive a mount the mount  has a flat platform  and side wings  that may be squeezably pressed against and retain an electrical product on the mount the back face  of the mount  has female recesses  that receive the male prongs  from the connector housing box  alternatively the mount  may comprise the male prongs and the connector housing box may have the female recessesreferring to fig  there is shown a conventional automobile electrical socket  the socket  includes electrical contacts  and  the plug  includes corresponding contacts  and  that when inserted in the socket  are in electrical communication with the contacts  and  an interconnecting wire  is the electrical connection between the plug  and the connector housing  inside the connector housing  is a conventional car charger circuit  the car charger circuit  converts power from the automobile electronics system to generally universal voltage and current compatible with particular devices or classes of devices in one example the car charger circuit  is a  volt amp type of circuit suitable for use with many electronics devices the connector housing  includes universal electrical connector sockets   and  the universal electrical connector sockets  and  are the same convention in this example usb sockets universal electrical connector socket  is an alternative format of socket device specific connectors   and  may be plugged into the universal electrical connector sockets   and  respectively the device specific plugs   and  connect to first device  second device  and third device  respectively additional powercharging circuitry may be configured in the connectors   or  if necessary for the specific devices   or  in this way one or more electronic devices may be charging through use of the connector housing  presumably one or more of the devices   and  is mounted on the mount that is a part of the connector housing referring again to fig  the end  of the support arm  may include a bracket  that makes the support arm slidably removable from the rectangular box  of the connector housing in an additional example the support arm  is removed from the connector housing  and a wire cable not shown may be directly connected to the automobile electrical power system either through a plug like plug  or otherwise directly into the automobile wiring the box  would then be permanently fixed in some manner to a surface inside the automobile the benefits of multiple connector sockets  and an interchangeable mount system would still be available to a user in the automobile the only difference is that the plug  and support arm  are not necessarythis invention is susceptible to considerable variation in its practice therefore the foregoing description is not intended to limit and should not be construed as limiting the invention to the particular exemplifications presented hereinabove rather what is intended to be covered is
