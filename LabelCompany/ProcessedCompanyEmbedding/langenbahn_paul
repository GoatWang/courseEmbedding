processor subscribe open search field search advertisement skip article header skip to start of article author kim zetter kim zetter security date of publication   time of publication  pm  pm restaurants sue vendor for unsecured card processor seven restaurants have sued the maker of a bank cardprocessing system for failing to secure the product from a romanian hacker who breached their systems the restaurants located in louisiana and mississippi filed a classaction suit against georgiabased radiant systems for producing a pointofsale pos system that they say was not compliant with payment card industry security standards and resulted in an undetermined number of customers having their debit and credit card numbers stolen the suit alleges that the system stored all the data embedded on the bank card magnetic stripe after the transaction was completed — a violation of industry security standards that made it a highrisk target for hackers also named in the suit is computer world a louisianabased retailer which sold and maintained radiant’s aloha pos system according to plaintiffs computer world’s technicians allegedly installed the remoteaccess program pcanywhere on the systems to allow its technicians to fix technical problems from offsite the only problem is the company failed to secure the program the suit alleges that the system was not up to date with software patches and the pcanywhere remote login and password that technicians used to access the pos systems was the same at every one of the  louisiana locations where the system was installed according to one of the plaintiffs who spoke with threat level the default login was “administrator” and the password was “computer” as a result a hacker believed to be based in romania accessed the systems of at least  businesses through the pcanywhere software and possibly others plaintiffs say once inside the hacker installed malware to grab card data as it was swiped and send it to an email address in romania the hack follows a wave of similar attacks that targeted pointofsale systems at other national retailers and restaurant chains between  and early  including dave  busters restaurants hannaford brothers tjx walmart and others the suit was filed in march in the us district court in louisiana but the court ruled only last week that the seven plaintiffs could proceed as a group with their case opening the way for additional plaintiffs to join the litigation “we want other restaurants nationally to be aware of the hidden dangers posed by these technology companies and the unfair penalties imposed by the credit card companies” said plaintiffs attorney shiel gallagher in a press release “these huge companies shouldn’t have the power to destroy these restaurants” the plaintiffs include crawfish town usa don’s seafood  steak house jone’s creek cafe mel’s diner picante’s mexican restaurant sammy’s grill and a best western two other restaurants have also sued radiant systems and computer world separately the restaurants are seeking millions in damages to recover their costs from the breach these include fines levied against them from visa and other credit card companies for failing to be pcicompliant the cost of forensic audits to uncover the source of the breach chargebacks to cover fraudulent charges made on customer accounts and reimbursements to card providers who had to issue new customer cards according to the plaintiffs’ court filing pdf radiant and computer world were allegedly warned by visa in april  that the aloha system along with pos systems made by five other vendors were noncompliant because they stored card data visa also sent out a bulletin in november  warning that one of the most frequent vectors for hackers to penetrate pos systems was through poorly configured or unpatched remoteaccess software pdf and default passwords nonetheless the restaurants say radiant and computer world sold them a product that was neither pcicompliant nor secured against a known attack pci compliance involves  requirements that include installing and maintaining a firewall changing default vendor passwords encryption of transaction data while it’s being processed and updated security patches and antivirus definitions among other things businesses that accept bank card payments from customers are contractually required by the payment card industry to have pcicompliant architectures and to use only products that are pcicompliant charles hoff general counsel for the georgia restaurant association and one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys says these kinds of security disputes are becoming more common but rarely garner public attention because vendors tend to settle rather than risk exposure through a court case he said this suit was filed only after radiant refused to take responsibility for the breaches “radiant … took a very arrogant attitude about it” he told threat level “i’ve had other pos vendors who felt they should be accountable and the end result was that they knew they needed to do the right thing radiant i don’t think thought we were serious radiant’s website gives customers the greatest assurance that when it comes to their resellers they monitor and make sure they’re scrutinized and compliant it really would give you all the confidence in the world if it was actually done” radiant has declined to comment on the details of the suit “what we can say is that radiant takes data security very seriously and that our products are among the most secure in the industry” paul langenbahn president of radiant’s hospitality division told the atlanta journal constitution “we believe the allegations against radiant are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves” keith bond owner of mel’s diner in broussard louisiana told threat level that he purchased his aloha system for  and installed it around late november  computer world he says convinced him that the system needed to be connected to the internet for faster transaction processing as opposed to the dialup modem connection he had been using for processing in april  just a few months after installing the system one of his employees called to tell him that the mouse cursor on one of three aloha terminals he’d bought seemed to be moving on its own and that employees were unable to take control of it after contacting computer world technicians the restaurant was told to disconnect its system from the internet a service tech appeared the next day to replace the hard drive but didn’t disclose the nature of the problem or indicate that an intruder had breached the system bond learned only later that a keystroke logger had been installed on all three of his aloha terminals and that the intruder had been siphoning card numbers for about three weeks he discovered this only after visa and mastercard contacted him in may to tell him his system had been breached bond whose hour diner processes about  to  card transactions a day says  card numbers were stolen during the threeweek period the hacker was in his system “if they had accessed the server they would have got thousands of card numbers” bond said the credit card companies forced him to hire a forensic team to investigate the breach which cost him  visa then fined his business  after the forensic investigators found that the radiant aloha system was noncompliant mastercard levied a  fine against his restaurant but opted to waive the fine due to the circumstances then the chargebacks started arriving bond says the thieves racked up  on  card accounts he had to pay  and managed to get the remainder dropped in total the breach has cost him about  and he says his fellow plaintiffs have borne similar costs bond said radiant and computer world were unresponsive “radiant just basically hung us out to dry” he says “it’s quite obvious to me that they’re at fault… when you buy a system for  you feel like you’re getting a stateoftheart sytem then three to four months after i bought the system i’m hacked into” image courtesy california state controller’s office go back to top skip to start of article cardingsecurity skip social skip to
