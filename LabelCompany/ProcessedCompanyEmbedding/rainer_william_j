commodity futures trading commission nd annual chicagokent college of law derivatives and commodities law institute chicago illinois remarks of william j rainer chairman commodity futures trading commission nd annual chicagokent college of law derivatives and commodities law institute chicago illinois october   the question that i will address this morning is must the cftc change the way it regulates the financial futures markets the answer is an unequivocal yes and it is the dramatic changes in the markets themselves that demand such reform ten years ago when the cftc issued the swaps policy statement the differences between swaps transactions and financial futures transactions were reasonably clear swaps were bilateral tailored and individually negotiated over the phone moreover there were no clearinghouses for swaps since then however we have witnessed an inexorable creep towards standardization and with today�s technology it has become increasingly difficult to find language that will preserve meaningful distinctions between the otc swaps and financial futures this convergence of the two markets has blurred the differences between swaps and futures and attempts to differentiate the two are not only an increasingly futile exercise but have also created legal uncertainty in the otc market and have distracted us from the task of reforming regulation of the futures markets therefore in examining both the otc derivatives market and the exchange traded financial futures market we must carefully analyze whether or not the broad statutory goals set forth many years ago in the commodity exchange act can continue to drive the correct regulatory policy shortly after i took this job i studied section  of the act and found three basic purposes for the regulatory structure currently administered by the cftc  to protect the price discovery function  to prevent the manipulation of commodities through corners squeezes and similar schemes and  to assure an effective vehicle for risk transference implicit throughout is the need to provide suitable customer protection from abusive trade practices and fraud do these purposes fit the financial futures and derivatives markets today let�s examine them one by one first price discovery with respect to financial futures such as the bond contract there is no critical price discovery role at least not in the classic sense as there is in the case of a physical commodity such as cotton users may rely on the price information of the bond contract but the government bond market does not discover the long bond price through the bond future the cotton industry on the other hand does discover its price through the cotton futures contract simply stated there is no case for regulating financial futures on the basis of price discovery second manipulation the long list of attempts to manipulate physical commodities is well known indeed the need to prevent manipulation is the primary reason this agency and its predecessor came into being manipulation continues as we recently witnessed in the case of copper but what is the record of manipulation in the financial arena we now have more than  years of experience with the bond contract and foreign currencies and about as much experience with other financial futures the cftc�s enforcement record contains only two minor cases of attempted manipulation in any of these instruments which is remarkable but one must remember the size of these markets tbonds alone trade  to  contracts a day while we cannot discount to zero the chances that someone may come up with a successful manipulation scheme in the future i am skeptical whether in light of this experience the public policy objective of preventing the remote possibility of manipulation warrants the current level of regulation for financial instruments third risk transference risk transference is a function of these markets and therefore a valid reason for regulation again we must ask how much regulation is required to achieve an effective result that is to say there are only a few ways to hedge agricultural products but financial market practitioners typically have at their disposal a wide array of effective risk management tools available in a number of different markets finally we need to determine the suitable level of customer protection the financial futures markets are open to the widest variety of participants from goldman sachs or morgan stanley to the relatively inexperienced individual speculator the overthecounter swaps market is almost entirely a sophisticated market composed mostly of professional dealers and institutional investors historically because our regulatory policy has been transaction based we have had a onesizefitsall approach to rules protecting customers again the question is do the facts support current regulatory policy we recognize that similar to the otc market the financial futures markets are also predominantly institutional we may need to make new judgments with respect to the appropriate level of customer protection the cftc�s statutory goals and regulatory policy today fit neither the financial futures markets nor otc derivatives the cftc has focused on the common element of futurity in the instruments we regulate one of the fundamental shifts that the cftc needs to make is to recognize that financial futures are not the same as metals futures energy futures or agricultural futures financial futures cannot be isolated from the rest of the global financial markets and we should regulate from that perspective the awkward fit between us regulatory policy and the markets would not matter � and until recently has not mattered very much � as long as the public interest did not suffer but today at least three vital priorities are not being met namely  the need to enhance economic efficiency and competition  the need to encourage innovation in technology for the markets and  the need to mitigate systemic risk in the rapidly growing otc markets by encouraging developments such as clearinghouses the national interest in fostering economic efficiency and competition in the otc derivatives market can only be accomplished by establishing clear legal certainty for overthecounter derivatives the cea was not designed to regulate the otc market the benefits from such legal certainty are selfevident and warrant no further comment here our economy will profit from the efficiencies created by technological advances � trades will be consummated faster and with lower costs and this will lead to a decrease in the cost of capital national and international markets will also gain from the development of a clearinghouse for these markets � among other benefits netting helps decrease systemic risk while achieving more efficient use of capital these are all areas that are being addressed through the auspices of the president�s working group on financial markets but in formulating a comprehensive approach to address the public policy priorities for otc derivatives it is the profound challenge of the cftc to address those same priorities for the financial futures markets the cftc�s regulatory policy must ensure that there is a balance between the regulatory environment for otc derivatives and the level of regulation applied to the financial futures markets these markets are simply too important to the nation�s economy to ignore the potential damage from disparate regulatory structures the financial futures markets by any measure are huge take for example the bond contract and the eurodollar contract the bond contract trades a notional value of about  billion a day the eurodollar contract usually trades more than  billion a day as we tailor policy to fit the three fundamental priorities of efficiency and competition technological advances and reduction of systemic risk it is important that the financial futures markets receive commensurate regulatory adjustments the government must not inadvertently pick winners and losers as we attempt to reshape the regulatory landscape for all financial markets consequently the cftc must embark on a process that may result in major deregulation of the financial futures markets beginning with those contracts that compete directly with otc derivatives no rule or regulation will escape scrutiny while the financial futures markets are most in need of regulatory reform all of our contract markets would benefit from a lighter regulatory hand the cftc intends to withdraw from approving contract designations and will soon issue proposed regulations to permit exchanges to adopt new rules without prior approval these are key elements in our overall plan to move from being a frontline to an oversight regulator in adopting an oversight role the cftc will consider a number of alternative market models in the past we have issued rules authorizing the establishment of professional markets and while these proved unsuccessful some may think this idea worth revisiting establishing pro markets might appear to be the easiest or quickest way to achieve competitive equilibrium between exchange and overthecounter markets but this design may have negative effects on cost and liquidity the efficiency of the futures markets and their depth of liquidity for risk management activity rely upon their public nature we should be very careful about creating a regulatory climate that would force exchanges to become exclusively professional markets to remain competitive there is no doubt that some of these objectives will be difficult to achieve but our nation�s priorities in the area of financial regulation dictate that we start to examine and regulate products entities and exchanges on a rational basis and not be bound by tradition since i know that there are many other hot topics that i have not addressed � from the policy modifications required to change the cftc from frontline to oversight regulation to the importance of information sharing with international regulators � i�ll stop here and open the floor for a few questions news on william j rainer news home advertising board and executive moves

testimony before the senate agriculture committee hearing on the report by the presidents working group on financial markets over the counter derivatives markets and the commodity exchange act february   thank you chairman lugar senator harkin and members of the committee i appreciate the opportunity to come here and discuss the recommendations of the presidents working group on financial markets regarding the commodity exchange act and overthecounter derivatives transactions us financial markets generally are the envy of the world whether we are speaking of futures swaps or securities each of these sectors plays an important role in maintaining americas leadership in this area our countrys position in the otc market is affected by uncertainty over the legal status of many derivatives transactions this uncertainty turns on whether or not transactions could be invalidated under the cea the members of the working group are unanimous in our assessment of americas national economic priorities for the overthecounter derivatives markets these goals have already been mentioned namely � to promote technological innovation competition efficiency liquidity and transparency and � to reduce systemic risk by encouraging the market to develop regulated clearing systems the ability to achieve these will be enhanced through greater legal certainty for the otc market congressional action to exclude otc financial derivatives from the act would provide such certainty i can advocate this step because otc derivatives transactions as we know them today do not present regulatory concerns within the scope of the act also excluding this activity will not diminish the cftcs ability to carry out the statutory mission it is charged to fulfill    when the commodity exchange act was written congress articulated the rationale for regulating futures transactions first the act establishes the economic utility of futures trading stating that futures prices are generally quoted and disseminated throughout the united states and in foreign countries as a basis for determining prices to the producer and the consumer of commodities  in addition to their price discovery function futures transactions are used by commercial handlers as a means of hedging themselves against possible loss through fluctuations in price cea section  the second prong of congress rationale for regulation is that the transactions and prices of commodities  are susceptible to excessive speculation and can be manipulated controlled cornered or squeezed  the risks of price distortion and manipulation are the factors rendering regulation of these markets imperative  cea section  congress thus identified the overarching public mission of the cftc as that of preventing price manipulation and ensuring price transparency    like exchangetraded futures otc derivatives are riskshifting instruments the working group however has determined that unlike futures prices established in otc derivatives transactions do not serve a significant price discovery role pwg report at  the working group also has concluded that most otc derivatives are not susceptible to manipulation id according to the bank for international settlements  percent of otc derivatives are interest rate contracts and  percent are foreign exchange contracts a report issued recently by the office of the comptroller of the currency stated that interest rate contracts constitute  percent of derivatives held in us commercial banks interest rate and currency products which together comprise  percent of the otc derivatives market do not present the concerns congress addressed in mandating the regulation of futures moreover otc transactions are entered into and traded by sophisticated institutional traders who are able to look out for themselves in these markets also most dealers in the swaps market are either affiliated with brokerdealers or futures commission merchants that are regulated by the sec or the cftc or are financial institutions that are subject to supervision by bank regulatory agencies therefore the activities of most derivatives dealers already are subject to direct or indirect federal oversight pwg report at  because there is no manifest regulatory interest warranting cftc oversight of otc derivatives i support the exclusion proposed by the working group congress and the cftc have acted before to resolve legal uncertainty affecting otc derivatives in  amid strong signals that swap market participants feared their contracts could be declared unenforceable congress responded decisively instructing the cftc not to regulate swaps entered into by sophisticated parties congress authorized the cftc to provide exemptive relief for swaps without requiring the agency to make a threshold determination that particular exempted transactions fell within its jurisdiction the cftc promptly issued a rule exempting swap agreements from all provisions of the act except prohibitions against fraud and manipulation provided the swaps meet certain conditions the cftcs swaps exemption worked relatively well lately however evolution in the otc derivatives market has rendered the exemption inadequate for some purposes the swaps exemptive rule does not apply to otc contracts that are standardized cleared or executed under conditions that approximate those of an organized exchange technology however is dramatically changing the structure and nature of many aspects of the financial services industry the rise of electronic screenbased trading has blurred the line drawn in our swaps exemption between bilateral and multilateral trading the growth in swap volume and the acceptance of these contracts by a wider range of users has led to their standardization public policy must meet these advances in the otc market i also believe that the development of regulated clearing systems should be encouraged clearing systems can employ a variety of risk management tools such as mutualizing risk and offsetting multiple obligations consequently clearing systems help reduce systemic risk by lowering the possibility that the failure of a single market participant could disproportionately disrupt or impact the overall market finally the commissions rule exempts bilateral swaps from all provisions of the cea except those provisions prohibiting manipulation and fraud the cftc thought it prudent to retain its jurisdiction to act in the event the agency learned that participants were engaging in fraudulent or manipulative conduct and that transactions executed under the exemption were in fact futures the swaps exemption does not alter the cftcs responsibility to take action against this misconduct in a given set of circumstances however the agencys ability to act may be contingent upon proving that transactions are futures or options this is a critical point to remember at no time has congress or the cftc made the definitive judgment that swap transactions are in fact subject to the ceas jurisdiction the combination of responsibility with no more than contingent authority is simply bad public policy because as a practical matter the cftc cannot exercise its residual enforcement authority under the swaps exemption without exacerbating the existing legal uncertainty in this area    apart from legal certainty issues regarding otc derivatives the working group report contains recommendations aimed at improving the regulatory framework for other financial instruments some of these proposals have been addressed by other members of the group i would like to comment on the recommendation to alter the treasury amendment provision of the act to give the cftc explicit jurisdiction over unregulated entities that sell foreign exchange instruments to the public at large abusive promoters have exploited regulatory gaps to sell foreign currency contracts to financially unsophisticated individuals making exaggerated claims of profit opportunities and failing to disclose the risks of these inherently volatile instruments promoters often target senior citizens recent arrivals in this country and other vulnerable segments of society many of these enterprises simply pocket investor funds others channel funds to currency markets but typically do so without adequate segregation or disclosure as fraudulent forex companies proliferated the agency in  issued a consumer advisory through the mass media warning the public about these schemes cases filed by the cftc against illegal foreign currency operations during the s have involved more than  million in customer funds courts in which the cftc has brought enforcement actions have reached varying decisions regarding our jurisdiction over these instruments in those jurisdictions where we have not been foreclosed judicially from enforcement action we continue to move aggressively against retail forex fraud we also cooperate with state local and other federal authorities to bring a halt to this activity we ask congress to clarify our authority to regulate these instruments so that we may provide a stronger deterrent to fraud and abuse while providing a zone of comfort and rational oversight to legitimate enterprises that want to offer foreign currency contracts to the public    while examining the applicability of the act to otc markets we also have conducted an inquiry into whether our current regulatory scheme is appropriately tailored to todays environment for exchangetraded futures during the past several months the agency has undertaken a serious effort to answer the question what degree of exchangetraded regulation is necessary to serve the public interests entrusted to us this inquiry is at the heart of the process that the cftc has engaged in over the last several months a strong consensus exists among ourselves congress and the working group that such a review is needed impending technological changes require the cftc to scrutinize the continued vitality and viability of its onesizefitsall regulatory structure that currently applies to all futures transactions while that process is not yet complete certain clear principles have emerged one the historic needs of traditional physical commodities should not be the basis for regulating every futures contract traded today two institutional market participants do not require all of the protections designed for retail traders although i will not get into much detail here let me say that at its core this plan will afford market participants the opportunity to operate in a regulatory environment suited to the product traded and the participants trading it the key policy elements of this plan include a move from direct to more oversight regulation a move from prescriptive rules to flexible performance standards and the increased use of disclosurebased regulation this plan will not impair the agencys ability to assure the fundamental market integrity that is expected when conducting futures exchange transactions in the united states or when relying upon the prices set in us exchangetraded markets the commission will continue to exercise its authority to oversee their continued integrity    in conclusion mr chairman time is not our ally in establishing a framework that achieves our national economic priorities with respect to derivatives trading technology has made it increasingly easy to establish rival markets in foreign jurisdictions technology has also increased the speed with which new innovations are introduced and widely used by market participants because of these realities i ask congress to act expeditiously on the recommendations of the working group thank you again for the opportunity to testify before you today i look forward to continued collaboration with the rest of the group and the members of this committee to see these recommendations enacted into law this year  bank for international settlements
