leadership  with thilo semmelbauer  dave carvajal back to video library tweetables building a great product is important but building relationships with people really creates value insights click to tweet an essential part of being a leader is getting to know and motivate the people around you insights click to tweet “leadership starts with a vision it can come from great inspiration or hard analytical work” thilosemm insights click to tweet download the pdf transcription transcriptions thilo semmelbauer well i think leadership always starts with a vision a plan i think it can come from great inspiration or it can come from hard analytical and strategic work but it always starts with clarity of vision thilo semmelbauer and i think the second part is getting other people on board and that ultimately i think great leaders have a way of getting to know the people around them and motivating them thilo semmelbauer you can’t motivate people who are all motivated by different things unless you get to know them which requires listening learning observing communicating–all those things to really connect so you can’t do it by yourself thilo semmelbauer so i think it’s that combination of knowing where you want to go and being able to at the end of the day get others to follow i think that’s what leadership is all about thilo semmelbauer there’s a deeper thing perhaps underlying leadership that i didn’t mention and you’re making me think about it now i think it’s kind of at the basic level of caring so what does that mean thilo semmelbauer i mean caring about people the people are going to help you the people together are going to make it happen and if you don’t care about them it’s not going to work as well it’s only going to work for a short time period thilo semmelbauer so there’s something i don’t know quite to how to put words around it but the teams that i have built and the people i’ve worked with it’s like a relationship i care about them i want them to succeed they want me to succeed and there’s a bond there i think that makes it special and sometimes makes it work and you can build magic together dave carvajal and it’s amazing how that leadership thilo has inspired so many people in their own leadership growth and how they choose to lead and the active decision that they make in understanding how to be a better leader creating value in the world thilo semmelbauer i hope so there’s a lot of people that i’ve worked with over the years that i’m still in touch with that are in leadership positions and they call me and ask for advice and i give them what i can thilo semmelbauer most of it is within them and they maybe need some help bringing it out and that’s very gratifying to see people move on and do amazing things that’s part of the fun for me thilo semmelbauer yeah it’s building great products and having impact on people’s lives but it’s also the relationships with the people you work with that is very gratifying dave

insights click to tweet creating global jobs touching peoples lives insights thilosemm click to tweet download the pdf transcription transcriptions thilo semmelbauer two experiences worth mentioning when i started weight watchers online business there was no revenue it grew to a peak of about  million in revenue with probably more importantly millions of users many of them satisfied and some of them having had significant life changes which was very gratifying thilo semmelbauer shutterstock is probably one of the things i’m most proud of in my career and during my time there it grew from  million to  million in revenue over the course of five years dave carvajal yeah and there was an ipo in there as well thilo semmelbauer there was an ipo which was i think a great confirmation for this sort of staying power in the company and the impact that it has on the industry dave carvajal thilo what is the impact of some of your greatest achievements what are you most proud of thilo semmelbauer yeah well i mean i think at weight watchers the whole brand is around helping people so that’s something i really connected with i mean helping people lead healthier lives lose weight make personal transformations thilo semmelbauer weight watchers had been doing that for  years but we were trying to bring that into the online experience as well and i think one of the most exciting things that happened after we built and launched the product was seeing people purchase it online i mean watching the ticker that people were actually buying what we built thilo semmelbauer but i think that paled in comparison to hearing stories of people months later and over the years that had success with it with either right in or… thilo semmelbauer i would meet users after having millions of users it was not so hard to people who would just come up to me and say “wow you were involved with weight watchers online it really helped me i lost  pounds i became healthier this happened that happened” and to hear those stories that people’s lives changed in some way that made me feel great thilo semmelbauer it happened at shutterstock as well although in different ways i mean even before i got there the concept behind the shutterstock subscription offering was very appealing thilo semmelbauer but once we blew it out and got a lot more users on the platform and made the product better and improved the content one woman came up to me who’s a customer who said “we used shutterstock so much we’ve turned it into a verb in office when we have a creative problem we say ‘hey let’s shutterstock it’ thilo semmelbauer and they go on the site and they got lots of ideas and i had never thought about shutterstock that way but the fact that it was getting such heavy use and had such appeal for creative people that was very powerful thilo semmelbauer and i think shutterstock being a marketplace business equally powerful where some of the stories on the contributor side i mean photographers videographers all over the world thilo semmelbauer one woman i remember we invited her into the office who worked from her home in a small town in siberia halfway around the world selling her images and her illustrations to customers all over the world and she was making a living doing that thilo semmelbauer and there’s probably no way she would be able to pursue that passion without shutterstock so again maybe small ways but important ways of touching people’s lives i mean that’s exciting dave carvajalsuccess  with thilo semmelbauer dave partners leaders that conquer
