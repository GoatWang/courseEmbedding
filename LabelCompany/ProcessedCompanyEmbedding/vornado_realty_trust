approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find

process start to finish even allowing an export into vornado’s proprietary accounting system the system reduced data processing and scanning by  industrycommercial real estate employees serviceexpense download pdf saving time and resources with automation for nearly a decade vornado’s accounting processes had been paperless across the board—except for expenses the manual expense process was cumbersome and timeconsuming employees had to log into the company intranet download the expense form and fill in each line item which the document would then tally then the employee had to print the expense form attach receipts and manually give them to the approver or multiple approvers once the expense report was approved ap would come in as the “cleanup crew”—validating that every receipt was accounted for by matching them to line items and then entering the data into the system once in the system the expense form was processed a check was cut five days later the auditor approved it and the check was sent chrome river was able to automate the entire expense management process start to finish even allowing all expense report information to be exported out of chrome river expense and into vornado’s proprietary accounting system chrome river expense reduced data entry and scanning by  overview vornado realty trust nyse vno is a fully integrated real estate investment trust reit with an enterprise value of  billion asset value and a market capitalization of  billion equity vornado is one of the largest owners and managers of commercial real estate in the united states with a portfolio of over  million square feet primarily located in the new york and washington dc areas vornado’s core businesses include new york washington dc and retail properties that are primarily in the northeast california and puerto rico flexibility for a complex entity system vornado needed an expense management system that could scale to its very complex entity system the company has divisions in new york new jersey and washington dc as well as a mix of millions of square feet of commercial and retail properties each of the three divisions has its own rules and has its own version of vornado’s proprietary internal accounting system  through its flexible business rules engine chrome river offered a platform that allowed for a complex expense and approval rules configuration at first glance vornado’s team thought the transition would be straightforward believing it would simply mean taking the current manual processes and moving them onto the chrome river platform but adding some complexity to the transition was the fact that each division had its own rules and circumstances in washington dc for instance the accounting system didn’t support automated clearing house ach payments chrome river was able to build the business rule engine so that dc based employees could not select ach direct deposit as a reimbursement option and for each division chrome river built the business rules engine specifically for that divisions’ rules as vornado continued to learn the capabilities and flexibility of chrome river it began to ask more of the platform according to vornado chrome river “flipped the system on its side” at least three times to come up with unique configurations to support the company’s business goals vornado was assigned a very competent chrome river project manager who was able to weed through its hierarchy issues and help the organization make many complex routing changes and rules  thanks to chrome river employees were surprised to learn that expenses they had been attributing back to vornado could instead be assigned to the tenant goal replace its manual expense reporting workflow process with an automated workflow process that has builtin rules to ensure compliance by division and spend visibility across the organization automated rules uncover offline cost savings once it began using chrome river expense vornado realized there
