mortgagebacked securities were flat to down by the end of the quarter as compared to the levels seen at the end of  changes in rates and spreads during the current quarter were due to a number of factors however uncertainty about the timing of any actions that the federal reserve board frb would take in regard to the extraordinary accommodations that have influenced markets in recent years and

face challenges employment metrics have generally improved but remain inconsistent and not particularly robust economic conditions vary significantly over geographic areas with strength concentrated in and around major population centers on the coasts and in certain areas where economic activity has been driven by specific regional factors the unprecedented intervention by governments in markets and attempts to stimulate the economy including the sharp easing of monetary policy during  will eventually be reversed how the federal reserve resolves its own balance sheet expansion has become an increasing focus of economists and market participants economic activity in europe china and elsewhere has also improved in some aspects but remains mixed finally regulatory changes that have been enacted are expected to continue to impact the banking industry going forward these regulatory changes have added significant operating expense and operational burden and have fundamentally changed the way banks conduct business the new presidential administration has set policy initiatives that include attempts to reduce the regulatory burden the timing and extent of any success on that front is yet to be determined fiscal policy initiatives particularly a plan to significantly reduce corporate tax rates could have a major impact on the economy and on trustco but there is no certainty that those initiatives will take effect at all or will result in any timely andor significant change index overview the primary factors accounting for the change in net income for the three months ended march   compared to the same period of the prior year were � an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets of  million to  billion for the first quarter of  compared to the same period in  � an increase in taxable equivalent net interest margin for the first quarter of  to  from  in the prior year period the increase in the margin coupled with the increase in average earning assets resulted in an increase of  million in taxable equivalent net interest income in the first quarter of  compared to the first quarter of  � an increase of  million in salaries and benefits expense for the first quarter of  compared to the first quarter of  � a decrease of  thousand in federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and other insurance expense for the first quarter of  compared to the first quarter of  � a decrease of  thousand in professional services expense for the first quarter of  compared to the first quarter of  due to increased staffing and benefits costs index � an increase of  thousand in income taxes in the first quarter of  compared to the prior year due primarily to higher pretax earnings regulatory agreement the agreement relates to the findings of the occ following its regularly scheduled examination of the bank in january  since the completion of the examination and entry into the agreement the bank believes it has been working diligently to address the findings of the examination and to develop and implement appropriate formal action plans the agreement requires the bank to take various actions within prescribed time frames with respect to certain activities of the bank these include among others i establishment of a committee of at least three directors to monitor and coordinate the banks response to the formal agreement ii adoption of compliance plans to respond to the formal agreement with the assistance of an independent qualified consultant iii evaluation and implementation of improvements in corporate governance with the assistance of an independent qualified consultant iv evaluation and implementation of improvements in internal audit v development of a strategic plan vi development of a revised capital plan including dividends consistent with the strategic plan assetliability management trustcos results are affected by a variety of factors including competitive and economic conditions in the specific markets in which the company operates and more generally in the national economy financial market conditions and the regulatory environment each of these factors is dynamic and changes in any area can have an impact on trustcos results included in the annual report to shareholders on form k for the year ended december   is a description of the effect interest rates had on the results for the year  compared to  many of the same market factors discussed in the  annual report continued to have a significant impact on results through the first quarter of  index interest rates have a significant impact on the operations and financial results of all financial services companies one of the most important interest rates used to implement national economic policy is the federal funds rate this is the interest rate utilized within the banking system for overnight borrowings for institutions with the highest credit rating the federal funds target rate decreased from  at the beginning of  to a target range of  to  by the end of  in december  the target increased to a range of  to  and  basis point increases in the target range were also announced in december of  and march of  producing the current range of  to  while frb officials have pointed repeatedly to additional increases in  the comments have not been completely consistent or clear in regard to expectations any increases are likely to be supported only if economic conditions continue to improve in the march statement from the federal open market committee it was noted that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and  percent inflation this assessment will take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments the committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal the committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate the federal funds rate is likely to remain for some time below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run however the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data traditionally interest rates on bank deposit accounts are heavily influenced by the federal funds rate the average rate on interest bearing deposits was  basis points lower in the first quarter of  relative to the prior year period rates were flat or lower on all deposit categories as compared to the same period in  please refer to the statistical disclosures in the table below entitled distribution of assets liabilities and shareholders equity the interest rate on the year treasury bond and other longterm interest rates have significant influence on the rates for new residential real estate loans the frb has attempted to influence rates on mortgage loans by means other than targeting a lower federal funds rate including direct intervention in the mortgagebacked securities market through purchasing these securities in an attempt to raise prices and reduce yields in recent periods this includes the reinvestment of principal payments received on its holdings of agency securities agency mortgagebacked securities and treasury securities while no longer increasing its holdings of these securities the reinvestment of principal means that the existing holdings are not being unwound eventually management believes the frb will have to unwind these positions which would likely put upward pressure on rates although other factors may mitigate this pressure these changes in interest rates can have an effect on the company relative to the interest income on loans securities and federal funds sold and other short term instruments as well as on interest expense on deposits and borrowings index interest rates on new residential real estate loan originations are also influenced by the rates established by secondary market participants such as freddie mac and fannie mae as a portfolio lender trustco does not sell loans into the secondary market in the normal course of business and is able to establish rates that management determines are appropriate in light of the longterm nature of residential real estate loans while remaining competitive with the secondary market rates financial market volatility and the problems faced by the financial services industry have lessened the influence of the secondary market however various programs initiated by arms of the federal government have had an impact on rate levels for certain products most importantly a government goal of keeping mortgage rates low has been supported by targeted buying of certain securities thus supporting prices and constraining yields as noted above very low interest rates in many markets around the world have also increased demand for us fixed income assets which has also contributed to the decline of rates on these assets the federal funds sold and other short term investments portfolios are affected primarily by changes in the federal funds target rate also changes in interest rates have an effect on the recorded balance of the securities available for sale portfolio which is recorded at fair value generally as interest rates increase the fair value of these securities will decrease interest rates generally remained below historic norms on both short term and longer term investments during the first quarter of  despite the increases seen during the quarter while trustco has been affected by aspects of the overall changes in financial markets it was not affected to the degree the mortgage crisis affected some banks and financial institutions in the united states beginning in  generally the crisis revolved around actual and future levels of delinquencies and defaults on mortgage loans in many cases arising in managements view from lenders with overly liberal underwriting standards changes in the types of mortgage loans offered significant upward resets on adjustable rate loans and fraud among other factors the company utilizes a traditional underwriting process in evaluating loan applications and since originated loans are retained in the portfolio there is a strong incentive to be conservative in making credit decisions for additional information concerning trustcos loan portfolio and nonperforming loans please refer to the discussions under loans and nonperforming assets respectively further the company does not rely on borrowed funds to support its assets and maintains a significant level of    may   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage the

globe newswire  trustco bank corp ny trustco nasdaqtrst today announced second quarter of  net income of  million compared to  million for the second quarter of  an increase of   summary robert j mccormick president and chief executive officer noted we are pleased to be able to report a  increase in net income in the second quarter of  as compared to the second quarter of   improved revenue growth and expense control combined to produce a solid quarter and an encouraging first half of   our focus on traditional lending criteria and conservative balance sheet management has enabled us to produce consistent earnings maintain strong liquidity and capital and allowed us to continue to grow our business and take advantage of changes in market and competitive conditions  in terms of our core business we continue to add customer relationships which ultimately drive future growth  we will continue to take advantage of opportunities as they are presented during the balance of  and beyond  trustco saw continued solid loan growth in the second quarter of  compared to the prior year led by an increase in residential mortgages  loan portfolio expansion was funded by a combination of utilizing a portion of our strong cash balances and by the growth of our deposit base  the continued shift toward loans helped offset the margin impact from continued comparatively low yields on cash and investments  recent decisions by the federal reserve to raise short term interest rates have contributed to our results and will provide a further benefit in the second half of  and beyond  the growth in average deposits in the second quarter of  versus the prior year was led by lower cost checking and savings deposits  trustcos strong liquidity position continues to allow it to take advantage of opportunities as they arise asset quality measures improved versus june   with nonperforming assets npas declining  million details average loans were up  million or  in the second quarter of  over the same period in  average residential loans our primary lending focus were up  million or  in the second quarter of  over the same period in   overall loan growth was constrained by a  million decline in average commercial loans which have become less attractive on a risk adjusted basis and a  million decline in average outstandings on home equity lines of credit as well as a small decline in installment loans average deposits were up  million or  for the second quarter of  over the same period a year earlier  the increase in deposits came from core deposit accounts which consist of checking savings and money market deposits with checking and savings entirely responsible for the growth within core deposits  average core deposits increased  million from the second quarter of  to the second quarter of  while average time deposit balances were down  within core money market balances were down  million while checking was up  million including interest bearing and noninterest bearing balances and savings were up  million  core deposits typically represent longer term customer relationships and are generally lower cost than time deposits  the cost of interest bearing deposits declined from  in the second quarter of  to  in the second quarter of   the shift out of money market balances was also beneficial as that category is the most expensive type of core deposit  mr mccormick noted that the yearoveryear growth of our loans and core deposit base reflect the long term strategic focus of the company for the second quarter of  return on average assets and return on average equity were  and  respectively compared to  and  for the second quarter of   diluted earnings per share were  for the second quarter of  compared to  for the second quarter of   as previously discussed some operating costs remain at elevated levels in response to regulatory requirements however overall expense control remains a key area of focus  total operating expenses declined by  million in the second quarter of  as compared to the second quarter of  led by lower deposit insurance ore costs and equipment expense  the decline in expenses coupled with  million of revenue growth over the same period resulted in the bottom line improvement noted  we anticipate being able to control expense growth effectively in the second half of   some of the costs associated with regulatory issues will be recurring but others will diminish over time while some banks have backed away from branches a customerfriendly branch franchise continues to be the key to our long term plans  we continue to make good progress expanding loans and deposits throughout our entire branch network  we expect that trend to continue as the newer branches continue to mature at june   our average deposits per branch were  million compared to  million a year earlier  we have always designed our branches to be smaller and more cost effective than those built by many of our competitors  we use open floor plans that help maximize the value of our branches  we remain mindful that fully achieving our goals for newer branches will take time and continued work  we believe success in growing customer relationships provides basic building blocks that will help drive profit growth for the coming years asset quality and loan loss reserve measures improved versus june    nonperforming loans npls were  million at june   compared to  million at june    npls were equal to  of total loans at june   compared to  at june    the coverage ratio or allowance for loan losses to npls was  at june   compared to  at june    nonperforming assets npas were  million at june   compared to  million at june    the ratio of loan loss allowance to total loans was  as of june   compared to  at june   and reflects both the improvement in asset quality and economic conditions in our lending areas  the allowance for loan losses was  million at june   compared to  million at june    the provision for loan losses was  thousand for the second quarter of  compared to  thousand in the second quarter of   net chargeoffs for the second quarter of  decreased versus the second quarter of  falling to  thousand from  million in the year earlier period  the annualized net chargeoff ratio was  for the second quarter of  compared to  in the second quarter of  remaining at the lowest level since the first quarter of   the net interest margin for the second quarter of  was  up twelve basis points versus the second quarter of  as increases in short term interest rates led to significantly higher earnings on cash while slightly better returns were also achieved in the investment portfolio  loan yields did decline but that was more than offset by higher volumes in terms of income  during the same period the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined reflecting trustcos strong funding base for the first half of  net income was  million up  as compared to  million in the first half of  or  and  respectively per diluted share  at june   the equity to asset ratio was  compared to  at june    book value per share at june   was  compared to  a year earlier trustco bank corp ny is a

is a nongaap financial measure derived from gaapbased amounts we calculate tangible equity and tangible assets by excluding the balance of intangible assets from shareholders equity and total assets respectively we calculate tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets at period end by dividing tangible equity by tangible assets at period end we believe that this is consistent with the treatment by bank regulatory agencies which exclude intangible assets from the calculation of riskbased capital ratios  the efficiency ratio is a nongaap measure of expense control relative to revenue from net interest income and fee income  we calculate the efficiency ratio by dividing total noninterest expenses as determined under gaap but excluding other real estate expense net by net interest income fully taxable equivalent and total noninterest income as determined under gaap but excluding net gains on the sale of nonperforming loans and securities from this calculation  we believe that this provides a reasonable measure of primary banking expenses relative to primary banking revenue  we believe that these nongaap financial measures provide information that is important to investors and that is useful in understanding our financial results our management internally assesses our performance based in part on these measures  however these nongaap financial measures are supplemental and not a substitute for an analysis based on gaap measures as other companies may use different calculations for these measures this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies a reconciliation of the nongaap measures of tangible common equity tangible book value per share efficiency ratio net income and net income per share to the
