interference mitigation xmax overcomes challenging wireless environments and conditions using advanced fieldproven interference mitigation technologyinterference is the chief limiting factor in highcapacity mobile communications it can negatively impact reliability performance and coverage in wireless systems interference is responsible in many cases for dropped calls slow download speeds and shortened battery lifewhile interference has long been an issue in unlicensed spectrum bands mobile carriers are seeing that the licensed ie dedicated spectrum used in their g and g mobile networks is also experiencing unprecedented levels of interference in large part this is due to unrelenting growth in highbandwidth mediarich mobile data use in addition to commercial networks interference is also of concern to our public safety armed forces and homeland security agencies their growing reliance on broadband communications makes unintentional and intentional interference jamming a real threat to their missionsxmax leverages proprietary xgdeveloped technology to implement a “layered” approach to dealing with interference—an industry firstbeginning with an advanced version of dynamic spectrum access dsa xmax uses realtime sensing of interference to instantly change channels if better frequencies are detected however xmax goes beyond simple dsa by incorporating sophisticated interference mitigation software that enables it to continue operating reliably on interferenceladen channels essentially xmax employs advanced intelligence to determine at a granular level how much interference it can effectively withstand before reconfiguring its parameters  when xg’s interference mitigation technology is added to its dsa capabilities xmax can greatly increase the capacity of both new and existing spectrum assetsxmax radios employ powerful parallel processing digital signal processors and computer processing units dspcpu that support speeds up to  giga ops billion operations per second for signal processing these processors combined with × mimo antenna configurations and patented spatial processing algorithms enable the xmax system to remove unwanted interference from the target xmax signals each xmax cognitive radio can simultaneously mitigate up to  mobile sources of interference or jamming by using xmax’s multiantenna technology to separate unwanted interference from desired xmax signals xg is able to offer robust and reliable links in conditions that would cause other radio systems to failxmax mimo based interference mitigation separates interference from desired signalsbecause xmax can tolerate high levels of interference before requiring the radios to switch channels more “gray spectrum” containing interference or jamming can be used in place of scarce “white spectrum” clean and interferencefree in turn this makes white spectrum channels available for other radios that cannot effectively mitigate interference on their own this capability increases an xmax network’s total throughput and capacity greatly—without consuming additional scarce and costly spectrum resourcesthe following press releases underscore xmax’s interference mitigation attributesxg technology demonstrates resistance to jamming at us special operations command eventxg technology awarded new patent for enhanced mitigating interference in

technology xg technology company websites imt solutions vislink xg technology rural telcos unlock new sources of nonregulated revenuesmall and rural telcos are in search of new and creative ways of generating nonregulated revenue to remain competitive in a changing marketplace traditionally options for creating nonregulated revenue have been limited to costly fixed infrastructure like ftth or acquiring expensive and scarce wireless spectrum—assuming it is even availablethis has caused a number of smaller familyowned companies to leave the business due to burdensome regulatory issues and low profit margins others have invested heavily in wired infrastructure only to see their target consumers – and the potential for profit – access networks on the outer edges of their territories another challenge is that government funding mechanisms often do not adequately cover the cost of delivering services to those remote communities  as a result even though  of all americans live in rural areas where wireless broadband coverage and competition is quite limited for many providers revenues are flat and growth is getting harder to findhowever there are still substantial business opportunities available for rural telcos to uncover if you are a service provider here is something to think about throughout your service area there are probably dozens of enterprises and organizations that could benefit from reliable interoperable easily deployed and affordable wireless broadband communications for exampleemergency response professionals are using smart phones and tablets to deliver data and highspeed video during emergencies and disasters many are paying  per month for lte that is not always available or accessible how much money could you make if you provided more reliable service for lessmany municipalities are looking for simple and more costeffective ways to provide wireless broadband to parks libraries senior centers and other community areas how would it impact your bottom line if you provided those services without the massive expense and management challenges of municipal wificolleges and universities are looking for ways to improve security and speed communications during crisis situations when the public cellular networks are seriously congestedduring large events such as college football games and music festivals communications can become problematic for event organizers vendors and attendees what would it be worth to them if you could solve those problems easily and inexpensivelythe solution for rural telcos is xmaxxmax from xg
