investment terms  peloton wealth strategists select page demystifying investment jargon d – g by steve carr  feb    investing  financial strategy peloton updates   comments this is the second in a series of posts from peloton wealth strategists which will form peloton’s investment glossary intended to help investors understand some of the most common and confusing investment terms we’ve shared the facts plus our own perspective on the terms our goal is to help you – the investor – become a more knowledgeable consumer of financial services d day trader someone who attempts to profit from intraday moves in stocks by placing many andor large trades often closing out all positions by the end of the trading session peloton’s take very few individuals are ever consistently successful day trading one reason is because often professional traders at large firms are on the other sides of these trades don’t do it deferred load a sales commission that is incurred when an investment product is sold most often associated with bshare mutual funds  see also a shares b shares c shares derivatives financial contracts that derive their value from the price of an underlying security commodity or other entity common derivatives include “options” on stocks options are contracts to buy or sell a stock at a certain price on a certain future date derivatives can be used to hedge risk structure income or speculate peloton’s take derivatives are ingenious instruments that make modern finance possible they can also be very complicated and dangerous if misused see also call option futures contract dividends the portion of the company’s profits that are returned to shareholders as cash peloton’s take we believe dividends are an important source of cash flow for clients taking distributions from their portfolios and work to make sure that companies we invest in can afford to continue paying their dividends see also dividend reinvestment dividend reinvestment a custodial or mutual fund account option which allows for the automatic purchase of more shares each time a dividend is paid dividend yield a company’s dividend expressed as a percentage of the company’s stock price bottom line stocks with high dividend yields don’t necessarily make good investments if the yield is too high it may mean that the company is stretching eg borrowing to pay it dividend yield must be viewed within the context of the company’s ability to continue paying it dow composition perhaps the most widely recognized stock index the dow jones industrial average is comprised of  of the largest most widely held common stocks in the us peloton’s take because the djia is a “price weighted” index stocks with higher share prices affect the index value most we believe a weighting based on market capitalization as used in the sp  is a better gauge of general market performance e ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is a modified measure of a company’s earnings often used to compare companies in different industries accounting concepts like depreciation can skew the actual profitability for companies with significant assets peloton’s take ebitda is a useful tool and applicable in certain cases ebitda is not the same as cash flow which also factors prominently in our fundamental valuation process enterprise value an alternative measure of a company’s value that factors in both debt and cash on the company’s balance sheet enterprise value  market capitalization  total debt – cash equity ownership public companies finance themselves either by selling an ownership interest or by or by borrowing money common stocks represent an equity ownership stake in a business while bonds and bank loans are examples of borrowed money see also creditor vs equity interest etfs exchange traded funds are diversified investment vehicles that trade on an exchange like a stock like mutual funds etfs own a portfolio of other securities peloton’s take the number and varieties of etfs have exploded in the the last decade for beginning investors etfs can be a costeffective way to get invested investors need to carefully study the holdings and expenses associated with etfs before investing ex dividend date the date on which the declared dividend belongs to the owner of the stock for all intents and purposes the dividend has been “paid” as of this date and often the stock falls by an amount similar to the dividend amount on this date see also dividends dividend yield   f fdic insurance limit the federal deposit insurance corporation is a government sponsored entity which guarantees bank customers against the possibility that their bank would fail during the  financial crisis the limit of fdic insurance was raised from  per account to  bottom line the insurance limit applies per fdicinsured bank fees b an annual marketing or distribution fee that is included a mutual fund’s “expense ratio” and costs typically  –  peloton’s take this is another misunderstood fee it is paid to advisors for selling a particular class of mutual fund to their clients often this fee is higher than the management fee paid to actual mutual fund manager many advisors sell mutual funds with b fees a way of building in a recurring annual commission without charging a direct fee fiduciary duty a legal requirement to act solely in the best interests of another party peloton’s take registered investment advisors like peloton are held to a fiduciary duty while many brokers and other financial advisors are held to a much weaker “suitability standard” the former requires that we make investment decisions in clients’ best interests the latter allows commissionbased advisors to recommend products that may be more expensive for clients andor generate higher commissions for themselves as long at the investment is deemed suitable for the client this is a huge distinction that is often overlooked or misunderstood by investors g guarantee a formal promise or assurance typically in writing that certain conditions will be fulfilled peloton’s take a word that has no place in finance or investing be wary of any advisor or investment product that guarantees anything see also annuity share thisfacebooktwitterlinkedinemail  subscribe to our email newsletter categoriescompany research economics  capital markets investing

contentpeloton wealth strategists takes a stand on complex and expensive diversification practicesmarketwireoctober  reblogsharetweetshareindianapolis inmarketwire    peloton wealth strategists a leading independent registered investment advisor today releases a white paper discussing the often overly complex and expensive practice of diversification while the need to diversify investments is intuitive naïve approaches to diversification are dangerousat its core diversifying among several attractive investments is one important means of mitigating the potential negative effects from making a bad decision while maintaining the positive impact of good decisions however mitigating risk by relying on vague concepts of eggs and separate baskets reduces investors odds of meeting their future financial needseffective investment diversification is more like math its governed by rules and relationships and it also requires consistent study and applicationdiversification by some advisors has become a sort of wizard of oz scenario where a myriad of products and layers of management distract clients from the hefty fees associated with overdiversification said matthew bradley chief investment officer for peloton wealth strategists at peloton we pride ourselves on independence ethics and fundamental analysis forming a unique investment strategy for each of our clients with varying levels of diversification the goal of this white paper is to help educate the market on this often overcomplicated strategy and better explain how diversification can be achieved costeffectivelythe white paper first describes the basic process of diversification by looking at fundamental characteristics of various types of investments it then explores how the practice of diversification has been made unnecessarily complex and expensive to serve the ambitions of some financial advisors finally the paper concludes with recommendations for how diversification can be practiced in an effective mannerthe full white paper is available on pelotons website at wwwpelotonwealthcomabout peloton wealth strategists founded in  peloton wealth strategists is an independent
