volume should not impact an investor’s ability to trade the etf during market hours for more information please read the following article understanding etf liquidity what are the tax implications when investing in etfs index or passive etfs may offer tax advantages relative to mutual funds due to their structure and unique creation and redemption process the creation and redemption processes used by index etfs are designed to mitigate adverse effects on an etf’s portfolio that could arise from frequent cash purchase and redemption transactions that affect the net asset value of the etf in contrast to conventional mutual funds where frequent redemptions can have an adverse tax impact on taxable shareholders because of the need to sell portfolio securities which in turn may generate taxable gain the inkind redemption mechanism of an index etf to the extent used generally is not expected to lead to a tax event for shareholders the actively managed ark etfs arkq arkg arkw and arkk are not permitted to reconstitute their portfolios through the use of custom baskets and inkind transfers as a result the actively managed ark etfs are subject to tradingrelated shortterm and longterm capital gains and losses in addition the actively managed ark etfs may make distributions annually that generally will be taxed as ordinary income other possible tax implications may occur when shares are sold in the secondary market or a creation or redemption unit is created tax consequences will vary by individual what are the differences between active and index etfs index or passive etfs are tethered to an underlying index like the sp  or dow jones industrial average fund management is focused on matching the underlying index instead of making decisions based on research a passive etf follows its underlying index as its benchmark ark developed its indices based on thematic research that highlighted niche areas of innovation active etf management is based on research and the portfolio manager’s discretion with the investment policies of the etf as with an active mutual fund most etfs in the active space are based on preexisting strategies just in a different wrapper because the manager is picking stocks based on research actively managed funds are not tethered to an index how do etfs differ from mutual funds an etf is similar to a mutual fund in that it offers investors a proportionate share in a pool of stocks bonds and other assets also like a mutual fund an etf is required to post the markedtomarket net asset value nav of its portfolio at the end of each trading day one major difference is that investors buy and sell etf shares on a stock exchange through brokerdealers much as they would trade individual stocks in contrast mutual fund shares are not listed on stock exchanges retail investors buy and sell mutual fund shares through a variety of distribution channels including directly from a fund company or through a financial adviser or brokerdealer mutual funds and etfs are also priced differently mutual funds are “forward priced” investors can place orders to buy or sell shares throughout the day but all orders received during the day will receive the same price—the fund’s nav at the next time it is computed most mutual funds calculate their nav as of  pm eastern time because that is the time us stock exchanges typically close in contrast the market price of an etf share is continuously determined through trading on a stock exchange consequently the price at which investors buy and sell etf shares may not necessarily equal the nav of the portfolio of securities in the etf in addition two investors selling the same etf shares at different times on the same day may receive different prices for their shares both of which may differ from the etf’s nav source investment company institute what are the benefits of etfs liquidity etfs trade on an exchange like a stock thus they have similar liquidity and investors can trade them throughout market hours transparency etfs disclose their holdings daily passive etf holdings should reflect the index to which they are tethered active etfs are similarly transparent and

previously unachieved to decipher the language of life combined with new capabilities in big data storage we can better understand our past and future and apply that understanding to the present why
