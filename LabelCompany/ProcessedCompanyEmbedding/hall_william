accelerating corporate strategy using technology and learning technology every small business needs a computer crash plan william hall leadership development  steps to build strategically critical leadershipdevelopment programs william hall execution youve had the annual strategy development meeting now what william hall shares july   working at apple between the early s through the early s was an exceptionally exciting time filled with unusually high opportunity for anyone choosing to work toward turning around one of the best companies in the world during the early part of that period apple was on its way to becoming historyrelated  reasons why steve jobs was truly one of a kindas most know steve jobss fateful return changed the course of the companys history for the betteri was one of the crazy ones who passionately believed in the company and thus stayed with the company even as it was heading toward its end during the first tech boom telling people i worked at apple would result in why do you work there or you should work for yahoo or sun microsystems is the place to work those nuggets of wisdom got old at timesbut i was ready for the naysayers my usual reply im doing more than most people will do in a lifetime or because apple is going to turn around and im helping work on thisin fact i was lucky to work with jobs avie tavanian jon rubenstein and other executives i didnt leave apple because i was learning as much as i could there about entrepreneurship and how to fix a great company it was the best education anyone could ask forafter working with jobs for a few years i can confidently list the clear lessons i learned that can be applied to entrepreneurship in general as well as to starting and growing a company here are the five greatest lessons i learned working with steve jobs during the apple turnaroundmarketing is criticalmost people may not believe this apple back then didnt do much marketing it was a relatively silent company and most people didnt know about its products but once jobs took over he quickly transformed the company into a marketing machine i remember him saying how can we sell a product if nobody knows about it the lesson i took away was you can make the best mouse trap in the world but if you dont tell anyone no one will buy itcare deeply about everything but rely on others to create excellenceits pretty well known that jobs cared just as much about the insides of a machine as its outside appearance i remember sitting in an imac meeting where he was able to talk to fred anderson about corporate finance and immediately switch his focus to questioning the placement of asic chips on the motherboard because it was too thick and uglythe lesson i took away was be very well versed and care deeply about everything but rely on exceptionally smart people to create excellencelook past the resume and scores when hiringjobs looked way past the resumes or scores of people he hired he looked at accomplishments personality and interests apple was filled with employees who didnt have scholastic pedigrees high scores or namebrand mbas in most cases top mbas floundered in the company and quickly leftrelated  tips for turnarounds that unleash your companys unmet potentialjobs hired exceptionally smart people who had many talents that created very wellrounded exceptionally creative and remarkable problemsolvers my takeaway from this style of hiring dont hire just on scholastic accomplishments or high scores hire the person you can easily work with who has many talents and has interesting talents outside worktrust your instinctsthe trend toward ai machine learning and analytics has made me a little uneasy this is a little ironic considering that i run a company that creates business simulations for fortune  companies but one of the greatest lessons i learned from jobs was to look at situations and trust my instincts interpretation and recommendationi can still remember as clear as day the first time jobs asked me what do you think about a certain challenge we were having with mac os x i replied with my honest assessment and recommendations with which he was okay phew i can also remember his frustration when people provided analytical solutions after they were asked what do you thinkjobs believed very strongly in smart peoples gut instinct my takeaway from this become comfortable with listening and acting on your instinctsgo big be bold take riskssteve jobs was in my opinion the absolute master at boldness and risks jobs had the ability to go big be bold and take risks after his return to apple he bet the entire company on one product the imac the entire companys future relied on this one product he went big went bold and took the risk the rest is history my obvious lesson from this be willing to go big go bold and take a riski chose to leave apple in  in order apply these lessons on turning a company around and finally open my own company i have been able to apply what i learned to my own entrepreneurial adventures many times overrelated how steve jobs saved applei miss the turnaround days at apple and still miss the smart people most of whom have also since left i was fortunate enough to work with so heres the takeaway for you if youre ever given the opportunity to help turn a company around take it you may not find a better

four visits to north america between  and  in  bartlett first visited the united states to draw the buildings towns and scenery of the northeastern states the finely detailed steel engravings bartlett
