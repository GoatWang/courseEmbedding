consumer research and complaints thrivent financial has been better business bureau accredited since  and has an a rating with only eight complaints having been reported in the last three years of the eight complaints two have been closed in the past  months there are few reviews of thrivent out there to be found as with most companies there are some negative reviews mainly by people frustrated with procedures even these are very minimal particularly for a company of this size the limited number of reviews is possibly based on the fact that the products sold by thrivent are not those that are dealt with on a regular basis life insurance annuities and investments are all things people might pay into but not modify often unlike other types of insurance where claims are more common these types of products can see reduced interaction with customers resulting in less opportunity for a negative experience financial strength rating company grade financial outlook am best a stable fitch aa stable sp na na bottom line thrivent financial is a good choice for those who need longterm planning insurance and financial products and are seeking a company that matches their personal religious beliefs as they offer products only to people of the christian faith they are obviously not an option for anyone who is not a member of this religious group the company has a strong reputation and is financially secure making them a strong bet for those who do fit the customer profile and who are in search of a different sort of financial services company from the forprofit financial institutions

disappointed with this company and their customer service we are now looking to move all of our accounts to another company my mom had policies with vanguard and they went out of their way to help thrivent’s customer service is horrendous reply joseph devecchio says february   at  pm thrivent has been harassing my wife for over  years for an apparent policy that they claim her parents took out on her when she was  months old the first she knew of any policy is when thrivent sent a threatening letter demanding payment and had bill collectors calling our home both of my wife’s parents have passed and thrivent claims they had not made all the payments on the policy thrivent has refused to correspond with our insurance adviser and declined to send my wife a copy of the policy that they say she is responsible for payments on this is a bad company do not do business with them reply angela says july   at  pm i would suggest reaching out to a local representative i find them able to

her to return “back on claim” and receive payment on her lt nursing care insurance i am happy to say this very senior leader was able to reinstate my mother with all backinvoices  – months paid in less than a week moral of the story……escalate jointly with your agent the claims department and leadership need help in serving their customers reply jimm lubenow says november   at  am thrivent is the worst company i’ve ever had to deal with they are lying redacted who use deceitful business practices i’ve been waiting a month for a payout that am told each day will be in my account “tomorrow” customer service and claims people are reducted who duck from accepting calls and keep saying they don’t have what they need to process the claim the last lie was them saying they didn’t have my checking account info but they did in fact they deducted a fee from my account three days prior stay away from thrivent reply nancy mills says october   at  pm my mom purchased long term care in  and when she needs it she can’t get it– thrivent states that a “granddaughter” is immediate family and will not pay for immediate family to get paid my mom doesn’t want to go into an assisted living or nursing home she would love to stay in her home where she is comfortable and well taken care of with her own money when my mom purchased this piece of paper aal gave her a book that stated family members can get paid taking care of the insured but………………… they still continue to make her pay for her piece of paper but won’t take care of her it is sad for me that this was a christian business not taking care of the elderly don’t buy long term care– reply kyle says october   at  am i’m not currently a thrivent agent and know nothing about your policy specifics but i will say family typically will not be paid for care yet in some cases can receive a portion of the benefits paid out but if she is indeed in need of care and cannot perform  activities of daily living she should qualify to have premiums waived for now instead of complaining to the company i recommend speaking to an intelligent agent that specializes in long term care like myself or your current thrivent agent although we wouldn’t be paid to review your policy it is our job and we’d be happy to do it cheers reply suan says november   at  am i have heard recently – at least here in nyc that family members can be paid to take care of a spouse or relative it may stem from so many companies popping up and not having ‘caring staff’ that family has to quit their job to care for someone…and it is a lotless expensive to stay in your own home reply suan says november   at  am sorry that’s new york state leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name  email

thrivent financial for lutherans and our indirect subsidiary thrivent life insurance company �tlic� are making an exchange offer to owners of certain outstanding variable annuity contracts issued through one or more of our separate accounts �current contracts� the current contracts include the following � � � � � thrivent variable annuity� thrivent issued between  and  � � � � �aal variable annuity� aal issued between  and  � � � � �lb variable annuity� lutheran brotherhood issued between  and  � � � � �tlic variable annuity� thrivent life insurance company issued between  and  the exchange offer is available only for current contracts under which we have not yet started making annuity payments each eligible contract owner may exchange his or her current contract for the flexible premium deferred variable annuity described in the prospectus that accompanies this description �new contract� before deciding to exchange your contract for a new contract you should carefully consider their differences the new contract offers an enhanced living benefit the guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit not available under the current contracts the new contract also offers another enhanced living benefit the return protection allocation which is already available in the  thrivent variable annuity so if you are considering exchanging your current contract for a new contract in order to get an enhanced living benefit also consider some of the other important differences that are discussed below please contact your thrivent financial representative or call the service center at  for assistance differences between contracts salessurrender charges like the current contracts the new contract imposes no sales charge at the time of purchase frontend sales charge the new contract imposes a contingent deferred sales charge surrender charge that is the same as the aal variable annuity surrender charge but higher and longer in duration than that of the other current contracts the new contract surrender charge begins at  in the first year and declines by  each contract year until the beginning of the th contract year after which no surrender charge applies the new contracts waive surrender charges under more circumstances than do the current contracts see the summary comparison chart for more details no surrender charge will apply upon an exchange of contracts pursuant to this exchange offer in addition as part of the exchange offer the new contracts will be deemed to have been issued on the same issue date as the current contract for purposes of computing the applicable surrender charge should you choose to cancel the new contract under the right to cancel provision the exchange will not have been completed under this program any surrender charge that applied to the prior contract will be assessed thriventcom other charges prior to the annuity date the new contract imposes a current mortality and expense risk charge of  for the first seven years of the contract and a maximum of  thereafter the current charge after seven years is  on and after the annuity date the new contract imposes a mortality and expense risk charge of  the aal variable annuity imposes a  mortality and expense risk charge during the life of the contract the other current contracts impose a current  mortality and expense risk charge during the life of the contract with a maximum charge of  additional charges are associated with optional death and living benefits that are offered under the contracts see the summary comparison chart for more details the new contract imposes an annual administrative charge that is deducted each contract anniversary from the accumulated value if the accumulated value on that day is less than  and the sum of all premiums paid less all partial surrenders made on the contract is less than  and the sum of premiums paid less partial surrenders made during the contract year just ended is less than  the administrative charge is  or if less  of the accumulated value on the contract anniversary the current contracts other than the  thrivent variable annuity each impose an annual administrative charge on different terms see the summary comparison chart for more details the  thrivent variable annuity does not impose an administrative charge the current and new contracts impose a transfer charge of  after  free transfers per contract year the new contract also imposes a commuted value charge for surrenders of life income settlement options if we are making payments under a life income settlement option with a guaranteed period the contract owner may elect to receive a lump sum instead of continuing payments under the life income option unless the life income election was irrevocable we will calculate the commuted value of the payments remaining in the guaranteed period by using an interest rate that is  higher than the interest rate used to determine the income payable under the life income settlement option investment options the current and new contracts generally offer the same variable subaccount options in addition the new contract offers the same fixed account options as the  thrivent variable annuity and offers market value adjusted �mva� fixed account options that are not available under the aal lb and tlic variable annuities the other fixed account options are generally the same under the current and new contracts except that the tlic fixed account option offers a minimum  guaranteed interest rate annuity options the current and new contracts offer some of the same annuity payment options namely interestonly income singlelife income fixed period and specified amount jointlife income is offered in the current and new contracts except the lb and tlic variable annuity contracts the aal variable annuity contract only offers fixed annuity payments the other current contracts offer annuity payments on both a fixed and variable basis as does the new contract the  thrivent variable annuity and the new contract both offer variable annuity payments using an assumed investment rate �air� of   and  the tlic and lb variable annuities offer variable annuity payments using an air of  see the summary comparison chart for more information death benefit options the current and new contracts offer the same basic death benefit namely the greater of accumulated value or return of premiums less withdrawal the current contracts other than the  thrivent variable annuity offer an enhanced death benefit namely the maximum anniversary death benefit �madb� in the case of the aal variable annuity and madb with sixthyear reset in the case of the tlic variable annuity and lb variable annuity the  thrivent variable annuity and the new contracts offer several enhanced death benefit options including madb premium accumulation death benefit �padb� and earnings addition death benefit �eadb� there is no separate charge for the enhanced death benefit under the aal lb or tlic variable annuities the charges for the enhanced death benefit options are generally higher under the new contract as compared to the  thrivent variable annuity however if you add either the guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit or the return protection allocation you cannot also choose the abovementioned enhanced death benefit options except you may add the madb if you also have the return protection allocation see the summary comparison chart for more information guaranteed living benefits the  thrivent variable annuity and the new contract offer a return protection allocation �rpa� which is an optional benefit that guarantees the future value of amounts allocated to specified subaccounts for either a sevenyear or tenyear period the rpa charge is  the other current contracts do not offer this optional benefit the new contract also offers the guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit �glwb� the current contracts do not offer the glwb the glwb is an optional rider benefit that you may select at the time the contract is issued or thereafter the glwb allows you to surrender an amount up to the guaranteed withdrawal amount �gwa� with no surrender charge for as long as the glwb rider is in effect under the glwb rider if your contract terminates because the gwa that is surrendered exceeds the accumulated value we will continue to pay you the gwa each year for as long as the annuitant is alive under a settlement agreement that we will issue the glwb is subject to a maximum annual risk charge of  the current glwb charge is  �   and  if you select the moderately aggressive moderate or moderately conservative allocations respectively please refer to the flexible premium deferred variable annuity prospectus for more details partial surrenders and the effects on death benefits a partial surrender will reduce the contract�s guaranteed death benefit for the aal lb and tlic variable annuities the guaranteed death benefit will be reduced by the amount of the partial surrender for the new contract and the  thrivent variable annuity a partial surrender will reduce the guaranteed death benefit by the same proportion as the reduction in account value guaranteed annuity rates both the new and current variable annuity contracts contain guaranteed annuity payment rates guaranteed annuity payment rates provide a minimum monthly income that can be established from the annuity�s accumulated value however mortality rates have generally improved and interest rates may have changed since the guarantees were developed for the current contracts as such the guaranteed annuity rates in the new contracts may be less favorable than those in the current contracts specifically the mortality and interest rate basis for the guaranteed annuity payments for each annuity contract in any case for all contracts the actual annuity payment that is paid to the contract owner is the greater of the guaranteed annuity payment and the annuity payment based on current mortality and interest rate expectations generally annuity payments based on current mortality and interest rate expectations are often higher than the guaranteed annuity payments see the summary comparison chart under �settlement options� for more details tax considerations we will impose no fee or charge in connection with an exchange please see the discussion of �federal tax matters� in the prospectus for the new contract regarding the federal income tax treatment of the new contract compensation we do not compensate our financial representatives for initiating the exchange of a current contract for a new contract however we continue to compensate on any additional monies placed into the new contract please see the discussion of �sales and other agreements� in the prospectus for the new contract regarding commissions availability of exchange offer if you wish to exchange your current contract for a new contract please contact your thrivent financial representative or the service center at  generally the new contract will be appropriate for you only if you wish to elect the guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit or the return protection allocation available under the new contract the return protection allocation is already available for the  variable annuity there would be no need to exchange your  variable annuity for the new contract if you only wanted the return protection allocation partial exchanges are not permitted and once you have accepted an exchange offer any exchange back to the current contract will not be permitted should you choose to cancel the new contract under the right to cancel provision the exchange will not have been completed under this program any surrender charge that applied to the prior contract will be assessed we reserve the right to terminate or suspend the exchange offer at any time this exchange offer may not be available in all states if you decide to exchange your current contract for a new contract the accumulated value under your new contract immediately after the exchange will be the same as it was under your current contract immediately prior to the exchange however if you have a  thrivent variable annuity and you have money allocated to a fixed period allocation there may be a market value adjustment on the accumulated value in the fixed period allocation if you decide to exchange your current contract for a new contract the market value adjustment will be applied and could result in the accumulated value under the new contract being less than or greater than the accumulated value under the current contract summary comparisons following is a chart that provides a summary comparison of some of the important features of the current and new contracts the chart is intended to highlight features that you may find important in deciding whether to accept the exchange offer described herein the chart is not intended to be a substitute
