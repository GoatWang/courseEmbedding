announcement which was released earlier today and is posted in the investor relations section of our website at omnicellcom our prepared remarks will also be posted in this same section let me now turn over the call to randall randall lipps good afternoon everyone were excited to discuss our first quarter results as well as our progress on the xt series introduction following the announcement at ashp in december last year of the new xt series we received great responses and have had good momentum among both existing and new customers i want to summarize our progress in three specific areas first we are winning in the market place across omnicell’s comprehensive medication management platform secondly we have good traction on xt with strong customer interest and the xt series is received with enthusiasm by new customers and by existing customers looking to add xt to their medication management platform and third we made great progress on conversion of g our older series and acudose quotes and backlog to xt first it’s clear that we are winning in the market place during the first quarter we had a strong new and competitive conversions rate of  of bookings this is a great indicator of the strength of the business around  of those were competitive conversions and the remainder were from greenfield customers who had never automated before we believe that these new account wins combined with our installed customer base gives us a robust platform for the future growth driven by expansion replacement and upgrade sales as well as cross selling opportunities across our product portfolio and also our first quarter bookings are ahead of our internal plan secondly the xt series is received with enthusiasm by new and existing customers as of last week we have delivered the xt series product to approximately  sites and the xt series are live at over  sites both numbers are growing every day both our internal and external surveys show very strong positive customer feedback one of the top benefits of xt according to users was the increased speed of the xt series the reduction in time in the workflow is returning significant time to nurses of course about  of nursing time is spent on medication management so you can see why this time savings is significant a leading medical center in the united states recently commented that xt is a night and day experience compared to our last system from another vendor everyone loves the extra capacity the large screen the intuitive design the clean design and the ability to authenticate users in and out of the system very quickly has created much better work flows for our users third we are progressing well on our conversion of g and acudoserx quotes and backlog and are ramping up the xt series revenue specifically weve converted the vast majority of all g and acudose quotes and yearend backlog to xt bookings and backlog there is a portion of the g and acudose backlog that won’t convert as those customers have chosen to complete their installations with g or acudose customers in our yearend backlog and pipeline were prepared for a g installation while we have redirected these customers to the benefits of xt and removed supply chain and paperwork issues we assumed that these customers would move through the process as quickly as they did with g frames however we have learned that customers want additional time to maximize their xt deployments especially with respect to optimizing their use of xt’s additional capacity configurations and feature benefits as a result of our expected conversion of our g and acudose bookings in backlog to xt bookings the xt manufacturing and installation ramp up we have anticipated two quarters or six months of transition disruption starting from december last year through april while the conversion has improved and continues to improve we now do see some continued residual impact of these dynamics through the second quarter ie through june out of the total adc frame revenue we are expecting the percentage of xt series frames revenue we expect to increase from around  in the first quarter to over  of xt revenues in the second quarter then to around   around  in the third quarter and over  in the fourth quarter and we will report this metric during the quarterly earnings calls this year to demonstrate the execution of the xt series roll out and adoption for the first quarter the nongaap revenue was  million within the guidance range provided in our fourth quarter results earnings call and essentially at consensus combined with good cost management and a tax favorability nongaap eps was  and that was above our guidance range and above consensus in the last number of years weve successfully grown the business by implementing three scalable growth strategies growth through the differentiated omnicell platform growth in new markets growth and growth via acquisitions now for  consecutive years we have received the top honors from klas the prestigious thirdparty rating organization for  consecutive years we have increased our market share and gained new thought leader customers every quarter and in almost every significant geography together with our customers we are consistently delivering state of the art medication management automation and workflow efficiency for caregivers and better healthcare outcomes for patients now in  we continued to experience great wins and added notable customers to our omnicell family under the first strategic pillar of differentiated platform with several large competitive conversions we estimated that we gained further market share in the first quarter of  a continuation of the market share gain trend and momentum we have experienced for many years in the first quarter we had some great wins with prominent new customers as well as significant deals with existing customers including mercy health ohio saint luke’s health system and north memorial health now mercy health ohio a hospital healthcare system serving ohio and kentucky has selected the company’s automated medication dispensing solutions including the new xt series to be installed across their facilities as one of the largest health systems in the us serving approximately six million patients each year mercy is looking for a vendor partner with technology that would streamline workflows and increase integration between the facilities saint luke’s health system a notforprofit healthcare system based in kansas city missouri will incorporate the omnicell performance center an integrated software and services offering to drive improved pharmacy operations and reduce costs saint luke’s health system will incorporate omnicell’s technology for its automated dispensing cabinets anesthesia workstations central pharmacy technologies and diversion detection software minneapolisbased north memorial health has selected multiple medication management and analytics solutions for both north memorial health hospital and maple grove hospital reinforcing their commitment to patient safety while enabling each hospital to more efficiently manage medications north memorial is implementing omnicell solutions across its facilities products include automated carousels and controlled substance management system omnicell xt automated dispensing system with anywhere rn xt anesthesia workstation and epic interoperability package with a focus on improving safety north memorial also selected omnicell analytics to gain insights into potential drug diversion activity these strategic wins in the market place are being driven by the strength of our overall portfolio and differentiated platform our second strategic pillar of expanding into new markets also fueled growth in the last several years and we believe sets us up well for growth in the coming years internationally in the largest single deal for omnicell’s iv robots outside of the united states invotek our distributor for turkey has purchased a sizable number of omnicell’s ivstation onco and ivstation robots these robots are set to be installed in various hospitals providing safe accurate and efficient iv preparation completerx a leading independent provider of pharmacy management and consulting services to health systems across the country has selected omnicell xt series solutions to support behavior health facilities in massachusetts having previously implemented omnicell’s adherence solutions completerx looked to omnicell to provide the latest technology quality service and longterm products for medication automation our third strategic pillar of expanding our presence and relevance through acquisitions has also continued to deliver great results the aesynt integration is progressing well the product portfolio integration is ahead of schedule with the market introduction of acudose on xt announced earlier this week that means that current acudoserx customers can add on xt equipment directly onto their system without making modifications the cost synergies are as expected already we are seeing good crossselling momentum within the total product portfolio and combined customer base specifically for our iv and performance center solutions in april we completed the acquisition of inpharmics inpharmics currently serves more than  hospitals with tools that analyze drug cost by patient diagnosis thereby supporting the pharmacy’s clinical activities while helping to optimize supply chain performance and comply with drug pedigree regulations the inpharmics solution adds clinical and compliance analytics to our performance center offering positioning omnicell as the partner of choice for health systems looking to drive improvement across all facets of the medication management we believe our hard work over the years and the execution of our threeleg strategy laid the foundation for our success historically and sets us up for continued future growth and scale in today’s evolving healthcare environment we remain focused on our mission to change the practice of healthcare with solutions that improve patient and provider outcomes with that let me turn it over to peter for some financial updates peter kuipers thank you randall our first quarter  gaap revenues of  million was down  from the same quarter last year and down  sequentially driven by the product transition and related ramp up of the xt series product launch as randall referred to earlier in this call the announcement of the omnicell xt series does result in some disruption for two quarters which we see continuing through the second quarter earnings per share in accordance with gaap were a loss of  which is down from a gaap loss of  in the first quarter of  gaap gross margin was at  for the quarter in addition to gaap financial results we report our results on a nongaap basis which excludes stock compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions onetime acquisition related expenses and the acquisition accounting impacts related to deferred revenue inventory fair value adjustments and severance and other expenses related to restructuring we use nongaap financial statements in addition to gaap financial statements because we believe it is useful for investors to understand acquisition amortization related costs and noncash stock compensation expenses that are a component of our reported results as well as onetime events such as the gain on avantec investment in q and onetime acquisition related expenses a full reconciliation of our gaap to nongaap results is included in our first quarter earnings press release and is posted on our website our first quarter  nongaap revenues of  million were down  from the same quarter last year and down  sequentially driven by the xt series market introduction and revenue ramp up on a nongaap basis earnings per share were  in the first quarter of  above consensus and above our guidance range and down  from the same quarter last year and down  sequentially nongaap gross margin was  in the first quarter and we expect gross margin to steadily increase through the year as the xt series rollout ramps up and we get scale efficiencies in manufacturing and installation cost the first quarter gross margin was also impacted by cost to expedite shipments of xt products to customers nongaap adjusted ebitda was  million for the first quarter of  our business is also reported in segments consisting of automation and analytics and medication adherence automation and analytics consists of our g acudose earliergeneration and xt automated dispensing cabinets anesthesia workstations central pharmacy omnicell supply omnicell analytics and mach robotic dispensing systems our acquisitions of avantec mach and aesynt are also included in this segment the medication adherence segment consists of all adherence package consumables which are now branded suremed and equipment used by pharmacists to create adherence packages our acquisitions of mts medication technologies surgichem and ateb inc are included in the medication adherence segment as a reminder we report certain corporate expenses that cannot be easily applied to either segment separately on a segment basis our automation and analytics segment contributed  million in gaap revenue in the first quarter of  down from  million in the first quarter of  driven by the start of the xt series launch  million of gaap operating income this quarter compares to a  million gaap operating income for the same quarter last year  million of nongaap operating profit compares to  million last year the medication adherence segment contributed  million of gaap revenue to the quarter compared to  million in the first quarter of  the gaap operating loss of  million compares to a  million gaap operating profit a year ago nongaap operating income was  million in the first quarter compared to  million of nongaap operating income a year ago the nongaap common expenses were  million compared to  million in the first quarter of  the nongaap operating margin was around break even for the first quarter including aesynt and ateb integration cost excluding the aesynt and ateb integration costs of approximately  million in the quarter the nongaap operating margin was around  for the first quarter in the first quarter of  our cash decreased from  million to  million after paying down our term loan and revolving debt by  million within the quarter the first quarter  cash flow from operations of  million was strong and driven by strong accounts receivable collections and an increase in ap and deferred revenue partially offset by an inventory buildup of xt for future quarter installs as of march   we had  million of outstanding funded debt and our loan leverage measured as outstanding total funded loan balance over the last  months of ebitda was  accounts receivable days sales outstanding were  for the first quarter up one day from the fourth quarter despite the lower sequential sales for context our standard customer agreements specify that for equipment sales the company invoices  of the contract value at shipment date we review the collectability of our receivables regularly and we do not believe that the fluctuations in dso are indicative of a change in our rate of bad debt inventories at march   were  million and are up  million from last quarter driven by an inventory build for future quarter installs our headcount was  down from  per year end driven by the reduction in force action we executed in the first quarter during the first quarter we executed well on a number of drivers underpinning the dynamics of the xt series product introduction we converted the vast majority of all g and acudose quotes and yearend backlog to xt quotes bookings and backlog we have ramped up manufacturing for the xt series after adding a second shift as randall mentioned earlier as of last week we have delivered xt series to approximately  sites and the xt series is live at over  sites both numbers are growing every day we executed on cost actions including a position reduction in force and general hiring delays the majority of the reduction in force over various locations was completed in the first quarter of  and also enables the creation of the centers of excellence to achieve cost synergies contemplated in the acquisition of aesynt as part of the next phase of the integration of the acquisition of aesynt we are progressing well on the creation of the following centers of excellence for product development engineering and manufacturing first the point of use center of excellence in california the robotics and central pharmacy coe in pittsburgh pennsylvania and lastly the medication adherence consumables coe in st petersburg florida the second through fourth quarter of  dynamics are expected to be as follows first the acudose on xt launch which we announced last week this product launch allows the full aesynt customer base to benefit from the xt series product advantages while continuing to use their existing acudose software secondly we expect to improve xt production cost accelerating bookings growth and accelerating organic revenue growth during the second through fourth quarters of  we are taking the following actions were implementing xt cost of goods sold reductions as revenue ramps we continued cost controls and were implementing the coes mentioned earlier although the first quarter bookings were ahead of our internal plan as randall mentioned we do see some continued disruption impact on revenue of the ramp up of the xt series product introduction in the full second quarter we do believe that there will be a partial catch up of these customer deployment and configuration installation timing delays on revenue in the second half of the year but not a full catch up as a result for the second quarter of  we expect nongaap revenue to be between  million and  million we expect the second quarter of  nongaap earnings to be between  and  per share as discussed in previous earnings calls it’s important to note that from time to time installation completion timing on specifically bigger projects can impact revenue and earnings in a given quarter but we don’t expect such quarterly fluctuations to impact the growth rate measured over multiple quarters for the second half of  we expect total nongaap revenue to be between  million and  million representing an approximate organic revenue growth rate when using the midpoint for the second half of  we expect total nongaap earnings to be between  and  per share this represents a  per share nongaap eps runrate when annualizing the second half of  using the midpoint of the guidance range although the first quarter bookings were ahead of the internal plan at this time we are not updating our product bookings guidance and we continue to expect the  product bookings to be between  million and  million we expect nongaap revenue to be between  million and  million for total  and we expect  nongaap earnings to be between  and  per share as we are offsetting part of the lower guided revenue range with cost actions and efficiencies we expect nongaap operating margins for  to be approximately  including integration cost for aesynt and ateb excluding the integration cost for the aesynt and ateb we expect nongaap operating margin for  to be between  and  given the ramp up of the xt series revenue and profitability through the year in  described earlier in this call we expect the nongaap margin for the fourth quarter in  including integration cost for aesynt and ateb to be at approximately between  to  in line with our longterm financial model excluding the integration cost for aesynt and ateb we expect the nongaap operating margin for the fourth quarter in  to be above  when reviewing  its important to note a couple of items included in the  guidance first of all for  our nongaap expected results include approximately  million of integration costs for aesynt and ateb that we do not adjust for based on our nongaap policy these integration costs directly impacting nongaap operating margins and nongaap eps mostly consist of integration related it expenses integration team and project cost cost related to the implementation of sarbanes oxley cost related to tax restructuring and accelerated product development integration costs in  we are expecting second year cost synergies of around  million as we have demonstrated in the past we are confident to achieve our  nongaap operating margin target over time after integrating the acquired business and getting full benefit of the scale of the combined business lastly for  we expect interest expense related to the senior secured credit facility used to finance the aesynt and ateb acquisitions to be around  million or equivalent to a nongaap eps headwind of around  finally were assuming an annual average effective tax rate of  on gaap earnings on a combined basis to round on our update ill hand the call back to randall randall lipps thanks peter just in quick summary we continue to win in the market place and i want to make it clear that we talk a lot about xt but as we approach our customers we’re not just talking about the difference that xt makes we’re talking about our entire platform and as we’ve seen the cost of the pharmacy operations for providers make substantially over the last few years and many of the years doubledigit growth in fact the single growing item line item in the provider network we’ve seen pharmacy medication management move from more of a tactical concern to a strategic approach for these facilities so when we go in and discuss with either new or existing customer were talking about a strategy over the next four to five years to take that customer and digitize all of their manual processes and then be able to rationalize it our offerings like the performance center and also address areas of automation like iv which are significant costs for the institution and of course xt is part of that  a big part of the platform but the conversations that we’re having are very strategic they’re very longterm oriented and they’re about optimizing the movement of drugs across a multiplicity of sites and the whole continuum of care with many of these provider networks having their own insurance program for their own employees as a test of population health which dovetails right in with our medication adherence product offering so we have this total broadbased solution set that resonates with where these provider networks are and where they’re going and of course the xt is the big financial piece that we talk a lot about but the whole platform has become a strategic sale that impacts customers for the long term and we’re really excited as we bring this almost new broad platform with aesynt and the xt series that weve been able to add has just changed the discussion and then as we move forward it is why we’re winning in the market place so with that ill finish our prepared remarks and turn it over for questions operator can you help us out there questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of jamie stockton with wells fargo jamie stockton hey good morning thanks for taking my questions i guess maybe the first one randy i assume the answer to this is going to be that its negligible but bd was talking about changes that theyre making to the way that they account for pyxis they indicated that there wasn’t going to be a change in kind of the cash flow payment from their customers so i assume that there is not going to be any impact in the marketplace from what theyre doing but can you confirm that randall lipps yeah i think that the customers are picking us because we have the best product in the marketplace the broadest platform we have the best technology we have the best customer experience the best install experience we have the best integration experience so when you put all these things together customers need to make choices that are going to take them to the place they need to go in order to be successful with medication management and cost and the way you finance the price for all these types of equipment is important but i wouldnt say it is the issue that makes someone choose us or not choose us we aren’t the cheapest but we are the best and as i said in just my last remarks people are choosing strategic ways making sure they can manage the future not a financing vehicle i guess and i would also say that most of the market has moved away from continuous payment  years ago  of the market was getting some kind of financial construct from their vendor today two thirds of the market either purchases their product direct or uses  the financial institution uses their own banking or financing vehicle to buy equipment because they are so large they have the leverage and they dont need financing from a vendor so i think its counter to what the industry has moved to and i think that many of the things that we do have changed the marketplace for instance you pay for our service and you get consistent software upgrades for free but it comes with the service you dont have to  you have to pay some big amount every year in order to get those thats built into our business model thats hard to compete with and thats because our systems are back to compatible and the software integrates and allows people to continuously improve the medication med platform without having a large amount of disruption a long answer to your question but yes i dont see any slowdown in our momentum in the marketplace because of that jamie stockton okay thats great and then maybe just two quick other ones ill get out both to you at the same time services seem to be pretty stronger in the quarter any more color on whats going on there and then in the medication adherence business it looks like opex was pretty high and it really hit the bottom line of that segment can you give us any more color on whats happening there peter kuipers so jamie this is peter so what you see there really from a sequential perspective is really the full quarter impact of the ateb acquisition the leading software provider that we required in december most of that revenue is service revenue and you see the opex falling back for the first quarter here in the segment so thats mostly ateb jamie stockton both issues both are stronger service revenue and also the impact on medication adherence profitability was… peter kuipers yes thats included in that segment yes jamie stockton thats great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mohan naidu with oppenheimermy mohan naidu thanks for taking my questions randy going back to your booking comments can you comment on your win rate has xt influencing your win rate so far for you guys randall lipps yeah i would say that xt is  as customers look at particularly whether its a new competitive conversion they want to get on the front end of the new cycle of technology thats the base technology for the entire platform so its more of a compelling reason i think to go with us as well as new customers i mean existing customers who are looking to make big strategic moves like st lukes that was an existing customer i think its over  hospitals they had the acudose system they didnt  they weren’t required to upgrade all their acudose systems to xt but they did but they didnt just but xt that wasn’t the driving force behind the transaction it was the fact that they were going to take performance center they were going to reduce some workflow processing in their pharmacy and put a whole strategy of deploying this over the next few years to make this a much more effective process and system and integrate it with their epic system in a lot deeper fashion so those were the driving decision points that made a current customer retire current equipment that was aged but still useful but moved to xt mohan naidu got it got it on the revenue guidance cut just want to dig in a little bit there is it the primary  i guess the primary cause of that is it that implementations that customers are getting delayed or getting elongated because customers want to extend or why is the delay even though you have the inventory in hand right now randall lipps well we had three reasons for the delay previously one was manufacturing constraint paperwork had to be repapered for the xt model numbers and as well that also included the configuration now weve gotten through most of that but as we got to the very end and even had  we have no manufacturing constraints and we have some paperwork constraints but the main issue is that hospitals that were taking g have agreed to take xt and have xt maybe even sitting at their sites are looking at reconfiguring xt and redeploying it in a different fashion because of the different options we offer with xt that g was not able to offer those additional loops if you will of consideration have caused us to push out some of the xt revenue from q to the second half of the year but as we get through june almost all of that is gone and by the end of the year all were shipping is xt and most of the orders that in the second half of the year theyre coming out of our backlog more and more those orders will have originated as original xt orders and the customer wouldve been sold and configured originally in xt and not g so we dont have those disruption issues are negligible as we get toward the end of june or very little as we move past june and your  all your backlog that you have that youre installing is really just coming out of pure originated xt product mohan naidu got you one last question on the revenue guidance for the second half of the year with  plus growth how much visibility do you have on that i guess  is that  do you have enough visibility right now that you have enough xt coming in that you can do that growth right now peter kuipers yes so the  is bookings right and then the  is revenue so we have bottom of rollup from installation perspective that we feel confident in specifically the third quarter revenue build up and then weve got some good visibility in the fourth quarter as well but then of course because of that as you move through the quarters as far bookings we feel very confident we noted both randall and i noticed that were ahead for bookings for the first quarter for our internal plan so we do have the bookings its just a matter of the year the final config and installation timing so we feel good about the total momentum of the business and were winning in the marketplace randall lipps we feel very confident about second half of the year and particularly the third quarter just because we  even if we had some issues we now have enough to maneuvering room with enough customers to try to install on a regular more consistent basis to get back to our revenue that we should have flowing through the company on a consistent basis mohan naidu thats great thank you very much for taking my question operator your next question comes from the line of matt hewitt with craighallum capital matt hewitt good morning gentlemen and thank you for the update and congratulations on the progress with xt randall lipps thank you matt hewitt a couple questions first i am trying to understand the delta in the adjusted earnings guidance this morning so you just beat with q you indicated in your prepared remarks that gross margins are expected to ramp over the course of the year which i would think would offset some of the change in the revenue guidance whats the delta that were missing or that i am missing with eps peter kuipers yes let me walk you through so in the plan of course in the original guidance we also assumed like you can see in the earlier earnings call we assumed an increase or improvement to the gross margin as we scale and get efficiencies both from a cost reduction perspective and supply chain and overhead cost absorption so that path that trend hasnt changed let me walk you high level from the guidance that we gave before so the midpoint of the guidance that we gave before was  million of revenue and the midpoint of eps was  we lowered the revenue guidance in the midpoint by  million which equates to roughly  down so it will be at  but then we have additional cost actions of about  getting us to roughly a  midpoint matt hewitt okay thank you and then regarding the bookings growth  or over  in the second half of the year historically on your conference calls youve talked about how bookings translates into revenues within a six to ninemonth period and im curious as we look out to  and im not asking for guidance necessarily but historically youve talked about that trend in revenues so if you got over  bookings growth in the back half of this year that would imply over  revenue growth in the second half of  does that historical patterns still hold peter kuipers well in general it does because of the math as well right so if you look at our revenue guidance for the second half youre looking at the  million revenue quarters there right so it means that well use some of the backlog that weve build up as well in the last couple of months and some of the bookings in the third quarter will turn into revenue in the last month of the third quarter and then also in the fourth quarter so its not for one but definitely its a growing trend randall lipps yeah  to  is historically where weve been and i think thats a good way to look at business even though were not giving any specific guidance for next year and i think we also have some really cool products that are recognized ratably theyre not recognizable once like for performance center the saas model some of the iv deployments that were doing or the rise model are recognized ratably so good profitable growth but it doesnt flow out of backlog as quick so i think the way were looking the way that weve traditionally looked at the business in a healthy format the  to  is always a good way to look at the business as well as we do  we are seeing a really nice pipeline growing of replacements this is the new market we have not had a lot of thats toward the back of the end of the year because we just introduced xt in december but weve already had some nice sales that we would not had if we didnt have xt and thats only going to grow as we move forward and give time for customers to get into their budgets and their pipeline for the year so we should feel confident about the  to  over the long run matt hewitt okay great and one last one for me and then ill hop back in the queue can we get an update on the performance center may be the number of customers that have implemented or contracted obviously there was strong growth right out of the gates with the first quarter but if we can get an update where you are today that would be helpful randall lipps well i would just say that we had record bookings of performance center in q it was a key piece of technology and service integrated into almost many of our large single orders that we had this quarter we are progressing very quickly because it is becoming a key driver in the total platform sale i know were  i dont know the exact number and i actually know the exact number of customer but its not single digits or anything but i think whats most exciting is that we thought that this would be more of an aftermarket sale after people had deployed their technology and its now part of the upfront sale in a major conversion or major new cycle of products matt hewitt okay great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of sean wieland with piper jaffray sean wieland thank you good morning can you give us some examples of how a customer is looking to redeploy xp in a different fashion than g and how many  exactly how many customers are rethinking their deployment in this way randall lipps well theres a couple of things one is that when you reconfigure the xt you have a lot more options to more meds to more locations and when you move more meds to more locations you might move from  of the meds flowing through the systems and  flowing from the pharmacy to get a  flow up the floor now the expanded capacity without changing the footprint you can move to  to  of the workflow up to whats called a cart less format and most of the hospitals that have not been in this format have had physical constraints on the space of the product and so this is a big change in workflow because now nursing will spend more time getting the drugs out of the system instead of having it delivered to them the  delivered from the pharmacy on a per patient basis so now when you move to  to  you deploy different software features different policies you change the workflow of the pharmacy on how often its delivered up to the floors and then you drive nursing to do more of their activity like anywhere were in directly through the system to prep their orders coming out of the automated dispensing and using it as a single point of operation as opposed to just a  to  workflow sean wieland so would you characterize it as most of the g to xt conversions are going through this kind of workflow change or dial it into a number of percentage randall lipps well thats probably the primary issue is just configuration because there isn’t a good one to one transfer or one drawer on the g it looks like one drawer on the xt there is such significant difference that it does require some decisionmaking there also some other xt issues in california you have to have oshpd recertified your earthquake plate on some new construction so the g earthquake plate is already approved but the xt is approved from the omnicell side but the hospital now has to go get its approval for the xt earthquake plate so again thats only because of xt its not because if it was a g kind of deal it would go through and wouldnt be a problem and even though there was extended time for the xt to get through some of these things theres just enough of these things that have pushed enough of the installs into the second half of the year that we were hoping to getting done in q sean wieland all right thats super helpful just one more clarification so that  in q to  to  to  as you laid out tell me again exactly what those numbers represent randall lipps thats just the  if you look at the adc installations dispensing systems c and xt so in q just of the adc installations  were g  were xt as we move to the second quarter  will be xt and  will be g and then we believe  and then first deal xt revenues essentially basically by the end of the year everything is pretty much xt sean wieland okay one more what percentage of xt shipments today so far have been to replace g versus replace acudose versus net new randall lipps well i think  well i dont know about the shipments but on the booking side i would say weve built a very healthy line and i think that we see that customers are excited about moving forward with xt the large customers especially are looking places to deploy xt so they can get a good understanding of it so that as they prepare the budgets in the following years they know how they want to deploy it and how they want to change the configuration of those things i havent had any customer say well im not going to go to xt eventually or i dont want to go to xt eventually its just about matters of time and if you just look at the numbers the numbers and the size of our installed base or take acudose thats a third of our installed base they probably had more of an urgency to switch to xt because they know that their acudose is going to be form factor is going to be sun setting there quickly and probably knew that since the acquisition a year ago sean wieland okay but my question was what percentage of the bookings xt bookings have been to replace to upgrade acudose versus upgrade g versus net new customers randall lipps okay didnt listen very well i think that probably more than half have been acudose and that when im talking about replacements less on the omnicell side and then  on omnicell and then probably from this date going forward there is very little new g orders we still have that line going but most of the g thats being installed has already been built and its about to be shipped to customers for q and q so that product line is not very large on the manufacturing side sean wieland okay thank you for taking all my questions operator your next question comes from the line of raymond myers with benchmark raymond myers great thank you and randy i want to continue on previous questions enough savings that were receiving with performance center can you discuss what that is and you have experienced what the recent trend has been randall lipps i think there is a nice roi if you look at it just from the roi of the cost rational of that rationalization of medication inventories across many multisite we say a minimum of  of the entire pharmacy spend is continuing in that fashion but there are other things that we are adding to the performance center that continue to help meet regulatory compliance and save cost along  b this new pedigree thing from pharmex is all about regulatory compliance and so theres  by having the performance center platform not only help save rationalize cost optimize the use and workflow of the system on a realtime basis but the ability to meet the new regulatory regulations without massive amounts across the deploying complex systems and to continue to deploy  b which is a huge cost saver for these institutions is another reason that people have gone with the performance center raymond myers okay sounds great and then to be clear the timing of your xt disruption i believe youre exiting now through june from april so just two months is that the primary reason for the adjustment in full year revenue guidance or are there other factors as well randall lipps thats the whole reason its just the xt launch because of the change in what additional requirements that some xt sites are requiring either through configuration or certification or different cycles of approval even though its the same software it may want to have to go in a look at it again and verify windows  because xt runs on windows  so theres just these extra additional steps that dont have anything to do with manufacturing constraints dont have anything to do with paperwork constraints but do have to do with its a new model and its landing on site and before you can install it we want to have some extra reviews of the product or actions peter kuipers so to summarize so we have the bookings we had our internal plan for the first quarter on bookings its really a matter of timing that those bookings which are noncancelable commitments or further into revenue fee and installation and to summarize it randy said we see because its a new product that customers want to make sure they optimize all the additional benefits that the xt series has and that takes a little bit more time than we initially had thought raymond myers okay understood last question is on the iv robots can you discuss the customer adoption of that and has your view changed about the potential for the product over the next few years randall lipps no its only getting more exciting i think what we see in the iv robotics is still an emergingmarket but the more we deploy the more local markets go by and see somebody elses robot and then want to move toward that and i think we see big good success there weve owned aesynt for about a year a little more than a longer in a year that was a new product to add to our sales persons bag and now were seeing the results of that product as the pipeline has been built up over the year and now its coming out of the funnel as new sales so thats a very exciting product and between performance center and iv those tend to be incorporated in all our new or larger sales in almost every case and we have a lot of individual hospitals making singular purchases of our iv system and that is resulting in first time business relationships with a lot of new customers that weve never had before raymond myers thats great thanks randy and peter randall lipps because were the market leader obviously operator your final question comes from the line of gene mannheimer with dougherty  company gene mannheimer thanks and good morning randall lipps hey gene gene mannheimer question is i guess how long in the future will you be continuing to support assuming a long quarters youre still getting installed there and how much of the g phase of the folks that never migrated over to g are candidates to xt some numbers around that would be great randall lipps yeah i think just the matter of getting our gross margin back to where it needs to be will require us to consolidate to a single line of automated dispensing and as you see the xt getting to  by the end of the year i think that points to a roadmap that says g and the acudose have pretty short fuses on it this year before thats all we ship for either customer base and then i think in the g world were already addressing those sites as weve launched the xt we are asking those sites to move quickly along and a lot of those most likely will move directly from the g to xt gene mannheimer so there are about  of those or give us a sense of maybe the magnitude of that randall lipps its not  i dont think its more than  of our  a little bit i am guessing less than  of our installed base but it is probably a significant number when you add up all the units we have out there but as far as the percentage of our customer base it’s not that big gene mannheimer got you and secondly randy or peter what was the ateb contribution in the quarter and would medication adherence have grown on an organic basis net of that randall lipps its about  million we guided last year and when we did the acquisition it was about a  million business so i think we said  million so we find that about  million i think its about  million for the quarter assuming its a fairly  its a lot of service right software so its ratably over times about between  million and  million i would say for this quarter if you carve that out you can calculate the percentage gene mannheimer okay very good thanks guys and happy birthday randy randall lipps oh thank you thank you gene and finally i just want to close and say that look this xt thing is we havent done as good job of rolling thing out or predicting how we roll out as we thought but were coming to the end of these issues and that is the only issue that is disrupting any of our business that we have going on here i think on the other side of the booking side of the business we are winning major deals in every geographic market in the us and every time you do want to that it just creates more momentum for the company when you when wellstar in georgia every georgia by the end wants to know why are people moving to wellstar and so why are they moving to omnicell so the company has significant momentum in the marketplace the xt series having the best products the broadest product lines these things continue to set us up for some fantastic growth and even to the point where we see these provider networks looking at med adherence and taking some of our med adherence products and bring that into the product offering for these folks as they try to improve the outcomes for patients its really satisfying to see the impact that we are making in the lives of patients and the way that providers can key into that success again thanks for joining us and again just want to continue to shout out the employee base its an acquisition xt rollout everybody is running pretty hard and i just want to thank you for your great efforts and great results well see you guys next time operator thank you that concludes todays conference call you may now disconnect copyright policy all transcripts on this site are the copyright of seeking

results are as usual included in our earnings announcement which was released earlier today and is posted in the investor relations section of our website at omnicellcom our prepared remarks will also be posted in the same section let me now turn over the call to randall randall lipps good afternoon everyone we’re excited to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results as well as our expectations for  we had a great response to our announcement at ashp in december last year on our new xt series from both existing and potential new customers now consistent with our longterm successful gotomarket strategy that has helped us win in the marketplace we’re continuing to be committed to deliver longterm value to our customers and we are allowing customers to upgrade their g products that they’ve already booked with us in backlog to the xt series to get the full benefits of the product and this is really important and understanding omnicell’s gotomarket and philosophy in the marketplace it’s to allow for our customers to integrate next generation technologies with minimal disruption and so the conversion of our current g bookings to xt backlog does take some time as we offer this to our customers and then it takes time mostly in repapering it reviews and hospitals and in some cases even csuite reapprovals our consultants need to explain the differences and the benefits of the xt series it is not usually a long process but explanation and confirmation does take some time now as a result of our expected conversion of our g bookings and backlog to xt bookings the xt manufacturing and installation ramp up we anticipate two quarters of transition disruption which started earlier than we anticipated and we saw that actually in the month of december last year now we expect the backlog revenue conversion to be normalized in more historical levels starting in the second quarter of  we are in the initial stages of the xt rollout we are shipping and installing xt every day in order to meet demand we are starting a second shift at our xt manufacturing site this month to meet those demands the initial customer experience is extremely positive we’ve already shipped xt to  sites one of our leading institutions in the united states recently commented in an industry journal that xt is more responsive faster and easier to use delivering a positive impact on patient care and staff efficiency now this is exactly why we design the xt series and is consistent with the positive response we received in december at the ashp trade show as well as at indiscernible where large number of customers were able to see and experience firsthand the advantages of the new xt series now despite the yearend disruption in december i’m really proud of our performance in  overall and our consistent track record over the past several years to review the full year of  was a company record for bookings backlog revenues and earnings for  product bookings were  million up  for  on a reported basis and up  from  when including aesynt for the full year in  and within our guidance range provided in our third quarter results earnings call for the fourth quarter nongaap revenue was  million bringing total year nongaap revenue to  million and company record and within the guidance range provided in our third quarter results earnings call during the fourth quarter we did experience some customers wanting to switch from a g install to an xt install causing a modest impact on our revenue now combined with good cost execution nongaap eps was  bringing total year nongaap eps to  and within a guidance range provided in our third quarter results earnings call so now we finish  with a strong annualized new competitive conversion rate of  of bookings this was a great indicator of the strength of the business over  of these bookings were competitive conversions and the remainder were from greenfield customers who have never automated before we believe that the new account strength and our install customer base gives us a robust platform for future growth driven by expansion replacement and upgrade sales as well as cross selling opportunities across our product portfolio now in the last couple of years we’ve successfully grown the business by implementing three scalable growth strategies growth through differentiated solutions growth in new markets and growth via acquisitions for  consecutive years now we have received the top owners from klas the prestigious thirdparty rating organization for  consecutive years we’ve increased our market share and gained new thought leader customers every quarter together with our customers we’re consistently delivering state of the art medication management automation and workflow efficiency for caregivers and better healthcare outcomes for patients now in  we continue to experience great wins and added notable customers to our omnicell family under our first strategic pillar of differentiated solutions with several large competitive conversions we estimate that we gain further market share in  and continuation of the market share gains trend and momentum we have experienced for many years in the fourth quarter we had some great wins with prominent new customers as well as significant deals with existing customers including wellstar dch health system inova health system now we’re real excited to announce that wellstar health system the largest health system in georgia has selected the full breadth of omnicell’s automated medication management and analytic solutions for its hospital floors central pharmacy and operating rooms throughout its facilities wellstar is focused on improving the patient experience across it’s enterprise as well as

future growth in scale and today’s evolving healthcare environment we remain focused on our mission to change the practice of healthcare with solutions that improve patient and provider outcomes let me turn the call back over to peter for some numbers and guidance peter kuipers thank you randall i’ll discuss a summary of our fourth quarter and full year financial results and our guidance for  as randall mentioned earlier in this call the  product bookings were a record  million up  on a reported basis and up  in  when including aesynt for the full year in  the resulting backlog of  million for december   is up from  million at december   which is a company record and represents a yearoveryear increase of  our fourth quarter  gaap revenue of  million was up  from the same quarter last year and down  sequentially as randall referred to earlier in this call the announcement of the omnicell xt series caught some delays in december and impacted our fourth quarter revenue modestly for new customers that wanted to switch to xt installs the full year  yearoveryear strengthened revenue was driven by both expansion and upgrades at existing customers as well as by new and competitive conversion customers we continue to see particular strength of the combined solutions portfolio that enabled strategic tailored indiscernible solutions for our customers earnings per share per in accordance with gaap were  which is down from  in the fourth quarter of  gaap gross margin for the quarter was at  in addition to gaap financial results we reported our results on a nongaap basis which excludes stock compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions onetime acquisitionrelated expenses and the acquisition accounting impacts related to deferred revenue and inventory fair value adjustments we use nongaap financial statements in addition to gaap financial statements because we believe it’s useful for investors to understand acquisition amortizationrelated costs and noncash stock compensation expenses that are components of our reported results as well as onetime events such as the gain on the avantec investment in  and the onetime acquisition related expenses a full reconciliation of our gaap to nongaap results is included in our fourth quarter earnings release and is posted on our website our fourth quarter  nongaap revenues of  million were up  from the same quarter last year and down  sequentially on a nongaap basis earnings per share of  in the fourth quarter of  down  or  from the same quarter last year and down  sequentially nongaap revenue of  million for full year  was a company record representing an increase of  yearoveryear nongaap eps of  per share for full year  was also a record nongaap gross margin was  in the fourth quarter and  for full year  the nongaap gross margin was negatively impacted in the fourth quarter  by lower overhead cost absorption as we entered into the product launch phase of the xt series and also less overhead cost could be absorbed by lower g volume in the quarter when compared to prior quarters the negative impact of lower gross margins on nongaap eps was approximately offset by rd tax credit settlement benefit for the years prior to  of around  million nongaap adjusted ebitda was  million for the fourth quarter of  and was  million from total year  or up  from total year  our business is also reported in segments consisting of automation analytics and medication adherence automation analytics consists of our xt acudose and omnirx automated dispensing cabinets anesthesia workstations central pharmacy omnicell supply omnicell analytics and mach robotic dispensing systems our acquisitions of avantec mach and aesynt are also included in this segment the medication adherence segment consists of all adherence packaged consumables which are branded as suremed and equipment used by pharmacists to create adherence packages our acquisitions of mts medication technologies surgichem limited and indiscernible inc are included in the medication adherence segment as a reminder we now report certain corporate expenses that cannot be easily applied to either segment separately on a segment basis our automation and analytics segments contributed  million in gaap revenues in the fourth quarter of  up from  million in the fourth quarter of  or an increase of  driven by the acquisition of aesynt and organic growth  million of gaap operating income this quarter compares to  million for the same quarter last year  million of nongaap operating income in the fourth quarter of  compares to  million last year in the fourth quarter the medication adherence segment contributed  million of gaap revenue to the quarter compared to  million in the fourth quarter of  gaap operating income of  million compares to  million a year ago the weaker great britain pound exchange rate impacted medication adherence operating income by around  compared to the same quarter last year as most of the medication adherence product sold in the united kingdom are manufactured in the united states nongaap operating income was  million in the fourth quarter compared to  million of nongaap operating income in the fourth quarter a year ago nongaap common expenses were  million compared to  million in the same quarter last year and the increase is mostly driven by the aesynt acquisition nongaap operating margin was  for full year  including the aesynt integration cost excluding the aesynt integration cost nongaap operating margin was  for  in the fourth quarter of  our cash increased from  million to  million primarily driven by strong cash flow from operations total year  cash flow from operations is  million up from  million in  our strong cash flow in the year enabled us to repay approximately  million of the outstanding balance during the year as of december   we had  million of outstanding from the debt and a loan leverage measured as outstanding total from the loan balance over the last  months of ebitda was  accounts receivable days outstanding were  for the fourth quarter down  days from the third quarter the decrease in dso was driven by record cash collections in the quarter for contracts ph our customer agreements specify that for equipment sales the company typically invoices  of the contract value at shipment date we review the collectability of our receivables regularly and we do not believe that the fluctuation dso are indicative of a change in our rate of bad debt inventories at december   were  million and down  million from last quarter our headcount was  for the end of the year with increase from last quarter driven by the acquisition of ateb in december last year let me now move to guidance for  during the last year we introduced the xt series to a number of customers on the nondisclosure agreements for first launch purposes we gave these customers the opportunity to move from g to xt and the vast majority of these customers are moving to installing xt starting in the first quarter of  and ramping through the year in  we do see some timing delays of the conversion of g bookings and sales quotes to xt bookings and revenue as randall talked about earlier in the call that is mostly driven by paper work and approvals taking longer than expected and timing of the scheduling of implementations stepping back and looking at   will be characterized by two distinct different phases as revenue and profitability are impacted by the xt product introduction and ramp up the first distinct phase is the start and ramp up of manufacturing of the xt series product in the first quarter of  as installations start the first quarter  dynamics are expected to be as follows first of all performance ph of the g product backlog and sales quotes in the field to xt bookings secondly the xt manufacturing volume is ramping up and we’re starting the second shift in our xt manufacturing plant this month thirdly we’ve the first installs at large ph customers this quarter and we also have the dynamic of xt manufacturing ramp up cost as we start production in the first quarter of  we’re taking the following actions to drive offsets the company today announced a  positions reduction in force including the closure of our tennessee office we will also have general hiring delays to contain cost as part of the next phase of the integration of the acquisition of aesynt the company is creating the following centers of excellence or coes for product development engineering and manufacturing first the point of use coe in california second the robotics and central pharmacy coe in pittsburgh pennsylvania and third the medication adherence consumables coe in st petersburg florida the majority of the reduction in force was around  positions over various locations is expected to be completed in the first quarter  and enables the creation of these centers of excellence and also enables the achievement of the cost synergies contemplated in the acquisition of aesynt this reduction in force includes the closure of the company’s national tennessee office we’re also planning to move the manufacturing of ic machines for the nonus customers from our slovenia plant to the pittsburgh robotics and central pharmacy coe in the third quarter of  to consolidate the ic manufacturing globally and we will close the slovenia plant after this transition the company expects to incur approximately  million of severance related cost and facilities restructuring cost in connection with this reduction in force and the two location closures for the first quarter  we expect nongaap revenue to be between  million and  million we expect the first quarter  nongaap earnings to be between  and  per share let’s now move to the second phase in the year the second distinct phase is the acceleration of installations of xt product and conversion of backlog into revenue during the second through fourth quarter of  the second through fourth quarter  dynamics are expected to be as follows we will launch the acudose software on xt platform we expect to see improved xt production cost we expect to see bookings growth yearoveryear organically and on a reported basis to be greater than  we also expect to return to  to  organic revenue growth during the second through fourth quarter  we’re planning to take the following actions xt cost of goods sold reductions as revenue ramps continued cost actions and roles implementing the development in manufacturing satisfaction as mentioned before for the second through fourth quarter  we expect total nongaap revenue to be between  million and  million representing a return to the  to  organic revenue growth longterm target for the second through fourth quarters of  we expect total nongaap earnings to be between  and  representing a  growth in earnings when using the midpoint of  for  we expect product bookings to be between  million and  million also consisting of two distinct phases first a yearoveryear bookings decline in the first quarter  as teams are working with customers to confer committed existing g contracts and sales quotes to xt bookings in the second phase is the second quarter through the fourth quarter of the year and we expect there as mentioned before and above  growth in product bookings both on the reported and organic basis we expect nongaap revenue for full year to be between  million and  million we expect  nongaap earnings to be between  and  for clarity we have summarized our  guidance for the two distinct phases on a specific table included in the press release k issued today as well as in the investor presentation posted on the ir section on omnicellcom we expect nongaap operating margins from  to be approximately  including integration cost for aesynt and ateb excluding the integration for aesynt and ateb acquisitions we expect nongaap operating margin for  to be slightly above  given the ramp up of revenue and profitability through the year in  described earlier in this call we expect that the nongaap operating margin for the fourth quarter in  after excluding integration for aesynt and ateb to be approximately between  and  in line with our longterm financial model indiscernible  it is important to know couple of items included in the  guidance first of all for  our nongaap expected result include approximately  million of integration expense for aesynt and ateb that we do not adjust for based on a nongaap policy these integration cost directly impacting nongaap operating margins and nongaap eps mostly consist for integration related it expenses specifically sales crm ph and financial erp ph implementations it also includes integration team and project cost cost related to the implementation of sarbanes oxley cost related to tax restructuring and cost related to accelerated product development integration cost in  we are expecting second year cost synergies for around  million as we have demonstrated in the past we’re confident to achieve our  nongaap operating margin overtime after integrating the acquired businesses and getting full benefit of the scale to combined business lastly for  we expect interest expense related to the senior secured credit facility used to finance the aesynt and ateb acquisitions to be around  million or equivalent to nongaap eps of around  impact finally we’re assuming annual average effective tax rate of  and gaap earnings on a combined basis as discussed on previous earnings call it’s important to note that from timetotime installation completion timing and specifically bigger projects can impact revenue earnings in a given quarter but we don’t expect indiscernible fluctuations to impact the growth rate measured over multiple rolling quarters to round out our update i’ll hand the call back to randall randall lipps well i think  was a water shed year for omnicell we had the integration of aesynt which really helped to drive record bookings backlog revenue and earnings and it significantly broadened our solutions portfolio strengthened our role as a strategic solutions provider to very large health systems which really positioned us totally different in the marketplace i’m really also pleased with our integration of aesynt which allows us to move forward with second phase of this integration which involves mostly systems and process implementation as well as joint product development and roadmaps and of course we couldn’t be more pleased with the response and the uptake on the xt series which we’re shipping installing every day and trying to figure out how to put more through the manufacturing process to get more out there and we continue to believe with what we’re seeing in health system with both existing in new customers are truly assessing their need for improving the efficiency and the safety around their medication processes and looking across the continuum and they’re evaluating a breadth of solutions sets and breadth of solution options out there and it sure feels good that they’re choosing omnicell so that ends our prepared remarks and now operator we would like to open it up for questions please questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question is going to come from the line of matt hewitt with craighallum capital matt hewitt several questions from me first it sounds like you had a greater response from customers that were in queue to buy g that now want to switch over to xt is that accurate and is that why you’re scrambling to ramp up production of the xt in adding that second shift randall lipps yes i think that we thought that g would wind down and more of  add a steady pace floor pace and that xt would ramp up and then almost from the day we announced xt everybody said wait you guys only put out a new platform every  years i want to really consider putting this in so it really pushed off decisions that would have been g and they wanted to get into queue for xt and particularly this quarter we did not have enough supply the xt systems to meet what would normally be our revenue goal so it’s not a  and so i guess you’re right the reaction to xt lot of people we thought would have stopped with the g just because they’ve they already have a lot of g in hospital they did maybe they wouldn’t want all of their systems to be the next xt system but most of the people we were surprised wanted to do that and that really sucked our sales force back into particularly q and now to repapering this stuff and bringing in our consultants to reconfigure based on the xt system because it is slightly different than the g it’s not a direct translation over so xt i’d have to say is a booming success matt hewitt okay secondly your guidance peter and i think you touched on this a little bit your guidance in applying another step down in gross margin either gaap or adjusted for the first quarter and then you would think you would start to ramp up what are the key points that you mentioned at the analysts day back in december was that the xt will actually carry a higher gross margin than the g how long until we start to see some of the benefits of that obviously this year as you get the transition period but is that an  event peter kuipers towards the end of the year in  we’ll see some benefit already  total cost xt versus g so i was going to say of course dependent on volume when you repurchase more volume you can negotiate better rates you can run the plants and more efficiently etc so and that will flow through the gross margins towards the first parts of that towards the end of the year in  so we don’t need to wait all the way through  matt hewitt okay maybe two more from me and then i hop back in the queue number one if you could touch on performance center briefly you did mention one win there but where are you from a customer standpoint if you don’t mind and what is the adoption curve kind of been like for that product randall lipps well we’re getting great adoption and traction in the marketplace i think we’re not on the exact numbers at least  to  customers we have going signed up for the product and given these contracts these are multiyear contracts of very large institutions and we have a large pipeline of more customers lined up for so we feel that this is  rings very true in the macro trends and healthcare and it’s just a natural combination of all the other things that we have to offer fits right in with it matt hewitt okay great one last one from me and then i’ll hop back in the queue i just want to make sure i heard you correctly i think peter you mentioned there was  million of integration expenses that were actually included or kept in your adjusted guidance is that accurate peter kuipers that is correct matt hewitt okay great thank you operator our next question will come from the line of mohan naidu with oppenheimer mohan naidu randy i just want to go back to the bookings questions a bit again the book in december do you guys see delays in new bookings as well as the customers thought about getting into xt are  is just revenue conversion that got delayed randall lipps well i think the bookings were pretty steady through december but as soon as we announced xt we did see a few bookings it’s not very many that were impacted by xt and but most of the people already had the paperwork through the systems and just about signed but there’s actually a little more disruption in q where paperwork hadn’t been quite circulated all the way around and now we’re pulling it back and recirculating it with xt as far as new bookings and then as well we’re also working on old bookings in g several hundred millions of backlog we have that need to be converted to xt as well mohan naidu okay maybe a topical question around hospital spending environment that you’re looking at right now are you seeing any changes in the pace of deals closure or anything like that because hospitals are thinking about any upcoming changes from the new administration randall lipps for our market segment we have not seen any slowdown in hospital i think hospitals continue to be very strategic about acquiring our types of systems they want standardization they want cost control they want safety they want regulatory compliance and they want it uniform across all of their provider facilities and that’s why they’re acquiring provider facilities and they want to leverage those and then a key driver is they want to integrate that into their enterprise technology systems that they have on the health record side and so we play extremely well into those aspects of what the market needs and wants in the macro trends to be successful so we really just not have not seen customer saying well we don’t want to spend the money on this infrastructure right now or on this type of project we have not seen that mohan naidu okay great peter one quick question for you how much are you baking in for ateb contribution for calendar  guidance peter kuipers so we’re not breaking it out specifically what we said before though is that on ltm basis per september  last year ateb ltm revenue was about  million assume that roughly to be doubledigit business it’s in the fast growing segment specifically the med synchronization time my meds as offer is really gaining indiscernible in the market mohan naidu okay does this going to the medication adherence segment when you report peter kuipers yes it is included there mohan naidu okay all right thank you very much operator and our next question will come from the line of sean wieland with piper jaffray sean wieland so if i’m an existing g client right now what is my sense of urgency to upgrade to the xt platform randall lipps well i think the issue is your next order that you’re going to get and the hospital right now you’re in this window the next incremental one you want in  to  of our orders were all from current customers you got to decide am i going to go with g or xt so as i just said most people are saying the next incremental one i want is xt and then this set you up and i think most hospital networks and providers understand that this is the system of the future to get the next generation of software you have to have a next generation of hardware first and so they’re trying to orient their investments overtime to make sure they get the platform eventually upgraded to xt now a lot of our customers large percentage of our customers of more than half of the systems we have out in the market place are seven years or older so their systems are old and we are eventually not going to service those just because that’s too old to service as we continue on so it’s really a question of winding down those systems and taking them out of the market so that would probably be the biggest driver as far as why customer is not ph eventually slow sean wieland so give us the sense of the magnitude if you could of the upsell of the g to xt versus g to g not on a per customer basis but you know from your perspective from the company’s perspective peter kuipers so the difference between the g upgrade which is the brain or the g console only that’s part of the total the automated dispensing cabinet a full fray of xt’s x the revenue if you will for an upgrade randall lipps and so g was i think around  million to  million opportunity and this is close to  billion as we replace all of the equipment over the next sevenish years because we have both the aesynt installed base to replace and the omnicell installed base to place so it’s a huge opportunity for us sean wieland okay and so what  because it’s the full frame is what you’re saying is the greater opportunity peter kuipers yes sean wieland okay and so what’s the visibility you got on the acceleration to  bookings growth starting in q peter kuipers we have a pipeline that we’re working we feel pretty good about the feasibility there and the benefits of the new products we’ve already talked about the aged equipments in the fields more than  older than seven years and particularly also in the aesynt acudose installed base is actually ageing a little bit more so we feel good about the opportunity there to for replacement sean wieland okay thanks so much operator our next question will come from the line of steve halper with cantor fitzgerald steve halper two questions the  million of integration expense that’s included in the numbers what does that compared to in  peter kuipers so in  we had about  million integration cost for aesynt and then in  planning roughly little bit less than  million for aesynt and around  million for ateb steve halper no go ahead peter indiscernible peter kuipers i was going to say that we expect to substantially complete the integration projects for aesynt by the end of the year in fiscal  right so that will then falloff be significantly reduced fairly small amount in  steve halper and the cost that you called out for headcount reduction and facility leases is that  million is that also included in the adjusted earnings guidance peter kuipers yes those will be gaap only we would adjust those out as onetime as those cost would not be in the nongaap results steve halper okay so the  million are not in the nongaap results peter kuipers correct steve halper okay operator our next question will come from the line of raymond myers with benchmark raymond myers randall and peter maybe you can help me to kind of walk me through what happens when a customer decides they were going to upgrade to the g and now you’ve introduced the xt do they hold back on the g are most of them simply holding their orders and not moving forward with anything for the time being while they make the determination or are many of them actually signing for the xt and when that is the case my understanding is that purchase price is several multiples higher than the g conversion so if you do the math if a large proportion of customers make the conversion the revenue opportunity to omnicell should be much higher in the second half of the year as you convert those customers to xt and yet your guidance doesn’t quite reflect that can you help us understand randall lipps yes so we use the g console upgrade is different than the g frame right they’re both g versions of the product so customer that’s expanding to adds a new hospital to their network would buy regular g frames and put an order within us because they’re adding this hospital to their network and so they would have an order for  g frames that’s not g console frame consoles that’s the whole system those are the ones that are being converted their whole systems that are being converted from g whole frames the g to xt there are not that many customers out there left that could use a g upgrade console only so when we talk about converting the g in our backlog that’s the current full fledge model that we’re shipping up until the middle of january middle of january we started shipping xt as well so it’s a replacement of one full model for the other it isn’t the upgrade of the g consoles that people are swapping out for the full frame it’s full frame for full frame raymond myers okay so in the case where it’s full frame for full frame the pricing i understand is more similar but you would have the opportunity for an upgrade cycle for all the previous g’s that you sold it in all year history so that’s where that the million opportunity come randall lipps that’s exactly right raymond myers so the disconnect is when does this great opportunity flow through to your income statement because it doesn’t seem like it’s happening quite yet peter kuipers this is peter the second through fourth quarter phase this year we’re expected to be back in the organic growth range of  to  so you can see your start there and then the eps if you take the nongaap eps you take the midpoint of the range that we gave if you’re looking at  yearoveryear so starting to fall through there as well randall lipps yes so the big difference i think is that this conversion of current customer base to the new technology is somewhere between a five to year process and which all the customers eventually swap out it isn’t there  they don’t want to swap out in the month frame or month frame it’s probably five to sevenish type year timeframe and we’re just at the beginning of the cycle in other words we just announced xt so most of the customers who would be willing to swap out or could swap out older equipment are customers who have fiscal dollars in the second half of  who we would target as replacing over equipment because it takes time to cycle the funds into the budgets and then of course as you keep moving on through the cycle   it continues to build raymond myers okay that helps thank you and on the performance center i think you previously said  to  at least customer installation so far can you give us a sense of what revenue contribution that product might be this year peter kuipers yes so we’re not breaking out the product line specifically but each of the contracts on average are multiyear multimillion dollars but you have to be fired of course the contract amount over the number of the years that the contract runs right so it’s kind of layering recurring revenue the model if you will but we’re ramping fairly aggressively there randall lipps yes we’ve  to  that have signed contracts we don’t have  to  running yet and so we’re probably under  in the running and probably adding a few every quarter into the revenue line but that’s recognized ratably over monthtomonth but its good margin obviously for us raymond myers okay good and then maybe just clear up one final point as we look at your guidance in december and in early january as compared to now it seems to be a little different particularly as we look at q was it the change in the last so many weeks that made your q outlook a little different than it was before peter kuipers yes so what randy talked about earlier in the call so we were expecting two quarters of sensation  we do actually see that already in  we saw that already in december so looking at the month of december plus into first quarter and a little bit in the second quarter as well so the six month kind of shifted a little bit forward in our minds if you will so that’s the difference we’ve got good visibility starting into the second quarter as well indiscernible so we feel actually a little bit more confident than we were before instead of first half second half we feel that at first quarter versus last nine months distinction is actually is more reasonable for dynamics that we’ve seen raymond myers okay so most of the impact has been now accelerated into q do you have visibility from customer purchase agreements that this delay in purchases is abetting and they’re actually moving forward with a xt purchase decision and that simply is weighing ph entirely randall lipps yes the backlog was being converted to xt so we have really good visibility and we’re of course lining up the xt conversions to line up with the installation expectation that’s why we feel really confident about q and moving forward is we have excellent visibility there as we’ve gotten folks to sign up and sign on the line for xt but that was too late to get it manufactured shipped and installed in q but obviously it sets us up well for q and beyond raymond myers okay thank you that’s a really important point thank you very much operator and our next question will come from the line of gene mannheimer with dougherty gene your line is open okay and we’ll go to the next question and that question will be from the line of mitra ramgopal with sidoti mitra ramgopal just a couple of questions first in the past you’ve mentioned you expected the gain maybe   market share with the success you’re having in terms of customer interest for the xt you still hold to that or you think it could even be faster peter kuipers well looking at  reducing that we gained one or two points off additional market share as we’ve done in the last couple of years especially notable of course is wellstar which is about full point of market share in the us so we’re expecting to continue to competitive wins in  as well i think for now maybe randy comment as well but for now we’ll continue to assume that we keep gaining one to two points of absolute market share this year as well if it’s higher then we’ll adjust but for now we’re assuming that randall lipps the xt really is a game changer for us it’s an advantage and the thing that i was trying to explain in the beginning of the call the way we’re introducing this technology the way the options that we’re giving our customers even though it’s caused some disruption here is what really drives them to choose us because we’re allowing them to get the technology integrated into their current platform and take advantage of it in a very meaningful way now without having to convert everything at once but start the conversion now knowing that over the next few years they’ll fully convert so this is grand promise that omnicell has created in the marketplace and is what’s driven this  to  and this is just another clear commitment that omnicell is making to their customer base that you’re going to be able to get longterm great return value with the best automation in the marketplace because we’re able to deliver the next generation of hardware and software with minimal disruption in the institution and that’s meaningful to people mitra ramgopal okay thanks and just quickly on the cost side obviously you’re closing tennessee facility i think the slovakia facility etc peter kuipers slovenia mitra ramgopal slovenia sorry should we expect pretty much  all the closures to be completed or do you anticipate this peter kuipers all right the group ph close to tennessee office will be in the first quarter the slovenia plant will be closed by the end of the third quarter this year mitra ramgopal and in terms of additional closures etc i guess it’s probably a little too early for that peter kuipers none plans at this time none at this time mitra ramgopal okay thank you operator thank you i’ll now turn the conference call over to randall lipps for closing comments randall lipps well again thank you for joining us today i know we had a lot of numbers and assessments for you guys to go through but the momentum in the business is strong and volume bases are excited i want to thank them for their hard work and getting this xt launch and the aesynt integration it’s really changed the dynamics of our company and sets up for a continued success with a great platform to reap many benefits over the many years to come so
