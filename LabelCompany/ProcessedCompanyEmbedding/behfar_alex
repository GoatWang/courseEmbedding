croteau senses a big payoff following the m acquisition of the cornell laser spinout in decemberdata center ramp to drive binoptics businessmacom technology solutions the lowell massachusetts communications technology company that has just acquired laser maker binoptics says that the deal is already exceeding expectations amid heavy demand for the indium phosphide devices developed by the cornell university spinout ceo john croteau told an investor conference call to discuss the firm’s latest financial quarter “after the announcement of our agreement to acquire binoptics it became clear literally overnight that the strategic upside of the transaction would exceed our expectations” macom closed the deal on december  and croteau said that since then discussions with existing major customers had revealed potential for expanded relationships and crossselling activity the ceo cautioned that challenges remain as binoptics transitions from a rapidly growing small company to a larger manufacturing operation under macom’s control but it is clear that there is already very strong demand for the company’s devices “we expect revenue growth for this new laser business to remain supplylimited through the remainder of fiscal ” croteau added macom’s current fiscal year runs until the end of september  and when the binoptics acquisition was originally announced the company said that it planned to quadruple its laser manufacturing capacity within a year it added at the time “in the last two years a gap has been created in the merchant supply of photonic chips especially lasers we are well positioned to fill this gap with binoptics” hinting at the potential size and rapid growth of that market croteau said that a major chinese oem expected demand for the devices in access applications to rise by two orders of magnitude “binoptics is shaping up to be a goldmine” he told investors public offering set to raise m documents filed with the us securities  exchange

sells radio frequency components used in wireless communication and radar applications said that it had made a net loss of  million on total sales of  million ceo croteau noted that in contrast to a general softness across many of its markets its optical component business focused on g communications grew  per cent sequentially that figure excluded around a  million contribution from binoptics in
