credit risk and interest rate risk issuer risk is the risk that the value of fixedincome securities may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the issuer reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the funds portfolio will decline if the fund invests the proceeds from matured traded or called bonds at market interest rates that are below the fund portfolios current earnings rate prepayment risk is the risk that upon a prepayment the actual outstanding debt on which the fund derives interest income will be reduced credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest andor principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result interest rate risk is the risk that fixedincome securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates a portion of the funds managed assets may be invested in subordinated classes of mortgagebacked securities such subordinated classes are subject to a greater degree of nonpayment risk than are senior classes of the same issuer or agency use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses
