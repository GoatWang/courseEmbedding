this study examined the effect of age on the distribution of oil in redcedar tree segments trunks of eastern redcedar  juniperus virginiana l trees at different stages of growth – years old were divided into three sections top center and lower each section was fractionated separately into bark heartwood and sapwood segments heartwood and sapwood samples from each tree section were analyzed for oil content and composition a hydrodistillation method was used for oil extraction volatile components of tree segments were examined by using a gas chromatographheadspace analysis technique the heartwood of eastern redcedar contained significantly higher oil than sapwood older trees had more oil in the heartwood than younger trees both redcedar bark and leaves contained significantly lower oil content than the cedarwood there were also significant differences in the oil composition of bark leaves and wood fractions cedarwood oil extraction may benefit from prior separation of tree segments prior to oil extraction however the economic feasibility of separation prior to an extraction process needs to be further studied required extra capital investment and operating costs need to be examined as well as whether sapwood is worth processing httpwwwdeepdyvecomassetsimagesdeepdyvelogolgpng bioresource technology elsevier
