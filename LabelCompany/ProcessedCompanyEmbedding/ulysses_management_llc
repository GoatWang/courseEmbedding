ulysses management who we are guiding principles team our strategies investment criteria portfolio case studies contact us menu close ulysses management llc is a diversified investment firm with over  billion in capital under management we follow a variety of investment strategies in pursuit of superior investment results over the long term the majority of the capital we manage belongs to our general partners and their families creating an uncommonly close alignment of interests in our investments with founders entrepreneurs and management teams who we are founded almost twenty years ago ulysses is the successor firm to odyssey partners lp the pioneering hedge fund formed in  by jack nash and leon levy odyssey was an innovator in the development of the alternative investment market and made some of the earliest private equity investments almost  years ago when they were known as ‘boot strap’ investments this tradition of investment innovation continues within the ulysses private equity group which is one of our three principal areas of investment focus along with public market and real estate investments our private equity group has a broad and flexible investment mandate that allows us to pursue attractive opportunities as a sponsor coinvestor or limited partner wherever we invest whatever the industry or transaction size our core philosophy is always the same find companies with identifiable barriers to competition partner with talented managers operating under the right incentives forge longterm relationships built on accountability trust transparency and collaboration and together we can create substantial value we do not invest out of a typical investment fund structure and consequently are not bound by traditional pe capital raising demands our capital is more durable and allows us to invest across  year business cycles enabling us to be far more strategic and longterm oriented without the time pressures created by funds with typical shortterm investment horizons this appeals to both sellers no stripping and flipping of their legacies and to management teams providing an opportunity to create meaningful wealth over a long period in a stable platform we believe the power of compounding has been lost in the private equity world in favor of the generation of fees for the sponsor at ulysses we earn our investment returns alongside our fellow owners not in front of them guiding principles value investors we are value investors we build conviction by having a firm understanding of a company’s ‘reason to exist’ we are attracted to businesses with defensible proven business models enduring free cash flow motivated management teams and deep customer relationships a central corollary to this philosophy is the avoidance of excessive borrowing or financial engineering to generate high risk equity returns partnership we believe strongly in the benefits of partnership we often deploy our capital alongside other likeminded investors believing in the wisdom of multiple perspectives and the resiliency derived from additional human and capital resources business building the power of compounding and thus longer term investment horizons is critical to our investment philosophy this allows us to focus on real company building rather than financial engineering or quick flips as a result we prefer to measure our success in terms of return on investment instead of internal rates of return operational focus an operational focus is critical to creating sustainable value in businesses we routinely rely on a network of operating executives to develop proprietary insights into our investment opportunities through many years of experience building businesses and our ability to draw on the talents and knowledge of our operating executives we can help companies enhance their core advantages and transcend their historical limitations alignment of interests ulysses is an unusual investment firm in that our general partners and their families have contributed the majority of our capital under management and it represents a meaningful portion of their net worth we subscribe to the notion of ”eating your own cooking” we have the ability to hold investments as long as we are the logical owner there is no artificial or external pressure caused by fund raising cycles value creation we work in close partnership with exceptional management teams and provide capital vision and operating resources to help build and strengthen the companies in which we invest we are particularly focused on adding greater intelligence to the companies we invest in which we define as  creating a data driven culture and  increasing the technology quotient of our products and services to improve the
