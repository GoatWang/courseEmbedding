watterson funds     boyd watterson limited duration enhanced incomeobjectivesthe fund seeks income generation as a principal objective and capital preservation and total return as secondary objectives fund overviewthe fund consists of a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities and leveraged loans managed to generate potential returns primarily through security selection sector allocation duration management and tactical trading opportunities that attempt to capitalize on identified market inefficiencies under normal market conditions the average quality rating of the portfolio may be expected to be bbba and the average portfolio duration may be expected to be  years principal investment strategiesunder normal market conditions the fund invests a majority of its assets in investments in domestic and us dollar denominated foreign incomeproducing securities  these securities are i below investmentgrade also known as “junk” bonds and investment grade fixed income securities bank loans and us government securities and ii equity securities preferred securities and hybrid corporate securities the fund may make these investments directly or from time to time indirectly through exchange traded funds “etfs” which include inverse etfs and through closed end funds the fixed income securities in which the fund invests have a typical targeted duration range of  years to  years the fund’s investment strategy seeks to capitalize on inefficiencies in the public trading markets for fixedincome securities and bank loans using boyd watterson asset management investment process and philosophy durationthe fund seeks to maintain a limited duration in order to reduce the impact of rising interest rates on its total return the fixed income securities in which the fund invests have a typical targeted duration range of  years to  years back to top ↑prospectus disclosure investors should carefully consider the investment objectives risks charges and expenses of the boyd watterson limited duration enhanced income fund this and other important information about the fund is contained in the prospectus which can be obtained at wwwboydwattersonfundscom or by calling  the prospectus should be read carefully before investing the boyd watterson limited duration enhanced income fund is distributed by northern lights distributors llc member finrasipc boyd watterson asset management llc is not affiliated with northern lights distributors llcrisk disclosure investments in mutual funds involve risk including possible loss of principal the risk that if the fund’s strategy for allocating assets among different assets classes does not work as intended the fund may not achieve its objective or may underperform other funds with the same or similar investment strategy the market for bank loans may not be highly liquid and the fund may have difficulty selling them these investments expose the fund to the credit risk of both the financial institution and the underlying borrower longerterm securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes given the recent historically low interest rates and the potential for increases in those rates a heightened risk is posed by rising interest rates to a fund whose portfolios include longerterm fixed income securities the net asset value of the fund will fluctuate based on changes in the value of the us andor foreign equity securities held by the fund when the fund invests in fixed income securities the value of your investment in the fund will fluctuate with changes in interest rates because the fund’s investments may include foreign securities the fund is subject to risks beyond those associated with investing in domestic securities foreign companies are generally not subject to the same regulatory requirements of us companies thereby resulting in less publicly available information about these companies the interest rate on hybrid corporate securities can fluctuate from fixed to floating rate which creates uncertainty regarding the interest rate that maybe received when the fund invests in other investment companies such as etfs and closed end funds it will bear additional expenses based on its pro rata share of the other investment company’s operating expenses including the potential duplication of management fees the value of a specific security can be more volatile than the market as a whole and may perform worse than the market as a whole lowerquality bonds known as “high yield” or “junk” bonds present greater risk than bonds of higher quality including an increased risk of default the fund is a new mutual fund and has a limited history of operations for investors to evaluate the adviser’s reliance on its strategy and judgments about the attractiveness value and potential appreciation of particular securities and the tactical allocation among the fund’s investments may prove to be incorrect and may not produce the desired results preferred securities may pay fixed or adjustable rates of return the earnings and prospects of small and medium sized companies are more volatile than larger companies and may experience higher failure rates than larger companies treasury obligations may differ in their interest rates maturities times of issuance and other characteristicsnld  boyd watterson asset management
