electronic tagging system for livestock a mobile office for a quadriplegic lawyer and herman millers action office system have in common they were all invented by robert propst while his inventions may seem unrelated they all spring from the same source his relentless need to investigate how the world operates and then find fresh answers propst wasnt interested in creating individual things that have no impact on complex situations instead he researched big issues and focused on developing new largescale systems that improve and simplify peoples lives a native of colorado propst began his career in the late s as a graphic artist teacher and sculptor in  he formed the propst co a denverbased firm specializing in speculative product development in other words propst drew on his independent nature and impatience with the status quo to attack problems whether anyone asked him to or not he called on herman miller with one of those speculative developments—a unique fishbone connection system for furniture components propst then signed on as a herman miller consultant and began conducting unprecedented studies of people in work situations as a basis for extending the companys line of products in  propst became president of herman miller research corp where he continued investigating how the world of work operates concluding that todays office is a wasteland it saps vitality blocks talent frustrates accomplishment it is the daily scene of unfulfilled intentions and failed effort propsts answer to this unhappy situation was introduced by herman miller in  the action office system was the worlds first openplan office system of reconfigurable components and a bold departure from the eras fixed assumptions of what office furniture should be with the action office system propst assailed traditional complacent office design with a concept that fit the way people really work wildly successful the action office system transformed the workplace as well as herman miller and the entire furniture industry which scrambled to copy it in the early s propst also initiated research into the troubled state of patient care delivery in hospitals as usual he came up with a revolutionary solution introduced in  by herman miller the costruc system streamlined hospital services with mobile and modular containers carts frames and rails with over  patents under his
