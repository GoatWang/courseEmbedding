will need to either update your browser to a recent version or update your flash plugin andrea guerras score for the feelgood drama the pursuit of happyness so closely resembles scottish composer rolfe kents efforts for the earlier about schmidt that one can only assume the film was tempotracked to kents quirky endearing melodies leaving guerra little choice but to ape his predecessor from within these claustrophobically narrow creative confines guerra nevertheless manages to generate a few original themes employing unobtrusive piano and guitar to forge a sweetly romantic and thoughtful approach in lockstep with the remainder of the score  indeed whats appalling about the pursuit of happyness has nothing to do with the quality of the music and everything to do with a me too hollywood mentality that renders even the most innovative ideas stale and predictable via sheer repetition  jason ankeny rovi read more format cd record label varese sarabande upc  product id  genre classical

purchase reviewstop customer reviews out of  starsan honest attempt at family drama scoring by guerrabykaya savasvine voiceon february  format audio cdextraordinary measures is a film that looks like it should be a saturday night movie on the hallmark channel yet somehow it stars brendan fraser and harrison ford italian born composer andrea guerra did the score i was first introduced to his work with some of the amazing stuff he composed for hotel rwanda alongside rupert gregsonwilliamswith extraordinary measures guerra takes a non intrusive approach some of the music borders saccharine and cliche but there are a few tracks that call back to that style i heard and loved in hotel rwanda this is a piano and strings score that relies on the arrangements he utilizes electronics occasionally more for percussion and to add some tension and conflict to the sound tracks like her eyes the lake breakdown and on the road shine through though because they find a way to step apart from the formulaic material of the filmthe sugar coated part of the score is melodramatic and just rushes in forced emotions do not get put off by the first track which is incredibly cheesy there is heart and real emotion in this score it just requires a little digging to get the sweet candy shell off this score is an honest attempt at lightweight emotional scoring for a pg family drama the music just never excels and while there are some genuine cues of real emotion there is also some melodramatic stuff we have to cut through to get to it guerra is another recent foreign composer who is starting to get more work in hollywood and i cant wait to hear more from himread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusesee all verified purchase reviews newest
