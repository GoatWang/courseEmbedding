undersigned attorneys for their claims against defendant compucredit holdings corporation “compucredit” or “the company” states and alleges as follows introduction  plaintiffs collectively own or have an interest in a majority of the  convertible senior notes due  issued by compucredit pursuant to an indenture dated may   “ notes and  convertible senior notes due  issued by compucredit pursuant to an indenture dated november   “ notes collectively the “notes” all beneficial holders of the notes are referred to herein as the “noteholders”  compucredit a subprime financial services provider is a public company owned primarily by david hanna the ceo his brother frank and other corporate insiders in its latest quarterly filing on november   the company once again  case cvjmrfln document  filed  page  of  emphasized to the marketplace that it is in severe financial distress the company reported plunging asset values on its balance sheet alarming and increasing losses a disturbing lack of liquidity and perhaps most disturbingly the possibility that the company will not be in a position to meet its obligation to repay more than  million of notes in   one thing that the company’s filings clearly did not suggest was that shareholders should anticipate distributions any time soon particularly in light of the company’s significant debt obligations compucredit has approximately  million in notes outstanding of which  million are due to be repurchased by the company in may  at par – a responsibility which as mentioned above the company indicated that it does not believe it can meet given its current circumstances  less than a month after the above filing however the company revealed a startling response to the challenges it faced a decision to funnel as much cash and assets to management and other corporate insiders as possible while leaving the holders of the company’s notes holding the bag in a december   press release attached hereto as ex a the company announced a massive cash dividend of almost  million – an amount that constituted over twenty percent of the market capitalization of the company at the time and nearly twentyfive percent of its last reported available cash it was the first dividend the company had ever declared which was astonishing in light of the company’s stated liquidity crisis its staggering ongoing losses and its  repurchase obligation in the same press release the company once again ignoring its obligations to  case cvjmrfln document  filed  page  of  its creditors also indicated that corporate insiders should expect additional cash dividends to be issued in the future  the company didn’t stop there however in addition to announcing its intention to issue a dividend that exceeded twenty percent of its current capitalization the company also announced its intention to spin off the microloan segment of its business – the only segment of the company’s business that is currently generating a profit like the dividend this asset would go to compucredit shareholders and therefore primarily to the ceo his brother and other corporate insiders  the company has thus embarked on a deliberate strategy of stripping itself of assets distributing those assets to insiders and disabling itself from meeting its obligations to its creditors there is a phrase for such a strategy the phrase is “fraudulent transfer” which the law does not permit in the guise of a dividend or otherwise  finally on a proforma balance sheet basis the liabilities already exceed the company’s assets and its insolvency is imminent absent an unexpected resurgence in operations as a result the plaintiffs have determined that it is necessary to bring this action to protect the holders of the notes by seeking an immediate halt to the company’s unlawful course of conduct before any of the proposed unlawful transfers are consummated parties  plaintiff akanthos is a delaware limited liability company through an affiliated

and whitebox hedged are not georgia citizens  defendant compucredit holdings corporation a georgia corporation with its principal place of business in atlanta georgia is a financial services holding company  compucredit holdings corporation was created pursuant to a corporate reorganization completed on june   in that reorganization the former parent company compucredit corporation became a wholly owned subsidiary of  case cvjmrfln document  filed  page  of  compucredit holdings corporation compucredit corporation and compucredit holdings corporation are collectively referred to herein as “compucredit” venue and jurisdiction  this court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to  usc § a because this action is between citizens of different states and of foreign states and the amount in controversy exceeds   this court has personal jurisdiction over defendant because compucredit or a closely integrated subsidiary acting on its behalf has substantial operations and conducts substantial business in minnesota one of the six office locations listed on compucredit’s website is in st cloud minnesota as a result compucredit has such systematic and continuous contacts with minnesota that it is subject to the general jurisdiction of minnesota’s courts  furthermore with respect to the notes that underlie this suit compucredit has and continues to direct activities toward minnesota through its relationship with the indenture trustee us bank on information and belief us bank services the notes through its offices in minnesota including receiving fees and any payments to noteholders  venue is appropriate in this district pursuant to  usc § a a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred in this district and this action concerns notes which are administered by an indenture trustee sitting in this district  case cvjmrfln document  filed  page  of  facts  compucredit is according to its investor relations website “a provider of various credit and related financial services and products to or associated with the underserved or subprime consumer credit market” within this subprime consumer credit market compucredit has four main business segments  credit cards  auto lending  retail microloans and  jefferson capital systems llc a “subsidiary that provides innovative and nontraditional debt recovery solutions”  compucredit while its stock is publicly traded on nasdaq under the ticker symbol “ccrt” is primarily owned by corporate insiders the company’s chairman and ceo david hanna together with his brother owns approximately  of the company’s equity and the chief operating officer and an outside director together own nearly  of the company’s stock although they each disclaim beneficial ownership of at least some portion of their holdings  upon information and belief neither compucredit holdings nor its predecessor corporation has ever paid a dividend to stockholders in fact compucredit’s investor relations website continues to state that the company has a policy of not paying dividends specifically compucredit’s website states does compucredit pay dividends does compucredit have a dividend reinvestment plan compucredit currently does not pay dividends we are guided by a strategy focusing on longterm success and believe the best opportunity for long term appreciation of our capital is continue to finance our operations and growth  case cvjmrfln document  filed  page  of  “investors faq” available at httpinvestorcompucreditcomphoenixzhtmlcpirolfaq last accessed december   compucredit is admittedly hemorrhaging cash and facing a liquidity crisis  the widespread and wellknown problems in the subprime financial services sectors have hit compucredit especially hard as the company made clear when it declared that it is facing a liquidity crisis in its most recent q quarterly filing with the sec dated november   the “november q” specifically the company declared that “we have no meaningful access to liquidity” and that “significant uncertainties” exist as to when liquidity markets will improve  in the november q the company also declared that it had lost  million in the last quarter and a total of  million in the last year to date it stated that as of september   the company’s shareholders possessed only  million in equity a number which if it is not overstated only narrowly exceeds the amount it has lost in the last quarter  moreover on information and belief reasonable adjustments to compucredit’s reported equity based upon disclosures regarding its offbalance sheet risks and noncash adjustments renders its liabilities greater than its assets by approximately  million thus on a proforma balance sheet basis the company is insolvent or imminently so the ability of compucredit to pay debts generally as they become due is increasingly in doubt absent extreme unexpected and immediate improvement in its operations  case cvjmrfln document  filed  page  of   given these dramatic losses the company repeatedly emphasized the need to preserve its remaining capital in the november q for instance the company reduced operating expenses resulting from “decreases in marketing and solicitation costs due to our desire to preserve capital given the ongoing dislocation of the liquidity markets and our corresponding scale back of our credit card marketing efforts… ” the company further stated that “given our current focus on costcutting and capital preservation in light of the continuing dislocation in the liquidity markets and significant uncertainties as to when those markets will improve we expect further reductions in marketing efforts and expense levels and in most other cost categories … in the next several quarters” emphasis added the company further stated that it was managing its business “with the assumption that the liquidity markets will not return to more traditional levels in the near term”  compucredit’s near term financial outlook is particularly bleak in light of imminent substantial financial obligations in january  the company’s  million credit facility its largest expires compucredit has disclosed that “our failure to renew or replace a maturing financing or securitization facility except where the facility may represent excess and unneeded capacity could potentially result in  asset seizures by our lenders or investors which in turn would result in impairments to the book value of our equity andor  accelerated repayment amortization schedules including early amortization which over time could impair the profitability of the assets underlying the facility” in the face of the abysmal credit environment for compucredit’s business the company’s heavy dependence on securitizations and other borrowings to finance its  case cvjmrfln document  filed  page  of  operations greatly increases the risk of asset fire sales and other measures detrimental to its financial viability  as compucredit is aware the holders of the  notes have a right to put those notes in may  in the november q compucredit indicated that it will not be able to meet that obligation through operation of its business given the current financial state of the company even before announcing the dividend and must rely on the speculative possibility that it can raise the money through securities offerings specifically compucredit stated that “given our current liquidity position and future liquidity prospects …  we may need to rely on debt or equity issuances or possible exchange offerings none of which are assured in order to meet our may  obligation to satisfy in cash payments conversions of” the  notes “of which  million in face amount is outstanding” emphasis added  in the november q compucredit stated that it intended to pursue a strategy to compromise the rights of the noteholders specifically the company assured shareholders that it would “evaluate and pursue additional opportunities to repurchase our convertible senior notes … at discounts to face amounts” compucredit announces plan to strip the company’s cash and spin off only profitable segment  less than a month after declaring that the company was “focused on cost cutting and capital preservation” and in spite of its stated policy not to pay dividends compucredit issued a press release on december   the “press release” announcing that “its board of directors has declared a dividend of  per share payable  case cvjmrfln document  filed  page  of  to holders of record as of the close of trading on december  ” to be paid “on or after december   but not later than february  ” the press release also stated that the company’s board “also is evaluating the declaration of additional cash dividends in the future”  with nearly  million shares currently outstanding this announced dividend will result in the stripping of almost  million of the company’s rapidly dwindling assets with over half of that amount going to corporate insiders  the announced dividend flies in the face of the company’s staggering ongoing losses its acknowledgement of the dire credit environment in which it is operating and its stated goal of preserving capital to shore up its operations  the announced dividend is transparently intended to force the noteholders to convert the notes at a significant discount by telling them that the company has no interest in fulfilling its obligations under the notes just as the company suggested that it would do in the november q the press release is not bashful about the company’s intentions to shortchange noteholders stating that “the payment of this cash dividend will entitle holders of the companys convertible notes to convert their notes and receive using an assumed december   closing trading price of the company’s stock either approximately  or approximately  for each  face amount of notes depending upon which series is held”  just in case noteholders did not get the message that compucredit did not intend to fulfill its obligations under the notes the company also announced in the press release that “it is considering a taxfree spinoff of its us and uk microloan  case cvjmrfln document  filed  page  of  businesses into a publiclytraded company called purpose financial holdings inc” according to the press release “the businesses to be evaluated for spinoff had revenues of approximately  million and  million for the nine months ended september   and year ended december   respectively”  in other words the press release told noteholders that while the company as a whole was losing money to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars per quarter the company was proposing to spin off the only portion of the business that had been generating revenue over  million in annual revenues and take another  million out of the corporate coffers primarily for the benefit of insiders the message to noteholders is clear convert your notes because the company’s management has no interest in leaving the company with enough assets to pay you what you are due these actions are not only an unfair inversion of the traditional preference for debt holders over equity holders they are barred by the uniform fraudulent transfer act and the georgia corporate code count i uniform fraudulent transfer act  plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs  as though set forth fully herein  the uniform fraudulent transfer act provides in section  that a transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor if the debtor made the transfer “without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation” – surely the case here – and the debtor either “was engaged or was about to engage in a  case cvjmrfln document  filed  page  of  business or a transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction” or “intended to incur or believed or reasonably should have believed that he or she would incur debts beyond his or her ability to pay as they became due”  the transaction is a fraudulent transfer because the company is planning the transaction to purposefully divert cash and assets to insiders leaving “remaining assets” that are “unreasonably small” and debts that are “beyond the company’s ability to pay” each element of the transaction individually constitutes a fraudulent transfer for the same reasons  alternatively section four of the uniform fraudulent transfer act provides that a transfer is fraudulent if made “with actual intent to hinder delay or defraud any creditor of the debtor”  the transaction is a fraudulent transfer because it is intended to enrich the insiders of the company and to hinder the creditors especially the noteholders each element of the transaction individually constitutes a fraudulent transfer for the same reasons  moreover as to the noteholders whose claims arose prior to the transaction a transfer is fraudulent under section five “if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer … and the debtor was insolvent at that time or the debtor became insolvent as a result of the transfer”  case cvjmrfln document  filed  page  of   the transaction is a fraudulent transfer under section five because compucredit is not receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transaction and compucredit is insolvent or will become insolvent as a result of the transaction each element of the transaction individually constitutes a fraudulent transfer for the same reasons  section seven of the uniform fraudulent transfers act entitles plaintiff to relief including “avoidance of the transfer or obligation to the extent necessary to satisfy the creditor’s claim” “an injunction against further disposition by the debtor … of the asset transferred or of other property” or “any other relief the circumstances may require”  plaintiffs are entitled to both a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining the transaction a plaintiffs will establish on the merits that the transaction constitutes an illegal fraudulent transfer b because the transaction will serve to dissipate the company’s assets and cripple its ability to earn future revenue if it is allowed to proceed plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury and will be left without any adequate remedy at law c the potential harm to plaintiffs outweighs any harm likely to be suffered by the defendant by an injunction barring the transaction d an injunction barring the company from proceeding with the transaction will not be adverse to the public interest  case cvjmrfln document  filed  page  of  wherefore plaintiffs requests a preliminary and permanent injunction barring the company from proceeding with the dividend and the spin off or any other transfer of assets without approval of the court as well as an award of any damages and costs count ii georgia corporate code  plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs  as though set forth fully herein  the georgia corporate code does not permit dividends if after the dividend is paid the company would be insolvent on a balance sheet or cash flow basis specifically a dividend may not be made if after distribution of the dividend “the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business” or “the corporations total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities… ” ga code ann § c  the company will not be able to meet its obligations under the notes if it makes the announced dividend andor the company’s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities  plaintiffs are entitled to both a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining the dividend a plaintiffs will establish on the merits that the dividend is barred by the georgia corporate code  case cvjmrfln document  filed  page  of  b because the dividend will serve to dissipate the company’s rapidly dwindling assets if it is allowed to proceed plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury and will be left without any adequate remedy at law c the potential harm to plaintiffs outweighs any harm likely to be suffered by the defendant by an injunction barring the dividend d an injunction barring the company from proceeding with the dividend will not be adverse to the public interest wherefore plaintiffs request a preliminary and permanent injunction barring the company from proceeding with the dividend as well as an award of any damages and costs prayer for relief wherefore plaintiffs respectfully request that the court     enter judgment in favor of plaintiffs and against defendant grant plaintiffs preliminary and permanent injunctive relief barring defendant from proceeding with the dividend and the spin off or any other transfer of assets without approval of the court award plaintiffs their costs disbursements attorneys’ fees and

for the case christopher w madel and k craig wildfang  robins kaplan miller  ciresi llp  lasalle plaza  lasalle avenue minneapolis mn  for plaintiff jeff i ross  ross  orenstein llc  south ninth street suite  minneapolis mn  for defendant memorandum opinion and order transfering venue john r tunheim district judge the question before the court is whether exercising jurisdiction over a lawsuit filed in minnesota while the same parties are currently involved in litigation in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia after a venue change is proper the court ordered the parties to submit simultaneous supplemental briefing on the issues of jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure a compulsory counter claims and the doctrine of abstention as outlined in colorado river water conservation dist v united states  us    see also mo ex rel nixon v prudential health care plan inc  fd   th cir  both parties have responded for the reasons set forth below the court transfers venue to the northern district of georgia background the defendants in this litigation collectively noteholders were plaintiffs in an earlier action brought in the district of minnesota against compucredit holdings corporation compucredit who is the plaintiff in this action akanthos capital mgmt llc et al v compucredit holdings corp case no cv d minn dec   hereinafter the georgia litigation in that litigation compucredit moved for a transfer of venue under  usc § a citing expense and the convenience of the parties the court granted the request for a change of venue to the northern district of georgia within weeks of the transfer compucredit filed suit in minnesota alleging antitrust violations the minnesota litigation docket no  the allegations in the minnesota litigation are closely related to the issues in the georgia litigation for example noteholders complaint in the georgia litigation alleges that on december   compucredit announced a plan to give away  million and spin off a profitable subsidiary primarily to insiders compl ¶  docket no  this announcement resulted in a dramatic drop in the trading prices of compucredit notes after the drop in prices compucredit initiated a tender offer for the notes at the lower prices noteholders boycotted this tender offer which is a key fact in compucredits antitrust claims in the minnesota litigation id noteholders initiated the georgia litigation to try to protect the value of their shares and were required to enter into settlement negotiations with compucredit portions of which are now a part of the allegations of conspiracy in the minnesota litigation id ¶ discussion a district court should    consider abstaining from exercising jurisdiction in a case where a parallel    lawsuit is pending the court may raise the issue of the appropriateness of abstention sua sponte cincinnati indem co v a  k const co  fd   th cir  discussing abstention in a case involving parallel federal and state claims internal citations omitted courts in other jurisdictions have similarly noted that federal courts should avoid duplicitous litigation ongoing in other federal courts particularly when potentially compulsory counterclaims are involved natl equip rental ltd v fowler  fd   d cir  further  usc § a the general transfer provision provides for the convenience of the parties and witnesses in the interest of justice a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought in analyzing a motion to transfer under § a a district court employs a threefactor balancing test that considers  the convenience of the parties  the convenience of the witnesses and  the interests of justice terra intl inc v miss chem corp  fd   th cir  these factors are not exclusive and a district courts decision on a motion to transfer requires a casebycase evaluation of the particular circumstances at hand and a consideration of all relevant factors id ultimately a district court enjoys much discretion when deciding whether to grant a motion to transfer id at  see also cent regl emps benefit fund v smithkline beecham corp no   wl  at  d minn aug   in the instant case the court finds that the relevant factors to the decision to transfer venue are whether the issues raised in the minnesota litigation could be considered compulsory counterclaims and whether the colorado river doctrine of abstention is implicated i venue considerations in the georgia litigation the court found that venue transfer was warranted primarily for the expense and convenience of the parties regarding the first factor of the balancing test the court noted that all of the parties are corporations more than twothirds of whom have no ties to minnesota at all hrg on mot to change venue at  docket no  akanthos capital mgmt llc et al no cv d minn mar   further noteholders claimed compucredit was insolvent so the court found that none of the parties would be served by the increased expense of litigating in minnesota as opposed to georgia where compucredit is located id at  regarding the second factor the court also noted that the primary witnesses in the case were located in georgia and that no fact witnesses were located in minnesota id at  finally on the third factor the court noted the considerations for evaluating the interests of justice are the relative familiarity of the two courts with the law to be applied the relative ability of the parties to bear the expenses of litigating in a distant forum judicial economy the plaintiffs choice of forum obstacles to a fair trial and each partys ability to enforce a judgment id at  citing graff v qwest commcns corp  fsuppd   d minn  the court determined the last consideration was not relevant and the others either carried no weight or were equally balanced with the exception of the ability to bear the costs of the litigation id at  again the court cited compucredits potential insolvency as determinative on this point id the court finds that the earlier determination on these three factors is applicable to the instant litigation since the parties are the same and the issues to be litigated revolve around the same factual scenarios the court notes that the instant litigation presents further issues related to judicial economy and the interests of justice that support a transfer of venue that were not present in the georgia litigation the potential of compulsory counterclaims and colorado river concerns of duplicative litigation ii compulsory counterclaims while a claim that could be a compulsory counterclaim in a different litigation does not necessarily make venue improper courts have noted that when there undoubtedly are judicial economy and preclusion issues involved    the availability of a counterclaim in another court is a factor to consider in determining whether to transfer the case pursuant to  usc § a jomico llc v traxys n am llc no   wl  at  ed okla june   emphasis omitted without determining precisely if claims were compulsory counterclaims other courts have transferred cases to districts with pending litigation in part because even if the cases are not ultimately consolidated having the matters resolved in the same forum will increase the probability of consistent results neb beef ltd v advanced food co inc no cv  wl  at  d neb july   see also avaya inc v mitel networks corp  fsuppd   ed va  the federal rules of civil procedure state a pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim that — at the time of its service — the pleader has against an opposing party if the claim a arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing partys claim and b does not require adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction fed r civ p a the allegations in the minnesota litigation are factually intertwined with the claims asserted in the georgia litigation indeed one portion of the instant motion concerns settlement negotiations that occurred in the georgia litigation prior to the venue transfer the eighth circuit applies the logical relation test to determine if a counterclaim is mandatory tullos v parks  fd   th cir  under that test compulsory counterclaims may comprehend a series of many occurrences depending not so much upon the immediateness of their connection as upon their logical relationship id citing moore v n y cotton exch  us    under this test the allegations in this complaint are logically related to those in the georgia litigation since they are the reactions of two parties to each others actions around the sale of the notes at issue in this manner the two lawsuits are intrinsically intertwined the court declines to determine whether the claims in the minnesota litigation are actually compulsory counterclaims — this determination properly belongs with the court hearing the underlying claims however the court finds that the probability that the minnesota claims are compulsory in the georgia litigation weighs in favor of transferring venue in the interests of justice iii colorado river the supreme court has noted that when an action in federal court is closely related to an action already pending in state court prudential factors should be considered when deciding whether to exercise federal jurisdiction colo river  us at  the principle of avoiding duplicative litigation is even stronger with regard to parallel proceedings in two federal courts id at  see also mo ex rel nixon  fd at  when faced with duplicative litigation a court has at its disposal a variety of mechanisms    to deal with this issue such as venue transfer     mastro v momot no   wl  at  d ariz july   see also haworth inc v herman miller inc  fsupp   nd ga  where exceptional circumstances grounded on considerations of wise judicial administration giving regard to conservation of judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of litigation exist a district court may decline to review a case where proper jurisdiction exists or transfer the case to a more appropriate venue internal quotation marks omitted citing colorado river  us at  given identical parties and the similarity of issues presented in the instant case the court finds that the colorado river principle of avoiding duplicative litigation is a relevant factor in the interests of justice weighing in favor of venue transfer in sum the court determines that the convenience of the parties and witnesses weighs in favor of venue transfer further for the interests of justice the purpose of judicial economy and to avoid potentially duplicitous proceedings with contradictory outcomes the court transfers venue for the instant case to united states district court for the northern district of georgia through its discretionary power under  usc § a order based on the above considerations it is hereby ordered that this case is transferred to the united states district court for the northern district of georgia footnotes  under section a a court must first determine whether the action might have been brought in the proposed transferee district however given that the minnesota district court previously reached this conclusion with regard to the same parties and over intrinsically similar factual allegations this court does not repeat this analysis hrg on mot to change venue akanthos capital mgmt llc et al case no cv d minn mar   comment your name your email comments  characters remaining leaglecom reserves the right to edit
