fund  click to explore subpages our investment philosophy why the arch building our portfolio why are we different how we think bookshelf why the arch as the supporting scaffolding was removed following the completion of a roman arch the responsible engineer was required to stand beneath it this approach ensured that the engineer designed and built the arch with a substantial margin of safety at cook  bynum we have applied the lessons of this highly effective quality control system in two distinct ways  first we only make investments in companies whose securities provide an appropriate “margin of safety” – meaning they trade at a significant discount to our appraisal of their intrinsic values  second we believe it is imperative to have our interests closely and fully aligned with those of our investors to accomplish this objective we invest substantially all of our liquid net worth alongside our investors and are more than willing to “eat our own cooking”  as a result we manage our partners’ money exactly how we manage our own we feel it is essential to our longterm success that we have partners who share our goals so we seek those who are focused on longterm investment results rather than shortterm market fluctuations  having partners focusing on the latter will almost certainly compromise our longterm results learn more building our portfolio

investment philosophy why the arch building our portfolio why are we different how we think bookshelf building our portfolio establishing and sizing positions we typically build concentrated positions in equity securities as we prefer to invest more capital in our best ideas recognizing that bigger stakes can be taken when information is adequate and outcomes are more certain  our assessment of the attractiveness of each potential investment is informed by our deep research shaped by our requirement of a ‘margin of safety’ and driven by the strict application of our core criteria among other considerations  this approach reflects our desire to make investments only when we feel that risk is low and potential returns are high  consistent with our longrange investment horizon we define risk as the probability that a business performs materially worse than we predict leading to a permanent loss of capital rather than a temporary decrease in the quoted price of a stock  we specifically reject the concept that price volatility is a form of risk and instead consider it our friend – an opportunity to either buy a business cheaply or sell it dearly  in fact because we anticipate being a large net purchaser of companies for the foreseeable future we welcome low and declining prices to build positions – even in positions we currently hold  we are only concerned with the intrinsic value of the businesses in which we invest  stagnant or declining prices in the face of solid business performance are simply an opportunity to own a greater proportion of the future profits of a business   the position size of and concentration in each of our ideas are influenced by the kelly criterion  our main takeaway from kelly is that a position’s size should be a function of both the security’s expected return and its potential range of outcomes such that although the math cannot be done explicitly in investing it implies two critical points when thinking about how big a position should be in a portfolio with the first point being more obvious than the second i     the larger the expected return the bigger the position should be and ii    the larger the possible range of outcomes the smaller the position should be as absolute value investors we are comfortable holding cash and equivalents in the absence of compelling opportunities that meet our minimum hurdle rate requirements  it is our obligation to not put our partners’ capital in harm’s way without the prospect of an adequate return and cash allows us to act quickly in volatile andor falling markets  we are staunch adherents to the belief that the avenue to superior returns is being “fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful”  this investment strategy may not be the best way to earn high returns in any given year but we believe it yields a portfolio that avoids the permanent capital losses endemic to shortterm strategies and earns the highest cumulative returns over a  year time horizon selling positions while our longterm approach typically produces low turnover and extended holding periods we will generally sell a security under the following conditions »  we will begin to liquidate an investment when it appreciates to the point that it approaches or moves beyond our estimate of its intrinsic value  an investment reaching our appraisal may have further upside potential but it will no longer offer an appropriate margin of safety for putting capital at risk »  we will also sell any investment that has a material adverse change in business management or return prospects since we invested  negative developments by themselves do not necessarily trigger the selling of a position but should an event lower our appraisal enough or prevent us from reliably appraising the intrinsic value of the investment we will sell it  positive events may cause us to adjust our appraisal of value upwards  we appraise our positions on an ongoing basis throughout the life of the investment »  based on opportunity cost considerations we will generally sell relatively overpriced securities to buy relatively underpriced securities as these specific opportunities arise  this situation happens most often in times of market dislocations or disruptions learn more why are we different sec info  cook  bynum funds trust et al  ‘naa’ on  sec info uses javascript  to

“fund” what is the funds investment objective the funds investment objective is longterm growth of capital  what are the funds principal investment strategies cook  bynum capital management llc the “adviser” attempts under normal circumstances to achieve the fund’s investment objective by acquiring underpriced equity securities of us and nonus companies and holding them until they reach in the adviser’s opinion full value  in pursuing this strategy the adviser focuses upon equity securities including common stocks depository receipts partnership interests business trust shares securities convertible into equity and rights and warrants to subscribe for the purchase of such equity securities without regard to market capitalization or other categorizations  the adviser can invest up to  of the fund’s assets using this strategy after accounting for cash needs  however it is not always possible to find enough undervalued equity securities to fill a portfolio and the adviser believes that it is unwise to buy when it cannot find bargains relative to all other available investment options  accordingly in instances where the adviser is unable to source sufficient equity opportunities for the fund it seeks to supplement the equity portion of the fund’s portfolio with investments in “special situations” “foreign debt” and “cash positions” as described in more detail below the fund is a nondiversified mutual fund but intends to adhere to the minimum diversification requirements required of a regulated investment company under section  of the internal revenue code “irc”  in pursuing its objective the fund uses a value investment philosophy in selecting equity securities  this investment philosophy is based upon the belief that over time an undervalued company’s stock price will converge with its true intrinsic value  the adviser defines intrinsic value as the actual value of a company based on an underlying perception of its true value including all facets of the business both tangible and intangible  the fund uses fundamental analysis to assess the intrinsic value of a targeted enterprise  this analysis attempts to identify and quantify certain desirable characteristics of a company  such characteristics include proven management wellreasoned capital allocation policies a conservative balance sheet and accounting sustainable competitive advantage potential for longterm growth low market price in comparison to tangible asset values significant free cash flow and intelligent investment of excess cash  the adviser defines free cash flow as the cash a company would produce annually from operations after all cash expenditures necessary to maintain the business in its current status  the adviser sells securities based on a simple opportunity cost analysis  if the adviser believes that the price of a security has gotten so high relative to the adviser’s appraised value of the security that a margin of safety no longer exists and that the fund would be better served by holding cash or an alternate security the subject portfolio security will be sold  similarly the adviser will sell relatively overpriced to value securities to buy relatively underpriced to value securities  the third selling criterion is if a material adverse change occurs in the business or economics of a security such that either the adviser cannot value it or its valuation is lowered below the opportunity cost for other investments  in such cases the security will generally be sold  the adviser makes every effort to hold onto securities until they reach the adviser’s appraised value and in the adviser’s opinion no longer represent sound bargains   the board of trustees reserves the right to change the investment objective of the fund in its sole discretion upon sixty  days prior notice to current shareholders       as noted above in order to supplement the equity portion of the fund’s portfolio during periods of limited opportunity or unfavorable valuation in this type of security the adviser may also make investments in “special situations” “foreign debt” and “cash positions”  since the fund’s goal is long term growth the adviser contemplates a wide range of investment options for the fund within these categories so long as such opportunity meets the overarching requirement of  protecting capital and  providing the maximum growth potential at the lowest possible risk  a potential investment should offer a high probability of an acceptable rate of return over time with low business risk or credit risk business risk and market risk for a bond special situations  the fund also intends to invest in special situations from time to time to achieve its investment objective  a special situation arises when in the opinion of the adviser the securities of a particular company are expected to appreciate within a reasonable time due to developments particularly or uniquely applicable to that company regardless of general business conditions or movements of the market as a whole  developments creating special situations include the following liquidations or reorganizations including those involving companies in or facing bankruptcy recapitalizations or mergers material litigation management changes and technological developments  investments in special situations may be either equity securities or fixedincome securities such as corporate debt which may be in distress as a result of economic or company specific developments  special situation investments may include high yield fixedincome securities or “junk bonds” ie securities that are rated below investment grade by standard  poor’s “sp” or by another nationally recognized statistical rating organization “nrsro” or similar unrated securities  the fund can invest up to  of its assets in special situation investments including junk bonds foreign debt  the fund may invest in fixedincome securities of nonus issuers including  corporate debt securities of nonus companies and shortterm debt obligations of foreign governments and other foreign moneymarket instruments  shortterm debt obligations of foreign governments will generally have a maturity of six months or less and a credit rating of “a” or better by sp or a similar rating by another nrsro  other debt securities of nonus companies including junk bonds may be purchased without regard to nrsro ratings and would generally fall under the category of “special situations”  generally the adviser will chose to invest in foreign debt securities because the adviser believes that a security is mispriced and represents a capital gain opportunity  the adviser does not generally invest in such securities for their income potential foreign securities  equity and debt securities of nonus issuers are referred to as “foreign securities”  the fund may invest up to  of its assets in foreign securities and up to  of its assets in foreign securities from emerging markets and up to  of its assets in foreign debt cash positions  there may be periods when both equity and debt securities are overpriced or the where the adviser may not be able to find enough securities to satisfy the irc diversification requirements  at such time investing in cash and cash alternatives including us treasuries is the default option for the fund  the fund may invest up to  of its assets in this strategy  when the fund holds a significant portion of its assets in cash and cash alternatives it may not meet its investment objective in the absence of compelling longterm equity or debt investments the fund seeks to be opportunistic when the market presents attractive riskreward scenarios especially when both equity and debt securities are overpriced  to avoid running afoul of the irc diversification requirements as a result of a lack of available debt and equity opportunities and to preserve capital and minimize losses the adviser will select cash alternatives as a preferred means of investment until such time as compelling longterm investments become available  when making portfolio allocation decisions the adviser compares its most attractive stock ideas against the cash alternatives and will hold cash and cash equivalents in the absence of other attractive positions  these include us government securities moneymarket funds repurchase agreements and other high quality money market instruments the fund seeks to maintain a certain level of liquidity in its portfolio to meet operating requirements and take advantage of new investment opportunities  in an adverse market climate cash and cash reserves may comprise a significant percentage of the fund’s portfolio      the fund may also use other nonprincipal investment strategies which are described in the fund’s statement of additional information “sai” what are the principal risks of investing in the fund general risks  there is no assurance that the fund will meet its investment objective investors may lose money by investing in the fund  as with all mutual funds an investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency when you sell your fund shares they may be worth less than what you paid for them because the value of the fund’s investments will fluctuate reflecting daytoday changes in market conditions interest rates and numerous other factors market risk prices of equity securities generally fluctuate more than those of other securities such as debt securities  market risk the risk that prices of securities will decrease because of the interplay of market forces may affect a single issuer industry or sector of the economy or may affect the market as a whole  the fund may experience a substantial or complete loss on an individual stock value style risk  over time a value investing style may go in and out of favor causing the fund to sometime underperform other equity funds that use different investing styles the value approach to investing involves the risk that value stocks may remain undervalued  value stocks as a group may underperform the overall equity market for a long period of time while the market concentrates on growth stocks   nondiversified portfolio risk  the fund is “nondiversified” meaning that it invests its assets in a smaller number of companies than many other funds  as a result your investment in the fund has the risk that changes in the value of a single security may have a significant effect on the fund’s net asset value nav  lack of broad diversification also may cause the fund to be more susceptible to economic political or regulatory events than a diversified fund special situations risk  investments in companies involved in special situations such as reorganizations or restructurings may involve greater risks when compared to the fund’s other strategies due to a variety of factors  a reorganization or other restructuring pending at the time the fund invests in a security may not be completed on the terms or within the time frame contemplated resulting in losses to the fund  reorganizations and restructurings that result from actual or potential bankruptcies carry additional risk and the securities of such companies involved in these types of activities are generally more likely to lose value than the securities of more financially stable companies  additionally investments in securities of companies being restructured involve special risks including difficulty in obtaining information as to the financial condition of such issuers the possibility that the issuer’s management may be addressing a type of situation with which it has little experience and the fact that the market prices of such securities are subject to aboveaverage price volatility  furthermore failure to anticipate changes in the circumstances affecting these types of investments may result in permanent loss of capital where the fund may be unable to recoup some or all of its investment      foreign securities risk  the fund has the ability to invest in foreign securities and from time to time a significant percentage of the fund’s assets may be composed of foreign investments securities of foreign issuers foreign currencies and securities issued by us entities with substantial foreign operations may involve significant additional risk  these risks can include political and economic instability foreign taxation different or lower standards in accounting auditing and financial reporting lessdeveloped securities regulation and trading systems fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the risk that a country may impose controls on the exchange or repatriation of foreign currency any of which could negatively affect the fund  many of these risks are greater when investing in countries with developing economies and securities markets also known as “emerging markets” moreover securities of many foreign issuers may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than those of comparable domestic issuers currency risk  the fund is subject to currency risk because fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may negatively affect the value of the fund’s investments in foreign securities  an increase in the strength of the us dollar relative to a foreign currency will generally cause the us dollar value of an investment denominated in that currency to decline  currency risk may be hedged or unhedged however currency hedging is not a principal investment strategy of the fund  unhedged currency exposure may result in gains or losses as a result of the change in the relationship between the us dollar and the respective foreign currency interest rate risk interest rates have an effect on the value of the fund’s fixed income investments because the value of those investments will vary as interest rates fluctuate generally fixed income securities will decrease in value when interest rates rise and when interest rates decline the value of fixed income securities can be expected to rise the longer the effective maturity of the fund’s securities the more sensitive the funds will be to interest rate changes as a general rule a  rise in interest rates means a  fall in value for every year of duration duration is a measure of the average life of a fixedincome security that was developed as a more precise alternative to the concepts of “term to maturity” or “average dollar weighted maturity” as measures of “volatility” or “risk” associated with changes in interest rates credit risk  the fund’s fixed income investments are subject to credit risk  the value of a debt instrument depends in part on the issuer’s or borrowers credit quality or ability to pay principal and interest when due the value of a debt instrument is likely to fall if an issuer or borrower defaults on its obligation to pay principal or interest or if the instruments credit rating is downgraded by a credit rating agency the value of a debt instrument can also decline in response to changes in the financial condition of the issuer or borrower changes in specific market economic industry political and regulatory conditions that affect a particular type of instrument issuer or borrower and changes in general market economic political and regulatory conditions certain unanticipated events such as natural disasters terrorist attacks war and other geopolitical events can have a dramatic adverse effect on the value of a debt instrument for certain types of instruments the value of the instrument depends in part on the credit quality of the counterparty to the transaction for other types of debt instruments including collateralized instruments the price of the debt instrument also depends on the credit quality and adequacy of the underlying assets or collateral enforcing rights against the underlying assets or collateral may be difficult or the underlying assets or collateral may be insufficient if the issuer defaults lower quality debt instruments and certain unrated debt instruments can involve a substantially greater risk of default or can already be in default and their values can decline significantly over short periods of time lower quality debt instruments are regarded as having predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to capacity to pay interest and principal lower quality debt instruments tend to be more sensitive to adverse news about the issuer or the market or economy in general than higher quality debt instruments the market for lower quality debt instruments and certain unrated debt instruments can be less liquid especially during periods of recession or general market decline  the fund does not rely on third party credit ratings to select its investments      small to medium capitalization risk  the fund has the ability to invest in securities of companies with small to medium market capitalizations  such companies may be engaged in business within a narrow geographic region be less well known to the investment community and have more volatile share prices  also companies with smaller market capitalizations often lack management depth have narrower market penetrations less diverse product lines and fewer resources than larger companies  moreover the securities of such companies often have less market liquidity and as a result their stock prices often react more strongly to changes in the marketplace microcap company risk microcap stocks involve substantially greater risks of loss and price fluctuations because their earnings and revenues tend to be less predictable and some companies may be experiencing significant losses and their share prices tend to be more volatile and their markets less liquid than companies with larger market capitalizations microcap companies may be newly formed or in the early stages of development with limited product lines markets or financial resources and may lack management depth in addition there may be less public information available about these companies the shares of microcap companies tend to trade less frequently than those of larger more established companies which can adversely affect the pricing of these securities and the future ability to sell these securities also it may take a long time before the fund realizes a gain if any on an investment in a microcap company high yield or “junk” securities risk  investments in fixedincome securities that are rated below investment grade by one or more nrsros “high yield securities” also known as “junk securities” may be subject to greater risk of loss of principal and interest than investments in higherrated fixedincome securities  high yield securities are also generally considered to be subject to greater market risk than higherrated securities  the capacity of issuers of high yield securities to pay interest and repay principal is more likely to weaken than is that of issuers of higherrated securities in times of deteriorating economic conditions or rising interest rates  in addition high yield securities may be more susceptible to real or perceived adverse economic conditions than higherrated securities  the market for high yield securities may be less liquid than the market for higherrated securities  this can adversely affect the fund’s ability to buy or sell optimal quantities of high yield securities at desired prices management risk   acting as investment adviser to the fund or any registered mutual fund is a new position for the adviser and the fund has no operating history  performance of individual securities can vary widely  the investment decisions of the adviser may cause the fund to underperform benchmark indices  the fund may also underperform other mutual funds with similar investment strategies  the adviser may be incorrect in an assessment of a particular industry or company or the investment adviser may not buy chosen securities at the lowest possible prices or sell securities at the highest possible prices  as with any mutual fund investment there can be no guarantee that the fund will achieve its investment goals      new fund risk  the fund is newly formed and therefore has no performance history for investors to evaluate  in addition certain types of transactions may have a disproportionate impact on the fund’s performance due to the fund’s small size  the fund may also not grow to an economically viable size and thus may be liquidated at a time that is not beneficial for all of its shareholders further discussion about other nonprincipal risks of investing in the fund may be found in the fund’s sai how has the fund performed in the past because this is a new fund that does not yet have an operating history a performance bar chart and table describing the funds annual performance and comparing that

estimated amounts for the current fiscal year but include expense amounts that would have been incurred absent fee waiver arrnagements  cook  bynum capital management llc the fund’s adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees andor reimburse the fund’s expenses to the extent that total fund operating expenses exceed  this agreement is in effect through february   and thereafter is reevaluated on an annual basis the expense reimbursement arrangement relates to aggregate expenses of every character incurred by the fund including but not limited to organizational expenses and investment management fees but excluding interest taxes brokerage commissions and other extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the funds business without this agreement expenses for shares of the fund would be higher the adviser may be permitted to recover expenses it has borne through the agreement described above to the extent that the fund’s expenses in later periods fall below the annual rate set forth in the agreement the fund will not be obligated to pay any such deferred fees and expenses more than three years after the end of the fiscal year in which the fee and expense was deferred   an example of expenses over time   the example below is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds   the example assumes that you invest  in the fund for the time periods indicated reinvest all dividends and distributions and then redeem all your shares at the end of those periods  the example also assumes that your investment has a  return each year and that the funds operating expenses remain the same  although your actual costs may be higher or lower based on these assumptions your costs

management team conflicts of interest in addition to serving as the investment adviser to the fund the adviser acts as the investment adviser to other pooled investment vehicles such as hedge funds  although it is the policy of the adviser to treat all clients fairly and equitably and the adviser has adopted policies and procedures designed to help prevent any particular client from being disadvantaged by the activities of other clients there may be inherent conflicts of interest that may from time to time affect the fund  the board reviews potential conflicts to try to ensure that the fund is not disadvantaged  in addition the codes of ethics of the adviser and the fund contain additional provisions designed to minimize any conflict of interest among the fund and other clients of the adviser  in the context of limited investment opportunities available to the fund and other pooled investment vehicles including hedge funds managed by the adviser the adviser allocates investment opportunities objectively by using a pro rata allocation among each of its investment vehicle clients  there is no guarantee however that the policies and procedures adopted by the adviser and the efforts by the board will be able to detect andor prevent every situation in which an actual or potential conflict of interest may appear      the other pooled investment vehicles managed by the adviser may pursue strategies not available to the fund and may invest in securities in which the fund does not participate as a consequence of their size investment powers or founding documents  additionally the fund as an investment company registered under the investment company act of  as amended the “ act” is subject to the requirements and restrictions of the act and the rules thereunder and therefore may not be able to pursue the same strategies or invest in the same securities as the unregistered investment vehicles such as hedge funds that the adviser manages  in some circumstances the fund may pursue strategies or purchase investments that are not purchased for other accounts of the adviser  as a result of pursuing different strategies and objectives the performance of these accounts may be materially better or worse than that of the fund how to buy and sell shares of the fund investing in the fund determining share prices shares of the fund are offered at each share’s net asset value “nav”  the per share nav is calculated by  adding the value of fund investments cash and other assets  subtracting fund liabilities and then  dividing the result by the number of shares outstanding  the fund’s per share nav is computed on all days on which the new york stock exchange “nyse” is open for business and is based on closing value of the fund’s portfolio securities as of the close of regular trading hours on the nyse currently  pm eastern standard time “est”  nav is calculated as soon as practicable following the close of regular trading on the nyse  in the event that the nyse closes early nav will be determined based on the prices of the fund’s portfolio securities at the time the nyse closes the nyse is closed for the following scheduled holidays new years day martin luther king jr day washingtons birthdaypresidents day good friday memorial day independence day labor day thanksgiving day and christmas the fund generally determines the total value of its shares by using closing market prices for the securities comprising its portfolio  securities for which quotations are not available or are deemed unreliable and any other assets are valued at fair market value as determined in good faith by the adviser pursuant to the fund’s fair value pricing procedures subject to the review and supervision of the board  the adviser may use fair value pricing under circumstances that include but are not limited to the early closing of the exchange on which a security is traded suspension of trading in the security or the release of significant news after the close of regular trading on the nyse  in addition the fund may use fair value pricing for securities traded in nonus markets because among other factors foreign markets may be closed on days or times when us markets are open  when the fund holds securities traded in foreign markets that close prior to us markets significant events including company specific developments or broad market moves may affect the value of foreign securities held by the fund  this is because the fund calculates its nav based on closing prices of the portfolio’s securities as of the close of trading on the nyse which gives rise to the possibility that events may have occurred in the interim that would affect the value of these securities and thus as with us securities would need to be valued by the adviser using the fair value pricing procedures  consequently the fund’s nav may be affected during a period when shareholders are unable to purchase or redeem their shares in the fund  it is intended that the use of the fund’s fair value pricing procedures will result in adjustments to closing market prices of foreign securities that reflect what is believed to be the fair value of those securities at the time the fund calculates its nav  while fair value pricing may be more commonly used with foreign equity securities it may also be used with thinlytraded domestic securities fixed income securities or other assets held by the fund      with respect to any portion of the fund’s assets that are invested in one or more openend management investment companies that are registered under the  act the fund’s net asset value is calculated based upon the net asset values of the registered openend management investment companies in which the fund invests and the prospectuses for these companies explain the circumstances under which those companies will use fair value pricing and the effects of using fair value pricing fair value pricing involves subjective judgments and it is possible that the fair value determined for a security is materially different than the value that could be realized upon the sale of that security minimum

order the securities broker or intermediary will be responsible for any resulting loss after you have established your account and made your first purchase you may also make subsequent purchases by telephone with an authorized bank account  please note that all telephone orders are subject to verification  in addition fund purchases in excess of  will be subject to the payment requirements described in this section consistent with current regulatory requirements it is permissible for financial intermediaries and retirement plan record keepers to aggregate mutual fund orders received prior to  pm est and transmit them to the transfer agent after  pm est policies regarding frequent trading of fund shares the fund was created as a vehicle for longterm investors and not for those who wish to frequently trade shares  management and the board do not believe that investors or speculators seeking to profit from daytoday fluctuations in stock prices and mutual fund portfolios as a whole should be shareholders of the fund  in the opinion of the fund’s management and the board shortterm trading of fund shares creates risks for the fund and its longterm shareholders including disruptions in carrying out the fund’s investment strategies increases in administrative and transactions costs and potential dilution from traders successful at seeking shortterm profits      a portion of the fund’s portfolio may be allocated to investments in foreign securities and such allocation may cause the fund to be susceptible to shortterm trading strategies  this is because foreign securities are typically traded on markets that close before the time the fund calculates its nav at  pm est which gives rise to the possibility that developments may have occurred in the interim that would affect the value of these securities  the time zone differences among international stock markets can allow a shareholder engaging in a shortterm trading strategy to exploit differences in fund share prices that are based on closing prices of foreign securities established some time before the fund calculates its own share price  it is intended that the use of the fund’s fair value pricing procedures will result in adjustments to closing market prices of foreign securities that reflect what is believed to be the fair value of those securities at the time the fund calculates its nav  while there is no assurance the fund expects that the use of fair value pricing in addition to the markettiming policies discussed below will significantly reduce a shareholder’s ability to engage in strategies detrimental to other fund shareholders in order to discourage behavior that can potentially hurt the fund and its longterm shareholders the fund and the board have adopted policies and procedures with respect to market timing and the frequent purchase and redemption of fund shares including the imposition of a redemption fee of  on the value of shares redeemed within  days of purchase see the section titled “redemption fee” below  under its market timing policies and procedures the fund will rely on its chief compliance officer to work in conjunction with the transfer agent or another fund agent to monitor trading patterns that may constitute abusive market timing activities  the fund’s market timing policy establishes a presumption of abusive trading for any investor that attempts to complete three purchase and redemption transactions of shares from the same fund ”roundtrip” within a  day period  if the chief compliance officer determines that impermissible market timing has occurred future purchases may be restricted or prohibited  however sales of fund shares back to the fund or redemptions will continue as permitted by the terms disclosed in the prospectus  the fund does not accommodate frequent purchases and redemptions of fund shares by fund shareholders the redemption fee is not imposed however in certain situations as described in more detail in the section entitled “how to sell redeem your shares  redemption fees” below the ability of the fund and its agents to detect and curtail excessive trading practices may be limited by operational systems and technological limitations  in addition the fund receives purchase exchange and redemption orders through financial intermediaries and cannot always know or reasonably detect excessive trading that may be facilitated by these financial intermediaries or by the use of omnibus account arrangements offered by these financial intermediaries to investors  omnibus account arrangements are common forms of holding shares of the fund particularly among certain financial intermediaries such as brokers and retirement plans  these arrangements often permit the financial intermediary to aggregate its clients’ transactions and ownership positions  in these circumstances the identity of the shareholders often is not known to the fund  the fund will seek to enter into agreements with financial intermediaries so that comparable surveillance and reporting procedures can be applied to omnibus accounts as will be applied to nonomnibus accounts  however there is no guarantee that the reporting and surveillance procedures will be the same across all financial intermediaries or that they will be successful in detecting abusive market timing practices      how to sell redeem your shares your shares of the fund may be redeemed on each day that the nyse is open for trading  you may request the sale of your shares either by mail or by telephone proper form with respect to redemption requests generally means that the redemption requests include    your account number    the number of shares to be redeemed or the dollar value of the amount to be redeemed    all required signatures of all account owners exactly as they are registered on the account    any required medallion signature guarantees and    any supporting legal documentation that is required in the case of estates trusts corporations or partnerships and certain other types of accounts a redemption order placed with respect to an ira account must include in addition to the above a statement of federal tax withholding indicating whether or not you elect to withhold federal taxes and if so the amount you elect  the transfer agent will withhold a mandatory  of the proceeds requested for federal tax unless the shareholder provides alternate instructions to the transfer agent otherwise in writing prior to the transaction a redemption order placed with the transfer agent in proper form received prior to  pm est will be processed on the day it is received by the transfer agent  a redemption order in proper form received after  pm est will result in the

description of the trust and fund the cook  bynum fund the “fund” was organized as a nondiversified series of the cook  bynum funds trust the “trust” on march   and commenced operations on june    the trust is an openend investment company established under the laws of delaware by an agreement and declaration of trust dated march   the “trust agreement”  the affairs of the trust are managed by a board of trustees  the investment adviser to the fund is cook  bynum capital management llc the “adviser”  the board has delegated the daytoday operations of the fund to the adviser which operates the fund under the board’s general supervision   the trust’s declaration of trust permits the board to issue an unlimited number of shares of beneficial interest  the board has the power to designate one or more separate and distinct series andor classes of shares of beneficial interest and to classify or reclassify any unissued shares with respect to such series  currently the fund is the only series of shares being offered by the trust   the funds investment policies objectives and securities options   the funds investment objective and the manner in which the fund pursues that objective are discussed in the prospectus  this section provides additional information concerning the funds principal investment policies and strategies that are discussed in the prospectus as well as information on nonprincipal investment strategies that the fund may also use  any investment strategy or risk discussed below that is not also discussed in the prospectus is considered nonprincipal   the fund is a nondiversified openend investment company which means that the fund can concentrate its investments in a smaller number of companies than a diversified fund  the fund’s principal investment strategies are described in the prospectus  the fund intends to structure its investments so as to enable it to satisfy the requirements for taxation as a regulated investment company under section  of the internal revenue code   the fund may invest in a variety of other securities  the other types of securities in which the fund may invest are listed below along with any restrictions on such investments and where necessary a brief discussion of risks unique to the particular type of security   special situations  from time to time the fund intends to invest in special situations which may involve purchases of securities including but not limited to equity securities noninvestment grade debt securities and securities of companies that are in default  a special situation arises when in the opinion of cook  bynum capital management llc the fund’s investment adviser the “adviser” the securities of a company will within a reasonably estimated time appreciate in value due to company specific developments that are independent of general business or market conditions  such developments and situations include but are not limited to liquidations reorganizations recapitalizations or mergers material litigation technological breakthroughs and new management or management policies  although large and wellknown companies may be involved special situations often involve greater risk than is found in the normal course of investing  see “credit risk” “interest rate risk” and “investment in high yield securities” below for a description of the risks of investing in debt and other fixedincome securities          foreign nonus securities  the fund may invest in securities of nonus companies including but not limited to depository receipts and similar equity securities corporate debt securities and shortterm and longterm debt obligations of foreign governments and other foreign moneymarket instruments  shortterm debt obligations of foreign governments will generally have a maturity of six months or less and a credit rating of “a” or better by standard  poor’s “sp” or a similar rating by another nationally recognized statistical rating organization “nrsro”  other debt securities of nonus companies may be purchased without regard to nrsro ratings and would generally fall under the category of “special situations” see “credit risk” “interest rate risk” and “investment in high yield securities” below for a description of the risks of investing in debt and other fixedincome securities   investments in foreign companies involve certain risks not typically associated with investing in domestic companies  an investment in a foreign company may be affected by changes in currency rates and in exchange control regulations  there may be less publicly available information about a foreign company than about a domestic company because foreign companies may not be subject to the same degree of regulation as us companies  foreign companies generally are not subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards  dividends and interest on foreign securities may be subject to foreign withholding taxes  such taxes may reduce the net return to fund shareholders  foreign securities are often denominated in a currency other than the us dollar  accordingly the fund will be subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in currency values  although the fund will only invest in foreign issuers that are domiciled in nations considered having stable and friendly governments there is the possibility of expropriation confiscation taxation currency blockage or political or social instability that could negatively affect the fund   preferred stock  the fund may invest in shares of preferred stock  preferred shares generally pay dividends at a specified rate and generally have preference over common shares in the payments of dividends and the liquidation of an issuers assets  dividends on preferred shares are generally payable at the discretion of the issuers board of directors  accordingly shareholders may suffer a loss of value if dividends are not paid  the market prices of preferred shares are also sensitive to changes in interest rates and in the issuers creditworthiness  accordingly shareholders may experience a loss of value due to adverse interest rate movements or a decline in the issuers credit rating   convertible securities  traditional convertible securities include corporate bonds notes and preferred stocks that may be converted into or exchanged for common stock andor other securities that also provide an opportunity for equity participation  these securities are generally convertible either at a stated price or a stated rate that is for a specific number of shares of common stock or other security  as with other fixed income securities the price of a convertible security to some extent varies inversely with interest rates  while providing a fixed income stream generally higher in yield than the income derivable from a common stock but lower than that afforded by a nonconvertible debt security a convertible security also affords the investor an opportunity through its conversion feature to participate in the capital appreciation of the common stock into which it is convertible  as the market price of the underlying common stock declines convertible securities tend to trade increasingly on a yield basis and so may not experience market value declines to the same extent as the underlying common stock  when the market price of the underlying common stock increases the price of a convertible security tends to rise as a reflection of the value of the underlying common stock  to obtain such a higher yield the fund may be required to pay for a convertible security an amount in excess of the value of the underlying common stock  common stock acquired by the fund upon conversion of a convertible security will generally be held for so long as such stocks are anticipated to provide the fund with opportunities that are consistent with the funds investment objective and policies          debt securities  the fund may invest in corporate and us government debt securities  corporate debt securities include but are not limited to debt obligations offered by public or private corporations either registered or unregistered  the market value of such securities may fluctuate in response to interest rates and the creditworthiness of the issuer  the fund may invest in debt securities that are noninvestment grade or are in default in accordance with the “special situations” paragraph above  us government debt securities include direct obligations of the us government and obligations issued by us government agencies and instrumentalities  although certain securities issued by the us government its agencies or instrumentalities are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government others are supported only by the credit of that agency or instrumentality  there is no guarantee that the us government will provide support to such agencies or instrumentalities and such securities may involve risk of loss of principal and interest  in addition a security backed by the us treasury or the full faith and credit of the us government is guaranteed only as to the timely payment of interest and principal when held to maturity  the current market prices for such securities are not guaranteed and will fluctuate  certain us government agency securities or securities of us governmentsponsored entities are backed by the right of the issuer to borrow from the us treasury or are supported only by the credit of the issuer or instrumentality  while the us government provides financial support to those us governmentsponsored agencies or instrumentalities no assurance can be given that it will always do so and those securities are neither guaranteed nor issued by the us government  in the case of securities backed by the full faith and credit of the us government shareholders are primarily exposed to interest rate risk   assetbacked securities  the fund may invest in assetbacked securities  the securitization techniques used to develop mortgagerelated securities are being applied to a broad range of financial assets  through the use of trusts and special purpose corporations various types of assets including automobile loans and leases credit card receivables home equity loans equipment leases and trade receivables are being securitized in structures similar to the structures used in mortgage securitizations  for example the fund may invest in collateralized debt obligations “cdos” which include collateralized bond obligations “cbos” collateralized loan obligations “clos” and other similarly structured securities  cbos and clos are types of assetbacked securities  a cbo is a trust which is backed by a diversified pool of highrisk below investment grade fixedincome securities  a clo is a trust typically collateralized by a pool of loans which may include among others domestic and foreign senior secured loans senior unsecured loans and subordinate corporate loans including loans that may be rated below investment grade or equivalent unrated loans  assetbacked securities are subject to risks associated with changes in interest rates and prepayment of underlying obligations  each type of assetbacked security also entails unique risks depending on the type of assets involved and the legal structure used  in some transactions the value of the assetbacked security is dependent on the performance of a third party acting as credit enhancer or servicer  furthermore in some transactions such as those involving the securitization of vehicle loans or leases it may be administratively burdensome to perfect the interest of the security issuer in the underlying collateral and the underlying collateral may become damaged or stolen   credit risk  the fund’s investments are subject to credit risk  an issuer’s credit quality depends on its ability to pay interest on and repay its debt and other obligations  defaulted securities or those expected to default are subject to additional risks in that the securities may become subject to a plan or reorganization that can diminish or eliminate their value  the credit risk of a security may also depend on the credit quality of any bank or financial institution that provides credit enhancement for the security  the fund does not rely on third party credit ratings to select its investments          interest rate risk  the fund’s investments are subject to interest rate risk which is the risk that the value of a security will decline because of a change in general interest rates  investments subject to interest rate risk usually decrease in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates decline  also fixedincome securities with longer maturities typically experience a more pronounced change in value when interest rates change   investment in high yield securities  the fund’s investments in securities that are rated below investment grade by one or more nrsro or rating agency ie ba and lower by moody’s or bb and lower by sp and fitch or if not rated determined by the adviser to be of equivalent quality “high yield securities” are subject to greater risk of loss of principal and interest than higherrated securities  high yield securities are also generally considered to be subject to greater market risk than higherrated securities and the capacity of issuers of high yield securities to pay interest and repay principal is more likely to weaken than is that of issuers of higherrated securities in times of deteriorating economic conditions or rising interest rates  in addition high yield securities may be more susceptible to real or perceived adverse economic conditions than investment grade securities   although the adviser does not rely on the ratings of rating agencies in selecting such investments debt securities rated ba including ba ba and ba by moody’s or bb including bb and bb by sp and fitch are judged to have speculative elements or to be predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer’s ability to pay interest and repay principal  debt securities rated b including b b b b and b by moody’s sp and fitch are judged to have highly speculative characteristics or to be predominantly speculative  such securities may have small assurance of interest and principal payments  securities rated baa including baa baa and baa by moody’s are also judged to have speculative characteristics   the market for high yield securities may be less liquid than the market for higherrated securities which can adversely affect the prices at which high yield securities can be sold  adverse publicity and investor perceptions about high yield securities whether or not based on fundamental analysis may tend to decrease the market value and liquidity of these securities  to the extent that there is no established secondary market for high yield securities the fund may experience difficulty in valuing such securities and in turn the fund’s assets   although the adviser will attempt to reduce the risk inherent in investing in high yield securities through credit analysis and attention to current developments and other trends affecting fixedincome securities losses may occur  certain high yield securities in which the fund may invest may contain call or buyback features that permit the issuers thereof to call or repurchase such securities  such securities may present risks based on prepayment expectations  if an issuer exercises such a provision the fund’s income may decline as a result of a loss of the higher income from such securities   ratings of fixedincome securities by the nrsros are a generally accepted barometer of credit risk although the adviser does not rely on credit ratings in selecting investments  ratings are however subject to certain limitations  the rating of a security is heavily weighted by past developments and does not necessarily reflect probable future conditions  there is frequently a lag between the time a rating is assigned and the time it is updated  in addition there may be varying degrees of difference in the credit risk of securities within each rating category  some securities are rated by more than one of the nrsros and the ratings assigned to the security by the rating agencies may differ  in such an event and for purposes of determining compliance with restrictions on investments for the fund if a security is rated by two or more rating agencies the adviser will deem the security to be rated at the highest rating   unless otherwise indicated references to securities ratings by one rating agency in this sai shall include the equivalent rating by another rating agency          investment companies  the fund may not acquire securities issued by other registered investment companies except as permitted by the investment company act of  as amended the “ act” and rules and regulations thereunder  under section d of the  act the fund may invest only up to  of its total assets in the securities of any one investment company but may not own more than  of the outstanding voting stock of any one investment company the “ limitation” or invest more than  of its total assets in the securities of other investment companies  the fund is subject to the  limitation unless i the fund has received an order for exemptive relief from the  limitation from the sec that is applicable to the fund and ii the fund takes appropriate steps to comply with any conditions in such order   as a shareholder of another registered investment company the fund would bear its pro rata portion of that companys advisory fees and other expenses  such fees and expenses will be borne indirectly by the fund’s shareholders   control or other substantial positions risk  the fund may make investments in the securities of a company for the purpose of affecting the management or control of the company subject to applicable legal restrictions with respect to the investment   these investments impose additional risks for the fund other than a possible decline in the value of the investments  the fund individually or together with other accounts managed by the adviser may obtain a controlling or other substantial position in a public or private company each a “portfolio company”  should the fund and other accounts managed by the adviser obtain such a position the adviser may be required to make filings with the sec concerning holdings in the portfolio company  the application of statutory and regulatory requirements to the fund or to the adviser and its affiliates could restrict activities contemplated by the fund or the adviser and its affiliates with respect to a portfolio company or limit the time and the manner in which the fund is able to dispose of its holdings or hedge such holdings  the fund or the adviser and its affiliates may be required to obtain relief from the sec or its staff prior to engaging in certain activities with respect to a portfolio company that could be deemed a joint arrangement under the  act   the fund may incur substantial expenses when taking control or other substantial positions in a company and there is no guarantee that such expenses can be recouped  in addition the fund’s investments could be frozen in minority positions and the fund could incur substantial losses   the fund could be exposed to various legal claims by a portfolio company its security holders and its creditors arising from among other things the fund’s status as an insider or control person of a portfolio company or from the adviser’s designation of trustees to serve on the boards of trustees of a portfolio company  such legal claims include claims that the fund or the adviser as a controlling person is liable for securities laws violations by the portfolio company or environmental damage or product defects caused by the portfolio company or failure to supervise the portfolio company  such legal claims also include claims that the fund as a control person or significant shareholder of the portfolio company has a fiduciary responsibility to other shareholders in connection with the fund’s voting or investment decisions with respect to its holdings of the portfolio company’s shares  notwithstanding the foregoing neither the fund nor the adviser intend to have unilateral control of any portfolio company and accordingly may be unable to control the timing or occurrence of an exit strategy for any portfolio company          real estate investment trusts  the fund may invest in real estate investment trusts “reits”  equity reits invest directly in real property while mortgage reits invest in mortgages on real property  reits may be subject to certain risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate including declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and local economic conditions overbuilding and increased competition increases in property taxes and operating expenses and variations in rental income  reits pay dividends to their shareholders based upon available funds from operations  it is quite common for these dividends to exceed a reit’s taxable earnings and profits resulting in the excess portion of such dividends being designated as a return of capital  the fund intends to include the gross dividends from such reits in its distribution to its shareholders and accordingly a portion of the funds distributions may also be designated as a return of capital  the fund will pay the fees and expenses that are incurred by the reits in which it invests and that the fund’s shareholders will indirectly bear such fees and expenses   repurchase agreements  the fund may invest a portion of its assets in repurchase agreements “repos” with brokerdealers banks and other financial institutions provided that the funds custodian at all times has possession of the securities serving as collateral for the repos or has proper evidence of book entry receipt of said securities  in a repo the fund purchases securities subject to the sellers simultaneous agreement to repurchase those securities from the fund at a specified price and time as short as one day and as long as several weeksthe repurchase price reflects an agreedupon interest rate during the time of investment  all repos entered into by the fund must be collateralized by us government debt securities the market values of which equal or exceed  of the principal amount of the money invested by the fund  a repo is a loan and therefore exposes the fund to the risk that the party that sells the securities will default on its obligation to repurchase those securities  if that happens the fund can lose money because it may not be able to sell the securities at the agreedupon time and price or because the securities may lose value before they can be sold  if an institution with whom the fund has entered into a repo enters insolvency proceedings the resulting delay if any in the fund’s ability to liquidate the securities serving as collateral could cause the fund some loss if the securities declined in value prior to liquidation  to minimize the risk of such loss the fund will enter into repos only with institutions and dealers considered creditworthy and will not allow more than  of the fund’s assets to be allocated to such investments   derivatives  the fund may invest in a number of different types of “derivative” investments however such investments shall not comprise more than  of the total value of the fund a derivative is an investment whose value depends on or is derived from the value of an underlying security asset interest rate index or currency derivatives may allow the fund to increase or decrease its exposure to certain markets or risks the fund may use derivatives to seek to increase its investment return or for hedging purposes the fund is not required to use derivatives in seeking its investment objective or for hedging and it might not do so options futures and forward contracts are some of the types of derivatives the fund can use the fund may also use other types of derivatives that are consistent with its investment strategies or for hedging purposes   derivatives may be volatile and may involve significant risks the underlying security or other instrument on which a derivative is based or the derivative itself may not perform the way the adviser expects it to some derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss regardless of the size of a fund’s initial investment a fund may also lose money on a derivative investment if the issuer fails to pay the amount due  certain derivative investments held by the fund may be illiquid making it difficult to close out an unfavorable position derivative transactions may require the payment of premiums and can increase portfolio turnover as a result of these risks the fund could realize little or no income or lose money from its investments or a hedge might be unsuccessful          securities lending transactions  the fund may lend its portfolio securities to brokerdealers and banks any such loan must be continuously secured by collateral in cash or cash equivalents maintained on a current basis in an amount at least equal to the market value of the securities loaned by the fund the fund would continue to receive the equivalent of the interest or dividends paid by the issuer on the securities loaned and would also receive an additional return that may be in the form of a fixed fee or a percentage of the collateral the fund would have the right to call the loan and obtain the securities loaned at any time on notice of not more than five business days the fund would not have the right to vote the securities during the existence of the loan but would call the loan to permit voting of the securities if in the advisers judgment a material event requiring a shareholder vote would otherwise occur before the loan was repaid  the fund will not lend more than more than  of the net asset value of the securities comprising its portfolio   in the event of bankruptcy or other default of the borrower the fund could experience both delays in liquidating the loan collateral or recovering the loaned securities and losses including a possible decline in the value of the collateral or in the value of the securities loaned during the period while the fund seeks to enforce its rights thereto b possible subnormal levels of income and lack of access to income during this period and c expenses of enforcing its rights   cash reserves  although the fund will normally hold a focused portfolio comprised primarily of equity securities the fund is not required to be fully invested in common stocks and may maintain a significant portion of its total assets in cash and securities generally considered to be cash equivalents including but not limited to us government securities moneymarket funds repos and other high quality money market instruments  from time to time cash and cash reserves may also include foreign securities including but not limited to shortterm obligations of foreign governments or other high quality foreign moneymarket instruments  the fund and the adviser believe that a certain amount of liquidity in the fund’s portfolio is desirable both to meet operating requirements and to take advantage of new investment opportunities  under adverse market conditions when the fund is unable to find sufficient investments meeting its criteria cash and cash reserves may comprise a large percentage of the fund’s total assets  when the fund holds a significant portion of assets in cash and cash reserves it may not meet its investment objective and the fund’s performance may be negatively affected as a result   restricted and illiquid securities  the fund will not maintain more than  of its net assets in securities that the adviser determines to be illiquid  illiquid securities are securities that may be difficult to sell promptly at an acceptable price because of a lack of an available market and other factors  the sale of some illiquid and other types of securities may be subject to legal restrictions  because illiquid and restricted securities may present a greater risk of loss than other types of securities the fund will not invest in such securities in excess of the limits set forth above  the fund may also invest in securities acquired in a privately negotiated transaction from the issuer or a holder of the issuers securities and which may not be distributed publicly without registration under the securities act of   however the fund will generally not purchase private securities in privately held companies absent a reasonable expectation that the securities purchased will be exchanged converted registered or otherwise made saleable on a public market within two years  restricted and illiquid securities are valued by the adviser in accordance with procedures approved by the trusts board of trustees “board” or “trustees” in a manner intended to reflect the fair market value of such securities  securities that are subject to substantial market and credit risk may have greater liquidity risk          whenissued securities and delayeddelivery transactions  the fund may purchase securities on a whenissued basis and it may purchase or sell securities for delayeddelivery  these transactions occur when securities are purchased or sold by the fund with payment and delivery taking place at some future date  the fund may enter into such transactions when in the adviser’s opinion doing so may secure an advantageous yield andor price to the fund that might otherwise be unavailable  the fund has not established any limit on the percentage of assets it may commit to such transactions but to minimize the risks of entering into these transactions the fund will maintain a segregated account with its custodian consisting of cash or other highgrade liquid debt securities denominated in us dollars or nonus currencies in an amount equal to the aggregate fair market value of its commitments to such transactions   margin purchases  the fund may not purchase securities on margin except i as otherwise provided under rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission “sec” under the  act or by guidance regarding the  act or interpretations thereof and ii that the fund may obtain such shortterm credits as are necessary for the clearance of portfolio transactions and the fund may make margin payments in connection with futures contracts options forward contracts swaps and other financial instruments   inflation risk  this is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money  as inflation increases the value of the fund’s assets can decline as can the value of the fund’s distributions  this risk increases as the fund invests a greater portion of its assets in fixedincome securities with longer maturities   future developments  the fund may take advantage of other investment practices that are not currently contemplated for use by the fund or are not available but may yet be developed to the extent such investment practices are consistent with the fund’s investment objective and legally permissible for the fund  such investment practices if they arise may involve risks that exceed those involved in the activities described above  the fund will sticker its prospectus andor statement of additional information as appropriate to describe such investment practices that are not currently contemplated for use by the fund   masterfeeder option  notwithstanding its other investment policies the fund may seek to achieve its investment objective by investing all of its investable net assets in another investment company having the same investment objective and substantially the same investment policies and restrictions as those of the fund  although such an investment may be made in the sole discretion of the trustees the funds shareholders will be given  days prior notice of any such investment  there is no current intent to make such an investment   portfolio turnover  the fund has no operating history and therefore has no annual reportable portfolio turnover  the fund will generally purchase and sell securities without regard to the length of time the security has been held  accordingly it can be expected that the rate of portfolio turnover will not be substantial  the fund expects that its annual portfolio turnover rate will not exceed  under normal conditions  however there can be no assurance that the fund will not exceed this rate and the portfolio turnover rate may vary from year to year   high portfolio turnover in any year will result in the payment by the fund of aboveaverage transaction costs and could result in the payment by shareholders of aboveaverage amounts of taxes on realized investment gains  distributions to shareholders of such investment gains to the extent they consist of shortterm capital gains will be considered ordinary income for federal income tax purposes        portfolio turnover rate is calculated by dividing  the lesser of purchases or sales of portfolio securities for the fiscal year by  the monthly average of the value of portfolio securities owned during the fiscal year  a  turnover rate would occur if all the securities in the funds portfolio with the exception of securities whose maturities at the time of acquisition were one year or less were sold and either repurchased or replaced within one year   disclosure of portfolio holdings   the fund has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent selective disclosure of the fund’s portfolio holdings to third parties  portfolio holdings are generally disclosed as required by law or regulation on a quarterly basis through reports to shareholders or filings with the sec within  days after quarter end  the fund may also make disclosures pursuant to a legitimate business purpose such as to service providers or brokerdealers in connection with the performance of services for the fund as long as the recipient has been notified or has executed an agreement to the effect that it is subject to a duty of confidentiality and may not trade in securities on the basis of nonpublic information that may be included in these disclosures  the fund reserves the right to request certifications from senior officers of a recipient that the recipient is using the information only in a manner consistent with fund’s portfolio holdings disclosure policy and procedures and any applicable confidentiality agreement  consistent with the aforementioned each of the following third parties has been approved to receive information concerning the fund’s portfolio holdings i the fund’s independent registered public accounting firm ii the fund’s custodian iii the fund’s transfer agent iv the fund’s administrator and v the fund’s accountant  in addition the fund’s  chief compliance officer or hisher designee may also authorize disclosure of the fund’s portfolio holdings to other persons after considering whether the fund has a legitimate business purpose in providing such information on a selective basis b the procedures that will be used to ensure that such information remains confidential and is not traded upon and c whether such disclosure is in the best interest of the shareholders of the fund and will report such authorizations to the board  such disclosures should also only be made if the recipient has been notified or has executed an agreement to the effect that it is subject to a duty of confidentiality and may not trade in securities on the basis of nonpublic information that may be included in these disclosures and the fund will reserve the right to request certifications from senior officers of a recipient that the recipient is using the information only in a manner consistent with fund’s portfolio holdings disclosure policy and procedures and any applicable confidentiality agreement  disclosure of nonpublic portfolio holdings to third parties may only be made if the cco or hisher designee determines that such disclosure is not impermissible under applicable law or regulation  the trustees will at least annually review information regarding the nature of any such disclosures and recipients  if the trustees determine that any such disclosure was inappropriate the trustees will take such actions as they deem necessary and appropriate to protect the interests of shareholders   the fund believes that the foregoing policies and procedures reduce the likelihood of conflicts between the interests of shareholders and affiliates of the fund  both the adviser and the fund have codes of ethics that govern conflicts of interest and that are designed to minimize the possibility that employees of the fund or the adviser will act in a manner inconsistent with their duties to the fund and its shareholders  no person will receive compensation of any kind in connection with the disclosure of nonpublic information pertaining to the funds portfolio holdings          investment restrictions   the restrictions listed below are fundamental policies and may be changed only with the approval of a “majority of the outstanding voting securities” of the fund as defined in the investment company act of  the “ act”  as provided in the  act a vote of a majority of

fund will not mortgage pledge hypothecate or in any manner transfer as security for indebtedness more than onethird of the funds assets    the fund is prohibited from purchasing any security while outstanding borrowings by the fund represent more than  of the funds total assets  please see the first fundamental restriction above for an overview of current pronouncements regarding the

of net assets in an industry or group of industries the  act limits the ability of investment companies to borrow and lend money and to underwrite securities the  act currently prohibits an openend fund from issuing senior securities as defined in the  act except under very limited circumstances  additionally the  act limits the funds ability to borrow money prohibiting the funds from issuing senior securities except a fund may borrow from any bank provided that immediately after any such borrowing there is an asset coverage of at least  for all borrowings by the fund and provided further that in the event that such asset coverage shall at any time fall below  the fund shall within three days thereafter or such longer period as the sec may prescribe by rules and regulations reduce the

the portfolio management team does not manage accounts for any other registered investment company other than the cook  bynum fund  as of this date the fund had not commenced operations conflicts of interest the adviser seeks to treat all clients including the fund and privately offered pooled investment vehicles fairly and equitably and has adopted policies and procedures designed to ensure that no client is disadvantaged over another where both clients have the ability to invest in similar securities  special attention is paid to situations where the activities of the fund may conflict with the activities of other advisory clients so that the fund is not disadvantaged there is no guarantee however that the policies and procedures adopted by the adviser will be able to detect andor prevent every situation in which an actual or potential conflict may appear        although all clients of the adviser have funds managed with the same overall investment philosophy not all clients use the same specific investment strategies to achieve their goals  furthermore different clients of the adviser have different restrictions on their permitted activities whether by statute contract or instruction of the client  as a consequence of employing differing strategies and taking into account total asset size and investment restrictions the fund and privatelyoffered pooled vehicles may own different securities and performance may materially differ specifically the pooled investment vehicles are typically permitted to invest without regard to liquidity have “lockup” or other provisions restricting liquidity on behalf of investors and may pursue strategies not available to the fund or other clients including but not limited to the use of derivatives shortselling the purchase of unregistered securities in private companies or other investments prohibited by the  act statute law charter or contract the fund may use specific strategies not employed by privately offered pooled investment vehicles managed by the adviser due to its ability to pursue investments in among other types of investments distressed debt special situations and illiquid securities  furthermore privately offered pooled investment vehicles may be more concentrated in specific securities and therefore generate higher or lower returns than the account of the fund where concentrations are limited by the  act or other statutes other  potential conflicts include allocation of limited time and attention  a portfolio manager who is responsible for managing multiple funds andor accounts may devote unequal time and attention to the management of those funds andor accounts  as a result the portfolio manager may not be able to formulate as complete a strategy or identify equally attractive investment opportunities for each of those accounts as might be the case if he or she were to devote substantially more attention to the management of a single fund  the effects of this potential conflict may be more pronounced where funds andor accounts overseen by a particular portfolio manager have different investment strategies allocation of limited investment opportunities  if a portfolio manager identifies a limited investment opportunity that may be suitable for multiple funds andor accounts the opportunity may be allocated among these several funds or accounts which may limit a fund’s ability to take full advantage of the investment opportunity selection of brokersdealers  portfolio managers may be able to select or influence the selection of the brokers and dealers that are used to execute securities transactions for the funds andor account that they supervise  in addition to executing trades some brokers and dealers provide portfolio managers with brokerage and research services as those terms are defined in section e of the  act which may result in the payment of higher brokerage fees than might have otherwise been available  these services may be more beneficial to certain funds or accounts than to others  although the payment of brokerage commissions is subject to the requirement that the portfolio manager determine in good faith that the commissions are reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided to the fund a portfolio manager’s decision as to the selection of brokers and dealers could yield disproportionate costs and benefits among the funds andor accounts that he or she manages        variation in compensation  a conflict of interest may arise where the financial or other benefits available to the portfolio manager differ among the funds andor accounts that he or she manages  if the structure of the investment adviser’s management fee andor the portfolio manager’s compensation differs among funds andor accounts such as where certain funds or accounts pay higher management fees or performancebased management fees the portfolio manager might be motivated to help certain funds andor accounts over others  the portfolio manager might be motivated to favor funds andor accounts in which he or she has an interest or in which the investment advisor andor its affiliates have interests  similarly the desire to maintain or raise assets under management or to enhance the portfolio manager’s performance record or to derive other rewards financial or otherwise could influence the portfolio manager to lend preferential treatment to those funds andor accounts that could most significantly benefit the portfolio manager portfolio management team compensation the trust does not directly compensate any personnel of the adviser including members of the portfolio management team messrs cook and bynum’s compensation from the adviser is in the form of a share of the adviser’s total profits the adviser also receives management fees based on managed assets and may receive incentive compensation based on profits if any of privately offered pooled investment vehicles  a portion of any such incentive compensation may be reallocated to members or partners that are affiliated with the adviser including the members of the portfolio management team no member of the portfolio management team is compensated based directly on the performance of the fund or the value of the fund’s assets ownership of fund securities the

al    and mr bynum  stonehurst green birmingham al  each own  of the outstanding shares of the fund shareholders owning more than  of the shares of the fund are considered to “control” the fund as that term is defined under the  act  persons controlling the fund can determine the outcome of any proposal submitted to the shareholders for approval including changes to the fund’s fundamental policies or the terms of the management agreement with the adviser  after the public offering commences it is anticipated that mr cook and mr bynum will no longer control the fund        purchasing and redeeming shares purchases and redemptions of the funds shares will be made at net asset value “nav”  the funds per share nav is computed on all days on which the new york stock exchange “nyse” is open for business and is based on closing prices of the fund’s portfolio securities as of the close of regular trading hours on the nyse currently  pm est  in the event that the nyse closes early nav will be determined based on prices prevailing as of the close of trading on the nyse  for purposes of computing the nav of a share of the fund securities traded on securities exchanges or in the overthecounter market in which transaction prices are reported are valued at the last sales price at the time of valuation or lacking any reported sales on that day at the most recent bid quotations the fund generally determines the total value of its shares by using market prices for the securities comprising its portfolio  securities for which quotations are not available or deemed unreliable as well as restricted securities and any other assets are valued at a fair value as determined in good faith by the adviser pursuant to the fund’s fair value pricing procedures subject to the review and supervision of the board the adviser may use fair value pricing under circumstances that include but are not limited to the early closing of the exchange on which a security is traded or suspension of trading in the security  in addition the fund may use fair value pricing for securities traded in nonus markets because among other factors foreign markets may be closed on days or times when us markets are open and some markets may remain open after the fund values its securities at  pm est when the fund holds securities traded in foreign markets that are open when us markets are closed significant events including company specific developments or broad foreign market moves may affect the value of foreign securities held by the fund  consequently the fund’s nav may be affected during a period when shareholders are unable to purchase or redeem their shares in the fund  while fair value pricing may be more commonly used with foreign equity securities it may also be used with thinlytraded domestic securities fixed income securities or other assets held by the fund the fund’s share price is calculated by subtracting its liabilities from the closing fair market value of its total assets and then dividing the result by the total number of shares outstanding on that day  fund liabilities include accrued expenses and dividends payable and its total assets include the market value of the portfolio securities as well as income accrued but not yet received  since the fund does not charge sales fees the nav is the offering price for shares of the fund  the price per share for a purchase order or redemption request is the nav next determined after receipt of the order the right of redemption may not be suspended or the date of payment upon redemption postponed for more than seven days after shares are tendered for redemption except for any period during which the nyse is closed other than customary weekend and holiday closings or during which the sec determines that trading thereon is restricted or for any period during which an emergency as determined by the sec exists as a result of which disposal by the fund of securities owned by it is not reasonably practicable or as a result of which it is not reasonably practicable for the fund fairly to determine the value of its net assets or for such other periods as the sec may by order permit for the protection of security holders of the fund        portfolio transactions   decisions to buy and sell securities for the fund are made by the adviser  in placing purchase and sale orders for portfolio securities for the fund it is the policy of the adviser to seek the best execution of orders at the most favorable price  in selecting brokers to effect portfolio transactions the determination of what is expected to result in the best execution at the most favorable price involves a number of largely judgmental considerations  among these are the advisers evaluation of the broker’s efficiency in executing and clearing transactions the rate of commission or the size of the brokerdealer’s “spread” the size and difficulty of the order the nature of the market for the security operational capabilities of the brokerdealer and research services provided  the adviser will not take into account the sale of fund shares when selecting brokers to execute portfolio transactions   the adviser may purchase or sell portfolio securities on behalf of the fund in agency or principal transactions  in agency transactions the fund generally pays brokerage commissions  in principal transactions the fund generally does not pay commissions  however the price paid for the security may include an undisclosed commission or “markup” or selling concessions  the adviser normally purchases fixedincome securities on a net basis from primary market makers acting as principals for the securities  the adviser may purchase certain money market instruments directly from an issuer without paying commissions or discounts  overthecounter securities are generally purchased and sold directly with principal market makers who retain the difference in their cost in the security and its selling price  in some instances the adviser feels that better prices are available from nonprincipal market makers who are paid commissions directly   the adviser may combine transaction orders placed on behalf of the fund with orders placed on behalf of any other advisory client including any partnership or private account where principals and employees of the adviser have an interest for the purposes of obtaining a more favorable transaction price or achieving fair and equitable allocations  if an aggregated trade is not completely filled then the adviser allocates the trade among the fund and other advisory clients as applicable on a pro rata basis or such other allocation method that in the opinion of the adviser will result in fairness to all participants  exemptions to trade allocation policies are permitted on a casebycase basis when judged by the adviser to be fair and reasonable to the fund and any other accounts involved  for example allocation of investments among other advisory clients and the fund may not be similar due to among other reasons differences in investment objectives investment strategies and policies investment restrictions cash positions timing andor asset size  since the fund’s objective will differ at times from those of other advisory clients it is possible the fund may not participate in certain aggregated trades or may purchase or sell securities not owned by other advisory clients and advisory clients may purchase or own securities not purchased or owned by the fund   trading by the portfolio manager   pursuant to section j of the  act and rule j thereunder the fund the adviser and alps distributor inc the fund’s distributor have adopted codes of ethics restricting personal securities trading by the funds portfolio

firm for its first fiscal year   legal counsel   alston  bird llp  f street washington dc  has passed on certain matters relating to this registration statement and acts as counsel to the trust   tax information   the information set forth in the prospectus and the following discussion relate solely to us federal income tax law and assumes that the fund qualifies to be taxed as a regulated investment company as discussed below  such information is only a summary of certain key federal income tax considerations and is based on current law  no attempt has been made to present a complete explanation of the federal tax treatment of the fund or its shareholders  investors should consult their own tax advisers with respect to the specific tax consequences of being a shareholder in the fund including the effect and applicability of federal state local and foreign tax laws to their own particular situations   qualification as a regulated investment company  the fund intends to qualify as a regulated investment company “ric” under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of  as amended so as to be relieved of federal income tax on its capital gains and net investment income currently distributed to its shareholders  to qualify as a ric the fund must among other requirements derive at least  of its gross income from dividends interest payments with respect to securities loans gains from the sale or other disposition of stock securities or foreign currencies or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock securities or foreign currencies and net income derived from interests in certain publicly traded partnerships   if for any tax year the fund does not qualify as a ric all of its taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates without any deduction for dividends paid to shareholders and the dividends will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the funds current and accumulated earnings and profits  failure to qualify as a ric would thus have a negative impact on the funds income and performance  it is possible that the fund will not qualify as a ric in any given tax year   if the fund qualifies as a ric and distributes at least  of its investment company taxable income taxable interest dividends net shortterm capital gains and other taxable ordinary income net of expenses the fund will not be subject to federal income tax on the investment company taxable income and net capital gain the excess of net longterm capital gains over net shortterm capital losses distributed  however the fund would be subject to corporate income tax on any undistributed income other than taxexempt income from municipal securities   the fund intends to distribute to shareholders at least annually substantially all net investment income and any net capital gain  dividends from net investment income and distributions from any net realized capital gains are reinvested in additional shares of the fund unless the shareholder has requested in writing to have them paid by check   excise tax  the fund will avoid the  federal excise tax that would otherwise apply to certain undistributed income for a given calendar year if it makes timely distributions to shareholders equal to the sum of i  of its ordinary income for such year ii  of its capital gain net income for the twelvemonth period ending on october  of such year and iii any ordinary income or capital gain net income from the preceding calendar year that was not distributed during such year  for this purpose income or gain retained by the fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by the fund during such year  the fund intends to make sufficient distributions to avoid liability for the excise tax  the fund may be required to liquidate portfolio investments to make sufficient distributions to avoid excise tax liability          taxation of the noncorporate shareholder  distributions of the funds investment company taxable income are taxable to you as ordinary income  a portion of the fund’s distributions may be treated as “qualified dividend income” which may be taxable through  to individuals trusts and estates at lower federal tax rates  a distribution is treated as qualified dividend income to the extent that the fund receives dividend income from taxable domestic corporations and certain qualified foreign corporations provided that holding period and other requirements are met  to the extent the funds distributions are attributable to other sources such as interest or capital gains the distributions are not treated as qualified dividend income   distributions of the fund’s net shortterm capital gains from dispositions of securities held for one year or less at the time of sale or exchange are taxable to you as ordinary income  distributions of the fund’s net longterm capital gains are taxable to you as longterm capital gains from dispositions of securities held for more than one year at the time of the sale or exchange   distributions that do not constitute ordinary income dividends or capital gain dividends will be treated as a return of capital  a return of capital distributions reduces your tax basis in the shares and is treated as gain from the sale of the shares to the extent your basis would be reduced below zero   all distributions will be treated in the manner described above regardless of whether the distribution is paid in cash or reinvested in additional shares of the fund   taxable distributions generally are included in a shareholder’s gross income for the taxable year in which they are received  however dividends declared in october november and december and made payable to shareholders of record in such month will be deemed to have been received on december st if paid by the fund during the following january   distributions by the fund will result in a reduction in the fair market value of the funds shares  should a distribution reduce the fair market value below a shareholders cost basis such distribution would be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income or as a longterm capital gain even though from an investment standpoint it may constitute a partial return of capital  in particular investors should be careful to consider the tax implications of buying shares of the fund just prior to a distribution  the price of such shares includes the amount of any forthcoming distribution so that those investors may receive a return of investment upon distribution which will nevertheless be taxable to them   a portion of the funds income may qualify for the dividendsreceived deduction available to corporate shareholders to the extent that the fund’s income is derived from qualifying dividends from domestic corporations  because the fund may earn other types of income such as interest income from securities loans nonqualifying dividends and shortterm capital gains the percentage of dividends from the fund that qualifies for the deduction generally will be less than   the fund will notify corporate shareholders annually of the percentage of fund dividends that qualifies for the dividends received deduction          if a shareholder fails to furnish his social security or other taxpayer identification number or to certify properly that it is correct the fund may be required to withhold federal income tax at the rate of  backup withholding from dividend capital gain and redemption payments to him  dividend and capital gain payments may also be subject to backup withholding if the shareholder fails to certify properly that he is not subject to backup withholding due to the underreporting of certain income  the fund will send each shareholder a notice in january describing the tax status of dividends and capital gain distributions for the prior year   in general you will recognize a gain or loss on a sale or exchange of shares of the fund in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of your net sales proceeds and your tax basis in the shares  all or a portion of any such loss may be disallowed if you purchase for example by reinvesting dividends other shares of the fund within  days before or after the sale or exchange  if disallowed the loss will be reflected in an upward adjustment to the basis of the shares purchased  in general any gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if you held your fund shares as capital assets  any capital gain or loss will be treated as longterm capital gain or loss if you held the fund shares for more than one year at the time of the sale or exchange  any capital loss arising from the sale or exchange of shares held for one year or less is treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent of the amount of distributions of net capital gain received on such shares and is otherwise treated as shortterm capital loss   investment income received from sources within foreign countries or capital gains earned by the fund investing in securities of foreign issuers may be subject to foreign income taxes withheld at the source  in this regard withholding tax rates in countries with which the united states does not have a tax treaty are often as high as  or more    you will not be able to claim a credit for such taxes on your federal income tax return unless more than  of the value of our assets is attributable to foreign stocks and securities and we make an election to pass through foreign tax credits   if the fund acquires stock in certain foreign corporations that receive at least  of their annual gross income from passive sources such as interest dividends rents royalties or capital gain or hold at least  of their total assets in investments producing such passive income “passive foreign investment companies” the fund could be subject to federal income tax and additional interest charges on “excess distributions” received from such companies or gain from the sale of stock in such companies even if all income or gain actually received by the fund is timely distributed to its shareholders   foreign exchange gains and losses realized by the fund in connection with certain transactions involving nondollar debt securities certain foreign currency futures contracts foreign currency option contracts foreign currency forward contracts foreign currencies or payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency are subject to code provisions that generally treat such gains and losses as ordinary income and losses and may affect the amount timing and character of distributions to shareholders   general information   the fund does not issue share certificates  all shares are held in

advisers act of  any adviser that exercises voting authority with respect to client securities must adopt proxy voting policies and procedures  cook  bynum capital management llc the “firm” may exercise proxy voting authority for each fund of the cook  bynum funds trust the “trust” and all privately offered unregistered funds “private funds” managed by the firm the trust and the private funds are referred to individually as a “client” and collectively as the “funds” in such cases when a client’s holdings of an individual stock represent  or more of the client’s portfolio as outlined in each client’s offering document  in those cases that the firm exercises proxy voting authority the firm has adopted the following proxy voting policy and procedures to ensure that client proxies are voted in the best interest of the clients accounts and are not affected by any material conflicts of interest within the firm   with respect to securities held in client accounts the firm shall vote in the best interest of clients without regard to the firm’s interest  generally the firm will support company managements which in its opinion have the intent and ability to maximize shareholder wealth over the long term  longterm shareholder value need not be sacrificed in favor of short term gains  proposals that diminish the rights of shareholders or diminish management or board accountability to the shareholders will typically be opposed however reasonable measures that provide the board or management with flexibility for negotiation during unsolicited takeover attempts might be supported provided that such measures do not deter every potential acquisition  likewise compensation plans that appear excessive relative to comparable companies compensation packages andor appear unreasonable in light of the performance of the issuer will typically be opposed  matters involving social issues or corporate responsibility will be evaluated principally based on their likely impact on the economic value of the issuer  on occasion votes may be withheld for certain directors to show our disfavor with a company’s chief executive or particular directors  see “predetermined proxy voting policy”   the firm has adopted a variety of methods to ensure that proxy votes are not affected by conflicts of interest  in cases where the firm votes securities in accordance with its predetermined policy the vote is insulated from potential conflicts of interest that the firm may have  only in those instances when the firm determines that it is in the best interest of clients to vote securities contrary to its predetermined policy does the potential for a conflict arise   conflicts of interest may arise when the firm or an affiliate has a relationship with an issuer eg a routine relationship such as a checking account whether the firm has knowledge of the relationship or not  for purposes of the policy a “material conflict of interest” is defined as a nonroutine relationship between the issuer of a security and the firm or an affiliate of which the firm has actual knowledge that may affect the firm’s judgment in voting securities in the best interest of client accounts  material conflicts may arise when the firm or an affiliate serves as investment advisor or fiduciary for the issuer or when an affiliate has a significant relationship with the issuer          in instances where the firm has determined that it is not in the best interest of its clients to follow the predetermined policy the chief compliance officer of the firm the “cco” must approve any recommendations for votes  in the event that the firm determines that there is a material conflict of interest with respect to the proxy vote the conflict of interest and the firm’s recommendation must be disclosed to the client and in the case of the trust consent or direction must be obtained from the board of trustees of the trust  all votes in which the firm has chosen to override the predetermined policy will be reviewed on a quarterly basis by the cco of the firm  the cco is responsible for maintaining the documentation regarding any vote recommendations or vote overrides   the firm will at all times make a best effort to vote all proxies in the best interest of shareholders of the funds  however there may be some instances in which the firm will choose not to vote or may not be able to vote a proxy  issues that may affect proxies for international securities include extraordinary requirements such as share blocking or the requirement to vote the security in person   investors in the funds “investors” may contact the firm to obtain a copy of the proxy voting policy  in addition investors may contact the firm for information on how the proxies for the securities in their portfolio were voted  all such information will be mailed to investors free of charge   this policy will be reviewed and approved on an annual basis by the cco of the firm predetermined proxy voting policy the firm will vote in accordance with management recommendations on proposals except   the firm will oppose proposals that diminish rights of shareholders or diminish management or board accountability to shareholders and  the firm will oppose compensation plans that are excessive relative to comparable companies’ compensation packages or appear unreasonable in

subscribe to cb notes brand down july   many branddriven moats are currently more assailable than at any time in our investing career we attribute this disruptive trend to a confluence of causes including but not limited to the opportunity to “rent” manufacturing scale by outsourcing production an ability to reach customers costeffectively outside traditional tv and print advertising via digital marketing efforts increased consumer comfort with ecommerce and retailers’ success at building trustworthy “house”privatelabel brands dollar shave club recently purchased by unilever is a good example of the impact of several of these trends they make some of the world’s bestloved products their logos are instantly recognisable their advertising jingles seared in shoppers’ brains for investors they promise steady returns in turbulent times they seem to be getting ever bigger on june th mondelez international made a  billion bid for hershey to create the world’s biggest

also include firms such as general mills nestlé procter  gamble and unilever for a hint of the problem they face take the example of daniel lubetzky who began peddling his fruitandnut bars in healthfood stores his kind bars are now ubiquitous stacked in airports and walmarts or that of michael dubin and mark levine entrepreneurs irked by expensive razors who began shipping cheaper ones directly to consumers five years ago their dollar shave club now controls  of america’s razor market such stories abound from  to  large cpg companies lost nearly three percentage points of market

is fading as consumers learn about products on social media and from online reviews at the same time barriers to entry are falling for small firms they can outsource production and advertise online distribution is getting easier too a young brand may prove itself with online sales then move into big stores financing mirrors the same trend last year investors poured  billion into private cpg
