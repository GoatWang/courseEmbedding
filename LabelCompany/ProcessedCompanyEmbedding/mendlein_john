d has joined their board of directors as executive chairman the translation of atyrs newly found class of proteins resectins into medicines of the future will benefit from dr mendleins experience in biologics partnerships and product strategy resectins may serve as potential replacement protein therapeutics or as targets for antagonists relevant to inflammation blood disorders and metabolic disease these naturally occurring human proteins possess novel biological activities distinct from currently known pharmaceutical targets and products atyr has recently uncovered novel proteins and pathways important to human physiology and disease dr mendleins experience in translating game changing scientific discoveries into novel therapeutics will help us reach our goal � to build a

opportunities while navigating the realities of running a biotech businessprofessor paul schimmel of the scripps research institute and cofounder of atyr pharma adds dr mendlein is the kind of visionary leader who recognizes how new biologies can open doors to whole new classes of therapeutics and targets his passion for delivering new medicines to patients and his experience in making this happen helps actualize the potential of the new biology being elucidated with aminoacyl trna synthetase resectinsdr mendlein added the genomics efforts missed an important class of extracellular signaling proteins resectins which where hiding in the genes of aminoacyl trna synthetases one of the most ancient and biochemically best understood enzyme families in biology thanks to atyr and dr schimmel a new fundamental biology related to intra and intertissue extracellular communication in human physiology hereto unrecognized in medicine is rising up from these ancient intracellular enzymes drug hunting doesnt get any more exciting than new therapeutic intervention points across multiple diseasescurrently chairman of fate therapeutics and alevium pharmaceuticals dr mendlein has

discovered by atyr which is leading to connections in human physiology and pathophysiology ranging from inflammation to metabolic disease to peripheral neuropathy to blood disorders resectin biology distinct from currently known pathways and pharmaceutical targets may represent breakthrough opportunities for novel therapeutic interventions tmax atyrs first program is a preclinical replacement protein candidate with a novel thrombopoietic activity for the treatment of thrombocytopenia atyr pharma has established a dominant intellectual property estate surrounding resectin based compositions

xconomy xconomylike us page  of  in science mendlein enrolled at the university of miami—“the harvard of the everglades” he jokes—with a vague notion he’d study marine biology that morphed into a general interest in chemistry and biology then narrowed like it does for many in biology to specific questions about how ions are transported in the body this interest eventually led mendlein to the lab of george sachs at ucla as a graduate student he did work trying to figure out the mechanism of action for a drug called omeprazole “naïve” about business in those days mendlein didn’t try to capitalize on the research the product for heartburn marketed by astrazeneca as prilosec went on to become one of the bestselling drugs ever mendlein finished his phd in biophysics at ucla and went to work on conventional smallmolecule pills at smithkline  french now known as glaxosmithkline in the philadelphia area wanderlust kicked in within two years and he “went sailing for a while” apparently while riding the waves he figured out that what he really wanted was to go to law school he enrolled at uc berkeley that was a shrewd move though he says he didn’t know it at the time he was a scientist who also had a law degree and he was located in silicon valley when biotech was taking off in the s he got a job with the cooley law firm doing patent work licensing deals and some corporate law amgen which was booming in those days was a major client and the valley was teeming with other amgen and genentech wannabes mendlein got to know them and the “absolute madness” of taking on the highrisk business of drug development it made him restless once again two people mendlein knew from his past stints at smithkline and ucla ultimately lured him into biotech he joined san diegobased aurora biosciences the company cofounded by ucsd chemist roger tsien in  with the vague title of “chief knowledge officer” he crafted financings and partnerships to advance the company’s science he raves about the experience he got there “if you were an able bodied person people gave you a lot of freedom to get things done” mendlein says john mendlein aurora was acquired by cambridge mabased vertex pharmaceuticals for almost  million in  it was time to do something new mendlein moved to toronto for his first chance to be a ceo at affinium pharmaceuticals an antibiotic developer born in the genomics bubble it didn’t live up to the lofty promise or investor valuations and mendlein resigned in  two of the vcs in the group that had backed affinium—jeanfrancois formela of atlas and noubar afeyan of flagship—then recruited him to be ceo of adnexus therapeutics adnexus had a platform technology that it thought could someday rival monoclonal antibodies along with other members of the management team—katrine bosley john edwards and eric furfine—mendlein developed a strategy that made sure adnexus didn’t try to do too many things at once instead of licensing the technology widely the company concentrated on drug candidates that could demonstrate the potential of the platform and do so in a way that would be perceived as valuable outside the company adnexus hit the jackpot with its sale to bristol most of the time that means a guy like mendlein gets rich and walks away for the next green pasture flagship’s afeyan says he was impressed by what came next mendlein stayed at the company for six months working on small details to make sure that each individual’s contribution to the success of adnexus was personally recognized and that he or she fit into the larger company’s culture “john did it in a way that took a lot of attention away from him and distributed it widely” afeyan says “a lot of people spend time on culture because they think good will come from it but to do so after you exit and purely for the benefit of the people who are staying behind is a whole other level of attention” bosley now ceo of waltham mabased avila therapeutics says
