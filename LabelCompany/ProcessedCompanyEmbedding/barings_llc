appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provision of the act section b of the act authorizes the

and the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company and the general purposes of the act  section a of the act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such a person acting as principal from selling to or purchasing from such registered company any security or other property and from borrowing money or other property from such investment company due to their secondtier affiliation any securities transaction by the funds involving jeffries trading entities would be subject to section a of the act where it constitutes a principal transaction between them applicants note that the primary purpose of section a is to prevent a person with the power to control an investment company from engaging in start printed page selfdealing to the detriment of the investment companys shareholders and contend that when the person acting on behalf of an investment company has no direct or indirect

the perspective of the funds applicants further contend that i the securities transactions are reasonable and fair and do not involve the risk of overreaching due to the independence of the jeffries trading entities from the advisers ii the funds participation in joint transactions will be on a basis no less advantageous than that of similarly situated trading entities due to the complete
