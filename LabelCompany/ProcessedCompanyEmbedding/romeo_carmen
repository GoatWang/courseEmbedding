only for his strong steady wellmodulated voice but also for his impressive stage presence and acting fortunately he made a number of gramophone records for victor which have been reissued on cd produced between  and  they confirm the excellence of his musicianship and the imposing power of his declamatory singing although the top of his range sounds a bit constricted on these yearold discs one of his most celebrated records is a  rendition of manricos aria �ah si ben mio� from verdis il trovatore in which he displays an admirably smooth legato line elegant phrasing and a splendid trill he also recorded a few french songs as well as arias and duets from various operas including lohengrin meyerbeers le proph�te saintsa�ns samson et dalila offenbachs les contes dhoffmann bizets carmen

ludd�maison�s efforts are to be applauded as they are most fulfilling in every musical and artistic aspect imaginable and underline the fact that he was one of the most histrionically and vocally talented tenors of his generation�ren� maison�s voice has a timbre that�can perhaps be compared to a slightly dry yet rich and fullbodied red wine he was a big man physically and his repertoire and

yields across wineries in much of the southern hemisphere as a result of highly favorable climatic conditions although in many areas these high yields brought with them something of a drop in overall quality this could not be said for south australias wines which were reportedly excellent indeed the  shiraz harvest in south australia is said to be one of the most successful in recent decades and western australias chardonnays are set to be ones to watch out for new zealands pinot noir harvest was also very good with wineries in martinborough reportedly very excited about this particular grape and the characteristics it revealed this year pinot noir also grew very well in the united states and was probably the most successful grape varietal to come out of california in  with sonoma coast and anderson valley delivering fantastic results from this grape elsewhere in united states washington state and oregon had highly successful harvests in  despite some early worries about frost however it was france who had the best of the weather and growing conditions in  and this year was one of the great vintages for champagne the mãdoc in bordeaux languedocroussillon and provence with pinot noir cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay grapes leading the way italy too shared many of these ideal conditions with the wineries in tuscany claiming that their chianti classicos of  will be ones to collect and piedmonts barberesco and barolo wines will be recognized as amongst the finest of the past decade varietal tempranillo the wines made from the tempranillo grape varietal have gone down in history as being some of the finest in the world with the spanish region of riot being one of the most famed and respected examples of a quality red wine made with this grape elsewhere in the world the tempranillo grape has had plenty of success and grows best in regions with a mixture of hot sunshine and cooling breezes these grapes hold plenty of intense and interesting flavors and are often said to hold many of the most sought after flavors to be found in a red wine leather tobacco plums and herbs are often noted in wines made with tempranillo grapes and the blended wines made with this varietal are often seen at the top of world rankings region la rioja la rioja is by far the most famous wine region of spain and remains one of the worlds great wine producing regions consistently offering deep complex red wines of character and distinction partly due to the fact that la rioja benefits from excellent soils rich in minerals and nutrients and plenty of sunshine the climatic conditions allow the fine grape varietals to reach full ripeness and express plenty of the best features of their terroir making la rioja wines some of the most interesting to have ever come out of europe the cantabrian mountains to the north provide the perfect shelter from the colder wetter influences of the atlantic oceans and in the beloved vineyards of la rioja wineries have been cultivating exceedingly flavorful tempranillo grapes for generations for the inclusion in their fine single variety and blended wines country spain for over two thousand years spain has been responsible for much of europes wine production making the very best of native grape varietals and more recently experimenting with and perfecting wines made from imported grapes of course the region of la rioja is renowned worldwide for the quality and characteristics of its wines which benefit greatly from the warm dry continental climate of the area and the fertile soils of the ebro river basin however there is far more to spanish produce than the complex aromatic and earthy red wine of this region as a result of the vast range of wine making traditions and practices and terrains and climatic conditions found across the country the region castilla y leon produces some of europes finest white wines and the sparkling wines of cava and the sherries of jerez are firm favorites for

argentinas wine industry was focused inward as the local markets thirst was sufficient to absorb the huge quantities of everyday drinking wine produced there but with percapita consumption in the domestic market in sharp decline since the mids argentinas wine producers realized that they had to look to export markets to remain in business and winemaking in argentina began its transformation in just a few short years argentina has shifted its emphasis to the production of quality wine and turned its attention to export markets vine yields have been reduced dramatically large old wood casks have been widely replaced by oak barriques and a major wave of new planting has taken place in mostly cooler highaltitude sites that are better suited to producing serious wines such as the uco valley in the foothills of the andes about  miles south of the city of mendoza despite the widespread reduction of vine yields argentina remains a huge wine producer ranking number five in the world red argentine wines especially those from malbec cabernet sauvignon and blends incorporating these two varieties represent the lions share of the best bottles many of todays finest argentine wines have barely five years of history consulting winemakers from california and europe have brought their technical expertise to argentina as well as their knowledge of what is necessary to compete in the world wine market at the same time there has been an explosion of foreign investment by wealthy wine producers luxury corporations and individual investors attracted by inexpensive vineyard land and by argentinas warm dry climate since the argentine peso was sharply devalued in late  land prices have been even more attractive to outside investors browse toprated wines from argentina about9 get
