this man could pocket  million from the largest corporate takeover in history has the buyout craze gone too far kkrs offer was welcomed by the board and to some observers it appeared that their

as bootstrap investments beginning in – they targeted familyowned businesses many of which had been founded in the years following world war ii which by the s and s were facing succession issues many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a financial buyer could prove attractive henry kravis speaking at the world economic forum in  their acquisition of orkin exterminating company in  is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions in the following years the three bear stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including stern metals  incom a division of rockwood international  cobblers industries  and boren

buyout in history to that time at  billion  billion including assumed debt as well as a highwater mark and sign of the end of the s buyout boom rjr—nabisco which would remain the largest buyout for the next  years was chronicled in barbarians at the gate the fall of rjr nabisco and later made into a television movie starring james garner in  f ross johnson was the president and ceo of rjr nabisco formed in  by the merger of nabisco brands and rj reynolds tobacco company a leading producer of food products shredded wheat oreo cookies ritz crackers planters peanuts life savers del monte fruit and vegetables and snickers chocolate as well as winston camel and salem cigarettes in october  johnson proposed a  billion  per share management buyout of the company with the financial backing of investment bank shearson lehman hutton and its parent company american express several days later kravis who had originally suggested the idea of the buyout to johnson presented a new bid for  billion  per share financed with an aggressive debt package kkr had the support of significant equity coinvestments from leading pension funds and other institutional investors investors included cocacola georgiapacific and united technologies corporate pension funds as well as endowments from mit harvard and the new york state common retirement fund however kkr faced criticism from existing investors over the firms use of hostile tactics in the buyout of rjr kkr proposed to provide a joint offer with johnson and shearson lehman but was rebuffed and johnson attempted to stonewall kkrs access to financial information from rjr rival private equity firm forstmann little  co was invited into the process by shearson lehman but attempted to provide a bid for rjr with a consortium of goldman sachs capital partners procter  gamble ralston purina and castle  cooke ultimately the forstmann consortium came apart and did not provide a final bid for rjr many of the major banking players of the day including shearson lehman hutton drexel burnham lambert morgan stanley goldman sachs salomon brothers and merrill lynch were actively involved in advising and financing the parties oreo cookies one of rjr nabiscos products in november  rjr set guidelines for a final bid submission at the end of the month the management and shearson group submitted a final bid of  a figure they felt

guaranteed whereas the management offer lacked a reset meaning that the final share price might have been lower than their stated  per share additionally many in rjrs board of directors had grown concerned at recent disclosures of ross johnson unprecedented golden parachute deal time magazine featured ross johnson on the cover of their december  issue along with the headline a game of greed this man could pocket  million from the largest corporate takeover in history has the buyout craze gone too far kkrs offer was welcomed by the board and to some observers it appeared that their elevation of the reset issue as a dealbreaker in kkrs favor was little more than an excuse to reject ross johnsons higher payout of  per share johnson received  million from the buyout kkr collected a  million fee in the rjr takeover at  billion of transaction value including assumed debt rjr nabisco was by far the largest leveraged buyout in history in  and  a number of leveraged buyout transactions were completed which for the first time surpassed the rjr nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price the deal was first surpassed in july  by the  billion buyout of us hospital operator hospital corporation of america in which kkr participated though the rjr deal was larger adjusted for inflation however adjusted for inflation none of the leveraged buyouts of the – period would surpass rjr nabisco the rjr transaction benefited many of the parties involved investment bankers and lawyers who advised kkr walked away with over  billion in fees kravis and roberts attracted an unprecedented amount of publicity that turned the cousins into instant celebrities size did not however guarantee success as the high purchase price and debt load would burden the performance of the investment which kkr overcame raising a new investment fund and continuing to invest throughout the s early s the aftermath of rjr nabiscoedit kkrs headquarters in the solow building at  west th street in new york city the buyout of rjr nabisco was completed in april  and kkr would spend the early s repaying the rjrs enormous debt load through a series of asset sales and restructuring transactions after the rjr nabisco deal kkr did not complete a single investment in  the first such year since  they would not complete another major leveraged buyout transaction for more than three years largely because of the shutdown of the high yield bond market and the collapse of drexel burnham lambert which filed for bankruptcy in february  kkr began to focus primarily on its existing portfolio companies acquired during the buyout boom of the late s six of kkrs portfolio companies completed ipos in  including rjr nabisco and duracell as the new decade began kkr began restructuring rjr in january  it completed the sale of rjrs del monte foods to a group led by merrill lynch kkr had originally identified a group of divisions that it could sell to reduce debt over

of new equity into rjr in july  to complete a restructuring of the companys balance sheet that appeased unhappy bondholders kkrs equity contribution as part of the original leveraged buyout of rjr had been only  billion in middecember  rjr announced an exchange offer that would swap debt in rjr for a new public stock in the company effectively an unusual means of taking rjr public again and simultaneously reducing debt on the company rjr issued additional stock to the public in march  to further reduce debt resulting in an upgrade of the credit rating of rjrs debt from junk to investment grade kkr began to reduce its ownership in rjr in  when its stock in rjr was used as part of the consideration for its leveraged buyout of borden inc a producer of food and beverage products consumer products and industrial products in an unprecedented and complex transaction  the following year in  kkr would divest itself of its final stake in rjr nabisco when borden sold a  million block of

this man could pocket  million from the largest corporate takeover in history has the buyout craze gone too far kkrs offer was welcomed by the board and to some observers it appeared that their

as bootstrap investments beginning in – they targeted familyowned businesses many of which had been founded in the years following world war ii which by the s and s were facing succession issues many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a financial buyer could prove attractive henry kravis speaking at the world economic forum in  their acquisition of orkin exterminating company in  is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions in the following years the three bear stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including stern metals  incom a division of rockwood international  cobblers industries  and boren

buyout in history to that time at  billion  billion including assumed debt as well as a highwater mark and sign of the end of the s buyout boom rjr—nabisco which would remain the largest buyout for the next  years was chronicled in barbarians at the gate the fall of rjr nabisco and later made into a television movie starring james garner in  f ross johnson was the president and ceo of rjr nabisco formed in  by the merger of nabisco brands and rj reynolds tobacco company a leading producer of food products shredded wheat oreo cookies ritz crackers planters peanuts life savers del monte fruit and vegetables and snickers chocolate as well as winston camel and salem cigarettes in october  johnson proposed a  billion  per share management buyout of the company with the financial backing of investment bank shearson lehman hutton and its parent company american express several days later kravis who had originally suggested the idea of the buyout to johnson presented a new bid for  billion  per share financed with an aggressive debt package kkr had the support of significant equity coinvestments from leading pension funds and other institutional investors investors included cocacola georgiapacific and united technologies corporate pension funds as well as endowments from mit harvard and the new york state common retirement fund however kkr faced criticism from existing investors over the firms use of hostile tactics in the buyout of rjr kkr proposed to provide a joint offer with johnson and shearson lehman but was rebuffed and johnson attempted to stonewall kkrs access to financial information from rjr rival private equity firm forstmann little  co was invited into the process by shearson lehman but attempted to provide a bid for rjr with a consortium of goldman sachs capital partners procter  gamble ralston purina and castle  cooke ultimately the forstmann consortium came apart and did not provide a final bid for rjr many of the major banking players of the day including shearson lehman hutton drexel burnham lambert morgan stanley goldman sachs salomon brothers and merrill lynch were actively involved in advising and financing the parties oreo cookies one of rjr nabiscos products in november  rjr set guidelines for a final bid submission at the end of the month the management and shearson group submitted a final bid of  a figure they felt certain would enable them to outflank any response by kravis and kkr kkrs final bid of  while a lower dollar figure was ultimately accepted by the board of directors of rjr nabisco kkrs offer was guaranteed whereas the management offer lacked a reset meaning that the final share price might have been lower than their stated  per share additionally many in rjrs board of directors had grown concerned at recent disclosures of ross johnson unprecedented golden parachute deal time magazine featured ross johnson on the cover of their december  issue along with the headline a game of greed this man could pocket  million from the largest corporate takeover in history has the buyout craze gone too far kkrs offer was welcomed by the board and to some observers it appeared that their elevation of the reset issue as a dealbreaker in kkrs favor was little more than an excuse to reject ross johnsons higher payout of  per share johnson received  million from the buyout kkr collected a  million fee in the rjr takeover at  billion of transaction value including assumed debt rjr nabisco was by far the largest leveraged buyout in history in  and  a number of leveraged buyout transactions were completed which for the first time surpassed the rjr nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price the deal was first surpassed in july  by the  billion buyout of us hospital operator hospital corporation of america in which kkr participated though the rjr deal was larger adjusted for inflation however adjusted for inflation none of the leveraged buyouts of the – period would surpass rjr nabisco the rjr transaction benefited many of the parties involved investment bankers and lawyers who advised kkr walked away with over  billion in fees kravis and roberts attracted an unprecedented amount of publicity that turned the cousins into instant celebrities size did not however guarantee success as the high purchase price and debt load would burden the

building at  west th street in new york city the buyout of rjr nabisco was completed in april  and kkr would spend the early s repaying the rjrs enormous debt load through a series of asset sales and restructuring transactions after the rjr nabisco deal kkr did not complete a single investment in  the first such year since  they would not complete another major leveraged buyout transaction for more than three years largely because of the shutdown of the high yield bond market and the collapse of drexel burnham lambert which filed for bankruptcy in february  kkr began to focus primarily on its existing portfolio companies acquired during the buyout boom of the late s six of kkrs portfolio companies completed ipos in  including rjr nabisco and duracell as the new decade began kkr began restructuring rjr in january  it completed the sale of rjrs del monte foods to a group led by merrill lynch kkr had originally identified a group of divisions that it could sell to reduce debt over

of new equity into rjr in july  to complete a restructuring of the companys balance sheet that appeased unhappy bondholders kkrs equity contribution as part of the original leveraged buyout of rjr had been only  billion in middecember  rjr announced an exchange offer that would swap debt in rjr for a new public stock in the company effectively an unusual means of taking rjr public again and simultaneously reducing debt on the company rjr issued additional stock to the public in march  to further reduce debt resulting in an upgrade of the credit rating of rjrs debt from junk to investment grade kkr began to reduce its ownership in rjr in  when its stock in rjr was used as part of the consideration for its leveraged buyout of borden inc a producer of food and beverage products consumer

this man could pocket  million from the largest corporate takeover in history has the buyout craze gone too far kkrs offer was welcomed by the board and to some observers it appeared that their
