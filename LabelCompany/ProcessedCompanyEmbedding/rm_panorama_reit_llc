estate investing through crowdfunding review of realty mogul reviewed by kevin mercadante published on july   last modified july   editor rating rated  stars realty mogul offers a unique opportunity to invest in real estate that’s less involved than buying a property outright on an individual basis but is much deeper in scope than investing in real estate through a real estate investment trust reit it’s an opportunity to invest in real estate through a variety of closetohome investment opportunities just as crowdfunding has come to investing and borrowing it has also made its way to real estate investing realty mogul is a real estate crowdfunding platform where investors and real estate investment sponsors and borrowers come together to create mutually agreeable real estate investments although we found a few flaws in the system overall it is easy to use and convenient here’s our full review what is realty mogul realty mogul is an online real estate capital marketplace that began in  the platform was founded by jilliene helman and justin hughes their aim was to disrupt traditional real estate funding by developing an online crowd funding site crowdfunding is the process of bringing together investors borrowers and investment sponsors to create new investments in this way it’s considered a “peertopeer” arrangement involving primarily individuals on both sides of the transaction though realty mogul is also open to institutional participation today the platform claims more than  investors borrowers and sponsors it has provided financing for more than  properties with loans totaling more than  million the platform arranges residential debt products as well as both equity and debt products for commercial real estate realty mogul is staffed by a team of professionals who have a mix of experience in real estate finance and technology realty mogul features minimum investment   for reits fees  – year accredited investor no reits yes offering types debt equity preferred equity property types commercial features and pricing to invest with realty mogul you must make a minimum initial investment of  you can make standard ach transfers from your bank account for amounts up to  for amounts that exceed  you’ll need to use wire transfers each investment that you fund will have a specific account number that the platform will use to make sure that the funds go directly into that particular investment opportunity signup process you start by creating an account you must first create a password and have your email address confirmed then you must certify that you’re an accredited investor which is to say that you are a sophisticated investor with substantial financial strength well able to withstand a potential loss on your investment position after that you will enter general information and you’re in realty mogul dashboard the dashboard enables investors to track all of the terms of their investment on the platform this includes how much money they have invested active transactions and earnings on those investments how does realty mogul work realty mogul enables investors to participate in a wide range of real estate investments some examples include multifamily dwellings office buildings industrial sites selfstorage retail medical buildings and hospitality establishments they will even enable you to participate in singlefamily properties that are bought for the purpose of being rehabilitated and flipped just about any property can be invested in as long as it is not used as a primary home or as a secondary residence when you invest you typically do so by purchasing shares in a realty mogul limited liability company llc that in turn invests into an llc or limited partnership lp that holds title to the real property investing in this way minimizes overhead for the investment sponsors and provides access to more investment opportunities as well as streamlined reporting of distributions through the platform rm manager llc which is a wholly owned subsidiary of realty mogul serves as manager of the realty mogul llcs the term of specific investments depends upon whether it is a debt or equity investment loan investments are generally six to  months while equity investments are anywhere from three years up to  years equity investments generally pay distributions on a quarterly basis while debt investments pay monthly these are just general rules and it’s important to understand the distributions on any investment are never guaranteed invest in commercial real estate with realty mogul for income tax purposes an irs form k will be provided for each equity investment reporting the results of that particular investment income from loans will be reported on irs form  debt investments when investing in loans you will purchase either an entire loan — which is actually secured by real estate — or what is known as a platform note these notes are borrower paymentdependent promissory notes from realty mogul they are unsecured limitedrecourse loans that correspond with the underlying mortgage loan originated on the website if you choose to be the sole investor on a whole loan you will be responsible for the cost of any foreclosure in the event of a default realty mogul benefits ease of investment selection quick and easy funding  investment monitoring documents can be executed online quarterly or monthly distributions realty mogul provides more investment flexibility than real estate investment trusts reits investments typically do not require capital calls which are requests for additional capital beyond the initial investment individual investments are “prevetted” which means the platform provides an initial underwriting to determine the viability of each investment invest in both loans and equity investments quick comparison  —read the reviewread the reviewrating rated  stars rated  stars rated  stars min depositfees  yearyearfreeaccredited investornonono mogulreit i new in competing with fundrise’s ereits realty mogul has introduced a reit themselves called mogulreit i the benefits of a reit is no accreditation is needed more diversification at a lower amount needed than investing in individual properties and typically lower investment requirement than a private placement though nonaccredited investors must have a net worth and an annual income greater than  the minimum amount to invest is  and the reit will have an annual fee capped at  which makes this fund costly and no bargain according to their website “mogulreit can invest in a variety of property types including but not limited to multifamily office industrial selfstorage retail medical office and hospitality the fund can invest in various commercial real estaterelated equity and debt securities across these different property types” so it will be a pool of various property types and not just one section or location around the country unlike other private reits that have long investment periods without redemptions realty mogul states it will allow redemptions on a quarterly basis but also noted in the offering circular there are limits on the total amount of redemptions per year pros prevetted investments — realty mogul has a preliminary underwriting process that evaluates the property location and the borrower or sponsor for each investment opportunity available on the platform the vetting extends to background and criminal checks on the principles involved in the investments simple investment process — when purchased individually real estate investments can be quite complicated especially commercial properties and properties purchased that are rehabbed and flipped but realty mogul makes real estate investing almost as simple as investing in paper assets the way you would on an investment brokerage platform no capital calls — other than for foreclosure costs on whole loans but not platform notes there are no capital calls in which you will be required to provide additional capital over and above your initial investment instead of additional investment your investment may be diluted if more money is needed or the transaction requires member loans at a high rate of interest – if member loans are necessary your equity position in the investment would be subordinated to those member loans and the loans would have to be paid back before any equity distributions are made greater control than reits — when you invest in a reit you are investing in a portfolio of real estate properties but you have little information and even less control over the individual investments with realty mogul you can invest in individual properties including those close to your home in fact realty mogul allows you to be very specific with your real estate investments reit new — the recently introduced mogulreit i allows nonaccredited investors to invest in real estate cons accredited investor — you must have an annual income of at least  or  for a couple or a net worth of more than  million  and that doesn’t include the value of your personal residence though the recently introduced mogulreit is for nonaccredited investors investments are illiquid — there is no secondary market to sell your positions and must hold to maturity invest in commercial real estate with realty mogul summary realty mogul offers a unique opportunity to invest in real estate that’s less involved than buying a property outright on an individual basis but it is much deeper in scope than investing in real estate through a real estate investment trust reit it’s an opportunity to invest in real estate through a variety of closetohome investment opportunities the disadvantages are that you must be an accredited investor
