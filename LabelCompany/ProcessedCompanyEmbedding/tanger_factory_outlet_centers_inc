thomas dividend growth investing reits newsletter provider valuemarketplacereit beatsummaryoutlet stores are a fixture of the american retail landscape donald k ngwe harvard professoroutlet stores may actually enable the firm to improve its regular store products which typically form the basis of a fashion brand’s imagei consider tanger the “quintessential bargainas donald k ngwe assistant professor of business administration at harvard business school explains outlet stores offer attractive prices at locations far from central shopping districts they form a large and growing component of many firms’ retailing strategies particularly in the fashion industry in a research paper ngwe uses a structural demand model to show that consumers are segmented according to their sensitivity to travel distance and taste for product newness he then developed a supply model to predict product development responses to changes in store locations he writes through policy simulations i discover that the firm uses outlet stores to serve lowervalue consumers who selfselect by traveling to outlet stores from central shopping districts the firm sells older less desirable merchandise through outlet stores to prevent cannibalization of regular store revenues by means of exploiting the positive correlation between consumers’ travel sensitivity and taste for new products ngwe found that the rate of new product introduction in regular stores would fall by  if outlet stores were closed down while variable profits would decline by  “these results imply that the existence of outlet stores may enable firms to improve quality in their regular channels thus counteracting brand dilution effects” ngwe’s research report was just what i was looking for as a means to understand the sustainability of the outlet store business model as many of you know i am highly bullish with tanger factory outlet centers inc nyseskt a pureplay outlet center reit that gets lumped into the mall reit sector as ngwe writes outlet stores are a fixture of the american retail landscape these brickandmortar stores offer deep discounts in locations far away from most consumers firms operate outlet stores in addition to regular stores which are located in central shopping districts outlet stores operated by different firms are often agglomerated in sprawling outlet malls off interstate highways as of march  there were  outlet malls in north america which generated an estimated  billion in annual revenues humphers  this is a large and growing portion of the total retail sales in clothing and clothing accessories which amounted to  billion in  ngwe’s paper is based on his dissertation and the research is exceptionally granular however i will provide you with his closing arguments this paper shows that outlet stores provide several benefits as a tool of price discrimination outlet stores allow the firm to serve lowervalue consumers without lowering prices faced by its regular store clientèle by stocking outlet stores with less desirable products the firm exploits the positive correlation between consumers’ travel sensitivity and taste for quality prices are low in outlet stores but not low enough to attract consumers who value quality and convenience the most… outlet stores may actually enable the firm to improve its regular store products which typically form the basis of a fashion brand’s image… outlet stores constitute a single aspect of a consolidated selling strategy that has become standard among fashion goods firms other parts of this strategy include price skimming targeted coupons and loyalty programs many of these components operate on the intertemporal dimension of durable goods demand tanger has no exposure to department stores as noted above tanger is not a traditional mall reit instead the north carolinabased company owns  outlet centers in the us  states and canada the company commenced operations over  years ago in burlington nc when the outlet industry was unknown this original concept was aimed to connect bargainhunting consumers with brandname manufacturers and tangers pioneering platform was the spark for the flaming retail sector that shoppers commonly refer to as the outlet center sector as the retail industry evolved tanger was the first to grasp the retail distribution channel in which goods could enjoy a longer life cycle than the traditional clearance concept uncommon to malls that are costly to build upwards of  million and with significantly higher operating costs tanger set out to create a differentiated retail model that could provide both scale and lowprice brand recognition aimed to meet the demands of the bargainhunting consumer tanger is the only pureplay outlet center reit and as you can see below there are no department stores in the portfolio when i think about tanger i think about a stalwart reit that has performed extraordinarily well through various economic cycles tangers premium brand can be best observed in periods of uncertainty… and it was evident during the recent economic downturn unlike many other retail distribution channels outlets benefited during the recession consumers did not have as much disposable income but still wanted to purchase quality products from brands and designers that they knew and trusted tanger has become the goto outlet landlord and over the years the company has developed trusted relationships in the outlet sector and the efficiency of driving highquality tenant relationships across the portfolio maximizing expense efficiencies by leveraging scale and more sophisticated risk management across markets one key competitive advantage that tanger enjoys is the companys ability to leverage its track record and brand by scaling the business model the outlet industry is small and tanger estimates that there is less than  million square feet of quality outlet space which is smaller than the retail space in the city of chicago unlike the traditional malls tanger enjoys a more effective moatlike model that allows the company to grow the portfolio without the risks associated with the struggling department store chains many of the mall reits have extended into the outlet sector and tanger has three jv deals with simon property group nysespg  more on that later fortress balance sheet as of q tangers market capitalization was  billion and leverage remained low with a debttototal market capitalization ratio at  last year tanger had the foresight to convert  million of floating rate debt to fixed interest rates although higher interest spend is expected to have a dilutive impact on  ffo of about  per share or about  tanger has always maintained discipline within the balance sheet as evidenced by the companys floating rate exposure of only  of total debt or  of total enterprise value the average term to maturity for tangers outstanding debt was  years as of q and the company has no significant maturities until june of  approximately  of the square footage in the consolidated portfolio was not encumbered by mortgages tanger maintains significant liquidity with about  million outstanding under the unsecured lines of credit leaving  unused capacity or approximately  million tanger also maintained a strong interest coverage ratio during the first quarter of x tanger has solid coverage ratios and leverage ratios with limited floating rate debt the company is rated bbb stable with sp and baa stable with moodys well positioned for growth as referenced above tanger has no department store exposure and the companys balance sheet is primed for growth from an external growth perspective tanger has an active pipeline of deals including recently completed projects in columbus oh opened june   and daytona fl opened november   tanger has projects under construction in fort worth tx projected opening late october  and a major expansion in lancaster pa projected opening september  tenant demand for outlet space continues for developers with access to capital and the expertise to deliver new outlet projects tanger prefers to fund growth using unsecured financing with limited secured financing to maintain financial flexibility tangers longstanding disciplined development approach remains intact and the companys underwriting practice requires achievement of  preleasing and receipt of all nonappealable permits prior to the acquisition of land or commencement of construction tanger does not build on a speculative basis during the first quarter tanger elected to terminate a purchase option for a predevelopment stage project near detroit michigan which resulted in a  charge for abandoned predevelopment costs tanger did not deliver any new developments between october  and november  and since that time the company has delivered ten new developments acquired seven existing outlet centers and sold eight noncore centers fundamentals are sound tangers occupancy cost ratio remains the lowest in the mall regroup evidenced by the fact that outlets remain an important and profitable channel of distribution for tenant partners the popularity of outlets with consumers and retailers along with tangers fortress balance sheet and the strength of its core portfolio positions the company to weather the current headwinds in the retail environment tangers q affo per share was  and in line with consensus estimates and up  compared to q as evidenced below tanger has maintained a very consistent record of affoshare growth tanger opted to revise its net income per share guidance and ffo guidance by  the reduction is a function of lower same center noi and the right to offer predevelopment costs for the detroit project partially offset by approximately  million of lease termination fees  million of which the company is expected to be recognized in the second quarter i consider the revisions consistent with tangers conservative risk management practices tangers management said on the earnings call that the companys initial guidance underestimated the impact of longer downtime unexpected store closings and lease termination fees tanger now expects its affo and ffo per share to be between  and  compared to a previous forecast of  and  one of the most important elements for tangers battletested brand is the companys dividend history as illustrated below tanger has increased its dividend each year and paid an allcash dividend every quarter since its ipo in april tanger raised the dividend by  on an annualized basis this was the th consecutive year the company has increased the dividend for every year since becoming a public company in may of  the current annualized dividend of  per share is more than double the  dividend which was  per share on a splitadjusted basis over the last three years tangers dividend has grown at a  compounded annual growth rate on may   tanger will pay its th consecutive quarterly dividend of  per share to holders of record on april   tangers dividend is well covered in  the ffo exceeded the dividend by over  million tanger’s moat is wide and so is the discount as viewed below tanger has a long history of earnings and dividend growth however shares have been battered yeartodate as a result of the growing pressure in retail and continued threat of ecommerce here’s skt’s dividend yield compared with the peer group as you can see skt’s dividend yield is higher than it has been since  now let’s examine skt’s pffo multiple compared with the peers ironically skt has many of the same tenants as simon property spg general growth nyseggp and taubman centers nysetco yet skt does not have the department store risk in fact i consider tanger the “quintessential bargain” and as far as im concerned this stock checks all of the boxes  strong balance sheet  strong management team  solid fundamentals  exceptional dividend growth history  brand recognition and most importantly…  an enormous margin of safety i’m in full agreement with professor ngwe that outlet stores are a fixture of the american retail landscape and that means tanger is too to learn more about my reit beat service click here for a
