rate increase affirmed in part reversed in part and remanded rainey ross rice  binns by hugh d rice and michael cauthron oklahoma city for appellant robert d stewart jr gen counsel edmond eddie m pope appellate counsel norman pat shore legal intern corporation commission state of oklahoma for appellee lavender justice  pd  ¶ southwestern public service company southwestern is an electric power utility serving oklahoma texas new mexico and kansas it is the primary source of generated electricity of the oklahoma panhandle and serves a number of municipalities industries and one electric cooperative ¶ on october   southwestern filed an application cause no  with the oklahoma corporation commission commission for a general rate increase in which it sought an increase in revenues derived from its retail rates and charges for electric service within the state of oklahoma in the amount of  on december   southwestern filed for approval of its fuel adjustment clause cause no  the two causes were consolidated by the commission after hearing and on december   the commission entered order no  in which the commission ¶ denied southwesterns application for a general rate increase in the amount of  but granted a general rate increase in the amount of  and ¶ required southwestern to refund to its oklahoma customers the sum of  purportedly resulting from an excess return from tuco inc which was then a wholly owned subsidiary of southwestern which refund was to be affected through southwesterns fuel adjustment clause ¶ southwestern alleges that the order of the commission violates its rights under the united states constitution amendments v and xiv and under the oklahoma constitution art ii §§    and  in weighing the constitutional challenge thus presented this court will exercise its own independent judgment as to both the law and the facts  pd  ¶ the reasonableness or unreasonableness of rates prescribed by the commission for a public utility engaged in both interstate and intrastate business must be determined with reference only to the intrastate business done within the state of oklahoma and the profits derived from the intrastate business it is by dividing the capital invested in the business in oklahoma in proportion to the earnings from both interstate and intrastate that the amount of capital invested in intrastate business is found and upon which the company is entitled to a fair return and it is by dividing the total expense of conducting both its interstate and intrastate business on the same basis that the expense of conducting each is found if the net profits derived from the intrastate business as adjusted by the order of the commission fails to yield a reasonable return on the investment the order is unreasonable and unjust and will be reversed by this court ¶ the constitutional safeguard afforded to a utility is summarized in alabama public service com v south cent bell tel co ¶ the burden of proving the rates fixed by the commission to be confiscatory is upon the party complaining ¶ in presenting its case before the commission southwestern used its operations for the calendar year  as the test year that is a twelvemonth period which has already occurred and in which the actual revenues and expenses of the utility may be closely examined by the utility and the  pd  regulators ¶ in determining whether a rate is reasonable and just or whether it is confiscatory when constitutionally challenged on that ground this court is not bound to adhere to a single formula or a combination of formulae nor is it inextricably committed to a particular point in time or base year in establishing a rate base ¶ as we said in southwestern bell tel co v state supra it is not theory but the impact of the rate order which counts if the total effect of the rate order cannot be said to be unjust and unreasonable judicial inquiry under the act is at an end ¶ there are however as we shall point out certain requirements of consistency and balance which must be met where deviations from the base year are sought to be interjected ¶ in the case of oklahoma natural gas co v corporation commission ¶ a test year is a mirror view of the past suspended within a limited but definite time frame through which we prophesy its duplication in the future to alter the image is to risk the distortion for the future only the cost of those capital assets which are in actual use during the test year or whose use is so imminent and certain that they may be said at least by analogy to have the quality of working capital may be added to the rate base established by the test year in any event ¶ the commission must take into consideration not only all increases anticipated in the rate base and operating expense which will be occasioned by the new facility but must take into account all estimated increases in income resulting therefrom ¶ where a utility charges interest back against uncompleted projects under construction during the test year the construction costs incurred during the test year may not be taken into account in fixing its rate base for the reason that to permit it to do so would be to allow it a double rate ¶ in determining whether property held by a utility for anticipated future use should be included in the rate base there is yet another factor to be weighed ie whether the purchase of the property in question was made in pursuance of honest and reasonable business judgment in carrying out some definite plan for example or whether the expenditure was dishonest wasteful or imprudent this is a question of fact to be determined from the evidence ¶ guided by the foregoing principles we now consider the various items which southwestern claims should have been included in determining its rate base i construction costs of the harrington generating station no  ¶ southwestern voluntarily selected the calendar year  as the test year for the purpose of establishing its rate ¶ southwestern began the construction of a new coalfired generating station harrington generating station no  and associated transmission facilities during the test year the generating station was completed within twelve months after the end of the test year and was placed in service six months prior to the filing of the application before the commission in its order the commission eliminated from the rate base the sum of  representing work in progress on the generating plant this sum being  short of the total estimated completion cost of the plant for the stated reason that the plant was not used and useful at the end of the test year southwestern alleges that the commission should have deviated from the test year by adding thereto the entire prospective cost  pd  of the new generating plant or in the alternative the portion of work in progress cost incurred by it during the test year ¶ while the evidence adequately establishes the fact that the generating plant was a prudent investment and that its usage was certain and imminent within the above guidelines southwesterns evidence establishes only the cost of the plant without showing the necessary concomitant income and operating expenses attendant with the projected use of the completed plant the commission therefore correctly held that the cost of the plant should be excluded in determining the rate base ii water purchase options acquired by southwestern ¶ because of the arid nature of the countryside which it serves and in anticipation of a need for additional subsurface water supplies upon completion of its harrington generating station no  in  southwestern purchased certain water purchase options underlying lands in texas said purchases being made in  and  and sought to include these acquisition costs in its rate base while a utility should be encouraged to expand to meet the anticipated needs of the people for additional services where that expansion is reasonable and the need imminent neither should todays users be burdened with expansion costs solely attributable to future consumers possible demands iii deduction of  from southwesterns working capital ¶ southwestern estimated its cash working capital requirements at  of operating and maintenance expenses less fuel costs and alleges error in that the commission deducted the sum of  from the working capital thus computed said sum being onehalf of the ad valorem taxes payable by southwestern in application of montanadakota utilities co supra the north dakota court had before it a specification of error resulting from the public service commissions offsetting against allowances for working capital materials and supplies the average monthly balances of the utilitys reserves for taxes there as here the utility included in its base rate reserves for taxes however it had the free use of these reserve funds for working capital until needed to pay taxes when taxes became due the north dakota court held that customers contributions to tax reserve funds of a utility which funds are employed as working capital until needed should be offset as against funds allowed for working capital we agree and find that the commission correctly deducted the sum of  from the working capital of southwestern in establishing its rate base iv commissions alleged failure to comply with art ix §  of the oklahoma constitution ¶ southwestern alleges error in the failure of the commission to comply with that portion of article ix §  of the oklahoma constitution which provides the corporation commission shall whenever an appeal is taken therefrom file with the record of the case and as a part thereof a written statement of the reasons upon which the action appealed from was based and such statement shall  pd  be read and considered by the supreme court upon disposing of the appeal   and the chairman of the commission under the seal of the commission shall certify to the supreme court all the facts upon which the action appealed from was based and which may be essential for the prompt decision of the appeal    emphasis added ¶ southwestern complains that the following findings of the commission are constitutionally deficient under art ix §   prepayments as in its calculation of materials and supplies southwestern uses a  month average of prepayments the staff correctly adjusted this calculation to a  month average additionally staff made other adjustments to prepayments which resulted in a total adjustment of  cash working capital southwestern estimated its cash working capital requirements at  of operating and maintenance expense less fuel costs staff accepted this calculation but deducted  being onehalf of the ad valorem taxes payable for the stated reason that southwestern had the use of such funds prior to payment to the taxing authority  accrued unbilled revenues southwestern proposed the collection of its accrued unbilled revenues through a surcharge on its rate base or cost of service howard w motley objected to this and proposed that a working capital allowance be included in the rate base for accrued unbilled revenues this staff adjustment in the amount of  is reflected in the total prepayment amount shown in   above  investment tax credit  by which the commission deducted  from the rate base for investment tax credit ¶ the mandate of the constitution article ix §  is threefold ie  the commission shall file with the record on appeal and as a part thereof a written statement of the reasons upon which the action appealed from was based  the commission must make findings of fact and  the chairman of the commission shall certify to the supreme court all the facts upon which the action appealed from was based and which may be essential for the prompt decision of the appeal upon failure to comply the supreme court may remand the case to the commission with directions to find the facts upon which the commission bases its order and to certify the same to the court before the appeal is finally decided ¶ and where there is no finding by the commission on a necessary point and the evidence in the record is indefinite and unsatisfactory on review here the order will not be sustained ¶ in cameron v corporation commission okl  pd   we held that an examiners report containing a resume of the evidence presented before the commission wherein it was apparent to the supreme court that the facts and the reasons for the commissions order were obvious or contained within the examiners report constituted sufficient findings and reasons to comply with §  art ix therein observing that proceedings before the commission are rather informal and their validity is not tested by all the technical rules that obtain in court trials  pd  ¶ a reconciliation of what may seem at least superficially to be inconsistencies in the holdings of the cases of this court in construing §  art ix and in applying it to appeals from orders of the commission becomes apparent when one considers the objective and the purpose of the constitutional provision while the commission is not subject to the administrative procedures act of   ossupp  §   except § a thereof relative to filing of its rules ¶ in brown v banking board okl  pd   this court had under consideration on appeal from a judgment of the court of bank review certain findings of that board what we said there applies by analogy to the case now before us in allied investment company inc v oklahoma securities commission  pd  okl  it was stated a statutory requirement that an administrative agency make findings of fact and conclusions of law is a matter of substance and not a mere technicality and if the administrative agency fails to supply such findings its determinations will not be sustained also it is fundamental that an absence of required findings is fatal to the validity of the administrative decisions regardless of whether there may be in the record evidence to support proper findings anglocanadian shipping co v federal maritime commission  fd  th cir  findings should be sufficient in content to apprise the parties the court of bank review and if necessary the supreme court of the actual basis of the action by the board in order that it may be determined whether the boards decision has support of substantial evidence and the law and to insure against arbitrariness findings in general terms are not sufficient the purpose of requiring findings of facts has been reiterated many times by this court findings of administrative agency acting in a quasijudicial capacity should be a recitation of basic or underlying facts drawn from the evidence and must be free from ambiguity which raises doubt as to whether board proceeded upon correct legal theory and must be sufficiently stated to enable reviewing court to intelligently review order and ascertain if facts upon which order is based afford reasonable basis for order state v guardian funeral home okl   pd  syllabus  see also oklahoma inspection bureau v board of property and casualty rates okl   pd  ¶ while this court is not precluded from making a review of the whole record and entering the appropriate order indicated by the record in its entirety v commissions retroactive rebate of southwesterns fuel adjustment clause ¶ in order no  the commission found that tuco inc a wholly owned subsidiary of southwestern had earned an excess return from payments by southwestern for fuel during the test year the commission staff computed the rate of return for tuco at  whereas southwestern had a rate of return of  the commission granted tuco the same rate of return as southwestern  and ordered a refund of the amount exceeding   to be rebated by adjustment in southwesterns fuel adjustment clause southwestern alleges the commissions order is arbitrary and contrary to the law and the evidence it further contends that the commission had no power to order a refund because this amounts to a retroactive setting of the rates of southwestern ¶ both the power and duty of the commission to conduct detailed investigation of tucos income expenses and investments in order to determine whether the rates charged by southwestern in connection with its fuel adjustment clause are just and reasonable are mandated by  ossupp  §   ¶ in determining a just and reasonable rate a balance must be struck between two extremes on the one hand common ownership is not of itself sufficient ground for disregarding agreements between a utility and its subsidiary fixing rates for the subsidiarys product even though the subsidiary may be receiving a larger share of the profits the utility may nevertheless be receiving substantial benefits from the contract and the utility may not be able to secure better terms elsewhere ¶ on the other hand a public utility cannot make a rate confiscatory by reducing its net earnings through the device of a contract unduly favoring a subsidiary or a corporation owned by its stockholders ¶ we next deal with the question of whether the commission having determined that tuco was charging southwestern an excessive rate for the sale of fuel to it properly ordered the excess charged in the past rebated through an adjustment in southwesterns fuel adjustment clause ¶ southwestern points out the fact that its fuel adjustment clause was established by commission order no  in  and that its payments to tuco were in conformity with that order under such circumstances no power to award reparations is vested in the commission by virtue of  os  §   ¶ the cause is remanded to the oklahoma corporation commission for the making of findings reasons therefor and certification as required by art ix §  of the constitution of the state of oklahoma and for the purpose of making an appropriate adjustment in the rate base after deleting therefrom the  recoupment erroneously ordered to be obtained through the fuel adjustment clause the orders and judgment of the commission are otherwise affirmed ¶ irwin cj barnes vcj and simms and hargrave jj concur ¶ doolin and opala jj concur in part and dissent in part ¶ hodges j dissents to parts i and ii and

shall not extend further than to determine whether the commission has regularly pursued its authority and whether the findings and conclusions of the commission are sustained by the law and
