health servicefood and drug administration  new hampshire avenuesilver spring md   september  warning letter via united parcel service ms catherine m szymansenior vice president and presidentmedtronic minimed devonshire streetnorthridge ca  dearms szyman during an inspection of your firm located in northridge california on february   through april   investigators from the united states food and drug administration fda determined that your firm manufactures paradigm insulin infusion pumps  this inspection was conducted as a preapproval inspection under pma p for the minimed g continuous glucose monitoring system which uses the currently marketed paradigm insulin infusion pumps as a component of the new device under section h of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the act  usc § h these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease or to affect the structure or any function of the body this inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section h of the act  usc § h in that the methods used in or the facilities or controls used for their manufacture packing storage or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the quality system regulation found at title  code of federal regulations cfr part   we received responses from catherine mary szyman senior vice president and president dated may   june   and july   concerning our investigators’ observations noted on the form fda  fda  list of inspectional observations that was issued to your firm we address these responses below in relation to each of the noted violations  these violations include but are not limited to the following     failure to establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive action as required by  cfr a for example a your corrective and preventive action capa system sop  product realization requires capas to be investigated and completed in a timely manner and requires verification of effectiveness of the actions to be conducted to ensure safety and functionality of the device you failed to verify or validate corrective actions to ensure that each action is effective and does not adversely affect the finished device and you did not identify actions needed to correct the deficiency specifically continuous improvement request cir cird opened  and cirg opened  were opened to address data taken from process audit results from  that showed that process validation procedures and policies were not followed this appears to affect all product lines the root cause was identified as insufficient training and lack of attention to detail as a corrective action training of personnel was completed  there is no documentation in the record to verify or validate that training as a corrective action was effective and would prevent recurrence of your employees not following process validation procedures and policies master validation procedure sop  the capas were closed on cire opened  was opened to address b periodically seen in device verification testing and during the qualification tests on paradigm insulin infusion pumps which could cause b the capa was closed on  recommending implementation of a b test to be performed on b on a b basis as a periodic check to provide assurance that process stability and capability are maintained no verification or validation documents were found in the capa file to document that the effectiveness of this corrective action conducting b tests on b identified in capa cire was assessed and that this corrective action identified was implemented mr henry sanders the firm’s director of pump value stream stated that b test was performed as requiredquality improvement request qir qir opened  was opened to address failure analysis of paradigm insulin infusion pumps mmtxx and xx series which indicated that b of returned insulin pumps for unresponsive keypads did not pass the b test a pma supplement was submitted to fda on august   for xx insulin pump devices however you have failed to identify and implement the action needed to correct and prevent recurrence of leakage problems to the xx insulin pumps which was identified in qir qir was closed on cire was opened on  to address problems related  to transferring design changes from the northridge nr site to the sister manufacturing facility medtronic puerto rico operations company mproc and implementation of those changes by mproc this appears to affect all product lines the corrective action for this deficiency included updating the design changetransfer process and training site personnel  on the updatedrevised process on  this capa cir e was closed the capa was closed with no evidence that effectiveness checks were completed for the corrective action identified updating design change process and training site personnel on these updated procedures for this capa to ensure that this corrective action was effective and does not adversely affect the finished product b you failed to identify the actions needed to correct and prevent   recurrence of the paradigm insulin infusion pumps mmtxx xx device failure thus not meeting specification b in the capas opened to address this issue  specifically as demonstrated by the multiple capas opened between  and  eg qir qir qiro cireos cire qir and qir where fluid ingress is identified as a cause of device failure the paradigm insulin infusion products are not meeting the required design requirements of the covered devices complying with iec ipx fluid ingress requirements the identification of corrections to the nonconformity were not adequate as evidenced in the capa investigation qir which identified the b as the root cause of the ongoing fluid ingress problem since this b causes initiation of b thus causing adverse effects to the finished device as a correction you decided not to change the b but instead to change the b however capa investigation documented in qir has identified the potential for fluid ingress to occur b your correction to change the b we reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that they are not adequate because you have not yet provided evidence of implementation for all corrections and corrective actions from  through  you made changes to your capa processes including implementation of effectiveness checks using capa software ie b revised capa procedures implemented reviews of capa scorecards by senior management and hired dedicated personnel for review of pump related capas you have stated that b capas that were opened since january   the date of b implementation and closed before april   were reviewed you provided a review of these capas that were opened and closed to verify that the corrective actions were determined to be effective the capas identified in a cir d and cir g have been reopened and reassigned to a new capa cir e in order to perform additional training on process validation procedures for the b process used in the production of paradigm insulin infusion pumps and to verify the effectiveness of the corrective action for this capa the capa identified in b cir e was reopened to document the rationale for not performing the b test and to include a more complete analysis of the impact of not using the b test you have completed the capa and conducted verification of the effectiveness of the corrective action for this capa the capa identified in c qir  documented the separation of the paradigm insulin infusion pumps xx and xx series investigations due to design differences between the two models the capa addressing the paradigm insulin infusion pumps xx series devices is closed and a pma supplement was approved a separate capa e was opened to address the paradigm insulin infusion pumps xx series devices this will include a design change that will be submitted to the fda in late  you state that an ongoing dialogue with the fda regarding this design change is currently taking place to ensure that leakage problems do not recur with the paradigm insulin infusion pumps xx series devices the capa identified in d was reassigned to a new capa cir e to investigate the engineering change order eco process between medtronic diabetes and mproc you have revised your quality improvement system  sop  ver l  to require that the quality improvement team qit help ensure that all capas include an effectiveness verification plan effectiveness acceptance criteria and evidence of effectiveness verification prior to closure you have provided this document for review you have trained personnel on quality improvement system sop  ver l  and have provided the training records you have revised your continuous improvement team sop  ver aa  to require that the continuous improvement team cit help ensure that all capas include an effectiveness verification plan effectiveness acceptance criteria and evidence of effectiveness verification prior to closure it has provided this document for review you have trained personnel on continuous improvement team sop  ver aa  and have provided the training records you have also deployed an b training b to all personnel involved in the capa processes you have trained b and have provided the training records you have had b conduct classes on the b aspects of the capa process and a b as well as a b you have provided the employee training records for these courses however you have not completed the employee training on process validation procedures for the b process used in the production of paradigm insulin infusion pumps in cir e combined from cir d and cir g as a corrective action identified for this deficiency and have not conducted an effectiveness check to ensure that retraining employees will ensure that they perform process validation activities as required in addition you have not provided evidence that an effectiveness check for capa cir e opened to address cir e was completed to ensure that the eco process between medtronic diabetes and mproc was implemented as required and will ensure that design changes are transferred as required you submitted a design change to the fda in february  to address concerns with keypad failures due to fluid ingress you have proposed labeling changes to clarify the ipx language as well as marketing and training materials and other literature this labeling has been submitted to the fda on june   as part of the interactive labeling review for pma p you have issued an urgent medical safety notification to restate the warnings related to water immersion an to notify patients of potential device failures although you have identified your manufacturing b as a root cause of the leakage problem you have not provided evidence that actions identified and needed to correct and prevent recurrence of the nonconforming product have been implemented you have not conducted an effectiveness check for capa qir to ensure that the labeling changes are effective in addition you have not provided a description and evidence of implementation of a corrective action to include a retrospective review of all capas to ensure corrections and corrective actions were identified and implemented as required      failure to review and evaluate all complaints to determine whether an investigation is necessary and to maintain a record that includes the reason no investigation was made and the name of the individual responsible for the decision not to investigate when no investigation is made as required by  cfr b for example you do not investigate complaints with reported high or low blood glucose level for the paradigm realtime insulin infusion pumps mmt and mmt to ensure that there have not been any adverse events or hospitalization as the result of the insulin infusion pump failure and to ensure that actions needed to correct the failure are implemented you do not document the rationale for the decision not to investigate or the individual responsible for the decision specifically the following complaints documented the decision to investigate as “unknown” and did not include the rationale for the decision or the individual who made the decision a   snb dated b documented the consumer reporting the b resulted from use of paradigm realtime insulin infusion pump mmt lnab manufactured on b your failure analysis indicated that the b the pump had to be returned by the customer and replaced the complaint record indicates that the complaint is not mdr reportable and was closed on b with no further followupb   snb dated b documented that the consumer indicated that b the paradigm realtime insulin infusion pump mmt nall date of manufacture unknown the customer stated that the b the firm’s failure analysis indicated an b you advised the customer to discontinue the use of the pump go on the backup plan and return the pump the firm replaced the pump the complaint record indicated that the complaint is not mdr reportable and was closed on b with no further followup by the firmc   snb dated b documented that the consumer indicated b resulted from use of the paradigm realtime insulin infusion pump mmt pnap manufactured b the customer called stating that when b your failure analysis indicated an b you advised the customer to treat b by using back up plan and that the pump would be replaced the complaint record indicates that this complaint is not mdr reportable and was closed on b with no further followup by youd   snb dated b documented that the customer reported a b when using the paradigm realtime insulin infusion pump mmt date of manufacture unknown the failure analysis indicated b you advised the customer to remain on the back up plan and that the pump would be replaced the complaint record indicates that this complaint is not mdr reportable and was closed on b with no further followup action we reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that they are not adequate you provided a copy of the revised procedure complaintnoncomplaint customer dop  which includes the requirement to followup on emails to patients in the united states who complain of high or low blood glucose you provided employee training records on this revised procedure you are in the process of further improving complaintnoncomplaint customer dop  by expanding the complaint handling process to include additional followup attempts when a patient in the united states reports high or low blood glucose you provided a copy of the revised procedure complaintsnoncomplaint customer dop  which includes the development of a separate system for patients who allege high or low blood glucose that do not provide an email address to contact them via an automated phone call system you indicated that a retrospective review of b of complaints with a report of high or low blood glucose will be conducted you did not provide a description and evidence of implementation of a correction to this deficiency to include conducting investigations for the above listed complaints or documenting the rationale for not conducting an investigation along with the signature of the individual responsible for the decision you did not provide the rationale for conducting a retrospective review of complaints received for b in addition you have not completed your revisions to complaintnoncomplaint customer dop  to include the expansion of the complaint handling process to include additional followup attempts when a patient in the us reports high or low blood glucose     failure to establish and maintain procedures for the identification documentation validation or where appropriate verification review and approval of design changes before their implementation as required by  cfr i for example you did not follow the design control procedure sop for documentation validation or verification and review of design changes before their implementation specifically you did not apply the design control procedure sop section  design changeschanges after design transfer – which requires that changes to released products are reviewed verified andor validated where appropriate and approved prior to implementation to post production changes for the following design changes to the b of the paradigm insulin infusion pumps mmtxx and xx the implementation of the b andthe implementation of the b qir er  documents that these two changes were implemented to the b your management stated that there is no record of the design review associated with these changes identified above and that analysis on impact of these design changes to the finished paradigm insulin infusion pumps have not been conducted we reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that they are not adequate you provided evidence that procedures are being revised to clarify that design changes are required to be reviewed by the quality improvement team and that it is documented that a design review has been performed for design changes after transfer quality improvement system sop  continuous improvement team sop  capa system sop  you have provided evidence of employee training on these revised procedures you have revised procedures to clarify that design changes are required to be reviewed by the qit and that it is documented that a design review has been performed for design changes after transfer design control sop  ver ak  change control and product qa review board sop  ver l   you also indicated that a retrospective review of b of design changes after transfer for all of the current product families from may   to may   is being performed to confirm that design reviews have been performed and adequately documented you did not provide the rationale for conducting a retrospective review of b of design changes after transfer for all of the product families and have not completed the appropriate training on the revised procedures design control sop  ver ak  and change control and product qa review board sop  ver l  you did not provide a description and evidence of implementation of a correction to include completing the design reviews for the implementation of the b and a design review for the implementation of the b on the b for b of the paradigm insulin infusion pumps xx and xx in addition you did not provide a description and evidence of implementation of a corrective action to include a retrospective review of all design changes to the paradigm insulin infusion pumps to ensure that all design changes were completed as required and not just design reviews for design changes     failure to establish and maintain procedures to ensure that all purchased or otherwise received product and services conform to specified requirements as required by  cfr  for example you issued eco  to manufacturing facility mproc with a specified release date of  to change the cleaning process of the b for the paradigm insulin infusion pumps mmtxx and xx eco  specifies a change from rev a to rev b for the b the paradigm insulin infusion pumps mmtxx and xx are manufactured at the firm’s facility and mproc this change was not implemented by mproc until  the lot history report summary of b indicates that mproc continued to manufacture to rev a until at least b after the required design change to rev b per eco  the northridge facility continued to receive b with the incorrect revision date for b work orders after implementation date of b for this design change to the b with rev b of the paradigm insulin infusion pumps ms donna twisdom your sr engineering manager confirmed that northridge received b subassembly rev a that should have been rev b we reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that they are not adequate  you have updated procedures to require that there be defined timelines when changes must be implemented specify how suppliers are notified of changes and define mechanisms for monitoring change implementation ecreco process sop  process ecr turnkey objects dop  ccr supplier change notification  customer change request procedure sop  you have provided employee training records for these revised procedures work instruction doc was updated to specify that all ecos are recorded in a newly created logbook and tracked b as well as having a project manager assigned for their implementation you provided employee training records on this revised work instruction mproc through its procedural revisions will now more actively manage engineering change order eco implementation you indicated that a retrospective review was conducted on all closed ecos issued between may   and may   and closed customer change requests ccrs issued between january   and april   to evaluate whether a delay in implementing a now closed ecoccr had an impact on product quality a small subset of changes was identified as having a potential impact on quality this subset was further evaluated and the associated risk assessed through further analysis it was determined that any delay in implementation of the respective change did not adversely impact product quality employee training on the revised procedures has been completed you have reopened cir e by reassigning the capa to a new

required  failure to ensure that when results of a process cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test the process shall be validated with a high degree of assurance and approved according to established procedures as required by  cfr a for example a   you did not validate the b process used in the manufacture of the mmtxx and xx paradigm insulin infusion pumps the b was not monitored and controlled during the b process validation to ensure b as required by your procedure it was noted in characterization report er that b has been misdiagnosed in the past and will result

review and evaluate a process and perform revalidation where appropriate when changes or process deviations occur as required by  cfr c for example you changed the design of the paradigm insulin infusion pumps mmtxx xx under the pump modernization project in  to include a change of the b however you failed to complete revalidation of the b process for the new b as required you used the b test to verify the b for the pumps but the b test was not included in the process validation plan pvp ver a and acceptance criteria were based on b test results mr jeff hauber your vice president of operationsgeneral manager of insulin delivery stated that he agreed and that the firm would revalidate the revised b process we reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that they are not adequate an engineering report was generated to confirm and document the scientific rationale for the initial decision not to revalidate the b process engineering testing was conducted to evaluate the b performance of all new b the design fmea for the b and the process fmea for the b have been reviewed and updated to clarify the potential impact that b performance a complete revalidation of the
