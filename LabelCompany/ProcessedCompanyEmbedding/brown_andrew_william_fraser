fraser jump to navigation search andrew william fraser also known as drew fraser born  is a canadianborn academic and was an associate professor in the department of public law at macquarie university in sydney new south wales australia fraser holds a ba hons and an llb from queens university an llm from harvard university and an ma from the university of north carolina his most recent book is the wasp question  contents  academic career  views  nonwhite immigration and multiculturalism  freedom of speech in australia  writings  selected works  books  articles  references  external links academic careeredit fraser studied advanced constitutional law at harvard law school he taught american constitutional history at macquarie university in sydney until  viewsedit nonwhite immigration and multiculturalismedit in july  fraser received national attention in australia with a letter to his local newspaper signed with his academic title in which he claimed that importing sudanese refugees threatened to turn australia into a colony of the third world and experience everywhere in the world shows us that an expanding black population is a surefire recipe for increases in crime violence and other social problems macquarie university responded that it distanced itself from professor frasers remarks but backed the right of academics to say what they wish in a responsible way the acting vicechancellor professor john loxton stated there was no place for racism at the university but it recognises and protects academic freedom as essential to the conduct of teaching research and scholarship fraser was accused of being affiliated with white supremacist groups including the patriotic youth league pyl by the antiracist group fightdemback although both he and the pyl initially denied any connection fraser admitted he had attended pyl meetings and signed up to the pyl website after video footage of a pyl member describing him as an official legal adviser surfaced following an outcry from sydneys sudanese community macquarie university vicechancellor dianne yerbury on  july  decided to suspend fraser from teaching any further at the campus on the grounds that the race debate was threatening to spill over into the classroom and was affecting the universitys ability to operate effectively macquarie university offered to pay out the final year of his contract but fraser declined describing the offer as a dishonorable discharge on this incident fraser wrote truth is no longer a defence when it comes to charges of academic deviance instead of an invitation to debate the issues the vicechancellors office sought to get me off campus as soon as possible by offering to buy out my contract the head of human resources made it clear to me that my public comments were damaging their efforts to market macquarie university to foreign students when i refused the offer on the grounds that it amounted to a dishonourable discharge vc di yerbury ordered that i be suspended from teaching this was justified on the specious grounds that the safety of students supposedly had been threatened by among others my supporters for what must be the first time in academic history alleged threats by outsiders to disrupt classes were met not by tightening security to deal with the disrupters but by getting rid of the disruptee in august  more than  macquarie university staff and students attended a forum on racism and free speech at which fraser as well as sudanese community and university members was allowed to put his views from the floor frasers suspension ended in mid when an earlyretirement package took effect in september  fraser wrote an article advocating a return of the white australia policy entitled rethinking the white australia policy the article was set to be published in the law journal of deakin university but the university directed the journal not to publish it rethinking the white australia policy has since been published and circulated across the internet in the controversial article fraser wrote given the relentless and revolutionary assault on their historic national identity white australians now face a lifeordeath struggle to preserve their homeland whether effective resistance to their displacement and dispossession can be mounted is another question unlike other racial ethnic or religious groups wellequipped to practice the politics of identity white australians lack a strong cohesive sense of ethnic solidarity as a consequence ordinary australians favouring a moratorium on nonwhite immigration cannot count on effective leadership or support from their coethnics among political intellectual and corporate elites on the contrary our still predominantly angloaustralian rulers are indifferent some profit from and others actually take pride in their active collaboration with the third world colonization of australia none of the major parties indeed not one member of the commonwealth parliament offers citizens the option of voting to defend and nurture australias angloeuropean identity the problem in short is clear the australian nation is bereft of a responsible ruling class in december  fraser further criticised multiracialism in australia by writing an article regarding the  cronulla riots entitled diversity vs freedom australians fight on the beaches as with the full version of rethinking the white australia policy the article was only published on the internet namely on the white nationalist webzine vdare a complaint from the sydney sudanese community about the original newspaper letter was upheld on  march  by the human rights and equal opportunity commission on whose direction fraser reluctantly apologised for his remarks andrew fraser addressed the american renaissance conference in february  alongside speakers such as nick griffin of the british national party and professor j philippe rushton this was followed up later in the year with appearances at the inverell political forum in march and at the sydney forum in august alongside speakers who included jim saleam of the australia first party freedom of speech in australiaedit in an article for alternative right entitled the cult of the other fraser warned that academic freedom was being stifled in australian universities he wrote academic freedom in australia is dying before our eyes another sacrifice performed in the now holy name of “the other” in the universities as elsewhere public criticism of privileged minorities must walk a shaky legal tightrope unfortunately in a massmediated wasteland of intellectual cowardice and political conformity australian universities are not an oasis of dissent if my experience as a teacher scholar and more recently a firstyear theology student is a reliable guide academia is utterly hostile to free thought and frank discussion on race ethnicity and gender writingsedit fraser has written numerous articles on ethnonationalist topics for publications such as vdare alternative right and the occidental observer in  fraser published the wasp question in which he examined the failure of anglosaxon peoples in north america australia and elsewhere to defend their ethnic identity and interests in the postmodern multicultural age in the wasp question fraser writes the defining characteristic of wasps white anglosaxon protestants is that they are much less ethnocentric than other peoples indeed for all practical purposes anglosaxon protestants appear to be all but completely bereft of ingroup solidarity they are therefore open to exploitation by freeriders from other more ethnocentric groups it seems unlikely that nominally americanized changs singhs and gonzales are as committed in a practical sense to the antidiscrimination principle as anglosaxon individualists there is no shortage of evidence to suggest that the changs the gonzales and the singhs not to mention the goldmans with their wellknown animus toward wasps still practice forms of ethnic nepotism strictly forbidden to angloprotestants in these circumstances an interesting question arises are contemporary wasps entitled to recognition as an historic people if not why not selected worksedit booksedit the spirit of the laws republicanism and the unfinished project of modernity  reinventing aristocracy the constitutional
