testimonials contact dashboard login incorporate now form an llc in texas   state fee  st year free registered agent start my llc how to form a texas llc in  simple steps are you looking for the freedom that comes with owning your own company an llc is a popular choice for many new texas business owners in the lone star state business owners can take advantage of several tax benefits strong asset protection and flexible profit choices—in a state with one of the fastest growing economies here’s how to start your llc in texas step one choosing your texas llc’s name the first step in forming a new llc in texas is to create a name the name you choose for your texas llc has to be different from other texas business or llc names here are a couple of laws unique to texas that will impact naming your llc what you can’t do the name can’t contain words or phrases that could give the impression that the llc has been organized for some purpose other than that specified in its articles or one that’s not allowed by state law what you must do the llc name must end in one of the following terms or its abbreviations “limited liability company” “llc” or “llc” “limited company” “lc” or “lc” step two creating and filing your articles of organization once you have a name texas law states that you must write up and file articles of organization for your new llc the articles of organization must list the llc’s name and business purpose the name and address of your llc’s registered agent see below for specific requirements for texas registered agents how long it’s planned to last usually perpetual unless otherwise specified the name and addresses of the organizers and their signatures whether the llc will be managed by a manager or managers the name and address of each manager or initial member the signature of a manager organizer member trustee or fiduciary and the signer’s position any other relevant information registered agents in texas texas llcs must each have a registered agent in texas — someone designated to receive official correspondence from state administrative or legal agencies a registered agent for an llc in texas can be an individual resident a texas llc or corporation or an outofstate “foreign” corporation or llc with an office in texas the llc must keep a business office at the same address as its registered office and it must be a street address not just a post office box or answering service if you need a registered agent in texas incfile can provide that service your llc is “organized” when an original and one copy of the articles of organization are given to the texas secretary of state’s office along with the filing fee and their office confirms that they comply with state requirements incfile will submit these forms for you the secretary of state endorses both copies keeps the original and returns the signed copy the articles of organization are effective as of the date and time they are filed unless a later date and time are specified step  writing your operating agreement after you’ve filed your articles of incorporation your llc needs an operating agreement this isn’t required by state law but it’s a critical internal document that officially explains how the llc will operate it lists the members see below for how membership works in a texas llc how much they have invested how profits are divided how much weight each member has when votes are taken it may also list standards for meetings how much notice what constitutes a quorum rules for voting etc and so on but is not required to do so a typical operating agreement also includes requirements mandated by the state of texas and can be amended or repealed as specified by the agreement or applicable law how membership works in a texas llc texas llcs must have at least one member and each member must be a natural person as opposed to a corporate entity to become a member an individual usually has to make a contribution pay money or transfer property to the llc or else assume an obligation to do so or render some kind of service a member can resign from an llc but only in the way specified in the articles of organization or operating agreement these documents also usually specify a minimum period of time a member can be a member before being allowed to resign llcs have the option of penalizing a resigning member for damages suffered by the llc due to his resignation ongoing requirements for llcs in texas  including taxes texas llcs are required to file an annual report with the texas secretary of state including the following llc name and the state where the llc was organized if not texas address of the registered office and the name of the registered agent address of the principal llc office names and business addresses of the llc’s managers the texas franchise tax filing requirements state that you must file an annual franchise tax report and an information report you must file additional forms if you take any credits on your report file as a tiered partnership or file as a combined group when you form your llc with incfile we’ll send reminder emails about texas’ ongoing requirements as the due dates approach how are llc taxes handled in texas an llc has some tax advantages when compared to a corporation including the availability of more deductions however there is no requirement for an llc to be a separate tax entity like a corporation instead an llc can be a “passthrough entity” when it comes to taxes so that the llc owner or owners report business losses or profits on their personal tax returns in the same way that a partnership would the irs treats singlemember llcs as sole proprietorships for tax purposes unless you choose for your llc to be taxed as a corporation this means the llc itself does not pay taxes and does not have to file a tax return the irs treats multiowned llcs as partnerships for tax purposes unless you choose for your llc to be taxed as a corporation this means that llc owners each pay taxes on their lawful share of the profits on their personal income tax returns not the llc itself when starting a new llc in texas you may need to obtain a federal tax identification or employment identification number ein in most cases you won’t need a separate ein for your llc if you are the sole owner and the llc has no employees however if you are not the sole owner of the llc or if the llc has employees the llc will need a separate ein to open a bank account and to meet tax filing requirements dissolution of an llc in texas a texas llc is dissolved when any one of the following events occurs events specified in the articles of organization or operating agreement there is an agreement to dissolve by the number or percentage of members specified in the operating agreement an event that makes it illegal for the llc to continue to operate when a member leaves the llc unless the remaining members agree to continue the llc within  days or the company continues under specifications set out in the operating agreement judicial decree ordering dissolution launch your business today for   state fee free st year registered agent see detailed pricing how

freedom that comes with owning your own company an llc is a popular choice for many new texas business owners in the lone star state business owners can take advantage of several tax benefits strong asset protection and flexible profit choices—in a state with one of the fastest growing economies here’s how to start your llc in texas step one choosing your texas llc’s name the first step in forming a new llc in texas is to create a name the name you choose for your texas llc has to be different from other texas business or llc names here are a couple of laws unique to texas that will impact naming your llc what you can’t do the name can’t contain words or phrases that could give the impression that the llc has been organized for some purpose other than that specified in its articles or one that’s not allowed by state law what you must do the llc name must end in one of the following terms or its abbreviations “limited liability company” “llc” or “llc” “limited company” “lc” or “lc” step two creating and filing your articles of organization once you have a name texas law states that you must write up and file articles of organization for your new llc the articles of organization must list the llc’s name and business purpose the name and address of your llc’s registered agent see below for specific requirements for texas registered agents how long it’s planned to last usually perpetual unless otherwise specified the name and addresses of the organizers and their signatures whether the llc will be managed by a manager or managers the name and address of each manager or initial member the signature of a manager organizer member trustee or fiduciary and the signer’s position any other relevant information registered agents in texas texas llcs must each have a registered agent in texas — someone designated to receive official correspondence from state administrative or legal agencies a registered agent for an llc in texas can be an individual resident a texas llc or corporation or an outofstate “foreign” corporation or llc with an office in texas the llc must keep a business office at the same address as its registered office and it must be a street address not just a post office box or answering service if you need a registered agent in texas incfile can provide that service your llc is “organized” when an original and one copy of the articles of organization are given to the texas secretary of state’s office along with the filing fee and their office confirms that they comply with state requirements incfile will submit these forms for you the secretary of state endorses both copies keeps the original and returns the signed copy the articles of organization are effective as of the date and time they are filed unless a later date and time are specified step  writing your operating agreement after you’ve filed your articles of incorporation your llc needs an operating agreement this isn’t required by state law but it’s a critical internal document that officially explains how the llc will operate it lists the members see below for how membership works in a texas llc how much they have invested how profits are divided how much weight each member has when votes are taken it may also list standards for meetings how much notice what constitutes a quorum rules for voting etc and so on but is not required to do so a typical operating agreement also includes requirements mandated by the state of texas and can be amended or repealed as specified by the agreement or applicable law how membership works in a texas llc texas llcs must have at least one member and each member must be a natural person as opposed to a corporate entity to become a member an individual usually has to make a contribution pay money or transfer property to the llc or else assume an obligation to do so or render some kind of service a member can resign from an llc but only in the way specified in the articles of organization or operating agreement these documents also usually specify a minimum period of time a member can be a member before being allowed to resign llcs have the option of penalizing a resigning member for damages suffered by the llc due to his resignation ongoing requirements for llcs in texas  including taxes texas llcs are required to file an annual report with the texas secretary of state including the following llc name and the state where the llc was organized if not texas address of the registered office and the name of the registered agent address of the principal llc office names and business addresses of the llc’s managers the texas franchise tax filing requirements state that you must file an annual franchise tax report and an information report you must file additional forms if you take any credits on your report file as a tiered partnership or file as a combined group when you form your llc with incfile we’ll send reminder emails about texas’ ongoing requirements as the due dates approach how are llc taxes handled in texas an llc has some tax advantages when compared to a corporation including the availability of more deductions however there is no requirement for an llc to be a separate tax entity like a corporation instead an llc can be a “passthrough entity” when it comes to taxes so that the llc owner or owners report business losses or profits on their personal tax returns in the same way that a partnership would the irs treats singlemember llcs as sole proprietorships for tax purposes unless you choose for your llc to be taxed as a corporation this means the llc itself does not pay taxes and does not have to file a tax return the irs treats multiowned llcs as partnerships for tax purposes unless you choose for your llc to be taxed as a corporation this means that llc owners each pay taxes on their lawful share of the profits on their personal income tax returns not the llc itself when starting a new llc in texas you may need to obtain a federal tax identification or employment identification number ein in most cases you won’t need a separate ein for your llc if you are the sole owner and the llc has no employees however if you are not the sole owner of the llc or if the llc has employees the llc will need a separate ein to open a bank account and to meet tax filing requirements dissolution of an llc in texas a texas llc is dissolved when any one of the following events occurs events specified in the articles of organization or operating agreement there is an agreement to dissolve by the number or percentage of members specified in the operating agreement an event that makes it illegal for the llc to continue to operate when a member leaves the llc unless the remaining members agree to continue the llc within  days or the company continues under specifications set out in the operating agreement judicial decree ordering dissolution launch your business today for   state fee free st year registered agent see detailed pricing how
