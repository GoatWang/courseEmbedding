contracts in addition the plus fund invests in cash and cash equivalents including shortterm investment funds and money market mutual funds the plus fund’s portfolio may include different types of investments with a variety of negotiated terms and maturities and is diversified across sectors and issuers the composition of the plus fund’s portfolio and its allocations to various stable value investments and fixed income investment sectors across the fund’s multiple tiers is determined based on prevailing economic and capital market conditions relative value analysis liquidity needs and other factorsthe plus fund primarily invests in stable value investment contracts that allow plan participants who invest in the plus fund to make benefit withdrawals at book value ie original book or contract value plus accrued interest plus additional deposits less withdrawals fees and expenses and other adjustmentsthe types of stable value investment contracts in which the plus fund may invest are described belowtraditional guaranteed investment contracts “gics” — contracts issued by insurance companies that guarantee  payments of interest at a fixed or floating rate and  repayments of principal the amount invested by the plus fund in each traditional gic becomes part of the insurance company’s general account assets which are managed and invested as the insurance company deems appropriate payments of principal and interest under a gic depend on the insurance company’s creditworthiness and ability to meet its obligations when they come dueseparate account gics — contracts issued by insurance companies that are backed by fixed income assets held in a separate account at the insurance company that is held separate from the insurance company general account assets for the benefit of the plus fund and any other contract holders in that separate account the underlying fixed income assets are managed by either the insurance company an affiliate of the insurance company or a thirdparty managersynthetic gics — contracts issued by insurance companies banks or other financial institutions a “synthetic gic issuer” that are backed by fixed income assets owned by the plus fund the synthetic gic issuer contract which provides for participant withdrawals at book value under certain conditions is called a “wrap contract” and the issuer may be referred to as a “wrap provider” or “wrapper” the underlying fixed income assets are managed by fixed income managers hired or approved by icmarc additionally certain fixed income assets are managed by icmarc certain wrap providers require that they or an affiliate manage the portfolio that they wrapbank investment contracts “bics” — contracts that are similar but not identical to traditional gics and are issued by a bank as a benefitresponsive bank depositsecurities lending — the plus fund participates in a securities lending program under which its custodian is authorized to lend a limited amount of fixed income securities backing the synthetic gics the fixed income securities that are on loan require cash or other forms of collateral at least equal to the market value of the securities loaned as provided for in a securities lending agency agreement with jpmorgan chase bank na the collateral received is reinvested into cash equivalents including money market funds as with other extensions of credit there are risks of delay in recovery of the securities on loan in the event of default or insolvency of the borrower the plus fund will be indemnified by its custodian for the securities lending program conducted through the custodian if at the time of a default by a borrower some or all of the loaned securities have not been returned by the borrowercrediting rate — investors in the plus fund receive a daily accrual to their accounts that seeks to approximate the plus fund’s expected yield the crediting rate is set monthly at the end of the prior month and seeks to approximate what the plus fund’s actual earnings will be for the current month increased or decreased to adjust for differences between actual and credited earnings in prior periods this crediting rate is estimated taking into account current yields on the plus fund’s holdings in gics and money market funds and prior period performance of the securities underlying the separate account and synthetic gics held by the plus fund the plus fund’s monthly crediting rate may not move in the same direction as prevailing interest rates over certain time periodsthe trust company reserves the right to change the plus fund’s policies or fees at any timeprincipal investment risks   different risks are associated with the different types of stable value investment contracts in which the plus fund invests generally stable
