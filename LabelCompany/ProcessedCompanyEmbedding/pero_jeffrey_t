you response internatural foods only deals with pero in the united states comment link tuesday  october   posted by kari i love pero my favorite winter drink being on hemo dialysis i would like to know the amounts of potassium and phosphros as these two minerals can make or break me having it response there is  mg of potassium per  ml of pero there is no phosphorus in pero comment link thursday  october   posted by hy havers i had to give up coffee so tried pero and i love it im also supposed to stick to low fiber stuff do you have information on fiber content im hoping something that dissolvessuspends so well cant be in the same fiber category as a thick barley soup response the manufacturers claim is the following  g pero contains  g of dietary fibers which equals a content of  g per cup when prepared with g pero this quantity would be too small to talk about diuretic properties of pero we are assuring this means that it has negligible diuretic effects on the body we would be happy to be more specific if you have further questions comment link sunday  june   posted by al johnson a new natural foods market named natural grocers recently opened its doors on  e nd st casper wy and carries pero i just wanted to pass that on to you and to potential customers so that you may add that to your websites google map locator i purchased a  ounce jar of pero from the new store and am thankful that it carries it as regular black coffee which i enjoyed drinking has begun to have adverse effect on my stomach its good to see your product in town response thank you for the location and we are glad you are enjoying pero natural grocers has been added to our store locator comment link tuesday  may   posted by ml love your product great coffee flavor with no caffeine my only concern is that i have discovered i am gluten sensitive there is gluten in rye and barley but is it prevalent in the finished product response pero beverage does contain grains after checking with the manufacturer we have confirmed that pero does contain a very small amount of gluten in the range of  mg per  kg   lbs of product  as always we advise that you check with your doctor to determine if this level of gluten would adversely affect you please let us know if you have further questions comment link friday  may   posted by jg hello can you tell me if pero is non acidic or if it is low acid what would the acid content be compare to coffee and where does the acid come from thank you the product tastes the best out of the coffee alternatives out there jg response ph level of pero is  ph level of coffee is around  to  depending on the roasting comment link wednesday  may   posted by allison i just ordered some pero and noticed that your formula has changed to add rye does this ingredient addition change the flavor why did you decide to change the formula response for over  years ending in late  the us government assigned arbitrary punitive duties on imports of chicory in response to a beef dispute with european countries strange but true this resulted in a  duty on all pero products for this reason we turned to switzerland to produce our products over this  year period as a result any change in suppliers of raw materials may result in slight changes in the finished product even though every attempt is made to minimize these deviations as we have moved production back to germany sorry for any inconvenience thank you  we absolutely love this product and hope that it will taste just as good when we receive our new order comment link saturday  april
