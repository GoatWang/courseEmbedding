speaks shc speaks shc speaksmeet ryan vero svp and president grocery and drug may   by shc staff ryan vero svp and president grocery and drug kmart format ryan vero recently met with sears holdings associates to share the grocery and drug business unit’s current strategies and discuss how his team is contributing to our company’s transformation ryan also updated associates on our kfresh concept which was piloted in norridge illinois and kahului hawaii after speaking he spent some time answering some questions from associates what is the current strategy for grocery and drug at kmart to start grocery is working to improve gross margin and operating profit dollars through a series of initiatives we are testing a variety of changes to our promotions and pricing on key items and our assortments to better align them with the different members shopping our various stores my team has also tested the kfresh concept to include fresh produce frozen dairy deli and meat products our three major focus areas include growing profitable sales improving inventory productivity and engaging our members what’s the difference between a super kmart and the kfresh concept  kfresh is a significantly different business model than what a super k is a super k is essentially a fullservice grocery store with kfresh what we are trying to do is not solve for  percent of a person’s grocery needs but provide  percent of our members with  percent of their grocery needs it’s not intended to be the weekly grocery trip store like a super k it’s a significantly different business model we aren’t cutting meat in the store but selling prepackaged products and are selling thawtoserve for bakery items instead we have also partnered with local bakers to provide our members with fresh and unique items we are constantly learning from our members on assortment choices that drive their shopping destination my team has seen compelling results including increases in trips and sales and we are evaluating expanding our kfresh test to additional markets what are the biggest challenges we face with the vendor community given the reduced store counts yearoveryear   we focus on how we are driving productivity in the stores that we have i think every good businessperson can appreciate smart business decisions where you decide to close an unproductive store our focus has to be on better serving our members and we have been working with our vendors to do that more effectively we have assets here as a company that none of our competitors have think about the power and leverage we have with our shop your way data that enable us to better understand our members we are invested in selling our strengths and figuring out what’s right for our business and our members how do we determine what food trends are right for us we continue to evaluate and assess various food trends in the market for example we have certainly gone after the organic trend in the kfresh stores and have seen positive results from our members but as these trends continue to emerge we must understand how they align with our particular members we are also focused on customizing our assortments to meet the needs of our members and localizing their demands it’s important to have the data to understand our individual members and their unique needs our job is to figure out how we best meet those needs with the products that they want a trend we have also seen is consumers’ loyalty to store brands we have our private label brands such as little ones champion breed smart sense and image essentials which offer a high value for our members from a member engagement standpoint this is important to drive more impactful results we are working to grow their baskets and drive more trips   ryan vero is the
