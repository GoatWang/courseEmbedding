form n ⋅  n     in that sense almost all cullen numbers are composite hooleys proof was reworked by hiromi suyama to show that it works for any sequence of numbers n · na  b where a and b are integers and in particular also for woodall numbers the only known cullen primes are those for n equal                 sequence a in the oeis still it is conjectured that there are infinitely many cullen primes as of february update the largest known cullen prime is  ×    it is a megaprime with  digits and was discovered by a primegrid participant from japan a cullen number cn is divisible by p  n −  if p is a prime number of the form k   furthermore it follows from fermats little theorem that if p is an odd prime then p divides cmk for each mk  k − k   p −  − k for k   it has also been shown that the prime number p divides cp     when the jacobi symbol   p is − and that p divides cp −    when the jacobi symbol   p is  it is unknown whether there exists a prime number p such that cp is also prime generalizationsedit sometimes a generalized cullen number base b is defined to be a number of the form n × bn   where n    b if a prime can be written in this form it is then called a generalized cullen prime woodall numbers are sometimes called cullen numbers of the second kind according to fermats little theorem if there is a prime p such that n is divisible by p   and n   is divisible by p especially when n  p   and p does not divide b then bn must be congruent to  mod p since bn is a power of bp   and bp   is congruent to  mod p thus n × bn   is divisible by p so it is not prime for example if some n congruent to  mod  ie        n × bn   is prime then b must be divisible by  except b   least n such that n × bn   is prime are with question marks if this term is currently unknown                                                                                                      sequence a in the oeis b numbers n such that n × bn   is prime these n are
