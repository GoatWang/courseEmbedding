and chief financial officer thanks ron good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today we will review the fourth quarter and full year financial results for  as well as provide some insight into our thinking for  with me today are norman schwartz john goetz shannon hall president of our life science group and john hertia president of our diagnostics group lets start with a review of the quarterly results we are pleased to report net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal  of  million a decrease of  when compared to the year ago period sales of  million on a currency neutral basis however quarterly sales actually grew  this dramatic difference represents a currency headwind of more than  million on the top line during the quarter we experienced good currency neutral sales growth across many of our product lines most notably in our life science group including continued strong sales of our droplet digital pcr products process media and our cell biology product line our diagnostics group also posted good growth for the quarter with strong sales of our diabetes monitoring autoimmune and blood typing products as well as quality control the consolidated gross margin for the quarter was inline with expectation at  and compares to last years gross margins of  the improvement in gross margin is largely the result of approximately  million of onetime cost in the fourth quarter of last year associated with the discontinuation of a small product line in addition during this fourth quarter weve recorded a total of approximately  million in cost of goods sold for the noncash purchase accounting expenses related to acquisition this compares to  million of amortization expense in the year ago period sga expense for the fourth quarter was  million or  of sales compared to  million or  of sales last year when compared to last year the current quarter sga includes benefit related to currency translations which effectively lowered sga on a reported basis by about  million in addition the current quarter includes a contingent consideration benefit of  million and finally in sga the amortization of intangibles related to prior acquisitions in the fourth quarter was approximately  million down slightly from the year ago period research and development expense in q was  of sales or  million versus  million last year this decrease in rd spending from last year is primarily related to the completion of key projects as well as expense taken in  for the discontinuation of a product line with the strong sales growth improved gross margin and lower operating spend the reported operating margin for the fourth quarter was better than expected at  and compares to  in the fourth quarter of last year however when thinking about last year we remember that the fourth quarter of  included onetime expenses related to the shutdown of certain product lines as well as contingent consideration charges interest and other for the quarter was a net expense of approximately  million compared to  million last year the effective tax rate used in the fourth quarter was significantly lower than expected at  a result of the reinstatement of the federal rd tax credit for  a reduction in certain tax reserves and a tax benefit from excess foreign tax credits related to a dividend from one of our foreign subsidiaries reported net income for the fourth quarter was  million or  per share on a fully diluted basis compared to  million last year or  per share excluding the discrete tax items i just mentioned we estimate that earnings per share would have been  and now for certain segment information our life science group reported strong sales for the fourth quarter of  million this represents a decline of  versus last year however on a currency neutral basis sales increased  for the quarter as i mentioned earlier these quarterly results reflect continued strong sales of our digital pcr systems and consumables as well as process media and our family of cell biology and western blotting products on a geographic basis currency neutral sales grew across many regions of life science most notably north america china and europe you may recall that during the third quarter life science sales were negatively impacted by system and productivity challenges associated with the go live of our second deployment of sap and on the last earnings call we signaled some caution regarding the groups ability to catch up the backlog especially in the face of sizeable q demand today we are pleased to report that the systemrelated challenges have been substantially remediated our clinical diagnostics group also achieved good sales for the quarter of  million compared to  million last year a decrease of  on a reported basis but growth of  currency neutral these sales were led by continued strong performance in the quality control and diabetes product line as well as solid growth for blood typing and bioplex  revenue on a geographic view diagnostic currency neutral sales for the quarter increased most notably in china north america and the emerging markets while sales in europe continued to decline looking at the full year financial results we are pleased to report annual revenues of  billion while this represents a decrease of  versus the last year on a reported basis on a currency neutral basis sales for the year grew  this dramatic swing reflects a currency headwind to sales of more than  million for the full year our life science group posted annual sales of  million a decline of  versus  and growth of  currency neutral with the swing representing  million of currency headwind this growth was fueled by continued strong sales of our digital pcr instruments and consumable we also saw good annual growth in our western imagers and reagent cell biology and process media products from a geographic view sales in north america europe and china were the biggest contributors to yearoveryear growth for the life science group for the year clinical diagnostic sales were  million a decline of  on a reported basis but growth  on a currency neutral basis a currency headwind of  million for the full year this growth was fueled by continued momentum in quality controls autoimmune and diabetes monitoring products on a geographic view sales of north america china and latin america were the biggest contributors to yearoveryear currency neutral growth for the diagnostics group total company gross margins for the full year of  were in line with guidance at  and compares to  in  the increase in margin versus last year is primarily the results of a more favorable product mix as well as the onetime charges for the discontinuation of small product lines and consolidation of small manufacturing operations during  also important to note total amortization of intangibles and purchase accounting recorded in cost of goods sold for  was  million sga expense as a percent of sales was  for the year or  million and compares to  million in  the decrease in spend yearoveryear relates to benefit associated with the stronger dollar as well as the reduction in overall contingent consideration and the absence of the fcpa related settlement accrual taken during  and finally in sga total expense for acquisition related amortization was  million for the full year research and development expense in  was  million or  of sales and compares to  million or  of sales last year this decrease is a result of the discontinuation of an underperforming product line in  as well as the wind down of spending for new instruments for blood typing and diabetes monitoring that were launched earlier in  looking to  rd expenses as a percentage of sales will likely stay at that  to  level as we move a number of investments through the product development pipeline net income for the full year was  million versus last years net income of  million fully diluted earnings per share for the year were  the effective tax rate for the full year  was  and lower than our  full year tax rate of  due to the previously mentioned discrete items affecting the fourth quarter as well as the mix of sales in lower tax jurisdiction for  we expect the effective tax rate excluding any discrete items that may occur to be in the  to  range for  biorads balance sheet remains strong as of december  total cash and shortterm investments were  million compared to  million at the end of last year net cash generated from operations during the fourth quarter was  million and  million for the full year  this compares to net cash generated from operations in  of  million the yearoveryear decrease in cash flow is substantially related to the lower sales on a reported basis and includes approximately  million of currency headwinds and receivables ebitda for  remained strong at nearly  million which includes  million of ebitda generated in the fourth quarter the ebitda margin improved to  of sales and compares to  in  net capital expenditures were  million for the quarter and  million for the full year slightly below the  million to  million range estimated on our last call looking to  we estimate that capex spending will increase to the  million to  million range as we continue to invest in our global erp and other systems as well as some foundational projects in europe finally depreciation and amortization for the quarter was  million and  million for the full year looking to  we see several opportunities for growth on the topline the momentum we are seeing in many of our life science product lines is encouraging for future growth in addition funding for research around the world seems to be improving as such we are targeting an increase in the life science growth to be in the  to  range on the diagnostics side of the business we also see opportunities for currency neutral growth in many of our core businesses including an increase in consumable sales associated with our new instruments for the blood typing and diabetes monitoring markets offsetting much of this expected growth we continue to face some sizable challenges in the diagnostic market including a continued decline in europe price pressure in government tenders and lab consolidation in selected markets around the world as such we are targeting the diagnostic currency neutral growth rate to be similar to the  rate of  to  overall the combined result of the opportunities and challenges across both businesses leads us to the expectation of sales growth in  of around  to  on a currency neutral basis for the full year with regard to margin you can see that we made solid currency neutral improvement to our profitability in  even in light of another year of significant spending for new technologies and systems during  we improved the gross margin by more than  basis points and are targeting to maintain if not slightly improve those levels in  in thinking about the operating margin for  we continue to see sizable investment in the pipeline as we move our global erp project to europe our most complex region from an operating standpoint during the year we will not only be investing in the erp design and implementation we will also be investing in new infrastructure and organizational improvement to ready the region for a more efficient footprint and transaction flow postsap all of these projects require a significant increase in spending having said that we do not want to take away the gains made during  and we will work hard to maintain a currency neutral operating margin around  to  for the full year on a reported basis the strong us dollar will continue to have a negative impact on our reported results for  at least for the first half of the year as many of you know biorad is a very global company in terms of both sales and operation and currency can have a significant impact on our reported result more than  of our sales are nonus dollar and we estimate that around  or  of our expenses are nonus dollar as such with todays strong dollar environment currency can have a significant negative impact to our financial outlook as i mentioned during the  results comments changes in foreign currency negatively impacted our revenue by more than  million for the year and as i mentioned our outlook for currency neutral sales growth in  is  to  however if we use exchange rates as of december  currency could actually result in a revenue headwind of  million to  million and perhaps flat yearoveryear reported sales and while we do have some natural hedge with the nondollar expenses this currency headwind could impact our expected operating margin by  basis points or more and essentially mask the great progress that we made with operating profit in closing let me just say that despite a relatively flat outlook for  profitability we will remain highly committed to focusing on ways to create greater leverage in our operating expenses while at the same time continuing our investments in new technologies and systems it is through these new products and technologies and a more efficient footprint that we can improve our gross profit and it is through changes in our organizational structure and implementing new global it systems that we can reduce our overall operating cost all of which will ultimately contribute to a significant improvement in our operating margin in the years to come and now ill turn things over to norman for a few comments norman d schwartz  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you christine so i think its fair to say while currency had an overwhelming effect on the reported results i mean i think you can see from christines comments that we did make progress on many fronts kind of the underlying currency neutral sales growth did benefit from a wave of new products that were not only introduced in late  but also supplemented by some of the notable introductions and regulatory clearances that we had from  and certainly we expect continued travel from those i think that internally much of our attention was focused on our erp project deployment two in this last year and also completing the restructuring of our operations with the implementation of these global systems we saw the opportunity to move to what we think of as a more functional structure which we spent much of  implementing i would say the two most notable or principle changes we made were to globalize our commercial or the selling operation and to globalize our supply chain we spent much of the year establishing the structure filling the positions created by this change i think we were fortunate in this regard to have some good bench strength and feel the majority of these positions from within we do see much potential from this organization the product groups can now focus their attention to our markets and ensure we continue to develop the innovative quality products that we are known for and the globalization of our sales and service organization should allow us to think more globally and really to better serve our increasing number of global customers and finally our new supply chain organization which encompasses procurement manufacturing and distribution i think for us functionalizing these areas and globalizing these areas gives us many opportunities to drive both efficiency and effectiveness for the company obviously it will take some time to see the results but we do expect them to be measurable i do feel we have now largely completed this transition and it appears that everyones excited about what we can accomplish for the company going forward so with that i guess we will open it up to questions questionandanswer session operator thank you ladies and gentlemen our first question comes from the line of dan leonard with leerink your line is open please go ahead dan l leonard  leerink partners llc thank you first of all on the erp is there any way to think about – if you had any boost in the fourth quarter from resolving some backlog that was left over from the third quarter issues or do you consider the fourth quarter organic sales growth to be a run rate number christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer dan thats a really great question and you may remember on the third quarter call we were kind of estimating that disruption could have been  million to  million range and its really hard to pinpoint that number but i think we made up at least  of whatever that number was pick something in the middle  million  million i think that was part of the growth in q but its difficult to pinpoint exactly how much is make up from q and how much is q without a doubt we knew going into q where the orders were coming in and the demand wave that was in front of us so i dont want to take away from the organic nature of the fourth quarter either dan l leonard  leerink partners llc got it and i know you said china grew across both diagnostics and life sciences can you quantify the growth rate at least ballpark was it midsingle digits was it high single digits and whats your expectation for china in  christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so ill talk a little bit about  and then maybe john and shannon want to chime in on  and you know dan we dont talk about sales specifically per region or growth rate per region what i can tell you is that diagnostics continues to grow at a really nice doubledigit rate in china life science i think because of a lot of what happened in the beginning of the year some slowing has been system related much of that impacted china they ended up with a growth rate in china thats in the single digits for the year which was probably lower than what we would have expected at the beginning of the year but both exited  with pretty decent momentum in china i dont know if theres anything –  china john hertia  evp  presidentclinical diagnostics group for diagnostics this is john hertia china continues to represent good opportunities in immunology and quality control and diabetes theres still a little bit of a challenge with respect to registration they have the china fda and thats a little bit of a wild card going into  so were probably a little conservative on how that could impact us going into the next year christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah good point dan l leonard  leerink partners llc got it and then my final question i guess for you john how are you contemplating the potential introduction of the ih  in the us how is that being contemplated in the guidance for  could that present potential upside to guidance or is that the kind of launch that would take a little bit longer to fully showup in numbers john hertia  evp  presidentclinical diagnostics group so we were targeting three fda approvals for  we did get two of them in we got t cleared in december and the infinity blood typing system also cleared in december the fda did ask for some additional data the north american gel and the ih  were in the process of getting that back to them and well just have to wait for some additional guidance from them from the time that we get clearance to introduction isnt a very long runway christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer and i think in terms of the outlook in the plan dan we dont have the clearance yet i think we remain very optimistic that we will receive it but at the time as weve said all along coming into the north american market with the gel technology while quite compelling for the customers it is a long sales cycle and not something that happens overnight so i think weve been very conservative in our expectations all along as to how quickly we would ramp up and take share in the us market and i think thats true for the  plan as well dan l leonard  leerink partners llc got it thank you operator thank you  our next question comes from the line of brandon couillard with jefferies your line is open please go ahead brandon couillard  jefferies llc thanks good afternoon christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer hi brandon brandon couillard  jefferies llc christine did you disclose the impact on the operating profit dollar line from currency in the fourth quarter christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer i dont think i said what the brandon couillard  jefferies llc but do you have it on – at your fingertips or do you have it at your fingertips by chance christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer if i can get this stack of papers yeah i think the operating margin was – well thats yeartodate wait a minute you want the quarter brandon couillard  jefferies llc yeah just the fourth quarter number christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think the operating margin was closer to  for the quarter instead of the  on a currency neutral basis brandon couillard  jefferies llc okay so maybe about – okay all right a question on the propel flow cytometer acquisition could you speak to the financial implications of that is that dilutive nearterm and sort of what do you see is the competitive differentiation of that system and do you think there is an opportunity to bundle it with the  you picked up back in  christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer so in terms of – in terms of impact on operating expense going into  is all included within our outlook in terms of market opportunity you are talking about the new flow cytometer brandon couillard  jefferies llc yeah the press release you put out i think last week or two weeks ago christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so i think shannons probably a better person to speak about the opportunity and how it fits in our product family shannon hall  executive vp  presidentlife science group so weve been pursuing the cell biology market as an area for growth for biorad it fits really closely with our overall approach to doing protein and dna and rna analysis at the bench our cell biology portfolio was oriented towards accessing a broader user base which is part of what s is about and the cytometer builds on that by offering a user centric cytometer that offers features really aimed at creating an accessible cytometer across multiple levels of users and multiple levels of analytical capabilities brandon couillard  jefferies llc christine any chance you can quantify the nearterm drag on the op line from that christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer its about  million in the fourth quarter brandon couillard  jefferies llc all right i think thats all i got thanks operator thank you and i am showing no further questions at this time id like to turn the call back over to christine for any closing remarks christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer okay well thank you everyone for taking the time to join us today we appreciate your

that id like to turn over the call to christine tsingos executive vice president and chief financial officer christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks ron good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us net sales for the third quarter of  were  million a decrease of  on a reported basis and versus the same period last year sales of  million the currency headwind to sales was more than  million for the quarter on a currency neutral basis sales decreased  when compared to last year you may remember that on the second quarter earnings call we cautioned that the continued challenges in europe coupled with seasonality could make for a tough quarter especially for our diagnostics group and that certainly was the case in addition our life science group also faced challenges primarily related to a slowing of growth in various emerging markets as well as system and productivity challenges associated with the golive of our new erp even with these challenges during the quarter we did experience good currencyneutral sales growth across some our key life science and diagnostic product lines including sales of our digital pcr consumables and our western blotting workflow products as well as our quality controls product line the reported gross margin for the quarter was slightly better than expected at  and compares to  in the yearago period this improvement in margin versus last year is related to a more favorable product mix lower cost as a result of the manufacturing operations and product lines that were shut down during  and a decrease in amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles the total noncash purchase accounting expense recorded in cost of goods sold related to prior acquisitions was  million for the quarter which compares to  million in the yearago period sga expenses for the third quarter were  million or  of sales compared to  million and  of sales last year the yearoveryear decrease in expense relates to foreign currency translation as well as onetime items contained in the third quarter of  including an accrual of  million in connection with the final settlement of the fcpa matter and a  million benefit related to the valuation of the purchase consideration for prior acquisitions and finally quarterly sga includes a total of  million for the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles research and development expense in q was  of sales or  million down both sequentially and versus last year this comparison reflects a decline in spending associated with the completion of key projects as well as some reduction related to currency translation going forward we expect rd expense to continue to be in the  to  of sales range during the quarter interest and other income was a net expense of  million compared to  million last year this improvement is partially the result of foreign currency exchange losses which were substantially lower this year versus last year and as a reminder the third quarter of last year included an additional  million of accrued interest associated with the fcpa matter the effective tax rate used for the third quarter was approximately  and in line with our guidance excluding any discrete items that may occur we continue to expect the full year tax rate to be in the  to  range this range excludes any impact from the potential reinstatement of the federal rd tax credit which once reinstated will have a significant positive impact on the rate net income for the third quarter was  million which compares to  million in the yearago period diluted earnings per share for the quarter were  life science reported sales for the third quarter decreased  to  million on a currencyneutral basis sales declined  versus last year sales of our droplet digital pcr products continue to do well along with our v western workflow product family however revenue growth for the life science group overall during the quarter was significantly impacted by a slowdown in our supply chain activity in the wake of the golive of our second deployment of sap the temporary disruption in productivity while adapting to new systems and processes is not atypical although the impact to the third quarter revenue was sizeable especially in north america we believe that this negatively impacted life science sales in the quarter by  million to  million the good news is that bookings remained strong during the third quarter and much of the disrupted revenue was likely a matter of timing and not a change in demand our clinical diagnostic group posted quarterly sales of  million a decrease of  compared to last year on a currency neutral basis sales were down slightly about  growth during the quarter was primarily fueled by good demand in our quality control products as well as our bioplex business on a geographic view north america posted good growth with nearly every product line up versus the yearago period looking outside the us our european markets continue to be negatively impacted by the challenges from lab consolidation and pricing pressure and as i mentioned earlier seasonality was also a factor in our slower growth and now for a quick review of the balance sheet as of september  total cash and shortterm investments were  million net cash generated from operations during the quarter was  million compared to  million last quarter and  million in the third quarter of last year this decrease in cash flow versus last year is substantially related to the decrease in reported sales and includes approximately  million of currency headwinds in receivables adjusted ebitda for the quarter was  million or  of sales net capital expenditures for the quarter were  million which represents a decrease both sequentially and yearoveryear the decrease in spend for the current quarter is related to the timing of payments and will likely be paid before year end however given the yeartodate run rate our fullyear expectation for capex is now slightly lower in the  million to  million range depreciation and amortization for the quarter was  million moving to our outlook for the remainder of the year we continue to anticipate strong currency headwinds to the top line yeartodate that headwind has been more than  million on a currency neutral basis yeartodate sales growth is  and below our original annual guidance of  given the third quarter results and the continuing market challenges in europe and coupled with our own systemsrelated issues in our life science group we now expect fullyear currency neutral sales growth in the  to  range for the full year as i mentioned earlier the slowdown in our supply chain processes is likely a matter of timing and not lost sales but it may take us into early next year to fully regain the tempo in recognized revenue and finally lets not forget that sales in the fourth quarter of last year were substantial which could make for a tougher comparison from a profitability standpoint our guidance has been for consolidated gross margins of  and an operating margin of  on a currencyneutral basis while yeartodate results are running at or slightly above our margin guidance remember that historically our margins tend to drift down in the fourth quarter as product mix shifts more towards instrument sales and spending for projects becomes fully ramped as has been our practice in prior years we will share our thinking and outlook for  in february during the fourth quarter earnings call and now we are happy to take your questions questionandanswer session operator and our first question comes from the line of brandon couillard from jefferies your line is open brandon couillard  jefferies llc thanks i guess maybe this is a better question for john could you elucidate some of the issues that occurred with the erp rollout in the quarter if i think back to the second quarter call in august which was probably a month and a half after the initial rollout it didnt sound like there were any disruptions or issues that had occurred at that time what changed really between now and then john goetz  chief operating officer yeah this is john goetz i guess what weve found is that the process timing being able to take an order and get a product shipped has taken a lot longer than we really realized at the time of the call and really what thats done is its moving shipments and sales recognition out beyond probably i think somewhere around two weeks so thats what were looking at there in addition i think the adoption of the system in our manufacturing plants has gone a little rockier than weve experienced during the first rollout during the first rollout we really had only one manufacturing plant come online with this one this brought up all of the rest of our diagnostic manufacturing as well as all of our life science manufacturing here in the united states so this has added quite a bit of complexity so the amount of time and effort that weve had to be able to cover the questions and requests to respond to some of the concerns of our users has just taken us a little bit longer to get a handle on brandon couillard  jefferies llc which outstanding issues if any are still to be resolved and christine why would it necessarily take several quarters for the revenue trend to normalize christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so i think a lot of this brandon is just people getting used to how to use a brand new system and we know from the first deployment that it takes six months to nine months for people to really get good at doing their jobs again with new processes new screens et cetera i think what were facing here different in deployment two than deployment one as john said it really brings in our entire life science group and much of their manufacturing is here and they ship to many places around the world so it can ripple to a lot of locations around the world and people need to as they get used to the processes then things start flowing more quickly so part of the caution on how long itll take is a little bit based on what we experienced with the first one but also knowing that the complexity of this second deployment and the complexity of our life science business is even that much greater and could take more time to normalize and part of it frankly is that demand has been quite strong and so there was a lot hitting on the system at the same time people were getting used to these new processes brandon couillard  jefferies llc okay and then in life science business christine could you give us a sense of how the process chromatography media performed in the period i believe you lapped a pretty tough comp there was curious if that was an incremental headwind for the segment as well christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer sure and shannon hall our president of life science is here so im going to let her talk about that as well in terms of the process media a tough compare yearoveryear shannon hall  executive vp  presidentlife science group yeah that period is a toughtocompare period but christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah its a lumpy business shannon hall  executive vp  presidentlife science group yeah very much so its been a solid year so far we continue to see great demand in that area so id say itd be easier to look at on a fullyear basis brandon couillard  jefferies llc okay and then last one finally christine or maybe this is a better one for ron ive been getting quite a number of questions from investors recently about your exact exposure to sartorius and i believe in your last q for the first time you called out an unrealized gain of about  million which you attributed to the preferreds was curious if you could quantify your exact exposure in terms of the preferred stock either in number of shares or any round numbers christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer so historically we really havent disclosed exactly what we own in preferred shares we do talk about whats on the books versus – the carrying value versus the estimated market value and as a reminder the voting shares we are holding at cost the preferred shares we marktomarket and i think certainly they continue to do well and so the unrealized gain on our investment continues to increase as well brandon couillard  jefferies llc super ill hop back in the queue thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bryan engler from great lakes advisors your line is open bryan langsam engler  great lakes advisors llc my question has been answered thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeffrey matthews from ram partners your line is open jeffrey l matthews  ram partners lp hi can you hear me ronald w hutton  treasurer  vice president yes christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer hi jeff jeffrey l matthews  ram partners lp hi aside from the currency and the erp what were the big surprises operationally in the quarter would you say norman d schwartz  chairman president  chief executive officer i think those are the two big ones i think that the continued softness in europe i think that probably when we went into the year we were a little more optimistic about maybe being farther through the cycle especially in france with this lab consolidation but it appears that weve got a ways to go with that christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah jeffrey l matthews  ram partners lp excuse me why do you think that is norm whats happening that keeps this ball rolling norman d schwartz  chairman president  chief executive officer its just the continuous consolidation of labs especially in france christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer i think remember jeff we had a very strong market share position in france compared to some of our competitors so as that market has consolidated in terms of the number of labs weve probably felt a disproportional impact compared to other ibd providers in france because we had such a strong market share position there and i think some of the economic woes of the region are bleeding into eastern europe and that may be more than we would have anticipated at the beginning of the year and you know regulatory changes continue throughout much of the emerging market world both in eastern europe and asiapacific jeffrey l matthews  ram partners lp okay and that leads to my next question which is what have you seen in china and japan this last quarter whats new and different norman d schwartz  chairman president  chief executive officer not much is new and different i would say japan continues to hobble along at a slow pace for both life science and diagnostics china its kind of running about the same as it has been certainly i think some of the slowdown that we have experienced in china this quarter has been related to the erp implementation and being able to ship products and recognize the revenue in the quarter but i think the underlying market is still about the same jeffrey l matthews  ram partners lp okay so i guess erpwise then ibm is happy to get to keep all their people there and spend a lot more time trying to help you out norman d schwartz  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i would say its largely a learning curve the system is running i think its running pretty well its just our adapting to the way it works and changing our mindset around the discipline of this system is probably the biggest challenge jeffrey l matthews  ram partners lp it sounds like what john was saying earlier you went from the first iteration you added one plant this time you added multiple plants and i would imagine its mainly just a function of the scale of it is there anything that you see in it that makes you any less enthusiastic about what youre thinking the outcome will be or does it change your timing of the rollout in europe norman d schwartz  chairman president  chief executive officer no i think were still enthusiastic about it i think the people who are using it see the benefits of it its just a matter of getting used to it and learning to use it as a tool its kind of like when you pick up a hammer or a saw for the first time it takes a while to get acclimated to it and to learn how to use it i think its the same thing with this system jeffrey l matthews  ram partners lp and how about timing on the european implementation any change there christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah weve been continuing to talk about going live in europe during  and well spend much of  doing the design with each deployment the complexity increases as we take it to more complex pieces of our business and without question the life science business model is much more complex than a diagnostic business model and the number of products is at least three times and so the second deployment was a big implementation for us thatll actually help us a little as we go to europe because most of the products will be in the system already so hopefully well be able to stay on the projected timeline of going live in a series of deployments during  as we roll through europe jeffrey l matthews  ram partners lp okay thanks and final question and i dont know what you can say about this but this whistle blower case related to the fcpa stuff seems to be creating new precedents into law has this continuation of it in its current iteration had any impact on your settlement is there anything that could come out of this that could affect the pl that we should be aware of or is this just a side issue norman d schwartz  chairman president  chief executive officer i think its probably better not to comment on items that are currently open litigation jeffrey l matthews  ram partners lp understood thank you operator thank you it looks like we have a followup from mr couillard from jefferies this is brandon couillard from jefferies your line is open brandon couillard  jefferies llc thanks go all the way around the horn a question for john hertia could you give us an update on where the ih  stands with the fda whether youve had any dialogue or feedback from the agency which seems to be holding up the approval and then in terms of the bioplex  would love to get a status update on where you stand in terms of the menu rollout and any round numbers you can give us in terms of placement growth activity yeartodate john hertia  evp  presidentclinical diagnostics group sure brandon this is john maybe well address the ih  first so we are in constant dialogue with the fda still pretty optimistic that well get news before the end of the year on the ih  and the north american gel launch and also the infinity system which is targeted at our midvolume laboratories on bioplex were seeing i would say increased traction in autoimmune weve had really good response to celiac and our measles panel also the addition of vitamin d and hiv and were seeing a wave of lets say increased requests for second and third placements within accounts that had bioplex upfront and thats been really good news brandon couillard  jefferies llc great thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeffrey matthews from ram partners your line is open jeffrey l matthews  ram partners lp hi thanks norman theranos seems to be imploding i dont know if you were as surprised as i was reading about it wondered if you had any thoughts about what it means for what they were ultimately trying to do does it cast doubt on the whole notion of this liquid biopsy explosion or is it a oneoff bad business model kind of thing norman d schwartz  chairman president  chief executive officer i dont know its really hard to say i guess i would put this down to maybe growing pains and it seems like any young company goes through a few of these things i think theres certainly some value in what theyre trying to do and the audience that theyre trying to reach and so well have to see how they navigate it jeffrey l matthews  ram partners lp all right thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of dan leonard from leerink your line is open dan l leonard  analyst leerink partners llc thanks and i hopped on late so apologies if its been asked already but you called out digital pcr again as a growth lever in the life sciences business can you give us an update on how large that business is either in terms of revenue or placements and then also any insights into the droplet nextgen sequencing instrument that you might be able to offer christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer so dan as you know we dont give out details of our revenue by our various product lines we believe it continues to do very well both in terms of revenue and the instrument placements all over the world and another encouraging sign is how our customers are using the product itself and the papers that continue to be published which then has a kind of a selffulfilling prophecy of generating even more demand for that product but its not something weve given out specific information on in terms of the size of that business dan l leonard  analyst leerink partners llc but it does sound like you continue to expect it to be a good growth driver going forward norman d schwartz  chairman president  chief executive officer yes christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah dan l leonard  analyst leerink partners llc got it and then the droplet sequencing instrument is there any updates to be had there christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer development and norman d schwartz  chairman president  chief executive officer okay well certainly that continues to be under development theyre making good progress i dont have an exact schedule for you but its still a little ways off dan l leonard  analyst leerink partners llc got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of scott wilkin from ubs your line is open scott wilkin  ubs global asset management thank you and good afternoon i was just hoping – i think maybe john is probably the best equipped to answer this i was just curious if you could put a little more color on the lost sales of  million to  million in the quarter and how youre confident that thats not business thats going elsewhere i understand maybe youre slow to be able to ship the revenue its just when i think about researchers doing experiments and ordering product theyre doing it as they need to do the experiments right and so how is this not leading to lost business as opposed to a delay john goetz  chief operating officer okay well were very close to our customers number one and through this launch of the system weve been monitoring customer satisfaction pretty closely and we have the ability to lets say flex a little bit about where products can go and so if i think about what the impact has been its just added time for us to get products shipped and the adoption has also caused us a little bit of problem with backorders the combination of those two things has caused what were thinking about in this  million to  million range but in terms of do we think were going lose the business we dont believe we will bookings are strong and as i said were staying very very close to our customers christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah scott wilkin  ubs global asset management go ahead christine christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer scott i would also add that a lot of this is instrumentrelated and there its not so much the daytoday i need more consumables for my experiments that i really need that instrument and for us the larger instruments need to not only be delivered but also accepted by the customers et cetera and so as the timeline gets pushed out it can push sales from one period to the next scott wilkin  ubs global asset management i see so what youre saying is you expect the backorder to persist through q and its more instrumentrelated so its not a daily consumable issue christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer some level could persist since this quarterend we have been tracking it in great detail every single week and see with each passing week its getting better and better but theres a fair amount of demand i guess thats the good news in it scott wilkin  ubs global asset management okay thank you operator thank you we will hold for one moment to see if anyone else wants to queue up and that looks like all the questioners that were going to have for today so id like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks christine a tsingos  executive vice president and chief financial officer okay great thank you andrew and thank you everyone for

later is still doing business in its own way    back to gallery long before the genome was mapped before investors went internet crazy even before color television david and alice schwartz started a scientific supply company called biorad laboratories now  years later they still preside over a familyrun biotech firm that stands out in an industry dominated by young companies run by professional managers founded in  in west berkeley biorad today is an  million company that sells thousands of different chemical supplies dna instruments and diagnostic tests to hospitals and biotech laboratories in  countries latest news videos roughly  employees ultimately report to david schwartz  who has trained his son norman  to take over the family business in which alice  still plays a role at the board level during a recent interview at his hercules headquarters david reminisced about doing business the biorad way when we first started nuclear energy was the big thing said david shuffling slowly down the carpeted hall toward his office one of our first products was amino acids tagged with carbon  youd swallow it and the researcher would follow it through your body with a geiger counter he said motioning with his hands thats where the rad in bio rad came from it was short for radiation david said in contrast to todays quickgrowth startups biorad took its time and bootstrapped everything it took us almost  years to reach a million dollars in sales he said in  when biorad finally broke the milliondollar mark the company took its second leap into the modern corporate world  it went public once again however the schwartz family did the ipo its way rather than pay an investment banking firm david said he and alice drafted an offering document got it approved by the california corporations commission and offered the shares to the people they presumed knew biorad best  its customers we mimeographed an order blank and sent it out to  people in california david chuckled we raised  if selfreliance was a virtue complacency was the enemy david said bio rad prospered by shifting its supply focus from nuclear to aerospace to electronics and today to biotechnology these waves of innovation have kept going and its always easy to settle back into doing something you know he said what drove us ahead was interesting technology we looked for something in a bottle that people could use to simplify their experiments in  biorad passed  million in sales it hit  million in  the companys recent  results showed its earnings grew  percent to  million  per share on sales of  million selling off a semiconductor instrumentation division in  left biorad focused on two biotech markets in the arena for laboratory instruments and chemicals biorad competes with the likes of foster citys applied biosystems biorads other big market is selling clinical diagnostic kits to detect many ailments one current hit is a test for mad cow disease biorads earnings are starting to attract attention on wall street which still doesnt know what to make of this family company i have an attractive rating out on the stock said scott greenstone at thomas weisel partners in new york what i like about them is they derive about  percent of their income from chemistry supplies these are consumables that arent as prey to fluctuations as equipment sales but greenstone said several issues make it difficult for wall street to embrace the stock for one thing biorad has such a low average trading volume that big investors cant get in and out without making waves biorad sought to address the liquidity issue by approving a for stock split this month but greenstone said thats only a start another issue that makes wall street somewhat leery of the stock is the fact that biorads voting shares are controlled by the family insulating the board and management from the takeover threats that face most corporate leaders as biorads heir apparent norman schwartz said he has thought a lot about the pluses and minuses of family ownership it certainly is in this day and age a rare model to have a company where you cant throw the rascals out so to speak he said but what do you get in return for that you get a management with real commitment greenstone said biorad also suffers at the moment from the absence of a chief financial officer biorads shares took a dip after cfo tom chesterman departed in december the company had to issue a statement in january saying it was not aware of any reason for the volatility reached at his home office in the east bay chesterman said he left bio rad to help start a new biotech company and was quick to dismiss the idea that his departure might have anything to do with any accounting irregularities theres no enron here he said calling biorad a business to be proud of biorad says it is searching for a replacement jim bennett a longtime biorad manager urged me not to overlook the role of alice schwartz who shuns the spotlight these days but she was the chemistry maven of biorads early years and later the money manager who balanced david schwartzs relentless curiosity the yin and yang of those two is something to behold bennett said of course the next chapter in the biorad saga cant be written until david and alice schwartz turn over the company to their eldest son succession is a sore point in many family firms and david is vague about exactly when the scepter will pass to his son but at one point as david was showing me through biorads research lab he observed that  is the average life expectancy of the
