about a new yorker obsessed with the cult clothing brand supreme offers a fresh strangely affecting critique of american consumerismphotograph by patti mcconville  alamythe consumerist path of least resistance in america takes you to amazon for books uber for transportation starbucks for coffee and pandora for songs facebook’s “trending” list shows you the news while yelp ratings lead you to a nearby burger the illusion of choice amid such plenty is easy to sustain but it’s largely false you’re being herded by algorithms from purchase to purchase here are the places you can spend money the things you can wear the shops contain certain things that change according to a set schedule your purchase goes in a bag with a logo printed on it the logo says something about what’s in the bag and something about where you shop—maybe even something about who you arejames jebbia founded supreme a cult clothing retailer in new york in 99 he is a former associate of the streetwear pioneer shawn stussy whose work from the eighties onward embodied a zeitgeist originating in the surf culture of southern california you could describe it as unfussy but mindful of beauty and quality athletic without being jockish funloving cheeky malefocussed through its connection to hawaii california skatesurf culture has longstanding ties to japan and it also has strong bonds with punk and oi culture with street art and tagging and with weed culture stussy’s genius was in synthesizing these elements into a fashion identity and brand that found admirers far from malibu and san onofresupreme the most prominent of stussy’s heirs added a new york veneer of heightened exclusivity and sophistication to that legacy it’s equal parts retail art project and hangout the company announced its multifarious intentions right up front with a redandwhite logo directly referring to the textual art of barbara kruger—an association the artist found reason to scorn in 0 when the logo was the occasion of a trademark dispute between supreme and a rival clothing brand but even that disconnect in a way somewhat embodied the sense of impudence that keeps kids lining up to buy the brandsupreme’s stuff is just a little expensive for what it is tshirts are priced at around thirty dollars for example but the goods are well made and the prices essentially fair with clever designs expressing the brand’s signature breezy male athleticism semirebellious attitude and sense of fun kate moss joe louis black sabbath charles bronson and betty boop have all made an appearance on supreme merchandise there are hoodies sneakers and offthewall branded goods from pocketknives to fire extinguishers many of the designs are produced in partnership with a wide range of wellknown artists from h r giger to rammellzee to john baldessari to comme des garçons each product is offered in a very limited run creating a lively and lucrative secondary market as david shapiro reported for the new yorker in 0 twentyodd years in the brand is still expanding with its tenth shop in paris having opened a few weeks agointo this context comes “supremacist” a new novel by shapiro who is now working as a corporate lawyer specializing in privateequity transactions he spoke to me by phone on a sunday afternoon when i found him lawyerishly playing minigolf “with a little putting green that i keep in my office” shapiro is also the author of the popular nowdefunct pitchfork reviews reviews blog and the novel “you’re not much use to anyone” the plot of “supremacist” such as it is tells of a mildly unhinged new yorker named david who is obsessed with the supreme brand and who persuades his rich footloose friend camilla to join him on a horrifically intoxicated pilgrimage to every supreme shop in the world in los angeles london japan where they make four stops and back home in new yorkdavid is a social train wreck getting drunk taking too many drugs falling asleep in the street making blunderingly sexist comments and swiping the snack of the passenger napping beside him on an airplane in this way david the narrator who is at some uncertain remove from david the author is a familiar american male character whose candor renders him appealing despite his unpleasantness as we find in bukowski miller mailer updike wallace heller franzen and so on the author whose real surname is not shapiro really went on the trip described in the book and really is a diehard supreme fan when i asked him what he had hoped to achieve with “supremacist” he replied that the trip had itself been the goal “i paid my way by writing this book and that’s what i wanted to do”the story amounts to a weirdly affecting critique of consumerism half homage to supreme and half culturejamming “frankly i find the brand to be like a brilliant art project and also i find obviously some selfloathing in loving it so much” shapiro said “i don’t know there is some dissonance obviously” his feelings about the novel are similarly complicated “i want to divorce myself from it because it’s so ugly and depressing but at the same time realizing that almost everything i say is exactly what would be expected for the narrator to say i mean i made this thing and it’s so ugly and i don’t want it to be anything like me but it is who i am to a great extent”why would you feel that your book is ugly when you’re so patently disgusted with the narrator’s materialist obsessions i asked the criticism presumably comes from somewhere else entirely from a better place you’re saying that this is gross it shouldn’t be like this it should be different—we don’t like being enslaved to things we can buy “yeah yeah the character in the book is like it is absurd to think that you could buy something and wear it and it be a declaration of something intrinsic to you it’s absurd” shapiro said but later he described to me the dual nature of this character’s longing for an unattainable coolness finding that ridiculous impossible but still hoping it’s not “supreme is the coolest thing in a way to the narrator—you know and to me—and he goes on the trip in the hopes of absorbing it through like osmosis” he said “like sitting there long enough and just popping out one day a cool guy not only a cool guy but like    well adjusted and you know all the things that the brand promises”surely all clothing is aspirational to some extent what you wear how you speak how you cut your hair how you educate yourself all create a personality a way of being in the world that you yourself can stand all this is silly and artificial but also not—it’s also serious and has a meaning there’s who you are and how you express your life just by living and then there’s the manufactured sort of carapace that you’re making deliberately to show to other people to signal to them various thingsi tell shapiro about the arguments i’ve had with my elderly mom on this score like when she expresses disapproval of a waitress’s tattoos and i tell her look this is not for you just like when you used to complain about whatever glamrock garbagio i was sporting in the seventies and yes that is how long we have been arguing not for you you are not the audience for these tattoos for those longagotorn fishnets why do you think this lady would be trying to wear something that you would like you have nothing to offer this person you don’t have anything she wants she is communicating to someone else so part of it’s real then when some teenager buys the supreme skateboard deck or the shirt what’s really going on is that he’s showing all his friends i’m this kind of personin the novel david and camilla visit a skater bar in japan where a boy with a beautiful voice is singing karaoke “to a schmaltzy ballad” the kids in the bar call him an otaku a cool japanese boy fools around with his iphone when conversation lags the lowaffect approach is a bit knausgaardian put across in the simplest of declarative sentences but then in a throwaway line david shows them his “fuck bush” tattoo “i’ll never forgive him” its difficult to describe without spoiling the effect but this is just one among many jarring little touches that resituate the narrator’s consumerism and “first world problems” generally in a wider world—a world that is in trouble—one in which so much about an iphone is exploitative and bad and maybe even flying to japan is in a sense ridiculous excessive a wasteful notion let alone flying there to visit four roughly identical shopsbut the point is not belabored the next few moments find david painfully embarrassed of his supreme flower pants “they were meant to demonstrate confidence in my masculinity but suddenly it seemed like i was just a guy wearing very effeminate pants” these absurdities are layered up money spent drinks catalogued anxieties and misunderstandings multiply and yet tiny bits of beauty are wandering in all the time despite everything there are “ghost sculptures” hanging from the ceiling in the supreme store in nagoya david touches all the clothes “especially the fireman’s coat and the love supreme tee” he rhapsodizes about “the material the heavy cotton”just as supreme makes a work of modern art from a joke about retail culture and commerce—a joke about itself—so does “supremacist” echo that joke shapiro’s novel is a mise en abyme an ultra joke about being someone who travels to fukuoka where he can’t resist buying a supreme hardcore hammer that is a hammerhead mounted on an axe handle “i was only a man”shapiro’s vision of materialist america is brutally honest complex and selfcontradictory he takes back the knife of consumerism and makes of it something wild and strange imperfect terrible disturbing unpredictable mutable at once lovely and unbearable that’s why “supremacist” is a far more nuanced and more effective response to materialism than any soupcan painting could ever be it breaks all the ordinary frameworks of oppositional cultural criticism now inside it all now outside loving and hating all that we are it isn’t sly like the pepsi “choice of a new generation” ads so masterfully skewered by david foster wallace or reactionary or appropriationist as thomas frank describes consumer culture in “the conquest of cool” it’s a sharp candid portrait of the artist as a young man in twentyfirstcentury new york and of the sick but also magical world in which he livesawaiting the book’s publication on july th shapiro is pretty worried that james jebbia and co will not like his work “you know their philosophy in general is like move along nothing to see here just some stuff on a tshirt if you like it you can buy it that’s it” he said “i just feel like they might regard it as like an invasion in some way” but supreme’s management is aware of the book shapiro told me “i have emailed with the founder    i told him like the broad contours of the book and he emailed me back about something unrelated and made no mention”most popularryan lizzaanthony scaramucci called me to unload about white house leakers reince priebus and steve bannonby ryan lizzadaily commentwhy anthony scaramucci’s attack on
