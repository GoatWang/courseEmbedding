retained including poet david murray henry prince of wales by marcus gheeraerts the younger c  training and personalityedit the king greatly preferred the role of schoolmaster to that of father and he wrote texts for the schooling of his children james directed that henrys household should rather imitate a college than a court or as sir thomas chaloner wrote in  his highnesss household  was intended by the king for a courtly college or a collegiate court he passionately engaged in such physical pursuits as hawking hunting jousting and fencing and from a young age studied naval and military affairs and national issues about which he often disagreed with his father he also disapproved of the way his father conducted the royal court disliked robert carr a favourite of his father and esteemed sir walter raleigh wishing him to be released from the tower of london the princes popularity rose so high that it threatened his father relations between the two could be tense and on occasion surfaced in public at one point the two were hunting near royston when james criticised his son for lacking enthusiasm for the chase and henry initially moved to strike his father with a cane but rode off most of the hunting party then followed the son upright to the point of priggishness he fined all who swore in his presence according to charles carlton a biographer of charles i who describes henry as an obdurate protestant in addition to the alms box to which henry forced swearers to contribute he made sure his household attended church services his religious views were influenced by the clerics in his household who came largely from a tradition of politicised calvinism henry listened humbly attentively and regularly to the sermons preached to his household and once told his chaplain richard milbourne that he esteemed most the preachers whose attitude suggested sir you must hear me diligently you must have a care to observe what i say henry is said to have disliked his younger brother charles and to have teased him although this derives from only one anecdote when charles was nine years of age henry snatched the hat off a bishop and put it on the younger childs head then told his younger brother that when he became king he would make charles archbishop of canterbury and then charles would have a long robe to hide his ugly rickety legs charles stamped on the cap and had to be dragged off in tears investiture and leadershipedit henry frederick c  by robert peake the elder with his fathers accession to the throne of england in  henry at once became duke of cornwall in  he was further invested as prince of wales and earl of chester thus for the first time uniting the six automatic and two traditional scottish and english titles held by heirsapparent to the two thrones as a young man henry showed great promise and was beginning to be active in leadership matters among his activities he was responsible for the reassignment of sir thomas dale to the virginia company of londons struggling colony in north america the irish gaelic lord of inishowen sir cahir odoherty had applied to gain a position as a courtier in the household of henry to help him in his struggles against officials in ireland unknown to sir cahir on  april  the day he launched odohertys rebellion by burning derry his application was approved henry took an interest in the kingdom of ireland and was known to be supportive of the idea of a reconciliation with the former rebel hugh oneill earl of tyrone who had fled into exile during the flight of the earls because of this tyrone and his entourage mourned when the prince met his early death deathedit for more details on this topic see charles i of england henry died from typhoid fever at the age of  the diagnosis can be made with reasonable certainty from written records of the postmortem examination although at the time there were rumours of poisoning he was buried in westminster abbey prince henrys death was widely regarded as a tragedy for the nation according to charles carlton few heirs to the english throne have been as widely and deeply mourned as prince henry his body lay in state at st jamess palace for four weeks on  december over a thousand people walked in the milelong cortege to westminster abbey to hear a twohour sermon delivered by george abbot the archbishop of

wrote texts for the schooling of his children james directed that henrys household should rather imitate a college than a court or as sir thomas chaloner wrote in  his highnesss household  was intended by the king for a courtly college or a collegiate court he passionately engaged in such physical pursuits as hawking hunting jousting and fencing and from a young age studied naval and military affairs and national issues about which he often disagreed with his father he also disapproved of the way his father conducted the royal court disliked robert carr a favourite of his father and esteemed sir walter raleigh wishing him to be released from the tower of london the princes popularity rose so high that it threatened his father relations between the two could be tense and on occasion surfaced in public at one point the two were hunting near royston when james criticised his son for lacking enthusiasm for the chase and henry initially moved to strike his father with a cane but rode off most of the hunting party then followed the son upright to the point of priggishness he fined all who swore in his presence according to charles carlton a biographer of charles i who describes henry as an obdurate protestant in addition to the alms box to which henry forced swearers to contribute he made sure his household attended church services his religious views were influenced by the clerics in his household who came largely from a tradition of politicised calvinism henry listened humbly attentively and regularly to the sermons preached to his household and once told his chaplain richard milbourne that he esteemed most the preachers whose attitude suggested sir you must hear me diligently you must have a care to observe what i say henry is said to have disliked his younger brother charles and to have teased him although this derives from only one anecdote when charles was nine years of age henry snatched the hat off a bishop and put it on the younger childs head then told his younger brother that when he became king he would make charles archbishop of canterbury and then charles would have a long robe to hide his ugly rickety legs charles stamped on the cap and had to be dragged off in tears investiture and leadershipedit henry frederick c  by robert peake the elder with his fathers accession to the throne of england in  henry at once

thomas dale to the virginia company of londons struggling colony in north america the irish gaelic lord of inishowen sir cahir odoherty had applied to gain a position as a courtier in the household of henry to help him in his struggles against officials in ireland unknown to sir cahir on  april  the day he launched odohertys rebellion by burning derry his application was approved henry took an

 the diagnosis can be made with reasonable certainty from written records of the postmortem examination although at the time there were rumours of poisoning he was buried in westminster abbey prince

at st jamess palace for four weeks on  december over a thousand people walked in the milelong cortege to westminster abbey to hear a twohour sermon delivered by george abbot the archbishop of canterbury as henrys body was lowered into the ground his chief servants broke their staves of office at the grave an insane man ran naked through the mourners yelling that he was the boys ghost immediately after henrys death the princes brother charles fell ill but he was the chief mourner at the funeral which his father king james who detested funerals refused to attend all of henrys

pleased to live an age in it  vertue and valor beauty and chastity armes and arts met and kist in him and his goodnesse lent so much mintage to other princes that if xenophon were now to describe a
