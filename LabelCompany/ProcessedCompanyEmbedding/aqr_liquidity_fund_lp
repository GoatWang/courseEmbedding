allocating smaller amounts of capital to assets that are risky and larger amounts to assets that are less risky in building the portfolio we seek assets that we believe are liquid and provide either a positive expected return or some portfolio diversification benefit over the long term we target balanced risk allocation across the four asset classes but we have the ability to exploit tactical opportunities by making modest adjustments or “tilts” toward assets that we believe are relatively attractive and away from ones we believe are less attractive we believe that by spreading risks in a more balanced manner and adapting to market conditions the fund can generate more stable returns over time than traditional approaches aqr risk parity fund foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty the use of derivatives forward and futures contracts and commodities exposes the fund to additional risks including increased volatility lack of

price of a security increases after the fund borrows the security the fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential fund gains and increase potential fund losses when investing in bonds yield and share price will vary with changes in interest rates and market

 as of    investment approach risk parity is all about diversification whereas traditional portfolios focus on dollarbased allocation risk parity portfolios focus on riskbased allocation aqrs risk parity fund invests globally across stocks bonds currencies and commodities allocating smaller amounts of capital to assets that are risky and larger amounts to assets that are less risky in building the portfolio we seek assets that we believe are liquid and provide either a positive expected return or some portfolio diversification benefit over the long term we target balanced risk allocation across the four asset classes but we have the ability to exploit tactical opportunities by making modest adjustments or “tilts” toward assets that we believe are relatively attractive and away from ones we believe are less attractive we believe that by spreading risks in a more balanced manner and adapting to market conditions the fund can generate more stable returns over time than traditional

asset classes but we have the ability to exploit tactical opportunities by making modest adjustments or “tilts” toward assets that we believe are relatively attractive and away from ones we believe
