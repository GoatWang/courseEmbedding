parttime professor of mass spectrometry at the university of amsterdam dr laukien holds a bs degree from the massachusetts institute of technology as well as a phd in chemical physics from harvard university in november  dr laukien was elected an officer and chairmanelect of alssa analytical  life science systems association the worldwide industry association frost  sullivan bruker daltonics is one of the most well known providers of isolation identification and characterization solutions in the life sciences market today from the vantage this provides what do you see as the hottest growth markets in the biological sciences dr laukien yes we do have a very strong reputation for highend products this reputation is something we have worked hard to build up over decades bruker has been and continues to be a strong brand name one of our most important assets with the postgenomic revolution in lifesciences research taking place we continue to concentrate on providing enabling lifescience tools based on mass spectrometry  a fast growing market our clients indicate that mass spectrometry has emerged as a crucial bioanalytical technique downstream of genomics we believe it is important to provide a broad array of lifescience mass spectrometry and technologies building on our mass spectrometry core competency and not limit ourselves to being a one or two product company consequently we concentrate on a portfolio of products and solutions for a number of hot growth markets within the life sciences especially academia government biotech and big pharma within the drug discovery market genomics proteomics and combinatorial chemistry are all of importance within the drug development market pharmacogenomics is becoming more and more significant we are starting to hear a lot about metabolomics we also feel that shotgun proteomics has an important future and we are addressing that market with our ftms product line demand and funding for our cuttingedge products continues to grow worldwide as lifescience research funding is shifting from gene sequencing dnarna expression arrays and highthroughput screening towards genetic variation expression proteomics functional and structural proteomics as well as metabolomics this is a logical progression in the postgenomic era leading to a new emphasis on high information content data quality and biological knowledge gain rather than just throughput we expect that these funding trends in drug discovery and lifescience research will continue to benefit our growth well into the future frost  sullivan the bruker daltonicsbiacore international collaboration announced in october of  has now been in effect for almost six months has this powerful integration of functional analysis spr and characterization ms been validated when can the research community expect to see this system on the market dr laukien our rd collaboration with biacore announced last october has already resulted in the introduction of a technical solution for surface plasmon resonance or spr coupled with mass spectrometry our joint sprms solution adds the unique functional information obtained using biacore’s spr technology to proteomics databases allowing users to correlate functional information with the identification and characterization data obtained from mass spectrometry the combined semiautomatic sprms technical solution is being comarketed by biacore and bruker daltonics and consists of a biacore  spr system a map ii maldi sample prep robot for anchorchip preparation and an autoflex malditof mass spectrometer the functional spr data on proteinprotein or proteinligand interactions as well as our ms data on protein identification and characterization are integrated using our proteinscape data warehousing and analysis bioinformatics software package we would not want to preannounce our early customer installations but these are expected to take place rather soon we do expect to gain significant competitive advantage from this sprms synergy as does biacore more importantly this sprms synergy will provide a lot of value to the research community helping to bring new drugs to market faster for example as you know biacore is the spr leader with more than  systems for biomolecular interaction analysis installed since bruker daltonics has over  of our own systems installed we expect to see a high level of sprms activity in our installed base as does biacore with its large installed base frost  sullivan the growing understanding of biological systems on a genetic level is undoubtedly changing both the methods and efficiencies of drug discovery it seems studies are increasingly done on computer using biological simulations or protein interaction models bruker daltonics in fact recently announced significant additions to the bioinformatics software line proteinscape biotools  and hystar  is the laboratory moving onto the desktop dr laukien we are certainly placing great emphasis on software development we expect proteinscape to be our flagship software product for this decade proteinscape provides a webbased clientserver platform for storing organizing and analyzing data generated in the entire workflow of our proteineer proteomics solution it operates with industry standard relational database systems like oracle  and ms sql serverdesktop simulations can be useful but we are going to continue to focus on mass spectrometers and associated solutions which generate archive and analyze massive amounts of real scientific data often well into the high terabyte range frost  sullivan how does bruker daltonics approach product development is there a set philosophy as to which product areas will be focused upon or in how product areas will be chosen dr laukien we focus on developing new platforms enhancing existing products and building new applications for the life sciences we leverage our existing large intellectual property portfolio in addition to enhancing our ip portolio with new patents we have been investing well over  of our revenues in product development helping to keep our product line fresh most of our sales come from cuttingedge products we have developed in the last few years we recognize this rapid cause and effect relationship so we will continue to grow our rd investment on an absolute basis however our rd as a percentage of our fastgrowing revenues will be dropping off to the midteens as a result of these development efforts we just announced six new products at pittcon in addition to the three major software enhancements you just mentioned these are very significant new systems solutions and bioinformatics tools for expression proteomics interaction proteomics and for functional genomics these novel and rather unique products will be very useful for our pharmaceuticalbiotech and academic research customers frost  sullivan the international scope of bruker daltonics’ sales effort provides you with a perspective broader than that witnessed by many uscentric business models which of these geographic markets do you view as primary growth opportunities for bruker daltonics and which international do you believe will meet this description five years from now dr laukien with our worldwide expansion we now have offices in  countries we have built up some very competitive global distribution capabilities europe is a particularly strong marketplace for us with over half of our revenues coming from there japan where we have three offices is a strong market and we expect that to remain strong frost  sullivan what is your view on mergers and acquisitions how has bruker daltonics leveraged their acquisitions  partnerships to their own advantage dr laukien rather than ma we have focused more on strategic partnerships and collaborations with key firms like agilent technologies sequenom biacore geneprot affinium pharmaceuticals and roche for example these collaborations have been highly successful for us and we expect to pursue more alliances like these regarding ma we could be interested in making some acquisitions provided that the firms have products proven in the marketplace and fit well with both our existing and planned integrated products and solutions firms that provide value to scientists at the front end such as liquid handling equipment or at the back end such as bioinformatics could well be of interest frost  sullivan any thoughts on your winning the frost  sullivan’s product line strategy award for the biotech instrumentation market dr laukienwe were particularly pleased to receive this award we have a lot of top people here at bruker daltonics working on product strategy and implementation many of them phds in the life sciences they’re the ones who’ve earned this award for bruker daltonics frost  sullivan what does the future hold for bruker daltonics dr laukienwe expect to enhance our number one or number two market position in the key mass spectrometry platforms for life sciences further expanding our share in this fast growing market and providing more and more value to research scientists worldwide on an accelerating basis back

financial results in may we will begin todays call with frank providing a business summary tony will then cover our financials for the fourth quarter and full year  in more detail now id like to turn the call over to brukers ceo frank laukien frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks joshua good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today i am pleased to report that bruker reported strong financial performance in the fourth quarter and significant improvement in our full year  results the higher profitability and free cash flow generation are clear evidence that the hard work over the past three years to transform bruker into a stronger and more profitable company is delivering results our full year  results reflect increasing organic revenue growth and we surpassed our guidance for operating margin expansion and eps i know that these performance improvements came while we were dealing with continued softness in some of our industrial markets and a strong currency headwind to nongaap eps i will now begin my presentation on slide four where i will discuss our q  results briefly before focusing on our full year  results which are more indicative of the underlying trends in our business we reported revenues of  million in q  with yearoveryear organic revenue growth of plus  this growth was driven primarily by our calid group and our best segment geographically europe and the americas were the primary drivers of organic growth in the fourth quarter our q  nongaap operating margin increased by  basis points yearoveryear versus q  we reported nongaap eps of  in q  which represented yearoveryear growth of plus  despite still facing a yearoveryear currency headwind but aided in part by a favorable tax rate in the fourth quarter of  finally our free cash flow of  million was very healthy following a strong q  and accentuated by strong customer collection on slide five i show brukers performance for the full year  in  we reported a revenue decline of minus  this decline was primarily driven by currency effects and also by a minus  net decline from our portfolio as a result of our  cam divestitures offset by a partial quarter from our recent jordan valley semiconductor acquisition we reported yearoveryear organic revenue growth of plus  in  which was better than our guidance for plus  organic revenue growth and represented a gradual acceleration of growth after an organic revenue decline in  geographically europe had a strong year delivering organic revenue growth in the highsingle digits for  the americas grew in the lowsingle digits organically while asia pacific declined in the highsingle digits primarily due to weakness in japan and southeast asia our nongaap operating margin for  expanded by about  basis points to  compared to  in  this improvement was well above our guidance for plus  basis points or more operating margin expansion in  due to our stronger profitability in the fourth quarter of  our nongaap eps for  were  a  increase compared to  in  currency headwinds lowered eps by minus  but this was somewhat offset by a discrete tax benefit in  that lowered our full year nongaap tax rate finally our free cash flow hit a record level of  million in  more than doubling yearoveryear primarily as a result of our strong performance in the second half of the year our  free cash flow performance also benefited from higher customer advances and reductions in our working capital while our focus on working capital reduction will continue to be a priority we likely will not reach the same level of free cash flow in  the recovery of our nmr business in the second half of  combined with strong operating leverage on a reduced cost base helped us to deliver much better than expected operating profit eps and cash flow in  i am also every pleased that our return on invested capital or roic in  reached a level of greater than  in summary we are very pleased that our results in  were much improved compared to prior years and we have clearly turned the corner with our transformation we now expect several years of gradually increasing organic revenue growth and further margin expansion ahead of us please turn to slides six and seven now where ill provide additional details about the yearoveryear performance of our three groups and of our best segment for the full year  let me begin with our biospin group which reported revenues of  million in  representing a minus  organic revenue decline this decline was the result of weakness in our preclinical imaging division combined with a slow start to the year for our magnetic resonance spectroscopy or mrs division our mrs division reported flat revenues for the full year but generated good organic revenue growth in the second half of  this second half strength was offset by our preclinical imaging business which posted declines in both revenues and new order bookings in  our nmr business experienced a lowteens increase in new order bookings in  representing a nice recovery after a significant bookings decline in nmr in  the effects of volume growth and price increases both contributed to the growth in new order bookings in the fourth quarter of  we already saw some positive effects of higher price backlog flow through to our biospin group margin at this time bruker biospin has substantially completed the transfer of ultrahigh field nmr magnet manufacturing from our rheinstetten plant in germany which is being closed to our remaining two magnet factories in france and switzerland next i will turn to our calid group which reported total revenues of  million and  organic revenue growth in  along with a major improvement in profitability in part due to our  cam divestitures and restructuring our detection division had an exceptionally strong year  with a number of large transactions including the explosives trace detection installations at various european airports in  our daltonics division had a good year of revenue growth in  for nearly all product lines our maldi biotyper continues to be one of our fastest growing product lines reaching close to  million in revenue in  with approximately  yearoveryear currency adjusted revenue growth after a strong year in  our optics division faced weakness in some of its markets which pressured its top line in  that said the optics division controlled expenses and sustained its above corporate average level of profitability please turn to slide seven now the nano group reported revenues of  million which represented organic revenue growth of approximately  nano had a mixed year of top line performance as strength in its academic customer segment was offset by continued weakness from industrial and semiconductor and data storage customers our axs division had a solid year delivering highsingle digit organic revenue growth in  with particular strength in our xray diffraction product we reported a decline in both revenue and profitability for our nano surfaces division in  the division has seen weaker demand from its industrial customers particularly in regions of asia outside of china and japan and despite the weak market the division is doing a good job of managing costs and expenses finally within our nano group our smaller nano analytics division posted lowteens organic revenue growth in  driven primarily by the micro xray fluorescence business our best segment reported revenues of  million and plus  organic revenue growth yearoveryear in  best also increased its nongaap operating margin by  basis points to  in q of  best substantially completed two multiyear programs rosatom and desy best also achieved strong bookings and backlog increases in  with large longterm superconducting wire orders id like to wrap up my presentation on slide eight where i show brukers key priorities for  the year  will mark brukers transition from a threeyear period of transformation including divestitures and restructuring to our next more evolutionary phase of operational excellence and lean initiatives over the past three years bruker has spent more than  million on restructuring charges as we changed our portfolio lowered our fixed cost and began to streamline our supply chain we are certainly not done with driving higher levels of operating profitability and cash flow but future improvements will come more from business and product innovation being close to our customers as well as our lean enterprise initiative outsourcing implementing better business systems and driving better commercial practices our second priority will be to continue to strengthen our systems and management insights by harmonizing business processes and erp platforms in  we went live with a new financial consolidation system and in early january of  we successfully merged our various instances of sap an important step as we consolidate our erp onto one global platform throughout  and  an important goal will be harmonize our business processes embed them in our erp and begin to roll them out in our country sales offices and production sites third it is important that we continue to invest for future profitable growth in order to sustain attractive operating leverage we expect to gradually accelerate our organic growth were continuing to make investments in our four strategic growth markets and we continue to invest a high percentage of our revenues into rd my fourth priority is to reemphasize the focus on customers and the importance of driving product and business innovation this is the lifeblood of our business and staying close to our customers and ensuring that were not inwardly focused is a key priority i will conclude my comments by stating that i am very pleased with our financial performance improvements in q and for the full year  with that let me turn the call over to tony mattacchione anthony l mattacchione  interim cfo senior vice president of finance  accounting thank you frank i will now provide some additional details on our financial performance in q  and in the full year  starting on slide  bruker had an excellent fourth quarter financially which built on the positive momentum from q  to reiterate franks comments in q  we expanded our operating margins by  basis points on organic revenue growth of  we delivered an eps increase of  yearoveryear and we generated  million of free cash flow on a full year  basis revenue grew  organically yearoveryear and we delivered  basis points of operating margin expansion  of nongaap eps growth and  million of free cash flow generation we are very pleased with our financial success in both the fourth quarter and in  now let me drill into more detail on our q performance our nongaap operating income grew  to  million and we reported a nongaap operating margin of  this operating income growth along with a favorable tax rate drove a  nongaap eps increase yearoveryear in the fourth quarter free cash flow generation of  million in q reflected a  million yearoveryear improvement primarily driven by our higher profitability but also from working capital improvements we typically generate most of our free cash flow in the fourth quarter and that trend also continued this year in  our balance sheet continues to be healthy as our net cash position increased by  to  million even as we initiated two share buyback programs in  our working capital reductions in the quarter resulted in an improved working capital to revenue ratio which was lowered to  per revenue dollar in q  compared with  in q  turning to slide  i show you the yearoveryear revenue bridge for q  despite a  basis point net negative portfolio effect and a  negative effect from changes in foreign currency translation organic revenue grew  in the fourth quarter of  the strengthening of the us dollar resulted in a  million currency headwind while the negative portfolio effect was the result of our cam divestitures in  and a partial quarter of revenue from our jordan valley acquisition in the middle of q  on slide  i show our q  profit and loss statement our q  nongaap gross margin of  increased  basis points yearoveryear the benefits of our cam restructuring added  basis points to our gross margin in q this year roughly  basis points of the gross margin improvement was primarily the result of the higher business volume improved order execution pricing and operational improvements related to our transformation initiative our q  operating expenses were down approximately  million yearoveryear in q  lower rd and sga spending resulted in a  basis point yearoveryear contribution to our operating profit margin the net result is that our nongaap operating margin improved  basis points compared to a relatively weak q  quarter our q  nongaap tax rate of  was  basis points lower than in q of  this was primarily the result of reversing certain us evaluation allowances this is primarily also attributable to the higher profits earned in the us which were caused by divestiture of our unprofitable cam businesses and other tax planning effects this year finally nongaap eps of  represented an  or  increase from q  on slide  youll see the revenue bridge for the full year of  we reported an organic yearoveryear revenue increase of  in  changes in foreign currency translation lowered our revenues by  or  million in  on slide  i show our nongaap pl for the full year of  our nongaap gross margins improved by  basis points compared to last year approximately half of the gross margin improvement was related to the higher business volume improvements in commercial practices and the operational initiatives associated with our transformation the savings from our cam restructuring contributed  basis points to the gross margin improvement in  our fiscal  operating expenses declined by  million compared to last year approximately  million of the decrease excuse me was related to fx while the cam restructuring represented  million of the yearoveryear decrease in the fiscal  operating expenses our nongaap operating margin increased by about  basis points yearoveryear in  with cam representing a little over  basis points of that increase and roughly  basis points coming from fx and operating leverage weve incorporated into our business model our nongaap tax rate of  was  basis points lower than last year and below the  to  we had assumed in our guidance the primary driver of this lower rate was the reversal of the us valuation allowances i referred to previously on the bottom line in  we reported  of earnings per share – nongaap earnings per share which was  or  higher than  and well above our most recent guidance of  to  changes in foreign translation rates – foreign currency translation rates reduced our eps by  whereas the absence of the divested cam businesses increased eps also by  on slide  i show our  full year cash flow statement we generated very strong free cash flow of  million in  compared with  million last year that was a  million improvement yearoveryear that increase was the result of the higher earnings and lower working capital cost predominantly by cash collection timing for large nmr installations and significantly higher customer advances we experienced in  customer advances which represent customer down payments can be large and can fluctuate significantly depending on the timing of order receipt and the customers acceptance of our systems our q  cash conversion cycle shortened by  days compared to q  this was comprised of the following our days of inventory decreased by seven days to  days our days sales outstanding decreased by two days to  days and our days payable outstanding increased two days to  days all compared to q  during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased  million shares in accordance with our share buyback program in  altogether we repurchased approximately  million of our shares most repurchases occurred in november and december last year so the effect on our  weighted average share count is not yet very significant as of the end of  we had  million of remaining authorization to buy back shares as part of the  million share buyback program we announced last november now turning to slide  i show brukers guidance for the full year of  we expect to generate organic revenue growth of approximately  and we expect to increase our nongaap operating profit margin by approximately  basis points we expect that our nongaap eps will be in a range of  to  we also expect that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will lower our reported revenues by  which will only have a nominal effect on our nongaap eps in fiscal  the revenue headwind from fx will be approximately offset by the benefits of our recent jordan valley semiconductor acquisition this means that organic and reported revenue growth will be around  also in fiscal  our currency assumptions included a yen to us dollar rate of  a us dollar to euro rate of € and a swiss franc to us dollar of chf  which were the spot rates at december   we assume a nongaap tax rate range of  to  for the full year of  and we are assuming a fully diluted share count of approximately  million to  million shares we expect capex to total approximately  million for the full year of  i would remind investors that much like  we expect the majority of our profitability and cash flow to be generated in the second half of  we also expect to have a seasonally weak first quarter and do not anticipate much yearoveryear growth in operating profitability or eps in q  i will close by stating that were very proud to report strong improvements in q and for the full year of  we are doing a very more effective job of delivering on our commitments to shareholders and we expect  to be another good year for operating margin expansion and free cash flow generation with that id like to turn the call back over to joshua to start the qa session joshua s young  vice presidentinvestor relations amy if could you please assemble the qa roster questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from brandon couillard at jefferies and i may have mispronounced the name i am sorry brandon couillard  jefferies llc thanks good afternoon frank and tony could you give us a sense of what youve embedded in terms of the organic growth guidance for the year by division any color you can give us sort of between biospin and the other units anthony l mattacchione  interim cfo senior vice president of finance  accounting we dont usually give that granularity obviously at the end of the year to help everybody with their models we give sort of the full year revenue for each of the three groups but i dont think were going into the granularity of providing growth rates for each of the group or divisions frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer as we mentioned in our prepared comments we will see strength in our nmr products the second half of the year was strong from a revenue and an order perspective but that will be offset of course by continued prolonged weakness in our industrial markets and some of the semi and data storage businesses as well so that color gives some thoughts on the revenue guidance brandon couillard  jefferies llc super and then one more tony in terms of the  basis points of operating margin improvement in  could you help us bridge that sort of between opex and gross margin in terms of contributors and just to make sure i understand your comments correctly did you indicate that free cash flow would actually be down yearoveryear versus  anthony l mattacchione  interim cfo senior vice president of finance  accounting yeah so most of the operating profit expansion will come from gross profit margin with a  around market revenue growth rate we believe that leveraging our production costs and benefiting from the initiatives that weve put in place in the last few years as well as some pricing effects will generate most of the operating profit margin expansion in gross profit margin with regard to the free cash flow the implication was yes that we dont expect  to be the same in terms of free cash flow generation level and thats really because of we had a very large amount of customer deposits this year that are very typical with the nature of our long lead time products particularly in the nmr and we cant count on that repeating yearoveryear so yes that would be the way to look at the cash flow operator the next question is from steve willoughby at cleveland research steve b willoughby  cleveland research co llc hi good evening and kind of a twopart question for you i guess first and i apologize if you did say it but in  what was the impact from fx on your gross and operating margins and then i have a followup anthony l mattacchione  interim cfo senior vice president of finance  accounting so eps will be impacted about  for the full year yearoveryear frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer on fx i think weve stated that its minus  from fx and minus  from portfolio if i recall steve b willoughby  cleveland research co llc okay i was just trying to see if the  basis points you guys expanded operating margins what the impact from fx was within that number because i am just trying to figure out here when i move into  i see the positive momentum in your nmr business youre just now starting to benefit from the biospin restructurings i presume that fx is less of a headwind in  – like you said less of a headwind in  than  and so i am trying to see why operating margins expansion wont be more than the  basis points youre guiding to anthony l mattacchione  interim cfo senior vice president of finance  accounting well its off a much higher level obviously we came in at  bps improvement or  bps improvement in  so we benefited from some of the biospin restructuring already in q and also some of the pricing actually we did expect to – did start to flow through in q of  so i think if you look at it over two years i think it makes a lot of sense probably but we really were able to accelerate some of these things already into  and q  and i think that – i think if you take a twoyear view i think it actually will probably match your model pretty closely steve b willoughby  cleveland research co llc okay thanks very much operator the next question is from dane leone at btig dane leone  btig llc hi thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on a very strong finish in  frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you dane leone  btig llc yeah i know thats great you gave a little bit of color on how we should think about the pacing of the year as it relates to the first quarter generally speaking its always helpful especially given the large order nature of your business should we be kind of thinking about that midteens if we think about the eps pacing as a percentage of the total year for  kind of that midteens for the first quarter and then kind of   and roughly  for the fourth quarter again or are we thinking a little bit weaker on the first quarter versus the pacing at  frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer so dan the trend will be very similar to what we saw in  meaning that if you look at the operating income generated in the back half of the year itll be almost identical – at least thats what our plan is – from what we saw this year in  dane leone  btig llc okay all right so its pretty much the same pacing is what weve seen in anthony l mattacchione  interim cfo senior vice president of finance  accounting yeah dane leone  btig llc is there anything that we should kind of call out there was just a question on kind of the segments but is there anything that you see in the pipe right now that you call out as kind of a big quarter you expect in kind of any specific quarter next year that we should contemplate in our modeling frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer no there really isnt anything this is frank there really isnt anything major and none of the  gigahertz systems will go into  that may be late  or  there is no rosatom pilot line and things that you may be kept track of in the past thats done some of the big contracts at best are done so really nothing discreet that will likely really stick out and i would add a little bit to the previous comments that our q  good results people really were working very very hard to make that happen and so they probably pulled in a little bit from q  so q  probably will be a relatively weak start to the year and not much of an improvement but were very comfortable with the full year guidance which of course implies an acceleration in q and in the second half of the year i think thats sort of maybe a useful prospective anthony l mattacchione  interim cfo senior vice president of finance  accounting and i would just add quickly that in the second half some of the growth comes – a lot of the growth comes from new products so thats a big part of the growth story in the second half of the year operator the next question is from derik de bruin at bank of america merrill lynch frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer derik are you offline derik de bruin  bank of america merrill lynch can you hear me frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer okay carry on derik de bruin  bank of america merrill lynch okay great thank you so a couple of questions so on the nmr business nice pickup in orders there can you give us some sense on just the mix of those orders whether these are like bruker replacements or people upgrading system people that are new to nmr and one that you think that are like agilent upgrades im just sort of curious on the mix frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer derik this is frank yeah i mean all of these things do play a role dont really have any quantitative insight for you but i mean of course we picked up some business from agilent some of it may have gone to our competitor weve had the price increases that we needed to deliver adequate margins in this business that we implemented a year ago and then we thought would come out in   about twothirds of our backlog in nmr probably will be delivered in  and another third goes all the way into  turns out we picked up a little bit of that pricing benefit already in q of  of course there are some new customers people that go into clinical metabolomics research eventually into laboratory developed tests by ivdbynmr and people that use the food screeners honey screeners wine screeners those are entirely new customers and quite honestly its nice that they can use an nmr even though theyre not at all nmr experts so some of these new applied market areas are also contributing to the growth of nmr so the answer is sort of all of the above that you mentioned have contributed to the order growth in  dane leone  btig llc great thats helpful and the multibiocipher had a nice  growth in  how should we think about that in  i believe you have some new modules coming online and should we think about that as still sort of maintaining a sort of doubledigit growth rate for next year or for this year frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer so maybe just to comment on  briefly derek the  was including consumables and service so the systems business is therefore not growing at  quite anymore as you might expect now that its a much larger basis its growth rate for systems business is now in the highsingle digits but the business overall including service and consumables and database upgrades grew at about  roughly its the same for bookings and revenue actually until the high value resistance assays and maybe even susceptibility assays of the more distant future until they play a significant role in maybe a second scurve that will be   so i think in  well be continuing to grow the multibiocipher for identification in clinical applications of course also in some pharma and food and nonclinical applications so given that its a larger business you might expect a growth rate that gradually slows down and probably ends up being in the highsingle digits for  and any reacceleration of that probably is more of a   story then operator the next question comes from tim evans of wells fargo securities tim c evans  wells fargo securities llc thank you within your  revenue growth guidance for  can you talk about what youre embedding in there for price frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer we are not disclosing that tim if you look at prices primarily around nmr weve said that it was one of several drivers for q and no question its an important driver for us as we get into  and ill also point out that some of the pricing increases weve taken already in the backlog will hit not just this year but also  so really spread between this quarter and into probably the first half of  as well tim c evans  wells fargo securities llc okay let me just try a followon to that then across your portfolio not just biospin but your entire business what percentage of your portfolio do you feel like you have room to push a little bit on price frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer well i think were trying to be pretty price disciplined everywhere and so in nmr there was a onetime discrete step i mean there are other areas where we have incremental price increases annually simply as a matter of commercial habit now and of course i think the biggest driver on the pricing side tends to be when you bring out entirely new system or major new capabilities and for instance we had some very significant new capabilities in some of the products that were introduced last year by our bruker daltonics division relatively late in the year which is why it didnt help with bookings or revenue anymore we introduced some pretty exciting products for our preclinical imaging division at the wmic conference in september of last year so as you provide entirely new capabilities like petmr or very very fast maldi imaging systems thats when you obviously can do some value pricing rather than increasing prices significantly at least on the existing products but on existing products and services we tend to have sort of annual at least inflation adjustments i think maybe that gives you the various levers that we have dane leone  btig llc thank you frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from ross muken at evercore isi luke sergott  international strategy  investment group llc hey guys this is luke in for ross i guess just to start off can you just give us a little more color on the apac region and what youre seeing there among your various customer classes and call out any particular areas of strength or weakness and if youre starting to see a turnaround in those weak areas frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer apac is really many different stories the japan relatively weak last year in terms of revenue was quite weak in terms of bookings it was a little better and dont really see any particular pickup in japan this year currency isnt doing us any favors china on the other hand has been relatively healthy with academic and research markets being healthier than industrial markets in china as you would probably expect and some of the rest of apac korea southeast asia taiwan theyve been clearly pockets of weakness and i guess some of these countries depend on exports to china and are becoming a little more cautious so anything youd like to add joshua on joshua s young  vice presidentinvestor relations no i think the key message is that in china for bookings for  we saw bookings expand in the midtohigh single digits so as we think about china for  if that bookings trend continues were incrementally more positive versus what we saw in  for revenue luke sergott  international strategy  investment group llc thats great thanks and i guess to follow up with that you guys talked about your four strategic areas of growth that youre investing in i guess if you can give us a little more top level thinking about like why you think that now is the best time to invest for this growth and what kind of additional investments should we be looking at for in  frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer well weve been investing in this growth all along in our transformation our transformation was never just a cost cutting exercise but of course cutting out cost and getting to a reduced footprint and changing the portfolio and all of that did take place but there was also already a significant reinvestment in some of these new product and market opportunities and that will simply continue there is no discontinuous additional investment in  the reinvestment trends over the last three years are simply continuing and everything that youve heard is in the guidance and in our budget and business plan so its nothing brand new there in terms of investments but its been an reinvestment story all along and that continues operator the next question comes from steve beuchaw at morgan stanley steve c beuchaw  morgan stanley  co llc hi good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions just a really simple question on nmr after a year of very strong order trend some price some volume – there are number of drivers behind it right academic is a little bit better europe is a little bit better and you have the opportunity to gain share how did you see over the course of the year that funnel evolving now as you come out of the year and come into  how do you think  sets up in terms of the potential to maintain a doubledigit order growth pace frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer i mean i dont think the longterm growth rate in nmr is not doubledigit so it will slow down for sure on the booking side because the  strong bookings of course had to do something with agilent leaving the business and with us raising prices but it also came right after a pretty significant doubledigit drop in  or call it a correction of whatever it was in  so some of that we made up for that at least in part so longerterm growth rates for nmr as ive said at some conferences maybe a couple of years ago or three years ago i might have still expected them to be in the lowsingle digits but given some of the new applied markets some of the new ultrahigh field trends into intrinsically disordered proteins and so on i am actually now more optimistic that longterm growth rates for the nmr market are in the midsingle digits but no doubledigit growth rates in orders are not sustainable steve c beuchaw  morgan stanley  co llc and then just thinking about the backlog progression would it be safe to say a pretty significant chunk of what we had in terms of the nmr backlog build in  will drive  revenues anthony l mattacchione  interim cfo senior vice president of finance  accounting we convert about  or twothirds of our backlog in any given year so about a third of the backlog well – revenue or – will revenue in  and twothirds in  frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer and thats clearly an nmr comment i think thats what also your question drove at its obviously different for other product lines steve c beuchaw  morgan stanley  co llc got it thanks so much frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer okay operator the next question is from doug schenkel at cowen  company chris lin  cowen  co llc hi this is chris lin on for doug today thanks for taking my question i think in the past the sustainability of margin expansion has been an issue but it does look like recent results and guidance demonstrates solid sustainability going forward could you just talk about some of the things that you give confidence in the sustainability of margin expansion over the next several years and then frank i believe you recently talked about your longer term margin expansion target could you just help us think about how dependent that target is on revenue growth versus realizing the benefits from all the restructuring initiatives you put in place over the past several years anthony l mattacchione  interim cfo senior vice president of finance  accounting yeah ill take the first part of that question so were very confident with the restructuring initiatives and the transformational initiatives we put in place over the last few years the focus on price and incremental volume at market growth rates that we can effectively with good operating leverage grow our gross profit margins and our operating profit margins by leveraging our production cost and distribution cost and not letting sga grow faster than the growth rate on the revenue line so we feel even at the market growth rate that were seeing that we can deliver strong operating profit margin expansion given the way weve landed on our operating model going forward and we feel like there is few years of runway in that regard as well frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer i agree so for  i mean a lot of what will drive  operating margin expansion were the actions we took in  and i think that simply summarizes what all the different points that tony has made of course to drive that into   and beyond well have to do more things in  but i think between all the actions that we have been taking and continue to take i really dont see any reason why we wouldnt have really quite a few years of continued margin expansion ahead of us operator the next question is from tycho peterson at jpmorgan tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc hey thanks maybe frank on that last point youve obviously done a lot of the restructuring at this point can you maybe talk as to how much of a focus and how much benefit you think you can get this year from supply chain maybe leaner manufacturing things that are beyond kind of the initial heavy lifting on the restructuring youve done frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah tycho we think obviously from the restructuring at biospin which is really just finished by the end of  that will have a big effect on  and of course there are some minor restructurings that are going on now really as an ongoing process and management process were probably not going to outline those or talk about these at the headline news level very much anymore because theyre not quite of the magnitude of a cam restructuring or the sizable bio restructuring last year so there is ongoing footprint consolidation and also lean initiatives and more outsourcing going on as part of our operational excellence base so we havent really quantified that externally of how much were going to drive that and quite honestly what were driving in  really will have more of an effect on  i think it will be fewer discreet items to track separately and it will just flow into this obviously ongoing goal of having  bps to  bps operating margin expansion hopefully its just about each year and this year  were signing up for the  bps from everything that weve implemented already and intend to do anthony l mattacchione  interim cfo senior vice president of finance  accounting just a short addition tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc and then anthony l mattacchione  interim cfo senior vice president of finance  accounting yeah sorry tycho just a short addition with the heavy lifting kind of behind us were really focused on the continuous process improvement and leaning out the production and the supply chain that clearly is a focus but what well also focus on is marrying that up with smart tax planning as well so as we advance on continuous process improvement in our supply chain and production processes which is a lot of opportunity well add to that smart tax planning which will give further benefits going out in terms of eps expansion tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc and then if we look at some of the businesses where you had headwinds preclinical imaging obviously continues to be a bit of a drag you talked about some of the new products that were introduced last fall and maybe can you just talk about how you think about potential recovery in that business and then similarly in nano services where things have been tough do you see any hope there frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer yes we see hope so good questions preclinical imaging in the biospin group with the products – first of all we really had it – it had –  it had record bookings and revenue so its a little bit even in the preclinical mri just its own little mini cycle so we expect a recovery there a modest recovery there and then the new product cycle with nmr and a new cryofree  tesla a new optical molecular imaging system and a very exciting new pet system those are all going to – none of those contributed to  anymore but we all expect good contributions from that new product cycle in pci in  especially in  beyond the mri cyclical recovery were expecting quite a bit of a drive from the new product cycle at bns its a little the academic setting actually they do a lot research systems they sell a lot of systems also into areas that are wellfunded by nih such as cell biology and neuroscience so those are all good growth drivers were actually somewhat hopeful that this year finally that this the year where semiconductor tools may become healthier and healthier as the year progresses we see that a little bit internally but then by simply looking at the larger pure plays in that space were encouraged whereas this maybe  of bruker that are really traditional nonsemiconductor industrial markets and that are somewhat concentrated in the nano group but of course they also exist elsewhere for those we expect relatively weak markets this year so bns is not only industrial its also semiconductor which we think will pick up and life sciences which we think will pick up including benefiting from a tailwind from nih funding and similar funding elsewhere in the world so its a much more positive mix picture than perhaps sometimes people assume and they think that bns is all industrial it luckily is not weve changed that portfolio quite deliberately over time operator next question is from bryan brokmeier at cantor fitzgerald bryan paul brokmeier  cantor fitzgerald securities hi thanks for taking the questions frank you just mentioned a little bit about new products and you talked earlier about it could you quantify the impacts in  that youre expecting from new products and how that compares to  frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer we dont quantify that for competitive reasons and theres too much granularity there but we expect a healthy benefit from the introductions of  and of course while we dont discuss what they are we expect some exciting product introductions again in  which then however typically end up being  drivers and i think the rate of meaningful innovation in products and in getting with new products or new applications into adjacent markets such as explosive trace detection and other examples i think continues to be very very healthy bryan paul brokmeier  cantor fitzgerald securities okay and you used  million to buy back shares during the quarter and you also acquired jordan valley how should we think about your cash use in  and what cash balance level are you comfortable maintaining anthony l mattacchione  interim cfo senior vice president of finance  accounting yeah in terms of capital allocation from a capex perspective there is no major need right now we have guidance of about  million and that allows for some maintenance spending erp and crm additional footprint consolidation if necessary so no major capex there ma we have a great technology portfolio so we dont need significant ma for that reason were very pleased with the collection of businesses that we have and weve done some portfolio trimming with cam so we like the three basis businesses we have so the ma would be focused more around bolton – to bolt through those great technology positions we have but nothing transformational would use capital and of course the share buyback program we have quite a bit left on the share buyback and given where the stock is trading at now well like buying it back at the lower levels that its at and if more uncertainty causes it to be lower then thats where well deploy capital operator the next question is from miroslava minkova at stifel miroslava minkova  stifel nicolaus  co inc hi good afternoon guys congratulations on the quarter frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks miroslava minkova  stifel nicolaus  co inc let me start maybe with the calid group it had very strong growth over the course of  i think it even might have strengthened in the back half of the year and there were some strong orders in detection there so i was wondering if you could give us a sense for what are you expecting for calid heading into  and what would be the drivers for this year frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah so clearly detection was a bit exceptional in  so we expect lower volume in detection in  bruker optics we think will be somewhat steady and i think the daltonics business were expecting healthy bookings increases this year probably nothing extraordinary but we expect that that business in terms of bookings will grow roughly with the markets and i think the mass spec markets are generally healthy markets so i mixed probably revenue and bookings a little bit here i apologize but did that address your questions or miroslava minkova  stifel nicolaus  co inc yes i was just trying to get a sense for – again it continued to grow and relatively it has been sort of above corporate average pace for the past several quarters or so anthony l mattacchione  interim cfo senior vice president of finance  accounting yeah were planning market base growth miroslava minkova  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay anthony l mattacchione  interim cfo senior vice president of finance  accounting and thats clearly what we see for  we are coming off of some softness out of q in orders are a little soft in q so thats part of the reason for the q miroslava minkova  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah so to be clear miroslava it grew  basis points above the corporate average in  we wont be able to sustain that obviously as we get into next year but its possible that daltonics could do slightly better than the  that we have the corporate average for the guidance for  miroslava minkova  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay got it and on the intrinsically disordered proteins and the new nmr tools when might we see some of the demand for the ultrahigh field begin to materialize and what would it take is it just all about raising funding or is there something that needs to come together in the marketplace for that frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer no its clearly about raising funding and a lot of institutions or consortia are trying to raise funding im sure theyll be very busy with that in   so its not going to contribute to revenue growth this year particularly strongly but i think people are really very motivated to get funding whether its upgrading existing systems or getting new ultrahigh field systems and the gigahertz class to be able to address these very important fundamental biology and disease biology opportunities that have opened up with the recognition how important these idps are but its mostly going to be a   story in terms of revenue and margins operator the next question is from isaac ro at goldman sachs isaac ro  goldman sachs  co hi good afternoon guys thank you question on pricing i know you guys talked about – or was it you didnt want to talk too much about  but i was curious if you could maybe recap for us just to give us a little bit of a baseline what pricing contribution was in  and then specifically in q given your earlier comments frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer yes so as we mentioned earlier were not going to break that out separately i think if you look at our portfolio clearly in id say parts of our portfolio were able to take price but in other parts particularly those in the industrial or semiconductor markets price is a lot more competitive right now due to the fall in volume so as you think how that flows through to the corporate pl most of what will flow through will be those nmr pricing increases in  and in  isaac ro  goldman sachs  co okay thanks and just a followup i think weve all been encouraged by the execution in the course of  played out and looking to get a little more comfort that that will continue this year i was hoping you could maybe give us a little bit of an update on specifically the cfo search kind of status there when we might get some clarity and then secondly internally some of the operational programs that you have in place that you need to really focus on to hit some of your guidance so whether thats it or back office systems anything thats really outstanding id be interested to know kind of what some of your operational milestones are thank you frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah so on the cfo search obviously we have an effective current finance team and an interim cfo and we havent missed a beat and the process of the cfo search is going well we hope to complete this and hopefully make an announcement before the end of the first quarter in terms of – i mentioned earlier – an important additional milestone namely the merge of the various sap instances that we had within the company in the first week or first business week of january the lights werent flickering and were still in business and that seems to have gone reasonably well and it provides the basis for now further process harmonization and business process harmonization across all of bruker of course embedded in the erp systems and then rolled out to the country offices and then factories over the next two years although this wont be finished in the next two years its really an even longer process from an investor or financial perspective its not going to matter that much its not that there is a big bolus of investment coming through were pretty much nicely spreading that out over the years so there isnt one of these cliff events or major boluses but yeah weve made a lot of progress in systems and we still have a lot of work ahead of us to really get this full field factory visibility and to get harmonized business processes it will keep us very busy but its sort of an ongoing process that to some extent you dont need to worry about that much weve got it mapped out for the next couple of years and its really a threeyear fouryear process and of course it never fully stops but were making good progress on that youll see an accelerating lean initiative we focus more on outsourcing and restructuring and well continue to do quite a bit on outsourcing in several divisions we have one or two more years of quite a bit of outsourcing ahead of us others are nearly finished with outsourcing and those that are nearly finished with outsourcing like for instance the bruker biospin group will be much more focused on lean layouts of their remaining operations primarily in manufacturing but really all the way to ga and rd and really with a broader lean enterprise perspective not only lean manufacturing hopefully that addressed most of what you were interested in operator the next question is from dan arias at citigroup daniel arias  citigroup global markets inc broker afternoon thanks for the questions frank to your last comments roughly speaking what percentage of the business is now fully under the umbrella of your erp system and maybe how should we think specifically about erp cost this year relative to  anthony l mattacchione  interim cfo senior vice president of finance  accounting yeah ill answer that dan its tony theres about  of our business is on the two major platforms that we have on sap and we just completed the merger of those two platforms so thats the basis for our erp template going forward so were really working on – now that we have a common platform were really working on harmonizing the underlying business processes and then embedding those in a template that that platform will carry and well roll that out into our commercial businesses and production entities over the next few years daniel arias  citigroup global markets inc broker okay thats helpful and just on biospin i am curious whether you think maybe the pricing increases and the restructuring that youve done in nmr are enough to bring the biospin gross margins in line or close to in line with the other businesses or is there still enough of a gap there to have maybe a bit of a dilutive impact from that business being a bigger part of the mix frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer were obviously as we – the biospin gross margins are moving in the right direction for sure our operating margins are above the corporate average anyway but i think we can do more on gross margin of the biospin group over multiple years were not giving multiyear guidance but as tony said earlier of our  bps operating profit margin improvement that were signing up for in  the majority of that has to come from gross margins it will be more gross margin improvements than opex leverage and of course biospin is a significant part of that biospin has – it has margins gross margins that are maybe a little bit lower than the average but on the other hand its sga cost tend to be a little bit lower as well and of course for the smaller systems in biospin theyre more comparable with the smaller systems of bruker optics or mass spectrometry but i dont see biospin as a drag i think i see biospin this year and last year very much as one of our drivers and i actually expect that to continue for several more years i am not worried about biospin as a drag i was a little bit worried in  when the orders came down and it was a drag but its recovered really very nicely and i think its going to be one of the healthy drivers in  and beyond daniel arias  citigroup global markets inc broker okay thats great thank you operator the next question is from shawn bevec at deutsche bank shawn bevec  deutsche bank securities inc yeah thanks guys i know its still quite early in the year but have you guys seen any of the recent intensifying macroeconomic concerns weigh on orders so far this year frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer its too early so im not aware of it but of course everybody is watching whats going on around us and what you read in the papers with some concern and i think were going to maintain cost discipline and i think were trying to get leverage on reasonable growth were not betting everything on growth only growth will give us operating margin leverage so i dont have any internal data that gives me concern but as i look at the macro picture all around us like everyone else im wondering but as we update as we report q then in early may well perhaps have a somewhat better read on that at this point i dont really have anything thats going to be meaningful anthony l mattacchione  interim cfo senior vice president of finance  accounting hey shawn just to put a little bit more color on that if you look at the pharma biopharma and academic and government markets thats probably about  plus of our business so the most exposed piece would be the industrial part of the business which is somewhere between  to  and thats one of the areas were watching closely frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer and within that i think the biggest piece within industrial is semiconductor and i think semiconductor and tools were actually more optimistic than you heard us in a while based on what we see in that space and intel and others committing to more capex this year and of course us having a bigger footprint with the – and a very relevant footprint with the jordan valley semiconductor acquisition that gave us some of the key xray metrology tools for going to smaller nodes and d structures so shawn bevec  deutsche bank securities inc okay frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i think those are the drivers shawn bevec  deutsche bank securities inc and quickly on the operating margin just going back to that real quick what do you think the operating margins for bruker can look like much longer term do you believe that a  plus operating margin more in line with your tools peers is achievable frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer were not going to comment on that we just havent given the longterm guidance at this point we again have just given one year guidance we have obviously said at various conferences and ill say it again that we think we have a lot of runway ahead of us we have not given a target of where this will end up and we may do so later this year if we were to hold an analyst day but for right now were comfortable and obviously were very glad we made a big step forward we kind of skipped the year last year by doing two years of progress in one year in operating profit margin if you like and i think were going to – from everything that weve put in place already and of course were not done managing the business i think well have a decent year of operating margin improvement but we have not picked a target number and i wont do so right now but for now well simply go with the annual guidance and hopefully we can deliver that again as we did last year operator the next question is from eric criscuolo at mizuho eric j criscuolo  mizuho securities usa inc thanks good afternoon frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer hello eric j criscuolo  mizuho securities usa inc tony what was the outstanding share count at the end of q anthony l mattacchione  interim cfo senior vice president of finance  accounting it was around  million before the dilutive effect of stock option exercises eric j criscuolo  mizuho securities usa inc thanks and then just getting back to the macroeconomic question what kind of impact if any are you guys seeing from the oil markets and has that changed in any way since the divestitures frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah thank goodness i mean we didnt see that coming but in fact a lot of the divestitures in icpms and gc and gc single happen to have energy markets oil markets as a particularly important market and coincidently – i wish i could take credit – but coincidently we divested of these for other reasons and then it turned out that the markets for those things are really hurting right now we have some relatively minor involvement in energy markets of course some of our instruments are sold into energy markets some big oil companies and national oil companies or oil research institutes sometimes buy a  million fticr ms ftms system for petroleum mix research and thats not so much effected anyway by the otherwise somewhat abysmal economic situation in the energy market so in short that has very little effect on us of course some secondary effects perhaps but overall that has very little effect on us operator the next question is from sung ji nam at avondale sung ji nam  avondale partners llc hi thanks for taking the questions i have two quick ones first of all tony i understand why the tax rate was lower in  versus  but for  guidance why is it higher whats driving that and second question is is preclinical imaging still roughly  of biospin revenue thank you anthony l mattacchione  interim cfo senior vice president of finance  accounting the higher tax rate is simply because we are now a tax payer in the us the reason why the rate is lower is because we reversed some valuation allowances against future tax benefits because we had tax losses in the us we now are tax payers so more of the mix of our jurisdictional pretax income will be in the us and that carries a higher tax rate and if you dont – could you repeat the second part of your question frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah the second part preclinical imaging is just a little bit under  of overall biospin revenues for fy  anthony l mattacchione  interim cfo senior vice president of finance  accounting okay operator the next question is from aurko joshi at william blair aurko joshi  william blair  co llc hi good afternoon can you hear me frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer yes we can anthony l mattacchione  interim cfo senior vice president of finance  accounting we can hear you aurko joshi  william blair  co llc yeah i just had a quick question regarding some that discussed upside drivers on leverage and organic revenue growth i know you went kind of group by group but where do you see an end market which you think may surprise investors in general as discussed frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer well if youre getting at the biggest source of upside as we think about  obviously whenever we have large nmr deals that close that is one source of potential upside and then the new products as well is also going to be a potential source so some of the ultrahigh fields when you get above  gigahertz is  but some transactions could still be in the multimillion dollars for  as well operator that is all the time we have allotted

detail now id like to turn the call over to brukers ceo frank laukien frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks joshua good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today i am pleased to report that bruker reported stronger well balanced operational performance in the third quarter of  our organic revenue growth operating margin expansion and free cash flow generation were all much higher on a yearoveryear basis i will begin my presentation on slide four we reported revenues of  million in the third quarter of  which represented a decrease of minus  million or minus  from q of  foreign exchange rates reduced our revenues by minus  yearoveryear in the third quarter of  our yearoveryear organic revenue growth in q  was plus  this strong growth was driven by our calid and our biospin group calid sustained its a strong first half performance by delivering doubledigit organic growth in the third quarter of  our biospin group also delivered strong organic growth due to a rebalance in our nmr business geographically europe and asia pacific were the primary drivers of organic growth in the third quarter our third quarter  nongaap operating margin increased by plus  basis points yearoveryear versus q  while our cam restructuring in  helped to drive approximately plus  basis points of this improvement the remaining increase was related to positive mix and some accelerated customer acceptances in q  which originally had been expected in q of  we also continue to make underlying operational improvement in our business we reported nongaap eps of  in q of  which represented yearoveryear growth of plus  despite facing a higher tax rate and a yearoveryear fx headwind of minus  finally we generated  million of free cash flow a plus  million yearoveryear increase due to higher profitability and more efficient working capital i would also note that we faced a weaker comparison in – with q  moving onto slide five i show brukers performance through the first nine months of  during the first nine months of  we reported a revenue decline of minus  this decline was primarily driven by currency effect in the  cam divestitures we reported yearoveryear organic revenue growth of plus  in the first nine months of  high singledigit organic revenue growth in our calid group and low singledigit organic revenue growth in our nano group more than offset a low singledigit organic revenue decline in our biospin group yeartodate geographically europe and asia were the strongest performing regions on a yeartodate basis our nongaap operating margin for the first nine months of  expanded by  basis points to  compared to  in the same nine months period of  our nongaap eps for the first three quarters of  were  a plus  increase compared to the same period of  excluding the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates our eps would have grown by plus  in the first nine months of  yearoveryear finally our free cash flow more than tripled yearoveryear during the nine month period of  primarily as a result of our strong performance in q  so in summary the operating performance trends through the first nine months of the year are very good our biospin business is starting to rebound after a slow start to the year and we are generating higher organic growth and we are were driving higher operating margins and free cash flow please turn to slide six and seven now where i will ill provide additional details about the yearoveryear performance of our three groups and of our best segments in the third quarter of  let me begin with our biospin group which reported strong organic revenue growth as a result of a rebound in our nuclear magnetic resonance or nmr business our nmr revenues grew in all geographies and we also benefited from timing as we were able to complete several installations in q of  that we had expected to finish later in the year i would also remind you that biospin had a weak first half of  and benefited from some catchup in q  our new order bookings for nmr continued to remain healthy and we believe that the market is recovering from the weak demand that we experienced last year our biospin preclinical imaging or pci division posted midsingledigit organic revenue growth in the quarter which was driven by our preclinical mri product even though the division posted reasonable revenue performance in q our pci new order bookings are weak on a yeartodate basis as a result of this weakness we have decided to restructure the molecular imaging business of pci to better align our cost structure with the lower revenue outlook in addition to healthy revenue growth biospin also posted significant profitability improvement in the third quarter as a result of two primary factors first the biospin group benefited from higher volume and a favorable product mix after unfavorable product mix in the second quarter of  second we are seeing margin benefits from our restructuring and operational excellence action overall biospin had a much improved third quarter but some of this outperformance was related to timing next i will turn to our calid group which generated healthy doubledigit organic revenue growth in the quarter and improved profitability calid saw healthy demand in europe and asia including china in the quarter one of the drivers of this performance was our daltonics division which experienced broadbased strength in nearly all product lines and geographies in q of  we have spent a lot of time working with strengthening the product portfolio of daltonics and were seeing improved demand our detection division which is part of calid also continued its strong year with another quarter of exceptional revenue growth as a result of its new explosives trace detection product or etd which we delivered in q of  in europe detection is a lumpy business and after a weak  we are seeing a strong year in  one should note that there will be much less explosives trace detection business in the immediate future as the european airports now mostly have been upgraded to newer technology please turn to slide seven now where i will discuss the performance of our bruker nano group and our best segment the nano group reported an organic decline in revenues and new order bookings in the third quarter primarily as a result of weaker demand from our industrial customers the bright spot for the nano group continues to be our axs division which posted mid singledigit organic revenue growth in q  and is benefiting from higher demand for its xray diffraction product as well as some timing effects due to improved execution for its order to revenue processes revenue in our nano surfaces division declined in the quarter with particular weakness in the semiconductor and data storage industry we currently dont see any signs that demand for the divisions products will improve in the shortterm but we continue to be strong believers in the longterm potential of our technologies and products in semiconductor metrology this conviction is reflected by our recent – very recent acquisition of jordan valley semiconductor which was announced earlier this week the closing of the acquisition was announced earlier this week the acquisition is expected to enable us to capitalize on the secular trends towards smaller and smaller feature sizes and three dimensional structures in the semiconductor metrology market i will talk more about this transaction on the next slide finally turning to our best segment despite an organic revenue decline of  in q  best expanded its nongaap operating margin to almost  the decrease in revenue is the result of a difficult yearoveryear comparison due to iter back in q – q of  and some rigmbh revenue shift into q of  additionally the rosatom pilot lines effectively shifted out of the third quarter and this pilot line will present approximately  million of low gross margin revenue in q of  we are very pleased that our best segment in the first nine months of  have seen more than  order growth yearoveryear with large superconducting wire orders from major mri manufacturers who have determined that the excellent performance timeliness and highest quality of our best superconductors enable them to achieve lowest overall cost on slide eight i would like go into more detail about the rationale of our jordan valley semiconductor acquisition you can see on this slide that the ongoing digital revolution in social media cloud computing and smaller portable electronics is changing the types of tools required to serve the semiconductor metrology markets semicon customers are demanding faster and more precise metrology of smaller and smaller feature sizes and three dimensional structures at advanced semiconductor node jordan valley provides xray metrology and defectdetection equipment for semiconductor process control that will enable bruker to be a bigger player in what we believe will be a fundamentally attractive market not many other metrology tools can provide useful results at these emerging advanced nodes by combining jordan valleys core metrology strength with brukers complementary xray technologies we believe we are very well positioned to capitalize on the adoption of new technologies and the next cycle of growth in semiconductor metrology i would like to wrap up my presentation on slide nine where i show the key messages that have emerged after our performance in the third quarter earlier this year i conveyed to you that my highest priority in  was to ensure that bruker delivered on its financial guidance for the full year im pleased to report that after nine months we are in an excellent position to meet or exceed our original fiscal year  guidance for organic revenue growth operating margin expansion and eps our strong performance in q  has put us in a position where our year will be somewhat less dependent on q which should help derisk the full year our biospin group is recovering after a weak start to the year as a result of better performance from our nmr business im encouraged by both the revenue and new order bookings performance from nmr and im optimistic that this trend will continue our calid group is having a much stronger year and were seeing good growth for new broad products and for core franchises with the elimination of our cam losses at the end of  calid has significantly improved its profitability finally we are attracting exceptionally experienced top notch managers to join both our senior management team and our board of directors during the third quarter we announced that dr hermann requardt the former ceo of siemens healthcare and john ornell the former cfo of waters had joined brukers board of directors we are excited to add two highest quality executives such as hermann and john weve also been strengthening our management team even further we recently announced that rene lenggenhager will take over as president of bruker biospin and i will introduce rene to you in a moment in addition we recently hired christian busch as biospin group evp of finance christian joined us from novartis to take over the leadership for the biospin group finance function and we made an important hire in our daltonics division where dr dietrich hauffe has been named as the executive vice president of our life science mass spectrometry business dietrich have joined us from phn and he also had a very successful career working for dionex previously so with the improved performance of biospin the continued momentum of calid and key new managers joining bruker i feel good about what we have accomplished in the first nine months of the year now before tony dives into the financial details of q id first like to turn the call over to dr rene lenggenhager to introduce himself to all of you rene please rene lenggenhager  biospin group president bruker corporation thank you frank even though today is only my third day at bruker i though it would be helpful to provide you some perspective on why i joined bruker and what i see as the opportunity in the biospin group bruker has a strong culture built on customer intimacy innovation with integrity and product leadership this culture fits well with my past experience at mettler toledo and attracted me to join the company i also joined because im excited about the potential of the biospin group bruker is a market leader and nmr will be a critical technology to help enable new scientific discoveries as new applied clinical and industrial solutions in the future we will continue the tradition of innovation but it will also forward the operational excellence and lean initiatives an ongoing journey that can continue to bring improvements yearafteryear im very familiar with the advantages and the challenges of managing business franchises where you have a market leader position at my previous company i completed many operational excellence projects ranging from rd sales and marketing operations and logistics from commercial perspective i was responsible for enhancing the value selling capabilities of our sales force while strengthening our processes and delivering sustainable growth and margin expansion i understand that the customer success and financial success need to go handinhand and i see many opportunities to work with frank and help make group of biospin an even more successful all around high performance franchise in the nearterm im focusing on several key priorities first i will be working to gain a deeper understanding of the biospin business customers and markets second i will work with the organization to finalize business targets and goals for  third i will ensure that the group successfully completes its ongoing restructuring initiatives and finally i will ensure that we continue to drive operational and commercial excellence to new levels all with a focus on customers innovation and profitable growth so i will close by stating that im excited to be part of the bruker team i see tremendous potential in the biospin business and i look forward to meeting our shareholders and analysts in the coming year now i will turn the call back over to tony mattacchione anthony l mattacchione  cfo senior vpcorporate finance  accounting thank you rene and welcome to the bruker leadership team i will now provide some additional details on our financial performance in q  and for the first nine months of  financially bruker had a very good third quarter in all respects organic revenue increased  gross and operating margins expanded by  basis points and  basis points respectively and eps increased  or  finally we generated  million of free cash flow in the quarter which is at a high watermark for us this year on slide  i show a snapshot of our q  nongaap results our total revenues were  million a decrease of  from the third quarter of  our nongaap operating income was  million a  increase from q  and our nongaap operating margin increased  basis points yearoveryear to  from  in q  while we had an easy comparison compared to q  our profitability improvement reflect a strong quarter in both our nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy businesses we also benefited from improvements we have made to our portfolio our operating capabilities and our fixed cost structure an offset to these improvements was continued weak demand from most of our semidata storage and industrial customers and our bruker nano group the net result of these drivers was that our nongaap earnings per share increased  to  a share in the quarter as i mentioned we generated  million of free cash flow in q reflecting a strong yearoveryear improvement which i will elaborate on in a minute our higher free cash flow combined with continuous improvements in our working capital ratios led to a strong yearoveryear improvement in our net cash position on slide  i show the revenue bridge for q  despite a  negative effect from the  cam divestitures and a  negative effect from changes in foreign currency translation organic revenue grew  in the third quarter of  organic revenue growth of  million in q  was driven by our calid and biospin groups as frank had mentioned i would also note that our calid group in particular had a very strong quarter of performance on slide  our q  nongaap gross margin of  increased  basis points on a yearoveryear basis foreign currency translation decreased our gross profit by  million in the quarter but had a small positive effect of  basis points on our gross margin percentage the benefits of our cam restructuring added another  basis points to our gross margin in q  the roughly  basis points of remaining gross margin improvement was primarily the result of higher volume and a more profitable product mix in the quarter biospin had a very strong quarter of gross margin performance due to a number of factors including the positive effect of the restructuring and operational improvements weve completed over the last couple of years we also benefited from earlier than expected revenue recognition on some systems with higher gross margins in the quarter our q  operating expenses were down approximately  million yearoveryear approximately  million of this decrease was related to foreign currency translation with the remaining decline primarily related to our cam restructuring careful management of our fixed cost structure has resulted in more pullthrough of gross profit increases to our operating process nongaap operating margin improved  basis points compared to q  in addition to the higher gross margin another factor in driving our higher operating margins was an rd expense decline of  basis points yearoveryear cam and fx represented most of this increase but we also selectively cut back rd project spending in our nano and biospin groups our q  nongaap tax rate was  which was  higher than the previous year third quarter and this was caused by a change in our jurisdictional mix including an expected decrease in us profit as a result of the weakness in the nano group our full year  nongaap tax rate is now expected to be between  and  finally nongaap eps of  represents a  or  increase from q  despite facing a  headwind from foreign exchange on slide  i show a reconciliation of our gaap to nongaap financial results for the third quarter in q  we excluded  million of operating cost from our nongaap results this was a decrease of  million from q  this decrease is driven by lower restructuring and other costs i would also note that our nongaap interest in other income and expense net line increased by  million yearoveryear as a result of higher fx foreign currency transaction losses on slide  i show the revenue bridge for the first nine months of  we reported organic yearoveryear revenue increase of  after the first nine months of  changes in foreign currency translation lowered our revenues by  or approximately  million with a weaker euro driving most of yearoveryear difference on slide  i show our nongaap pl for the first nine months of  our nongaap gross margins have improved by  basis points compared to the first nine months last year the gross margin improvement through the first nine months is a similar story to what we saw in q  from a group perspective calid drove most of this improvement as savings from our cam restructuring added  basis points to the gross margin improvement through the first nine months of the year changes from foreign currency rates added another  basis points of improvement with the remaining increase related to a more profitable revenue mix the cam restructuring and fx represented all of the  million yearoveryear decrease in operating expenses in the first nine months of  our nongaap operating margin increased by  basis points yearoveryear though the first nine months of  with cam representing a little over  basis points of this increase and roughly  basis points coming from fundamental improvements in the rest of our businesses on the bottom line we reported  in nongaap eps which was  or  higher in the first nine months of  primarily due to the strong operating earnings growth in q  changes in foreign currency translation rates reduced our eps by  whereas the absence of the divested cam businesses increased eps by  as well on slide  we show the gaap to nongaap reconciliation for the first nine months of  we excluded operating costs of  million compared to  million in the first nine months of  lower restructuring costs were offset by higher other costs in the first nine months of  the biggest drivers of the higher other costs are related to outsourcing of our – the outsourcing of our pension plan in switzerland and higher it costs related to our erp financial consolidation and human resource transformation system initiative on slide  i show our cash flow statement for the third quarter of  we generated free cash flow of  million in q compared with  million in the same period in  which is a  million improvement higher gaap net income together with lower restructuring costs lower depreciation and amortization and improved working capital efficiency all contributed to the free cash flow increase also contributing to the increase were approximately  million of tax refund resulting from settled audits in germany our cash conversion cycle improved by  days compared to the q  this would comprise of the following dio decreased by  days to  days our dso decreased by four days to  days and this was an improvement that was partially offset by a reduction in our days payable outstanding which totaled  days compared to  days in q  overall we are pleased with the improvement in our working capital but we do have further room for improvement during the third quarter we repurchased  shares as part of our share buyback program on a yeartodate basis we have repurchased approximately  million shares now turning to the guidance i show brukers updated guidance for the full year of  as a result of our performance in q  we are increasing our guidance for nongaap operating margin expansion and for eps we continue to expect to generate organic revenue growth of approximately  but with our yeartodate profitability improvement we now expect to increase our nongaap operating margin by  basis points or more compared to our previous guidance of  basis points or more we now expect that our nongaap eps will be in the range of  to  compared to our previous guidance of approximately  we expect changes in foreign currency exchange rates to reduce our reported revenue by approximately  for the full year in  which refines our earlier guidance of  to  adverse effect this will generate a headwind to our nongaap eps of roughly  for the full year in  our currency assumptions include a yen to us dollar rate of  and a us dollar to euro rate of  which were the spot rates at the end of q  we expect fiscal year  cam related revenues to decrease by  million in  – sorry in  compared to  as i mentioned earlier we now expect the nongaap our nongaap tax rate to be between  and  for the full year in  so i will close by reiterating that the third quarter was a very good quarter of overall financial performance performance improvements for the company the strong outperformance in q put us in an excellent position to deliver our full year of attractive operating margin earnings growth and cash flow improvement and commitment with that id like to turn the call back over to joshua to start to the qa session joshua s young  vice presidentinvestor relations amy could you please assemble the qa roster questionandanswer session operator certainly our first question comes from steve willoughby at cleveland research steve b willoughby  cleveland research co llc hi good evening guys thanks for taking my question frank you went from a mid singledigit yearoveryear decline in your biospin business last quarter to calling it out as an area of strength here in the third quarter i was just wondering given your relatively positive commentary regarding orders the last few quarters should we expect the nmr business to kind of turn the corner now and expect a more positive result to continue in the fourth quarter and going into next year frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer yes steve i do think there is a sustainable improvement in nmr with orders for the full year that youre expected to clearly be stronger than last year which are pretty weak orders as you recall in the first half of this year we had some execution issues in that bruker biospin business that i think weve fixed to a great extent and clearly at least we made very significant improvement in q and so i think with healthy orders in nmr this year compared to last year and improved execution i think were on a good path to hopefully be able to call that in another one or two quarters for sustainable improvement im optimistic here steve b willoughby  cleveland research co llc just one followup on that frank in regards to the strength of the orders youre seeing in nmr i know youve been calling it out as healthy for the past several quarters was the strength in orders in nmr any different here in the third quarter as compared to what you saw in the first or second quarter frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer the nmr orders fluctuate even more from quartertoquarter thats even lumpier so looking at orders in any given quarter q orders were excellent but there also was an also ultrahigh field order as you may recall we had a press release in some of our ultrahigh field orders some of which of course wont get delivered and turn into revenue for several more years but overall its been – its been – for the year its healthy single digits thats healthy for the full year and in any given quarter it really goes up and down a little bit i really wouldnt want to comment quarterly on biospin orders because they fluctuate too much for the year theyre healthy as we said before and that implies single digits but steve b willoughby  cleveland research co llc thanks very much okay thanks frank frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer yes operator the next question is from brandon couillard at jefferies brandon couillard  jefferies llc yes good afternoon frank in terms of the – i guess the more balanced second half revenue cadence here i mean was that largely a function of luck or better management of the cadence and how much control do you – can you really exert on this dynamic to perhaps level it out more so in the future frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer we work very very hard on it brandon and then we got lucky sometimes you work very hard and you dont get lucky and things fall out but we worked very hard weve made a very concerted effort to do better than our own previous internal forecasts for q and we succeeded so that was good because i was not comfortable with the way q and q were shaping up with q is always the strongest quarter of the year that will never be changed but it was too much with – would have come in from q and i wanted to achieve more in q already but keep in mind that q was a mix there was some favorable mix there was some favorable timing for which we worked very hard but they also were from improving fundamentals its really a mix of those three things coming together brandon couillard  jefferies llc thanks and a quick one for tony could you give us the impact of currency in terms of operating profit dollars in the third quarter anthony l mattacchione  cfo senior vpcorporate finance  accounting sure actually let me get that back – get that to you later brandon couillard  jefferies llc super thanks operator the next question is from tim evans of wells fargo tim c evans  wells fargo securities llc thank you frank on preclinical imaging business you said it was weak and you decided to take a restructuring so im assuming that you are anticipating that weakness will continue can you talk about whats going on in that business a little bit more broadly frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer well if you – which you do i know of course tim if you followed our press releases youll notice that in the third quarter we had some of the most significant product introductions in that we have a new preclinical pet spect system we call it the albira si which we think is going to be performance leading we came out with a cryogenfree  tesla magnet and an mri pet combination and also optical molecular imaging a new system so major major product introductions in pci in q but of course you dont get orders and revenue from that yet thats going to take probably a couple of quarters before that begins to ramp up so were not only doing restructuring although we did some restructuring or we are in the process of doing some restructuring in some of the optical molecular imaging product line which were streamlining and integrating into another rd site and factory tim c evans  wells fargo securities llc okay and just one  frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer i dont know if i answered all of your questions but thats sort of the big picture tim c evans  wells fargo securities llc that is helpful and i just wanted to squeeze one in on your margin guidance you said greater than  basis points of expansion if i just kind of triangulate on revenue and eps i could get to a margin number that is meaningfully more than  basis points of expansion i want to make sure that im calculating that correctly and there is nothing below the line that would kind of maybe make the margin a little bit lower and still allow you to come in to eps guidance frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer there is just still a lot of risk every fourth quarter  by a significant margin well i try not to use the word margin here but the fourth quarter will be the biggest quarter of the year in every respect and so therefore there is risk if some sites are not ready or the magnets dont make it to field and things like that i think were the  bps guidance or greater than  is reasonable there is upside to that but there is also risk tim c evans  wells fargo securities llc okay thank you anthony l mattacchione  cfo senior vpcorporate finance  accounting tim there is nothing below the line noteworthy and as both have frank and id mentioned in our comments we had very positive mix in q we dont expect that mix to continue in q and we do have from lower margin business that we expect to revenue in q as well so we dont expect that mix to continue and if i may just to go back to brandons question the fx impact on operating profit was about  million in the third quarter tim c evans  wells fargo securities llc  million negative anthony l mattacchione  cfo senior vpcorporate finance  accounting negative operator the next question is from derik de bruin at bank at america merrill lynch michael ryskin  bank of america merrill lynch hi good evening its actually mike ryskin calling in for derik thanks for taking my question kind of a followup on something thats been asked before about the third quarter fourth quarter split most of you – as you mentioned most of your second half strength usually comes from q you alluded to that in some guidance earlier this year but then today you also mentioned that you saw some strong sales in calid with explosive trace detection which was lumpy nonrecurring then you had some orders in biospin move up from q and those two groups really drove your performance could you provide some color on how much of an effect you think those two factors will have in q and whether or not we should expect sort of similar ramp that weve seen in prior years especially given the difficult comp you have with  anthony l mattacchione  cfo senior vpcorporate finance  accounting yeah mike like we just mentioned q we had – the timing of q there was more acceptances that we expected those wont continue into q and we – yeah so we benefited from the timing the yearoveryear q is not expected to be much higher or much lower as well so that will play an effect on the sequential comparison frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i mean so being a little less dependent on q is a healthy thing id like to make that – id like to reach that achieve that in every year q will still be a very strong quarter and i think you kind of always – were giving guidance for the full year were reporting the first nine months so you can really triangulate what were thinking about the fourth quarter but as always keep in mind that for bruker even though we have better and better tools to predict there is still a plusminus  million type of uncertainty and thats very fundamental because we deal with bigger systems and customer acceptances and insights that can or that may or may not be ready so i think this is you know reasonable guidance and i think thats makes still for a very strong q but i am glad that we moved a little bit more into q otherwise q would have been we would have relied too much on q i think thats really all there is to it its not that all of a sudden q is stronger than q but i think its just a healthier sequence of events as we now envision it operator our next question is from doug schenkel at cowen  company doug schenkel  cowen  co llc hey good afternoon guys and thank you for taking my question i only have one but it does have four parts so just related to nmr order improvements and the healthy order bookings one was the momentum pretty balanced across higher field products and lower field products where your major competitor exited two anything notable in terms of geographic strengths or weaknesses three is it too early to determine with about the improvements in academic government budgets freeing up is helping order trends and four anything available datawise that would demonstrate that some of your newer product launches are starting to have an impact on driving a replacement cycle thank you frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer we love your one single question doug so an nmr order geographically were pretty balanced so there was strength everywhere in the quarter yeartodate europe was quite strong nmr orders ultrahigh field has been it was dormant – almost dormant last year it has recovered a little bit but its not at its usual strength and new orders for gigahertz systems and gigahertz class systems as these are depending on field strength  million to  million types of funding that takes longer so we dont have anything under our belt yet in that direction from new orders theres one  gigahertz order that we added in frankfurt in the third quarter sorry i dont want to skip that but thats just been in the works and in the pipeline for a very long time and finally got funded so ultrahigh field i would say partial recovery compared to  but not as strong as we had seen some time ago and quite honestly not as strong as we might expect hopefully in   as the gigahertz class nmr systems hopefully well generate along with the new applications particularly for intrinsically disordered proteins which i think will be very important but that has not materialized into orders yet academic trends more or less as they have been japan is still weak india middle east africa a little bit weak in biospin and europe and the us relatively healthy and china not bad new products yes some of the more new products that dont require very large budgets like the fusion the fusion solution combining nmr and high revolution accurate mass spectrometry clearly were seeing some initial traction or things like the food screener module for the wine profiler the honey profiler these things are getting traction whereas that you expect things that cost  million or more people are excited about them people see the scientific need but the fundraising there takes much longer i hope that has addressed all four parts of your question doug schenkel  cowen  co llc that was perfect frank thank you so much frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer youre welcome doug operator our next question is from ross muken at evercore isi ross muken  evercore isi good afternoon guys so obviously when charlie departed there was a lot of concern relative at least on the investor side to sort of the story of the management team and the like even though many of youve been together for a while but then you added two really impressive board members which you mentioned and then you brought on rene not long ago and clearly you are a much much strong organization at least optically to us from an operation standpoint is there any way you can give us some – that i know not everyones been there for quite a long time yet but any way you can give us some like anecdotal stories or examples where these three individuals who came from obviously much larger and diversified companies that had maybe a bit better of an operating trajectory historically give us examples of how theyve already start to input maybe add to the business and how youve incorporated some of the ideas to sort of helping drive what seemingly have been better results here in the business obviously a lot of this has been many years in the making im just trying to get a sense for some of the new voices frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer okay ill start with rene because this is his – really his day four hes my kind of guy he started working on sunday on november  so and he had an entire saturday of vacation between jobs so im optimistic that he will be a hard worker hes a very experienced guy and his very deep very technical background in innovation and rd experience including rd management but he really has outstanding operational experience and operational defined very broad not only manufacturing or logistics or procurement so i think thats one of the areas as you know our operational and commercial excellence initiative the lean initiative youve never done weve implemented some of that but you know he has the experience that he shared with me that you can really do round after round after round then you get a little better each time and so driving that relentlessly along with innovation and he already visited his first four customers in cambridge and boston this morning so that – those are the anecdotes for rene but its very early days so well have to observe that hermann requardt on the board i mean – he obviously has so much experience thats immediately applicable to our preclinical imaging business because he did the clinical imaging at siemens as one of the world leaders and so we have a lot of insight there from technology to trends to funding to – while patient reimbursement doesnt affect us so were learning a lot from him about – what to do and what not to do very valuable and – hes just been at one board meeting so far its early days john ornell is very active he is sort of my partner for the cfo search and i think were also learning a lot of things about longterm tax planning – things that wont have an effect not even on next year very much but over time can add up so he is an audit committee member were learning a lot from him also on systems implementations so incredibly valuable sounding board it helps that he lives locally here so we get to see him not only at board meetings but sort of in some ways coaching us a little bit on a number of topics and those are my anecdotes for the moment its all early days for all three of them operator your next question is from jonathan groberg of ubs jonathan groberg  ubs securities llc great thanks for that frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer very poor audio jonathan anything you can do about that jonathan groberg  ubs securities llc sorry do you hear me okay anthony l mattacchione  cfo senior vpcorporate finance  accounting yeah john youre better now go ahead you can ask your question jonathan groberg  ubs securities llc okay i was just saying geographically obviously japan and china are two significant markets for you can you maybe just give a little bit more color on whats interesting in those geographies joshua s young  vice presidentinvestor relations yeah john this is joshua so last quarter we talked about japan being a point of weakness in the business we saw those trends continue in the third quarter in japan we saw weak revenue and weak orders with reasonable declines in terms of china you know china we had a slow start to the year but id say we certainly are seeing mixed results in some businesses were doing quite well in china for example daltonics and others not so well the way that will shake out though is we still expect growth in both revenue and new order bookings for the full year in china jonathan groberg  ubs securities llc okay and then also i may have missed this can you give some color on the malditof the  business and kind of what you are expecting there over the next bit frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah this is frank so that continues to be healthy even in europe where of course the market – you know weve been in the market much longer the aftermarket business is growing very rapidly were expecting for the full year healthy growth in the americas which is what we expected because we now have – or as of earlier in the year we had our second fda claim accepted and in china weve seen very healthy market development yeartodate and expect more of that as we also got chinese fda clearance late last year so its particular strength in china and the us and very satisfactory in general and also as predicted particular strength and now rapidly growing from a smaller base but rapidly growing aftermarket business for the multi biocipher jonathan groberg  ubs securities llc frank could you quantify that how big that business is now or how big you are expecting you see by the end of the year frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer very broadly in the  million to  million range i dont think we want disclose exact figures nor do i have it at my finger tips jonathan groberg  ubs securities llc okay all right operator next question is from tycho peterson at jpmorgan tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc hey guys the positive price mix dynamic you called out was that specific to nmr or you kind of seeing an ability to kind of extract broader price increases across the portfolio anthony l mattacchione  cfo senior vpcorporate finance  accounting it was specific to nmr we had a few high margin shipments some of which benefited from timing and if you look at we had lower nmr gross profit shipments in the previous third quarter so most of the product mix effects came from nmr tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc okay and then on the weakness in nano can you may be just frank talk a little bit about how you think about the cycle here how long you think the order book here remains depressed and with the bolton you did there does that smooth out a little bit of the cyclicality for that business frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah i think that the that business thats an ongoing business there they are not only depending on the cycle but also on technology adoption and technology adoption and first pilot systems thats a steadier process of course what we really would like to see is the technology adoption where we think were in very very good position for the next decade quite candidly and without having to wait for a decade even as we go from  nanometer to  nanometer eventually seven nanometer and five nanometer and of course the trend toward d finfet structures infrastructure in memory end process is ongoing already anyway but the cycle to build capacity that has not really been satisfactory for anybody in the metrology business but we do know its coming back its an usually long down cycle but were kind of feel good about that first of all we dont have too much exposure as a company overall we do get the technology adoption part throughout and you were all patiently waiting for the cycle to pick up that will be the gravy but in the meantime thats the situation i think some of the other industrial markets youre not surprised to hear sometimes there are elements of that thats the wall street journal business thats what you read about so they are they didnt get stronger in the last three months to six months keep in mind that nano also has made a very conscious effort to have more of its mix from academic research and biology and life science research particularly the florescent microscopy florescent microscopy super resolution and multiphoton those acquisitions that we did in the previous year thats getting into gear so the mix of nano is also changing along the way in a way that in some areas where we see favorable funding trends from the brain initiative or from investments in cell biology so its a mixed bag its not all just dependent on steel or metals or cement or so although there is some elements of that well become more diversified and in some areas we simply in addition to the cycle which we cant control and which isnt that favorable where our technology adoption curves where were almost a must on that adoption curve and were branching out more into life sciences so its strategically changing over time from the nano that perhaps you remember from two years or three years ago i hope that helps that may have been too much color operator the next question is from isaac ro at goldman sachs isaac ro  goldman sachs  co good afternoon thank you for taking the question here frank maybe just a high level question on the cfo search could you maybe give us an update on the progress there in terms of the pipeline kind of the qualities of the candidates youre currently evaluating maybe when we might know a little more there thank you frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah its a very active search and were clearly looking at candidates and were getting to see some good candidates we have good external candidates and internal candidates we believe that were going to make a decision most likely in the first quarter of next year and at this point its just an intense process thats proceeding and so i would think that we most likely will make a decision in the first quarter of next year isaac ro  goldman sachs  co great and then just one product specific question on biotyper i think you mentioned in the prepared comments that it was strong i was curious if you could maybe try to put a little more color on what it contributed to growth and then more importantly where do you think we are in the product life cycle i gather that we are still somewhat early days based on i think our last conversation at asm this year but just curious on as you think about sort of in baseball terms what inning we are in and maybe from here what kind of general investment you think that you need to make to realize the opportunity thatll be great thank you guys frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer well i mean for the biotyper we dont want to get too granular in giving its growth rate and stuff but it has healthy growth rates it has – and has had for a number of years the highest growth rate within the daltonics business as you know and we dont see that trend changing dramatically even though its a larger business so the growth rates are good and weve also said directionally in the past and that continues to be true that its gross margins are above calid average or bruker average to your – to the further questions i think it depends a little bit what geography were talking about in europe maybe were in the fifth inning or something like that and now of course aftermarket – there is a lot more established we are much further along aftermarket its now starting to play a role in – first customers are also experimenting where they presently research use only not approved yet resistance testing and approaches to maybe even to do susceptibility testing on that platform which might add another s curve to the identification capabilities eventually and thats early days i think in the us we are perhaps in the third inning and in china in the second so theyre still early days and still a lot of lot of potential i hope thats helpful operator the next question is from dan arias with citi bryan kipp  citigroup hi this is actually bryan kipp on behalf of dan just a question on pacing in the quarter just around the color you guys gave on the kind of the implied growth rate for q how did the october pace just – and in conjunction with that did you expect the  million rosatom to come forward in the back half of the year can you remind me there frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer we expected that in the second half of the year and during the quarter it became clear that its going to move out of q and into q bryan kipp  citigroup and the pacing in the fourth quarter in the sense of – i know you guys are still working through your erp system and trying to have visibility at month end how is it pacing so far in the fourth quarter just trying to get a sense of the plus and minus  million is still what you are thinking thank you frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer i think we find out the plus or minus  million in the last three days or four days of each quarter its literally there so many installations and acceptances that i have no increased visibility and i wouldnt have it internally even by middle of december its literally whether or not we may exceed by up to  million i mean thats – thats at the high end of the variability or might be lower that really gets determined in many ways fundamentally and even with better systems and sort of the last week of each quarter thats no different in q and then that actually would be more or less also true in the q or q so the pace – the pacing is on track theres nothing remarkable there in q bryan kipp  citigroup and just a higher level question kind of more around strategy you guys have not emerged not in a bad way but on talking to you at length in regards to the rationalization of the portfolio rightsizing the business and streamlining the company these tangible changes are helpful but just thinking where are you guys are going forward in terms of product portfolio kind of dynamic do you have any interest in moving further downstream or do you think its going to be five years to  years from now the identity of bruker is still going to be a leading kind of more upstream research analytical instrument provide frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer well i wouldnt want to use the category downstream or upstream but more were looking for defensible highmargin areas where we can be one of the leading players and that can be a  million ultrahigh field nmr system thats clearly what you would call a very highend and perhaps upstream that can be a € or  explosive trace detector has new libraries and technology that goes far beyond whats generally has been found at airports before so there i would say were very – we are not only a highend only company were looking for high performance kind of sometimes come in innovative small packages or in user friendly packages with great content like the maldi biotyper thats not the most highend maldi  or mass spectrometer thats out there but its incredibly powerful solution because of the libraries and assays and consumables that come with it so were much less a niche highend company today but we still look to leverage performance for good margins and that can be really at either end of the market wherever we think we can find interesting profit and margin pools where we think we can have defensible positions operator our next question is from bryan brokmeier at cantor fitzgerald bryan paul brokmeier  cantor fitzgerald securities hi good evening since introducing the tissuetyper how is the development of the library then frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer very early days very early days bryan so there is some early adopters that are now ordering this system and they will all be – in most cases they will all be collaboration partners this will – this in some ways will be a team sport not unlike for the maldi biotyper where there is no way that we can develop all the contents or library inhouse and so we rely on many different collaborators to – who explore and discover new areas and then we help organize validation if they think theyve discovered something youve got to do it on multiple systems in multiple labs so its very early days but in the meantime even as theres no validated assays yet its in a system that generates a lot of excitement because of it incredible tissue or anatomical pathology research capabilities so we benefit initially now from the researchoriented customers bryan paul brokmeier  cantor fitzgerald securities okay and in the quarter i guess really over the last couple of quarters were any of the improvements that youre seeing – were any of the improvements youre seeing that has allowed for customers to take deliveries in these – from the fourth quarter into the third quarter is any of that a result of things youve done yeartodate or was it really just up to the customer and the customer readiness frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer very strong execution in q we really worked it at very hard and that means you lose some customers because theyre not ready and you work with others and you just make sure that we dont add to it by incomplete shipment or quality or not properly planning our resources so i really think the biospin colleagues and others in calid and elsewhere i think they just – i think our execution is getting better and better i think our management processes and information systems are getting better theyre not perfect yet but i think there is a lot of improvement and its pretty steady anthony l mattacchione  cfo senior vpcorporate finance  accounting and just one point of detail here its not that customers are taking shipments its that were completing installations of systems earlier than expected and theyre meeting the specs as well frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you bryan paul brokmeier  cantor fitzgerald securities okay great thank you operator the next question is from paul knight at janney montgomery scott william march  janney montgomery scott hi this is actually bill march on for paul how you guys doing frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer good how are you william march  janney montgomery scott doing well i was just hoping you could provide a little more color on the recent jordan valley acquisition and then how we should think about kind of the pacing andor lumpiness of revenue within that segment thank you frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer sure bill so weve given some color on the rationale behind the jordan valley technology the xray metrology technology that theyre pursuing we think they can strengthen that even further with some of the components and other technologies that we can contribute so theres some nice technical synergies theres also some sales and customer support and service synergies between their global setup and our global setup thats all coming together nicely we have given some guidance that we think this will be that their revenue next year might be somewhere around  million so bill what they contribute the remainder of this year will be negligible but what they contribute next year might be around  million and we expect this to be  to  accretive to nongaap eps next year william march  janney montgomery scott just then a quick followup just thinking about the revenue pacing do you think that theyll have kind of a consistent mix or do you think that it could be kind of quartertoquarter or you could see lumpier revenues thanks frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer well since they have high ticket items im sure that particular business will have lumpiness no question about it but the more different businesses we have these lumpiness are not in phase so to speak so within the much larger revenue stream of bruker i dont think this will materially or perhaps in anyway increase our lumpiness overall william march  janney montgomery scott thats helpful frank h laukien  chairman president  chief executive officer standalone business yes but at the bruker level its the lumpiness doesnt make such a big difference william march  janney montgomery scott great thanks for your help have a good evening operator that is all the time allotted
