officer of the medicines company visit wwwcfostudiocom to read about this interview and to watch the entire oncamera interview  keys to transitioning from cfo to president zezas  you’re watching cfo studio and i am your host andrew zezas  i have the pleasure of being joined today by glenn sblendorio president and chief financial officer of the medicines company  mr sblendorio holds a bba in accounting pace university and an mba in finance from fairleigh dickinson university  he completed the harvard finance management program  mr sblendorio sits on the board of directors of both the medicines company and amitech therapeutics  his previous experiences are having held high level of executive positions at eyetech pharmaceuticals    mbm capital sony and roche  mr sblendorio is a recipient of  nj biz cfo of the year award  the medicines company founded in  is publicly traded on the nasdaq as symbol mdco   it’s a global company based in new jersey with operations in  countries  and as a leader in providing acute care hospital medicines the medicines company’s lead product angiomax is one of the top selling acute cardio vascular drugs used to treat patients from having heart attacks  mr sblendorio is here today to share his views on the keys to transitioning from cfo to president  glenn it’s so nice to have you here on cfo studio sblendorio thank you andy so nice to meet you zezas glenn i understand that the medicines company has a unique business model  and it’s primarily based on outsourcing and something you guys call “hiring high”  tell me about that  share with me the unique challenges sblendorio sure let’s talk about the model first  as you mentioned the company was founded back in   it was a venture capital start up  it was a clean sheet of paper  i was actually involved in helping draft that plan       zezas oh wow sblendorio and the plan was very simply to put together a biopharmaceutical company that would go out to big pharma companies and find assets that were put on the shelves specifically drugs that could be developed cost effectively  with that also you would have to have people to do that great project managers and also great leaders in the respective field  roll that forward a minute and talk a little bit more about the “hire high”  today the company hopefully this year is on track to do close to  million in sales  we have about  people zezas wait give me that again   million in sales with over  employees  that’s tremendous sblendorio so that’s the “hire high”  that’s the “hire high” so we go out and we higher great doctors and clinicians  and really what we are hiring is great lawyers and great accountants  what we are hiring are not only great professionals but great project managers  it’s been a core competency core objective of the company to find the right people and pay them quite well  our average salary is about  zezas  average is that typical for pharmaceutical company sblendorio that’s very high so that includes your base salary your bonus and your benefits  that’s on the high side when you average it out zezas sure sblendorio and that reflects the “hiring high”  human resources we call human strategy zezas human strategy sblendorio human strategy because it is a key strategy of the company to be sure we hire the right people  from a cfo’s prospective if you think about it is a huge investment so if you hire somebody and they last six months i mean it’s always bad for the company but here where the investment is so significant a long leave time to try to find these people with high salaries  so that’s the “higher high” it’s the core principal our ceo makes sure every time we go out and hire somebody that we are hiring not only the right individual but we are hiring at the right level as well zezas so you are wearing the hats of cfo and president stay with the “hiring high” what particular challenges do you have have experienced as cfo in the “hiring high” model sblendorio again and it comes back to really just the cfo hat an executive as well  the “hiring high” is that big investment  salaries and benefits is the largest single cost on our pl if you add up commercial cost manufacturing this is the largest single cost as a cfo you want to be sure that and i know this is people but that this investment is a good investment zezas that’s actually a pretty serious statement as a pharma company that your greatest single cost is your human assets  that says a lot about your company  all good all good sblendorio thank you zezas so alright on your dual role as cfo and president your also responsible for business development at the medicines company  given your finance background i’ll ask you a question in prospective of cfo is business development what the cfo should be doing is the cfo the right person who should be doing that at a company like yours sblendorio not because i do it but i think it is the right person  a few reasons why what in our particular case i mentioned the business model of going out and acquiring assets either acquisitions licensing things of that nature  as a cfo it is an investment so first and foremost you got to run the numbers do the models make sure your assumptions are right  that’s more in a classical cfo prospective  but i think you need to have an appreciation of the business as well zezas especially if you do business development sure sblendorio and i think as a cfo if you are doing your job right you have a good appreciation  the second reason is i think finance executives tend to be very good project managers  you go through a process of diligence contract negotiation overseeing that even though we are in a technical business where there is a lot of science and medicine we have some great people doing the actual work  i think as a cfo overseeing that process is again a core competency  and finally after you acquire the asset there is always the little task of integration and i think cfo’s or finance executives do a great job with that  so i think with this particular case i think a cfo that understands your business understands your products good person to run the business development zezas right business development  and business development is one where good project management skills are essential and most people don’t think about it that way sblendorio that’s absolutely right zezas i would agree with your assessment  so glenn last year you were promoted from cfo to cfo and president sblendorio yes zezas in retaining your cfo title which is very unusual i find it very interesting was your promotion from cfo to president a planned event by you or by others or did the board actually seek you out and propose it to you sblendorio i think it was a few things  first i would like to say that in a growth company you have some great people in finance and as i rose up through the ranks they have as well but we’ll talk about that maybe later so it creates opportunities  i think it was a planned event  the first thing the board decided was to open up an opportunity for me to join the board of directors which i did prior to the promotion  i had been taken on an increased responsibility in terms of operations manufacturing business development i already had  and then the next logical step was the move to president  i think it was partly retention not that i was looking to go anywhere i love the company  but it was a great move for retention for career growth for me at this point of my life  so i think it was a little of both i think it was planned and in a couple steps zezas okay so let’s stay with that cfo to president is a trend and ceo is a trend we are seeing more often but cfo to president retaining the title of cfo is very very unusual  what special skills does a cfo bring to any organization when he or she becomes a president sblendorio i think if you do your job right as a finance executive cfo you want to spend time understanding your business  that means getting out meeting with customers zezas not just the spread sheet side of it sblendorio no the spread sheet is the boring part  but getting out seeing what customers want and you know you mentioned before in our particular case the customers are hospitals so it is everything from meeting the pharmacist to the nurse to the doctor to the people in the csuite  that’s important i think meeting your vendors are also important  you get out and in our particular case with the outsourcing vendor support for us is very important  that could be a manufacturer that could be a provider of services as relates to research and development  and probably very important if you want to transition from a cfo to a presidentcoo you need to understand your organization which means you got to get out understand the people do understand the dynamics the culture and you might say that’s natural but i think that’s very important that you have all those aspects zezas so you are really talking about a  degree view  you’re talking about what’s behind you in terms of manufacturers and vendors who’s in front you the customers and clients perhaps and then the organization itself sblendorio yeah zezas wow  so then tell me how the role of president compares or differs from the role of cfo sblendorio you know andy…it’s interesting i think it was with its challenges and complications i don’t want to say but it was almost a natural transition zezas really sblendorio because over the years i took a lot of pride in really getting to know the company understand the company understand our business model  and i felt it was a natural transition to me zezas well the best cfo’s that we’ve seen are those who view their cfo role as being more of a coo role and it sounds to me like you have always done that sblendorio  yeah well don’t forget we’re a public company so you have to be diligent as a cfo you got responsibilities to the shareholders  so you can’t neglect that  but you’re right i think understanding the company integrating yourself into the organization is all a part of it zezas glenn the medicines company based here in new jersey  countries and going through a global expansion how is that working as a company that is relatively young from new jersey sblendorio i’d love to say it’s simple but it’s not  we’ve had our challenges especially outside of the us in europe  it’s going to be interesting and i’m going to come back to a common issue people  about four or five years ago we had a great opportunity to reacquire one of our key assets in europe zezas reacquire sblendorio angiomax we had partnered it out early on we had an opportunity to take it back  and it was an opportunity to start the global expansion of the company  so we bought the asset back put the best of transition plans in and we started and stopped a couple times  it was complications largely with organization  i think we knew the markets generally  but it did take some work and we had to go through a couple rounds of people before we got it right  and you can’t expect to manage that company from parsippany you really do have to have a local presence we are headquarters in zurich outside the us  and i think we got it right now  after four years a little slower than we thought so we had a nice little plan of two years to get up and running it took closer to three to four on track  next hurdle for us is asia huge market everyone talks about the emerging markets in india and china and you need to be there for the long term  so we have a small footprint there we have some people  we are actually selling some product in india which is fantastic  we just finished some clinical research in china but need to be there for the long term  i think that we are a little bit more diligent in our process and a little bit more careful about people but the next big area of growth for the company zezas and you seem excited about both sblendorio they’re both terrific i mean i know europe because i lived there years ago  i traveled there a lot  i had an opportunity to spend some time in asia when i was with sony   but asia is just exciting beyond belief because you are seeing growth that is unprecedented zezas  yeah i can only imagine  glenn characterize your management style for me sblendorio  i think one as you get older and unfortunately we all get older you need to listen first i learned to listen much better  i would hope that’s the case  but listening is very important and then i think it is a collaborative style  you mentioned before i just had a fantastic opportunity to finish a management training program at harvard and it was great it really even you think you know there is always an opportunity to learn and i learned a lot a lot of it was about leadership so what i learned about leadership was that in addition to being collaborative to be open to communication making sure there is alignment i think alignment in a growing business is very important  transparency ya know in creating an environment where people feel they have the opportunity to grow  so i hope it’s a style and one of the reasons i think it does work i’ve been able to retain a number of folks with me as i went from company to company  some of the folks i have today have been with me before and they’re still here today  zezas well that says a lot about them it says a lot about you sblendorio it does zezas glenn is there anyone in particular who was influential in your career and did they teach you anything specifically sblendorio there actually was a very long time ago a cfo at hoffmannla roche in nutley a guy by the name of marty stadler  i was quite young then  i had an opportunity even as a young and up and coming i won’t even say executive a young and up and coming finance person accounting person  i had an opportunity to work with him on a number of projects quite closely and what he taught me in addition to being a good account at that time was also to be very analytical  and really be sure you had your analytics and your facts and your assumptions right in digesting a problem a business problem  he also then supported me in a trip a reassignment to europe  i had an opportunity to go with my wife and my two young children zezas oh wow sblendorio and live in basel switzerland working for roche and that was life changing to do that in the mid to late s to have a global experience  i will never forget that and i learned a tremendous amount from that zezas wow nice to have a great mentor sblendorio yeah zezas glenn tell me about your typical day at the medicines company sblendorio there are no typical days  everybody says that  no in a growth company and i really mean they probably are very few typical days  you have your agenda for the day you have your projects for the day but when you are a growing organization every day is different it comes with different challenges zezas that’s not a bad thing sblendorio it’s not a bad thing but i think you have to be prepared for that  and whether you are a finance executive an executive in any area you have to be flexible and accommodating because if you are not being in a growth company is not the place to be as opposed to a more wellestablished mature company  so although there may be a so called typical day they’re all different and that’s what makes it fun quite honestly zezas glenn for those who aspire to become cfo or president of an organization what advice would you give them sblendorio  get to know your organization get to know your people go beyond the spreadsheet go beyond the financial reporting go out and visit customers that is a life changing no matter what the business you’re in and we happen to be in a life changing business  get out there understand your customers understand what they need understand your people your vendors understand your peers other executives that you work with  i think take with that some leadership competencies listen alignment good communication transparency  i think it’s absolutely essential that if a financial executive wants to move to president ceo coo those are some key criteria for them zezas those are great words to live by  i have one last question before we go  what does glenn sblendorio do when he is not president and cfo sblendorio  there’s no down time  i love to spend time with my family so i do that  we travel i have three children one is  one is  and one is  zezas wow sblendorio so we are all off doing different things but i like to play golf but not well but i like to play zezas you like to play not well sblendorio  yeah i think that’s the way it goes  i still play some softball and any type of sport and travel  down time is very important so i like to spend it with the family zezas glenn this has been great you’ve given us some good insight you’ve had a tremendous career  i wish you continued success and i want to thank you for appearing with us on cfo studio sblendorio  thanks for having me  i appreciate it zezas it’s been wonderful sblendorio  thanks zezas this is andrew zezas your host at cfo studio with
