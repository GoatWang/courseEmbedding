fitch affirms  classes of ford credit auto owner trust rev  business wire fitch affirms  classes of ford credit auto owner trust rev november    pm eastern standard time new yorkbusiness wireas part of its ongoing surveillance fitch ratings affirms the three outstanding classes of notes for the ford credit auto owner trust fcaot rev as follows class a at aaasf outlook stable class b at aasf outlook stable class c at asf outlook stable key rating drivers the rating affirmations reflect loss coverage levels consistent with current ratings as of the october  reporting period cumulative net losses totalled  basis points bps for rev the transaction is currently revolving and loss performance to date continues to be below fitchs initial base case loss proxy the pool composition currently is consistent with initial pool characteristics and therefore fitchs current loss proxy remains unchanged from the initial loss proxy the ratings reflect the quality of ford motor credit companys fmcc retail auto loan originations the sound financial and legal structure of the transaction and the strength of the servicing provided by fmcc rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for the transaction lower loss coverage could impact ratings and rating outlooks depending on the extent of the decline in coverage in fitchs initial review of the transaction the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to a x and x increase of fitchs base case loss expectation to date the transaction has exhibited stable performance with losses within fitchs initial expectations with rising loss coverage and multiple levels as such a material deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings use of thirdparty due
