common stocks selected according to the us high dividend strategy will constitute approximately  of the trust portfolio shares of etfs that invest substantially all of their assets in fixedincome securities will make up the remaining  of the trust portfolio the fixedincome etfs included in the portfolio invest in a wide range of debt securities rated investmentgrade through below investmentgrade highyield below investmentgrade securities or junk bonds are considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks than investmentgrade securities the fixedincome etfs included in the portfolio will invest in debt securities with shortterm mediumterm and longterm maturities typically fixedincome securities with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes finally the fixedincome etfs included in the portfolio will also invest in debt securities issued by foreign companies including companies located in emerging markets  investment summary security selection us high dividend strategy approximately  of the trust portfolio will constitute the common stocks selected according to the us high dividend strategy these stocks were selected seven business days prior to the initial date of deposit the security selection date  using the security selection rules described below security selection rules in constructing the common stock component of the trust s portfolio securities will be selected based on the following fundamentally based quantitative criteria  initial universe start with an initial universe of all securities in the russell  index as of the security selection date  rank on fundamentals rank every company identified in the initial universe against other companies in the same sector as defined by global industry classification standard gics along each of the following reported financial metrics each ranking is determined as of the security selection date using the most recently reported information and uses a scale of  through   representing the highest scoring  in the sector and  representing the lowest scoring  in the sector return on assets as provided by sp compustat and calculated as latest four quarters of reported operating income divided by the average of most recent reported total assets and year ago reported total assets earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for the latest four quarters divided by enterprise value as provided by sp compustat enterprise value is determined by adding the equity market capitalization as of the most recent closing price with the total outstanding long term and short term debt as determined by the most recently available balance sheet and then subtracting any cash and short term investments as determined by the most recently available balance sheet yearoveryear growth in sales per share as provided by sp compustat trailing yearoveryear growth is the percentage change in sales pershare for the trailing  months versus the sales pershare from the prior  months sales pershare is the trailing  months of sales from the most recent trailing quarterly or semiannual filings whichever is most current divided by the end of period reported count of common shares outstanding used to calculate basic earnings per share each financial metric will create a separate score so that every company will have three scores these three scores are averaged together to create one composite score for a company this composite score is used to rank the companies in the next step in order to determine the subuniverse of securities  define subuniverse reduce the initial universe of securities to a subuniverse that meets the following requirements with each requirement being applied independently to the investment summary  initial universe from the other requirements in this step as of the security selection date exclude the lowest ranked  of securities from the initial universe determined by the average of the three financial rankings described in step  exclude the  of the initial universe with the lowest trailing six month total return exclude securities which do not have a policy of regular periodic cash dividends quarterly semiannual or yearly or have omitted the most recent regular periodic cash dividend exclude securities with a market capitalization less than  million market capitalization is determined by the closing price as of the security selection date exclude securities with a liquidity of less than  million liquidity is determined by the median trading volume in us dollars looking back  days from the security selection date ie trading volume each day in shares multiplied by the closing price for the day as provided by factset research systems inc exclude business development companies as identified by bloomberg industry classification system subindustry exclude mortgage real estate investment trusts as identified by gics subindustry exclude securities that have a pending cash or stock merger and acquisition or bankruptcy which will lead to delisting the security such events will be determined by reviewing the announced merger and acquisition data from bloomberg exclude securities that are not one of the largest  companies of the initial universe by market capitalization per factset  selection select from the subuniverse the twentyfive top dividend yielding securities with higher rank given to larger market capitalization when yields are equal and equally weight these securities as of the security selection date so that each security represents  of the total trust portfolio selected securities must adhere to following strategy limits as of the security selection date maximum  weight in any gics sector minimum  in us incorporated companies once an investment limitation has been reached additional securities of the type that would violate the limitation will not be included in the trust and the next highest yielding security will be used please note that due to the fluctuating nature of security prices the weighting of an individual security or sector in the trust portfolio may change after the security selection date  investment summary fixedincome exchangetraded funds approximately  of the trust portfolio will constitute etfs that invest substantially all of their assets in fixedincome securities the sponsor with the assistance of gpim has selected fixedincome etfs believed to have the best potential for current income when selecting the etfs for the trust the sponsor considers a number of factors including but not limited to the size liquidity and daily trading volume the current dividend yield the strategy and investment objective the fixedincome securities held by the etf the expense ratio and the overlap of the underlying fixedincome securities held by the etfs guggenheim partners investment management llc guggenheim partners investment management llc is a

the firm with supervision of more than  billion in assets a global diversified financial services firm guggenheim partners llc office locations include new york chicago los angeles miami boston philadelphia st louis houston london dublin geneva hong kong singapore mumbai and dubai exchangetraded funds etfs are investment pools that hold securities etfs provide an efficient and relatively simple way to invest in that they offer investors the opportunity to buy and sell an entire basket of securities with a single transaction throughout the trading day etfs are often built like an index fund but trade like a stock on an exchange etfs generally offer advantages similar to those found in index funds such as low operating costs performance designed to track an index the potential for high tax efficiency and consistent investment strategies unlike conventional mutual funds etfs normally issue and redeem shares on a continuous basis at their net asset value in large specified blocks of shares known as creation units market makers large investors and institutions deal in creation units the trust will buy shares of the etf on the exchanges and will incur brokerage costs future trusts the sponsor may create future trusts that follow the same general investment strategy one such trust is expected to be available approximately three months after the trust s initial date of deposit the inception date  and upon the trust s termination if these future trusts are available you may be able to reinvest into one of the trusts at a reduced sales charge each trust is designed to be part of a longer term strategy the sponsor is also indirectly owned by guggenheim partners llc and is an affiliate of gpim investment summary  essential information as of the inception date

investments you may lose some or all of your investment in the trust no assurance can be given that the trust s investment objective will be achieved the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these securities prices can be volatile the value of your investment may fall over time market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include stock market movements purchases or sales of securities by the trust government policies litigation and changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of the securities issuer or even perceptions of the issuer units of the trust are not deposits of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency the trust invests in shares of etfs etfs are investment pools that hold other securities the etfs in the trust may be passivelymanaged index funds that seek to replicate the performance or composition of a recognized securities index etfs are subject to various risks including management s ability to meet the fund s investment objective shares  investment summary of etfs may trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of the etf shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors the underlying etf has management and operating expenses consequently you will bear not only your share of your trust s expenses but also the expenses of the underlying etfs by investing in etfs the trust incurs greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the etfs the etfs are subject to annual fees and expenses including a management fee unitholders of the trust will bear these fees in addition to the fees and expenses of the trust see fees and expenses for additional information the trust is subject to an etf s index correlation risk to the extent that an underlying etf is an index tracking etf index correlation risk is the risk that the performance of an etf will vary from the actual performance of the fund s target index known as tracking error this can happen due to fund expenses transaction costs market impact corporate actions such as mergers and spinoffs and timing variances the value of the fixedincome securities in the etfs will generally fall if interest rates in general rise typically fixedincome securities with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes the trust may be subject to greater risk of rising interest rates than would normally be the case due to the current period of historically low rates an etf or an issuer of securities held by an etf may be unwilling or unable to make principal payments andor to declare distributions in the future may call a security before its stated maturity or may reduce the level of distributions declared this may result in a reduction in the value of your units the financial condition of an etf or an issuer of securities held by an etf may worsen resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the primary offering period economic conditions may lead to limited liquidity and greater volatility the markets for fixedincome securities such as those held by certain etfs may experience periods of illiquidity and volatility general market uncertainty and consequent repricing risk have led to market imbalances of sellers and buyers which in turn have resulted in significant valuation uncertainties in a variety of fixedincome securities these conditions resulted and in many cases continue to result in greater volatility less liquidity widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency with many debt securities remaining illiquid and of uncertain value these market conditions may make valuation of some of the securities held by an etf uncertain andor result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in its holdings investment summary  certain etfs held by the trust invest in securities that are rated below investmentgrade and are considered to be junk securities below investmentgrade obligations are considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks and accordingly the risk of nonpayment or default is higher than with investmentgrade securities in addition such securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes and more likely to receive early returns of principal certain etfs held by the trust may invest in securities that are rated as investmentgrade by only one rating agency as a result such splitrated securities may have more speculative characteristics and are subject to a greater risk of default than securities rated as investmentgrade by more than one rating agency certain etfs held by the trust invest in foreign securities investment in foreign securities presents additional risk foreign risk is the risk that foreign securities will be more volatile than us securities due to such factors as adverse economic currency political social or regulatory developments in a country including government seizure of assets excessive taxation limitations on the use or transfer of assets the lack of liquidity or regulatory controls with respect to certain industries or differing legal andor accounting standards certain etfs held by the trust invest in securities issued by companies headquartered or incorporated in countries considered to be emerging markets emerging markets are generally defined as countries with low per capita income in the initial stages of their industrialization cycles risks of investing in developing or emerging countries include the possibility of investment and trading limitations liquidity concerns delays and disruptions in settlement transactions political uncertainties and dependence on international trade and development assistance companies headquartered in emerging market countries may be exposed to greater volatility and market risk certain etfs held by the trust invest in senior loans borrowers under senior loans may default on their obligations to pay principal or interest when due this nonpayment would result in a reduction of income to the applicable etf a reduction in the value of the senior loan experiencing nonpayment and a decrease in the net asset value of the etf although senior loans in which the etfs invest may be secured by specific collateral there can be no assurance that liquidation of collateral would satisfy the borrower s obligation in the event of nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest or that such collateral could be readily liquidated senior loans in which the etfs invest generally are of below investmentgrade credit or junk quality may be unrated at the time of investment may be floatingrate instruments in which the interest rate payable  investment summary on the obligations fluctuates on a periodic basis based upon changes in the base lending rate generally are not registered with the securities and exchange commission  sec  or any state securities commission and generally are not listed on any securities exchange in addition the amount of public information available on senior loans generally is less extensive than that available for other types of assets the trust invests in securities issued by midcapitalization companies and certain etfs held by the trust may invest in securities issued by smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies these securities customarily involve more investment risk than securities of largecapitalization companies smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments share prices or dividend rates on the securities in the trust may decline during the life of the trust there is no guarantee that share prices of securities in the trust will not decline and that the issuers of the securities will declare dividends in the future and if declared whether they will remain at current levels or increase over time inflation may lead to a decrease in the value of assets or income from investments the sponsor does not actively manage the portfolio the trust will generally hold and may when creating additional units continue to buy the same securities even though a security s outlook market value or yield may have changed see investment risks in part a of the prospectus and risk factors in part b of the prospectus for additional information who should invest you should consider this investment if the trust represents only a portion of your overall investment portfolio the trust is part of a longerterm investment strategy that may include the investment in subsequent portfolios if available and the trust is combined with other investment vehicles to provide diversification of method to your overall portfolio you should not consider this investment if you are uncomfortable with the trust s investment strategy you are uncomfortable with the risks of an unmanaged investment in securities or you want capital preservation investment summary  fees and expenses the amounts below are estimates of the direct and indirect fees and expenses that you may incur based on a  unit price actual expenses may vary percentage of public amount per offering  investor fees price  invested

variability of the initial sales fee each investor is obligated to pay the entire applicable maximum sales fee  the deferred sales fee is fixed at  per unit and is deducted in monthly installments of  per unit on the last business day of each month in august  and september  and  per unit on the last business day of october the percentage provided is based on a  per unit public offering price as of the inception date and the percentage amount will vary over time if units are redeemed prior to the deferred sales fee period the entire deferred sales fee will be collected  the cd fee compensates the sponsor for creating and developing your trust the actual cd fee is  per unit and is paid to the sponsor at the close of the initial offering period which is expected to be approximately three months from the inception date the percentages provided are based on a  unit as of the inception date and the percentage amount will vary over time if the unit price exceeds  per unit the cd fee will be less than  of the public offering price if the unit price is less than  per unit the cd fee will exceed  of the public offering price however in no event will the maximum sales fee exceed  of a unitholder s initial investment  based on  units with a  per unit public offering price as of the inception date  the estimated trust operating expenses are based upon an estimated trust size of approximately  million because certain of the operating expenses are fixed amounts if the trust does not reach such estimated size or falls below the estimated size over its life the actual amount of the operating expenses may exceed the amounts reflected in some cases the actual amount of the operating expenses may greatly exceed the amounts reflected other operating expenses do not include brokerage costs and other transactional fees  although not an actual trust operating expense the trust and therefore the unitholders of the trust will indirectly bear similar operating expenses of the etfs held by the trust in the estimated amount provided above estimated etf expenses are based upon the net asset value of the number of etf shares held by the trust per unit multiplied by the annual operating expenses of the etfs for the most recent fiscal year unitholders will therefore indirectly pay higher expenses than if the underlying etfs were held directly please note that the sponsor or an affiliate may be engaged as a service provider to certain etfs held by your trust and therefore certain fees paid by your trust to such etfs will be paid to the sponsor or an affiliate for its services to such etfs  investment summary example this example helps you compare the costs of this trust with other unit trusts and mutual funds in the example we assume that you reinvest your investment in a new trust every other year at a reduced sales charge the trust s operating expenses do not change and the trust s annual return is  your actual returns and expenses will vary based on these assumptions you would pay these expenses for every  you invest  year  years   years  years  these amounts are the same regardless of whether you sell your investment at the end of a period or continue to hold your investment the example does not consider any brokerage fees the trust pays or transaction fees that brokerdealers may charge for processing redemption requests see expenses of

of the securities organization costs the maximum sales fee which includes an initial sales fee a deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee and cash and other net assets in the portfolio

eastern time to give you the price for that day if we receive your order after this time you will receive the price computed on the next business day value of the securities the sponsor serves as the evaluator of the trust the evaluator  we cause the trustee to determine the value of the securities as of the close of the new york stock exchange on each day that the exchange is open the evaluation time  pricing the securities the value of securities is generally determined by using the last sale price for securities traded on a national or foreign securities exchange or the nasdaq stock market in some cases we will price a security based on the last asked or bid price in the overthecounter market or by using other recognized pricing methods we will only do this if a security is not principally traded on a national or foreign securities exchange or the nasdaq stock market or if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate if applicable the trustee or its designee will value foreign securities primarily traded on foreign exchanges at their fair value which may be other than their market prices if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate the trustee determined the initial prices of the securities shown in trust portfolio for your trust in this prospectus such prices were determined as described above at the close of the new york stock exchange on the

expenses of the trust in part b of the prospectus and in fees and expenses in part a of the prospectus initial sales fee based on a  unit the initial sales fee is initially  of the public offering

provide an efficient and relatively simple way to invest in that they offer investors the opportunity to buy and sell an entire basket of securities with a single transaction throughout the trading day etfs are often built like an index fund but trade like a stock on an exchange etfs generally offer advantages similar to those found in index funds such as low operating costs performance designed to track an index the potential for high tax efficiency and consistent investment strategies unlike conventional mutual funds etfs normally issue and redeem shares on a continuous basis at their net asset value in large specified blocks of shares known as creation units market makers large investors and institutions deal in creation units the trust will buy shares of the etf on the exchanges and will incur brokerage costs future trusts the sponsor may create future trusts that follow the same investment strategy one such trust is expected to be available approximately three months after the initial date of deposit the inception date if these future trusts are available you may be able to reinvest into one of the trusts at a reduced sales charge each trust is designed to be part of a

investment all accounts  unit  principal risks as with all investments you may lose some or all of your investment in the trust no assurance can be given that the trusts investment objective will be achieved the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these o securities prices can be volatile the value of your investment may fall over time market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include stock market movements purchases or sales of securities by the trust government policies litigation and changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of the securities issuer or even perceptions of the issuer units of the trust are not deposits of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency o the trust and certain closedend funds held by the trust invest in mlps mlps are limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are taxed as partnerships and whose interests limited partnership units or limited liability company units are traded on securities exchanges like shares of common stock currently most mlps operate in the energy natural resources or real estate sectors investments in mlp interests are subject to the risks generally applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors including commodity pricing risk supply and demand risk depletion risk and exploration risk the benefit the trust derives from its investment in mlps is largely dependent on their being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes as a partnership an mlp has no income tax liability at the entity level if as a result of a change in an mlps business an mlp were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes such mlp would be obligated to pay federal income tax on its income at the applicable corporate tax rate if an mlp was classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes the amount of cash available for distribution with respect to its units would be reduced and any such distributions received by the trust would be taxed entirely as dividend income if paid out of the earnings of the mlp therefore treatment of an mlp as a corporation for federal income tax purposes would result in a material reduction in the aftertax return to the trust likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of the units of the trust o the trust is concentrated in the energy sector and certain closedend funds held by the trust include securities issued by companies in the energy sector as a result the factors that impact the energy sector will likely have a greater effect on this trust than on a more broadly diversified trust companies in the energy sector are subject to volatile fluctuations in price and supply of energy fuels and can be impacted by international politics and conflicts including the unrest in iraq and hostilities in the middle east terrorist attacks the success of exploration projects reduced demand as a result of increases in energy efficiency and energy conservation natural disasters cleanup and litigation costs associated with environmental damage and extensive regulation o the trust invests and certain closedend funds held by the trust may invest in securities issued by smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies these securities customarily involve more investment risk than securities of largecapitalization companies smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments o the trust includes closedend funds closedend funds are actively managed investment companies that invest in various types of securities closedend funds issue common shares that are traded on a securities exchange closedend funds are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the closedend funds investment objective and to manage the closedend funds portfolio during periods of market turmoil and as investors perceptions regarding closedend funds or their underlying investments change closedend funds are not redeemable at the option of the shareholder and they may trade in the market at a discount to their net asset value closedend funds may also employ the use of leverage which increases risk and volatility instability in the auction rate preferred shares market may affect the volatility of closedend funds that use such instruments to provide leverage o the trust includes an etf etfs are investment pools that hold other securities etfs are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the funds investment objective shares of etfs may trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of the etf shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors the underlying etf has management and operating expenses consequently you will bear not only your share of the trusts expenses but also the expenses of the underlying etf by investing in an etf the trust incurs greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the etf o the trust is subject to an etfs index correlation risk to the extent that an underlying etf is an index tracking etf index correlation risk is the risk that the performance of an etf will vary from the actual performance of the funds target index known as tracking error this can happen due to fund expenses transaction costs market impact corporate actions such as mergers and spinoffs and timing variances o the etf and closedend funds are subject to annual fees and expenses including a management fee unitholders of the trust will bear these fees in addition to the fees and expenses of the trust see fees and expenses for additional information o the value of the fixedincome securities in the closedend funds will generally fall if interest rates in general rise typically fixedincome securities with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes o a closedend fund etf or an issuer of securities held by a closedend fund or etf may be unwilling or unable to make principal payments andor to declare distributions in the future may call a security before its stated maturity or may reduce the level of distributions declared this may result in a reduction in the value of your units o the financial condition of a closedend fund etf or an issuer of securities held by a closedend fund or etf may worsen resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the primary offering period o share prices or dividend rates on the securities in the trust may decline during the life of the trust there is no guarantee that share prices of the securities in the trust will not decline and that the issuers of the securities will declare dividends in the future and if declared whether they will remain at current levels or increase over time o inflation may lead to a decrease in the value of assets or income from investments o the sponsor does not actively manage the portfolio the trust will generally hold and may when creating additional units continue to buy the same securities even though a securitys outlook market value or yield may have changed see investment risks in part a of the prospectus and risk factors in part b of the prospectus for additional information who should invest you should consider this investment if o the trust represents only a portion of your overall investment portfolio o the trust is part of a longerterm investment strategy that may include investment in subsequent portfolios if available and o the trust is combined with other investment vehicles to provide diversification of method to your overall portfolio you should not consider this investment if o you are uncomfortable with the trusts investment strategy o you are uncomfortable with the risks of an unmanaged investment in securities or o you are seeking capital preservation as a primary investment objective fees and expenses the amounts below are estimates of the direct and indirect expenses that you may incur based on a  unit price actual expenses may vary percentage of public amount per offering  investor fees price  invested    initial sales fee paid on purchase    deferred sales fee    creation and development fee      maximum sales fees including creation and development fee     estimated organization costs amount per  units paid by the trust at the end of the initial offering period or after six months at the discretion of the sponsor   approximate annual fund  of public operating offering amount per expenses price   units    trustees fee    sponsors supervisory fee   evaluators fee   bookkeeping and administrative fee   estimated other trust operating expenses    estimated closedend fund expenses      total      the initial sales fee provided above is based on the unit price on the inception date because the initial sales fee equals the difference between the maximum sales fee and the sum of the remaining deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee cd fee as described below the percentage and dollar amount of the initial sales fee will vary as the unit price varies and after deferred fees begin despite the variability of the initial sales fee each investor is obligated to pay the entire applicable maximum sales fee  the deferred sales fee is fixed at  per unit and is deducted in monthly installments of  per unit on the last business day of september  and october  and  per unit on the last business day of november  the percentage provided is based on a  per unit public offering price as of the inception date and the percentage amount will vary over time if units are redeemed prior to the deferred sales fee period the entire deferred sales fee will be collected  the cd fee compensates the sponsor for creating and developing your trust the actual cd fee is  per unit and is paid to the sponsor at the close of the initial offering period which is expected to be approximately three months from the inception date the percentages provided are based on a  unit as of the inception date and the percentage amount will vary over time if the unit price exceeds  per unit the cd fee will be less than  of the public offering price if the unit price is less than  per unit the cd fee will exceed  of the public offering price however in no event will the maximum sales fee exceed  of a unitholders initial investment  based on  units with a  per unit public offering price as of the inception date  the estimated trust operating expenses are based upon an estimated trust size of approximately  million because certain of the operating expenses are fixed amounts if the trust does not reach such estimated size or falls below the estimated size over its life the actual amount of the operating expenses may exceed the amounts reflected in some cases the actual amount of the operating expenses may greatly exceed the amounts reflected other operating expenses do not include brokerage costs and other transactional fees  although not an actual trust operating expense the trust and therefore the unitholders of the trust will indirectly bear similar operating expenses of the closedend funds and etf held by the trust in the estimated amount provided above estimated closedend fund and etf expenses are based upon the net asset value of the number of closedend fund and etf shares held by the trust per unit multiplied by the annual operating expenses of the closedend funds and etf for the most recent fiscal year unitholders will therefore indirectly pay higher expenses than if the underlying closedend funds and etf were held directly please note that the sponsor or an affiliate may be engaged as a service provider to certain closedend funds and etf held by your trust and therefore certain fees paid by your trust to such closedend funds and etf will be paid to the sponsor or an affiliate for its services to such closedend funds and etf example this example helps you compare the costs of this trust with other unit trusts and mutual funds in the example we assume that you reinvest your investment in a new trust every other year at a reduced sales charge the trusts operating expenses do not change and the trusts annual return is  your actual returns and expenses will vary based on these assumptions you would pay these expenses for every  you invest  year    years   years   years  these amounts are the same regardless of whether you sell your investment at the end of a period or continue to hold your investment the example does not consider any brokerage fees or transaction fees that brokerdealers

receive your order to buy units prior to the close of the new york stock exchange normally  pm eastern time to give you the price for that day if we receive your order after this time you will receive the price computed on the next business day value of the securities the sponsor serves as the evaluator of the trust the evaluator we cause the trustee to determine the value of the securities as of the close of the new york stock exchange on each day that the exchange is open the evaluation time pricing the securities the value of securities is generally determined by using the last sale price for securities traded on a national or foreign securities exchange or the nasdaq stock market in some cases we will price a security based on the last asked or bid price in the overthecounter market or by using other recognized pricing methods we will only do this if a security is not principally traded on a national or foreign securities exchange or the nasdaq stock market or if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate if applicable the trustee or its designee will value foreign securities traded on foreign exchanges at their fair value which may be other than their market prices if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate the trustee determined the initial prices of the securities shown in trust portfolio for your trust in this prospectus such prices were determined as described above at the close of the new york stock exchange on the business day before the date of this prospectus on the first day we sell units we will compute the unit price as of the close of the new york stock exchange or the time the registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission becomes effective if later organization costs during the initial offering

to reimburse us for these costs at the end of the initial offering period or after six months at the discretion of the sponsor organization costs will not exceed the estimate set forth under fees and expenses transactional sales fee you pay a fee when you buy units we refer to this fee as the transactional sales fee the transactional sales fee has both an initial and a deferred component and is  of the public offering price based on a  unit this percentage amount of the transactional sales fee is based on the unit price on the inception date because the transactional sales fee equals the difference between the maximum sales fee and the cd fee the percentage and dollar amount of the transactional sales fee will vary as the unit price varies the transactional sales fee does not include the cd fee which is described under expenses of the trust in part b of the prospectus and in fees and expenses in part a of the prospectus initial sales fee based on a  unit the initial sales fee is initially  of the public offering price the initial sales fee which you will pay at the time of purchase is equal to the difference between the maximum sales fee  of the public offering price and the sum of the maximum remaining deferred sales fees and the cd fee initially  per unit the dollar amount and percentage amount of the initial sales fee will vary over time deferred sales fee we defer payment of the rest of the transactional sales fee through the deferred sales fee  per unit you pay any remaining deferred sales fee when you sell or redeem units the trust may sell securities to meet the trusts obligations with respect to the deferred sales fee thus no assurance can be given that the trust will retain its present size and composition for any length of time in limited circumstances and only if deemed in the best interests of unitholders the sponsor may delay the payment of the deferred sales fee from the dates listed under fees and expenses reducing your sales fee we offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the maximum sales fee you pay it is your financial professionals responsibility to alert us of any discount when you order units since the deferred sales fee and the

period sales during volume calendar quarter concession   but less than  million   million but less than  million   million but less than  million   million or more  eligible unit trusts include all guggenheim funds unit trusts sold in the primary market redemptions of units during the primary offering period will reduce the amount of units used to calculate the volume concessions in addition dealer firms will not receive volume concessions on the sale of units which are not subject to a transactional sales fee however such sales will be included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level breakpoints for volume concessions guggenheim funds reserves the right to modify or terminate the volume concession program at any time the sponsor may also pay to certain dealers an administrative fee for information or service used in connection with the distribution of trust units such amounts will be in addition to any concessions received for the sale of units in addition to the concessions described above the sponsor may pay additional compensation out of its own assets to brokerdealers that meet certain sales targets and that have agreed to provide services relating to the trust to their customers other compensation and benefits to brokerdealers the sponsor at its own expense and out of its own profits may provide additional compensation and benefits to brokerdealers who sell shares of units of this trust and other guggenheim funds products this compensation is intended to result in additional sales of guggenheim funds products andor compensate

or type of services provided by the intermediary the level or expected level of sales of guggenheim funds products by the intermediary or its agents the placing of guggenheim funds products on a preferred or recommended product list access to an intermediarys personnel and other factors the sponsor makes these payments for marketing promotional or related expenses including but not limited to expenses of entertaining retail customers and financial advisers advertising sponsorship of events or seminars obtaining information about the breakdown of unit sales among an intermediarys representatives or offices obtaining shelf space in brokerdealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale of the sponsors products the sponsor may make such payments to many intermediaries that sell guggenheim funds products the sponsor may also make certain payments to or on behalf of intermediaries to defray a portion of their costs incurred for the purpose of facilitating unit sales such as the costs of developing trading or purchasing trading systems to process unit trades payments of such additional compensation some of which may be characterized as revenue sharing may create an incentive for financial intermediaries and their agents to sell or recommend a guggenheim funds product including the trust over products offered by other sponsors or fund companies these arrangements will not change the price you pay for your units we generally register units for sale in various states in the united states we do not register units for sale in any foreign country it is your financial professionals responsibility to make sure that units are registered or exempt from registration if you are a foreign investor or if you want to buy units in another country this prospectus does not constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be offered or sold lawfully we may reject any order for units in whole or in part we may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary market due to fluctuations in unit prices the gain or loss is equal to the difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or redeem them we may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to create units for example we lost the amount set forth in trust portfolio on the initial deposit of

for example this could happen as a result of a merger or similar transaction involving a company whose security is in your portfolio in addition your trust may pay a special distribution in order to maintain the qualification of the trust as a regulated investment company or to provide funds to make any distribution for a taxable year in order to avoid imposition of any income or excise tax on

audited financial statements for your trust if available see administration of the trust in part b of the prospectus for additional information investment risks all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of the securities in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest you could lose some or all of your investment in the trust recently equity markets have experienced significant volatility if the value of the securities falls the value of your units will also fall we cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security in the trust the trust itself or securities in general may fall in value market value may be affected by a variety of factors including o general securities markets movements o changes in the financial condition of an issuer or a sector o changes in perceptions about an issuer or a sector o interest rates and inflation o governmental policies and litigation and o purchases and sales of securities by the trust even though we carefully supervise the portfolio you should remember that we do not manage the portfolio your trust will not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund master limited partnership risk the trust and certain closed end funds held by the trust invest in mlps mlps are limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are taxed as partnerships and whose interests limited partnership units or limited liability company units are traded on securities exchanges like shares of common stock an mlp consists of a general partner and limited partners the general partner manages the partnership has an ownership stake in the partnership and is eligible to receive an incentive distribution the limited partners provide capital to the partnership have a limited if any role in the operation and management of the partnership and receive cash distributions the trusts investment in securities of mlps which are required to distribute substantially all of their income to investors in order to not be subject to entity level taxation often offer a yield advantage over other types of securities currently most mlps operate in the energy natural resources or real estate sectors investments in mlp interests are subject to the risks generally applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors including commodity pricing risk supply and demand risk depletion risk and exploration risk there are certain tax risks associated with mlps including the risk that us taxing authorities could challenge the trusts treatment for federal income tax purposes of the mlps in which the trust invests these tax risks and any adverse determination with respect thereto could have a negative impact on the aftertax income available for distribution by the mlps andor the value of the trusts investments the benefit the trust derives from its investment in mlps is largely dependent on their being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes as a partnership an mlp has no income tax liability at the entity level if as a result of a change in an mlps business an mlp were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes such mlp would be obligated to pay federal income tax on its income at the applicable corporate tax rate if an mlp was classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes the amount of cash available for distribution with respect to its units would be reduced and any such distributions received by the trust would be taxed entirely as dividend income if paid out of the earnings of the mlp therefore treatment of an mlp as a corporation for federal income tax purposes would result in a material reduction in the aftertax return to the trust likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of the units of the trust energy sector risk the trust is concentrated in the energy sector and certain closedend funds held by the trust include securities issued by companies in the energy sector as a result the factors that impact the energy sector will likely have a greater effect on this trust than on a more broadly diversified trust some of the risks associated with the energy sector are listed below companies in the energy sector include but are not limited to companies that explore for produce refine distribute or sell petroleum gas products or consumable fuels or provide parts or services to petroleum gas or consumable fuel companies companies in this sector are subject to volatile fluctuations in price and supply of energy fuels and can be impacted by international politics including the unrest in iraq and hostilities in the middle east terrorist attacks reduced demand as a result of increases in energy efficiency and energy conservation the success of exploration projects cleanup and litigation costs relating to oil spills and environmental damage and tax and other regulatory policies of various governments natural disasters such as the hurricanes in the gulf of mexico will also impact companies in the energy sector oil production and refining companies are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding air emissions and the disposal of hazardous materials in addition declines in us and russian crude oil production will likely lead to a greater world dependence on oil from opec nations which may result in more volatile oil prices smallcapitalization and midcapitalization company risk the trust includes and certain closedend funds held by the trust may include securities issued by smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies these securities customarily involve more investment risk than largecapitalization companies these additional risks are due in part to the following factors smallcapitalization and midcapitalization companies may o have limited product lines markets or financial resources o be new and developing companies which seek to develop and utilize new andor emerging technologies these technologies may be slow to develop or fail to develop altogether o have less publicly available information o lack management depth or experience o be less liquid o be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments and o be dependent upon products that were recently brought to market or key personnel closedend fund risk the trust invests in closedend funds closedend funds are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the closedend funds investment objective and to manage the closedend funds portfolio during periods of market turmoil and as investors perceptions regarding closedend funds or their underlying investments change shares of closedend funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of closedend fund shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors certain closedend funds included in your trust may employ the use of leverage in their portfolios through the issuance of preferred stock while leverage often serves to increase the yield of a closedend fund this leverage also subjects the closedend fund to increased risks including the likelihood of increased volatility and the possibility that the closedend funds common share income will fall if the dividend rate on the preferred shares or the interest rate on any borrowings rises instability in the auction rate preferred shares market may affect the volatility of closedend funds that use such instruments to provide leverage in addition closedend funds are subject to their own annual fees and expenses including a management fee such fees reduce the potential benefits associated with owning a closedend fund and are in addition to your trusts expenses exchangetraded funds risk the trust invests in shares of an etf which are investment pools that hold other securities etfs are usually passivelymanaged index funds that seek to replicate the performance or composition of a recognized securities index etfs are either openend management investment companies or unit investment trusts registered under the investment company act of  as amended unlike mutual funds or unit investment trusts etfs generally do not sell or redeem their individual shares at net asset value etfs generally sell and redeem shares in large blocks often referred to as creation units however the sponsor does not intend to sell or redeem etfs in this manner shares of etfs are listed on securities exchanges for trading which allows investors to purchase and sell individual etf shares at current market prices throughout the day the trust will purchase and sell etf shares on these securities exchanges etfs therefore possess characteristics of traditional openend mutual funds and unit investment trusts which issue redeemable shares and of corporate common stocks or closedend funds which generally issue shares that trade at negotiated prices on securities exchanges and are not redeemable etfs are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the funds investment objective the trust is also subject to the risks to which the underlying etfs may be subject as well as management and operating expenses you will bear not only your share of your trusts expenses but also the expenses of the etfs by investing in the etfs the trust incurs greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the etfs shares of etfs may trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of the etf shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors index correlation risk index correlation risk is the risk that the performance of the indextracking etf will vary from the actual performance of the funds target index known as tracking error this can happen due to fund expenses transaction costs market impact corporate actions such as mergers and spinoffs and timing variances some etfs use a technique called representative sampling which means that the etf invests in a representative sample of securities in its target index rather than all of the index securities the use of representative sampling could increase the risk of a tracking error interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the value of securities held by a closedend fund or etf in your trust will decline in value because of a rise in interest rates generally securities that pay fixed rates of return will increase in value when interest rates decline and decrease in value when interest rates rise typically securities that pay fixed rates of return with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes credit and dividend payment risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security held by the trust or a closedend fund or etf in your trust is unable or unwilling to make dividend andor principal payments highyield or junk securities that are rated below investmentgrade are generally more susceptible to this risk than investmentgrade securities call risk call risk is the risk that securities held by a closedend fund or etf in your trust can be prepaid or called by the issuer before their stated maturity if securities are called your income will decline and you may not be able to reinvest the money you receive at as high a yield also an early call at par of a security trading at a premium will reduce your return securities held by a closedend fund or etf in your trust are more likely to be called when interest rates decline this would result in early returns of principal to the closedend funds or etf in your trust the securities may also be subject to special or extraordinary call provisions and mandatory put features that may cause the securities to be removed from a fund prior to maturity or stated call dates highyield or junk securities that are rated below investmentgrade are generally more susceptible to this risk than investmentgrade securities security quality risk security quality risk is the risk that a reduction in a securitys rating may decrease its value the value of a closedend fund and the value of your investment in your trust securities ratings may be reduced at any time including during the primary offering period of your trust splitratings risk splitrated securities are those securities that at the time of investment are rated below investmentgrade by one rating agency so long as at least one other rating agency rates such securities within the four highest grades ie investmentgrade quality this means that a splitrated security may be regarded by one rating agency as having predominately speculative characteristics with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal and accordingly subject to a greater risk of default the prices of splitrated securities in the view of one but not all rating agencies may be more sensitive than securities without a splitrating to negative developments such as a decline in the issuers revenues or a general economic downturn pfic risk your trust may invest in companies that are considered to be pfics in general pfics are certain nonus corporations that receive at least  of their annual gross income from passive sources such as interest dividends certain rents and royalties or capital gains or that hold at least  of their assets in investments producing such passive income as a result of an investment in pfics your trust could be subject to us federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those securities even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its unitholders your trust will not be able to pass through to its unitholders any credit or deduction for such taxes your trust may be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences in this case your trust would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such pfic shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income under this election your trust might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions from pfics and its proceeds from dispositions of pfic stock during that year and such income would nevertheless be subject to the distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the  excise tax dividends paid by pfics will not be treated as qualified dividend income litigation and legislation risk your trust is also subject to litigation and legislation risk from time to time various legislative initiatives are proposed in the united states and abroad which may have a negative impact on certain of the companies represented in the trust in addition litigation regarding any of the issuers of the securities or of the sectors represented by these issuers may raise potential bankruptcy concerns and may negatively impact the share prices of these securities we cannot predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation or any bankruptcy concerns will have on the share prices of the securities inflation risk inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money significant unitholders risk there may be unitholders of the trust who hold a significant portion of the trust and as result a redemption by such significant holder may have a material impact on the size expenses and viability of the trust see risk factors in part b of the prospectus for additional information how the trust works your trust your trust is a unit investment trust registered

may not be able to vote the securities in your trust that are traded on foreign exchanges in the event that an issuer of any of the securities in the trust offers to issue new securities or to exchange securities for trust securities the trustee will at the direction of the sponsor accept or reject such offer or vote for or against any offer for new or exchanged securities or property in

transactions and brokerage allocation  purchase redemption and pricing of units  taxes  experts  description of ratings  general information each trust is one of a series of separate unit investment trusts created under the name guggenheim defined portfolios and registered under the investment company act of  and the securities act of  each trust was created as a common law trust on the inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of new york each trust was created under a trust agreement among guggenheim funds distributors llc as sponsor evaluator and supervisor and the bank of new york mellon as trustee when your trust was created the sponsor delivered to the trustee securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the trust after your trust is created the sponsor may deposit additional securities in the trust contracts to purchase additional securities along with cash or a bank letter of credit in lieu of cash to pay for such contracted securities or cash including a letter of credit with instructions to purchase additional securities such additional deposits will be in amounts which will seek to replicate as closely as practicable the portfolio immediately prior to such deposits if the sponsor deposits cash existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust will pay the associated brokerage fees a trust consists of i the securities listed under trust portfolio in the prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust ii any additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions of the trust agreement and iii any cash held in the accounts of the trust neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of the securities however should any contract for the purchase of any of the securities initially deposited in a trust fail the sponsor will unless substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement refund the cash and sales charge attributable to such failed contract to all unitholders on the next distribution date investment policies the trust is a unit investment trust and is not an actively managed fund traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic financial and market analysis the portfolio of a trust however will not be actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio unitholders will not be able to dispose of or vote any of the securities in a trust as the holder of the securities the trustee will vote the securities and will endeavor to vote the securities such that the securities are voted as closely as possible in the same manner and the same general proportion as are the securities held by owners other than such trust however the trustee may not be able to vote the securities in a trust that are traded on foreign exchanges the trust agreement provides that the sponsor may but need not direct the trustee to dispose of a security in certain events such as the issuer having defaulted on the payment on any of its outstanding obligations the issuer having qualified as a passive foreign investment company under the internal revenue code or the price of a security has declined to such an extent or other such credit factors exist so that in the opinion of the sponsor the retention of such securities would be detrimental to the trust if a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger or acquisition has been announced affecting a security the trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer for cash if the supervisor determines that the sale or tender is in the best interest of unitholders the trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to unitholders pursuant to the trust agreement and with limited exceptions the trustee may sell any securities or other properties acquired in exchange for securities such as those acquired in connection with a merger or other transaction if offered such new or exchanged securities or property other than cash the trustee shall reject the offer however in the event such securities or property are nonetheless acquired by the trust they may be accepted for deposit in a trust and either sold by the trustee or held in a trust pursuant to the direction of the sponsor proceeds from the sale of securities or any securities or other property received by the trust in exchange for securities are credited to the capital account for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions except as stated in the trust agreement or in the prospectus the acquisition by the trust of any securities other than the portfolio securities is prohibited the trustee may sell securities designated by the sponsor from the trust for the purpose of redeeming units of a trust tendered for redemption and the payment of expenses and for such other purposes as permitted under the trust agreement notwithstanding the foregoing the trustee is authorized to reinvest any funds held in the capital or income accounts pending distribution in us treasury obligations which mature on or before the next applicable distribution date any obligations so acquired must be held until they mature and proceeds therefrom may not be reinvested proceeds from the sale of securities or any securities or other property received by a trust in exchange for securities are credited to the capital account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions except for failed securities and as provided in the prospectus or in the trust agreement the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the portfolio securities is prohibited the trustee may sell securities from a trust for limited purposes including redeeming units tendered for redemption and the payment of expenses risk factors stocks an investment in units of a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an investment in equity securities including the risk that the financial condition of issuers of the securities may become impaired or that the general condition of the stock market may worsen both of which may contribute directly to a decrease in the value of the securities and thus in the value of the units or the risk that holders of common stock have a right to receive payments from the issuers of those stocks that is generally inferior to that of creditors of or holders of debt obligations issued by the issuers and that the rights of holders of common stock generally rank inferior to the rights of holders of preferred stock you could lose some or all of your investment in the trust common stocks are especially susceptible to general stock market movements and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of the issuers change these perceptions are based on unpredictable factors including expectations regarding government economic monetary and fiscal policies inflation and interest rates economic expansion or contraction and global or regional political economic or banking crises holders of common stock incur more risk than the holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations because common stockholders as owners of the entity have generally inferior rights to receive payments from the issuer in comparison with the rights of creditors of or holders of debt obligations or preferred stock issued by the issuer holders of common stock of the type held by a trust have a right to receive dividends only when and if and in the amounts declared by the issuers board of directors and to participate in amounts available for distribution by the issuer only after all other claims on the issuer have been paid or provided for by contrast holders of preferred stock have the right to receive dividends at a fixed rate when and as declared by the issuers board of directors normally on a cumulative basis but do not participate in other amounts available for distribution by the issuing corporation cumulative preferred stock dividends must be paid before common stock dividends and any cumulative preferred stock dividend omitted is added to future dividends payable to the holders of cumulative preferred stock preferred stocks are also entitled to rights on liquidation which are senior to those of common stocks moreover common stocks do not represent an obligation of the issuer and therefore do not offer any assurance of income or provide the degree of protection of capital debt securities indeed the issuance of debt securities or even preferred stock will create prior claims for payment of principal interest liquidation preferences and dividends which could adversely affect the ability and inclination of the issuer to declare or pay dividends on its common stock or the rights of holders of common stock with respect to assets of the issuer upon liquidation or bankruptcy further unlike debt securities which typically have a stated principal amount payable at maturity whose value however will be subject to market fluctuations prior thereto common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity and have values which are subject to market fluctuations for as long as the stocks remain outstanding the value of the securities in a portfolio thus may be expected to fluctuate over the entire life of a trust to values higher or lower than those prevailing at the time of purchase the sponsors buying and selling of the securities especially during the initial offering of units of the trust or to satisfy redemptions of units may impact upon the value of the underlying securities and the units the publication of the list of the securities selected for the trust may also cause increased buying activity in certain of the stocks comprising the portfolio after such announcement investment advisory and brokerage clients of the sponsor and its affiliates may purchase individual securities appearing on the list during the course of the initial offering period or may purchase warrants issued by the sponsor or its affiliates which are based on the performance of the securities on the list the sponsor or its affiliates may also purchase securities as a hedge against its risk on the warrants although generally the sponsor and its affiliates will not purchase securities for their own account until after the trust portfolio has been acquired such buying activity in the stock of these companies or issuance of the warrants prior to the purchase of the securities by the trust may cause the trust to purchase stocks at a higher price than those buyers who effect purchases by the trust fixed portfolio investors should be aware that the trust is not managed and as a result the adverse financial condition of a company will not result in the elimination of its securities from the portfolio of the trust except under extraordinary circumstances investors should note in particular that the securities were selected on the basis of the criteria set forth in the prospectus and that the trust may continue to purchase or hold securities originally selected through this process even though the evaluation of the attractiveness of the securities may have changed a number of the securities in the trust may also be owned by other clients of the sponsor however because these clients may have differing investment objectives the sponsor may sell certain securities from those accounts in instances where a sale by the trust would be impermissible such as to maximize return by taking advantage of market fluctuations in the event a public tender offer is made for a security or a merger or acquisition is announced affecting a security the sponsor may instruct the trustee to tender or sell the security on the open market when in its opinion it is in the best interest of the unitholders of the unit to do so although the portfolio is regularly reviewed and evaluated and the sponsor may instruct the trustee to sell securities under certain limited circumstances securities will not be sold by the trust to take advantage of market fluctuations or changes in anticipated rates of appreciation as a result the amount realized upon the sale of the securities may not be the highest price attained by an individual security during the life of the trust the prices of single shares of each of the securities in the trust vary widely and the effect of a dollar of fluctuation either higher or lower in stock prices will be much greater as a percentage of the lowerprice stocks purchase price than as a percentage of the higherprice stocks purchase price closedend fund risks if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust may invest in the common stock of closedend funds closedend funds closedend funds are actively managed investment companies which invest in various types of securities closedend funds issue shares of common stock that are traded on a securities exchange closedend funds are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the closedend funds investment objective and to manage the closedend fund portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil and as investors perceptions regarding closedend funds or their underlying investments change shares of closedend funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of closedend fund shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors certain of the closedend funds included in a trust may employ the use of leverage in their portfolios through the issuance of preferred stock while leverage often serves to increase the yield of a closedend fund this leverage also subjects the closedend fund to increased risks including the likelihood of increased volatility and the possibility that the closedend funds common share income will fall if the dividend rate on the preferred shares or the interest rate on any borrowings rises exchangetraded fund risks if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust may invest in the common stock of exchangetraded funds etfs etfs are investment pools that hold other securities etfs are either openend management investment companies or unit investment trusts registered under the investment company act of  unlike typical openend funds or unit investment trusts etfs generally do not sell or redeem their individual shares at net asset value in addition securities exchanges list etf shares for trading which allows investors to purchase and sell individual etf shares at current market prices throughout the day etfs therefore possess characteristics of traditional openend funds and unit investment trusts which issue redeemable shares and of corporate common stocks or closedend funds which generally issue shares that trade at negotiated prices on securities exchanges and are not redeemable etfs are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the funds investment objective the underlying etf has management and operating expenses you will bear not only your share of the trusts expenses but also the expenses of the underlying etf by investing in an etf the trust incurs greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the etf shares of etfs may trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of the etf shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors market discounts or premiums certain of the securities may have been deposited at a market discount or premium principally because their dividend rates are lower or higher than prevailing rates on comparable securities the current returns of market discount securities are lower than comparably rated securities selling at par because discount securities tend to increase in market value as they approach maturity the current returns of market premium securities are higher than comparably rated securities selling at par because premium securities tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity because part of the purchase price is returned through current income payments and not at maturity an early redemption at par of a premium security will result in a reduction in yield to the trust market premium or discount attributable to dividend rate changes does not indicate market confidence or lack of confidence in the issue liquidity whether or not the securities are listed on a national securities exchange the principal trading market for the securities may be in the overthecounter market as a result the existence of a liquid trading market for the securities may depend on whether dealers will make a market in the securities there can be no assurance that a market will be made for any of the securities that any market for the securities will be maintained or of the liquidity of the securities in any markets made in addition a trust is restricted under the investment company act of  from selling securities to the sponsor the price at which the securities may be sold to meet redemptions and the value of a trust will be adversely affected if trading markets for the securities are limited or absent additional deposits the trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of additional securities or cash including a letter of credit with instructions to purchase additional securities in such trust and the issuance of a corresponding number of additional units if the sponsor deposits cash existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the securities and because a trust will pay the associated brokerage fees to minimize this effect the trusts will attempt to purchase the securities as close to the evaluation time or as close to the evaluation prices as possible some of the securities may have limited trading volume the trustee with directions from the sponsor will endeavor to purchase securities with deposited cash as soon as practicable reserving the right to purchase those securities over the  business days following each deposit in an effort to reduce the effect of these purchases on the market price of those stocks this could however result in the trusts failure to participate in any appreciation of those stocks before the cash is invested if any cash remains at the end of this period and such date is within the day period following the inception date and cannot be invested in one or more stocks at what the sponsor considers reasonable prices it intends to use that cash to purchase each of the other securities in the original proportionate relationship among those securities similarly at termination of the trust the sponsor reserves the right to sell securities over a period of up to nine business days to lessen the impact of its sales on the market price of the securities the proceeds received by unitholders following termination of the trust will reflect the actual sales proceeds received on the securities which will likely differ from the closing sale price on the termination date litigation and legislation at any time litigation may be initiated on a variety of grounds or legislation may be enacted with respect to the securities in a trust or the issuers of the securities there can be no assurance that future litigation or legislation will not have a material adverse effect on the trust or will not impair the ability of issuers to achieve their business goals financial sector risks if set forth in part a of the prospectus certain of the issuers of securities in a trust may be involved in the financial sector an investment in units of a trust containing securities of such issuers should be made with an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the financial sector in general banks thrifts and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets in commercial and residential real estate loans or any particular segment or industry and competition from new entrants in their fields of business banks and thrifts are highly dependent on net interest margin banks and thrifts traditionally receive a significant portion of their revenues from consumer mortgage fee income as a result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets banks thrifts and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and when such institutions are statechartered to state regulation as well such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks and thrifts may pursue furthermore bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund regulatory actions such as increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and thrifts and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the fdic can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a company to pay dividends neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental regulations however insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their holding companies or insures against any risk of investment in the securities issued by such institutions the statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks thrifts and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone substantial change in the recent past the securities and exchange commission and the financial accounting standards board fasb require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring marktomarket accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts or available for sale adoption of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported health of the industry and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems accounting standards codification  fair value measurements and disclosures changed the requirements of marktomarket accounting and determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability has significantly decreased these changes and other potential changes in financial accounting rules and valuation techniques may have a significant impact on the banking and financial services industries in terms of accurately pricing assets or liabilities additional legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming for example the bank regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws rules and regulations and there can be no certainty as to the effect if any that such changes would have on the securities in a trusts portfolio in addition from time to time the deposit insurance system is reviewed by congress and federal regulators and proposed reforms of that system could among other things further restrict the ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks or change the dollar amount or number of deposits insured for any depositor on october   eesa increased the maximum amount of federal deposit insurance coverage payable as to any certificate of deposit from  to  per depositor the impact of this reform is unknown and could reduce profitability as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits the sponsor makes no prediction as to what if any manner of bank and thrift regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such actions might have on a trusts portfolio the federal bank holding company act of  bhc act generally prohibits a bank holding company from i acquiring directly or indirectly more than  of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company ii acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company iii acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank or iv merging or consolidating with another bank holding company without first obtaining frb approval in considering an application with respect to any such transaction the frb is required to consider a variety of factors including the potential anticompetitive effects of the transaction the financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting institutions the managerial resources of the resulting institution the convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve the record of performance of each combining organization under the community reinvestment act and the equal credit opportunity act and the prospective availability to the frb of information appropriate to determine ongoing regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws in addition the federal change in bank control act and various state laws impose limitations on the ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks or bank holding companies the frb has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies in which the frb expressed its view that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that would weaken its financial health such as by borrowing the frb also may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of certain applications including applications for approval of mergers and acquisitions the sponsor makes no prediction as to the effect if any such laws will have on the securities in a trust or whether such approvals if necessary will be obtained companies engaged in investment bankingbrokerage and investment management include brokerage firms brokerdealers investment banks finance companies and mutual fund companies earnings and share prices of companies in this industry are quite volatile and often exceed the volatility levels of the market as a whole negative economic events in the credit markets have led some firms to declare bankruptcy forced shortnotice sales to competing firms or required government intervention by the fdic or through an infusions of troubled asset relief program funds consolidation in the industry and the volatility in the stock market have negatively impacted investors additionally government intervention has required many financial institutions to become bank holding companies under the bhc act under the system of functional regulation established under the bhc act the frb supervises bank holding companies as an umbrella regulator the bhc act and regulations generally restrict bank holding companies from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities the frb and fdic have also issued substantial riskbased and leverage capital guidelines applicable to us banking organizations the guidelines define a threetier framework requiring depository institutions to maintain certain leverage ratios depending on the type of assets held if any depository institution controlled by a financial or bank holding company ceases to meet capital or management standards the frb may impose corrective capital andor managerial requirements on the company and place limitations on its ability to conduct broader financial activities furthermore proposed legislation will allow the treasury and the fdic to create a resolution regime to take over bank and financial holding companies the taking over would be based on whether the firm is in default or in danger of defaulting and whether such a default would have a serious adverse effect on the financial system or the economy this mechanism would only be used by the government in exceptional circumstances to mitigate these effects this type of intervention has unknown risks and costs associated with it which may cause unforeseeable harm in the industry companies involved in the insurance industry are engaged in underwriting reinsuring selling distributing or placing of property and casualty life or health insurance other growth areas within the insurance industry include brokerage reciprocals claims processors and multiline insurance companies interest rate levels general economic conditions and price and marketing competition affect insurance company profits property and casualty insurance profits may also be affected by weather catastrophes and other disasters life and health insurance profits may be affected by mortality and morbidity rates individual companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers insurance companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation including the imposition of maximum rate levels which may not be adequate for some lines of business proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies policy sales tax obligations and profitability in addition to the foregoing profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressures to compete globally in addition to the normal risks of business companies involved in the insurance industry are subject to significant risk factors including those applicable to regulated insurance companies such as i the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves particularly reserves for the cost of environmental asbestos and mass tort claims and the fact that ultimate losses could materially exceed established loss reserves which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition ii the fact that insurance companies have experienced and can be expected in the future to experience catastrophe losses which could have a material adverse impact on their financial condition results of operations and cash flow iii the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment patterns caused by new claims settlement practices iv the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus particularly in light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state insurance regulatory authorities and in order to maintain acceptable financial strength or claimspaying ability rating v the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies subsidiaries are subject various regulatory initiatives that may affect insurance companies and regulatory and other legal actions vi the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the value of an insurance companys investment portfolio and on the attractiveness of certain of its products vii the need to adjust the effective duration of the assets and liabilities of life insurance operations in order to meet the anticipated cash flow requirements of its policyholder obligations and viii the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables this enhanced oversight into the insurance industry may pose unknown risks to the sector as a whole the state insurance regulatory framework has during recent years come under increased federal scrutiny and certain state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that alter and in many cases increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company systems further the national association of insurance commissioners naic and state insurance regulators are reexamining existing laws and regulations specifically focusing on insurance companies interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws in addition congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the united states to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation the sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance industry or what effect if any such legislation would have on the industry all insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain investment categories failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause nonconforming investments to be treated as nonadmitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and in some instances would require divestiture environmental pollution cleanup is the subject of both federal and state regulation by some estimates there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to clean up the insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  superfund and comparable state statutes minisuperfund govern the cleanup and restoration by potentially responsible parties prps superfund and the minisuperfunds environmental cleanup laws or ecls establish a mechanism to pay for cleanup of waste sites if prps fail to do so and to assign liability to prps the extent of liability to be allocated to a prp is dependent on a variety of factors the extent of cleanup necessary and the assignment of liability has not been fully established the insurance industry is disputing many such claims key coverage issues include whether superfund response costs are considered damages under the policies when and how coverage is triggered applicability of pollution exclusions the potential for joint and several liability and definition of an occurrence similar coverage issues exist for clean up and waste sites not covered under superfund to date courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues an insurers exposure to liability with regard to its insureds which have been or may be named as prps is uncertain superfund reform proposals have been introduced in congress but none have been enacted there can be no assurance that any superfund reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair effective and costefficient system for settlement of superfund related claims while current federal income tax law permits the taxdeferred accumulation of earnings on the premiums paid by an annuity owner and holders of certain savingsoriented life insurance products no assurance can be given that future tax law will continue to allow such tax deferrals if such deferrals were not allowed consumer demand for the affected products would be substantially reduced in addition proposals to lower the federal income tax rates through a form of flat tax or otherwise could have if enacted a negative impact on the demand for such products major determinants of future earnings of companies in the financial services sector are the direction of the stock market investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of longterm and shortterm interest rates and the outlook for emerging markets negative trends in any of these earnings determinants could have a serious adverse effect on the financial stability as well as the stock prices of these companies furthermore there can be no assurance that the issuers of the securities included in the trust will be able to respond in a timely manner to compete in the rapidly developing marketplace in addition to the foregoing profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressures to compete globally foreign securities risk if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust or issuers of securities held by a trust may invest in foreign issuers and therefore an investment in such a trust involves some investment risks that are different in some respects from an investment in a trust that invests entirely in securities of domestic issuers those investment risks include future political and governmental restrictions which might adversely affect the payment or receipt of payment of dividends on the relevant securities currency exchange rate fluctuations exchange control policies and the limited liquidity and small market capitalization of such foreign countries securities markets in addition for foreign issuers that are not subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  there may be less publicly available information than is available from a domestic issuer also foreign issuers are not necessarily subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards practices and requirements comparable to those applicable to domestic issuers however due to the nature of the issuers of the securities included in the trust the sponsor believes that adequate information will be available to allow the sponsor to provide portfolio surveillance certain of the securities in the trust may be in adr or gdr form adrs american depositary receipts and gdrs global depositary receipts represent common stock deposited with a custodian in a depositary american depositary receipts and global depositary receipts collectively the depositary receipts are issued by a bank or trust company to evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation these instruments may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the securities into which they may be converted for purposes of the discussion herein the terms adr and gdr generally include american depositary shares and global depositary shares respectively depositary receipts may be sponsored or unsponsored in an unsponsored facility the depositary initiates and arranges the facility at the request of market makers and acts as agent for the depositary receipts holder while the company itself is not involved in the transaction in a sponsored facility the issuing company initiates the facility and agrees to pay certain administrative and shareholderrelated expenses sponsored facilities use a single depositary and entail a contractual relationship between the issuer the shareholder and the depositary unsponsored facilities involve several depositaries with no contractual relationship to the company the depositary bank that issues depositary receipts generally charges a fee based on the price of the depositary receipts upon issuance and cancellation of the depositary receipts this fee would be in addition to the brokerage commissions paid upon the acquisition or surrender of the security in addition the depositary bank incurs expenses in connection with the conversion of dividends or other cash distributions paid in local currency into us dollars and such expenses are deducted from the amount of the dividend or distribution paid to holders resulting in a lower payout per underlying shares represented by the depositary receipts than would be the case if the underlying share were held directly certain tax considerations including tax rate differentials and withholding requirements arising from the application of the tax laws of one nation to nationals of another and from certain practices in the depositary receipts market may also exist with respect to certain depositary receipts in varying degrees any or all of these factors may affect the value of the depositary receipts compared with the value of the underlying shares in the local market in addition the rights of holders of depositary receipts may be different than those of holders of the underlying shares and the market for depositary receipts may be less liquid than that for the underlying shares depositary receipts are registered securities pursuant to the securities act of  and may be subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  for the securities that are depositary receipts currency fluctuations will affect the united states dollar equivalent of the local currency price of the underlying domestic share and as a result are likely to affect the value of the depositary receipts and consequently the value of the securities the foreign issuers of securities that are depositary receipts may pay dividends in foreign currencies which must be converted into dollars most foreign currencies have fluctuated widely in value against the united states dollar for many reasons including supply and demand of the respective currency the soundness of the world economy and the strength of the respective economy as compared to the economies of the united states and other countries therefore for any securities of issuers whether or not they are in depositary receipt form whose earnings are stated in foreign currencies or which pay dividends in foreign currencies or which are traded in foreign currencies there is a risk that their united states dollar value will vary with fluctuations in the united states dollar foreign exchange rates for the relevant currencies preferred stock risks if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust or issuers of securities held by a trust may invest in preferred stock if this is the case an investment in units should be made with an understanding of the risks which an investment in preferred stocks entails including the risk that the financial condition of the issuers of the securities or the general condition of the preferred stock market may worsen and the value of the preferred stocks and therefore the value of the units may decline preferred stocks may be susceptible to general stock market movements and to volatile increases and decreases of value as market confidence in and perceptions of the issuers change these perceptions are based on unpredictable factors including expectations regarding government economic monetary and fiscal policies inflation and interest rates economic expansion or contraction market liquidity and global or regional political economic or banking crises preferred stocks are also vulnerable to congressional reductions in the dividendsreceived deduction which would adversely affect the aftertax return to the investors who can take advantage of the deduction such a reduction might adversely affect the value of preferred stocks in general holders of preferred stocks as owners of the entity have rights to receive payments from the issuers of those preferred stocks that are generally subordinate to those of creditors of or holders of debt obligations or in some cases other senior preferred stocks of such issuers preferred stocks do not represent an obligation of the issuer and therefore do not offer any assurance of income or provide the same degree of protection of capital as do debt securities the issuance of additional debt securities or senior preferred stocks will create prior claims for payment of principal and interest and senior dividends which could adversely affect the ability and inclination of the issuer to declare or pay dividends on its preferred stock or the rights of holders of preferred stock with respect to assets of the issuer upon liquidation or bankruptcy the value of preferred stocks is subject to market fluctuations for as long as the preferred stocks remain outstanding and thus the value of the securities may be expected to fluctuate over the life of the trust to values higher or lower than those prevailing on the initial date of deposit trust preferred securities risks if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust or issuers of securities held by a trust may invest in trust preferred securities holders of trust preferred securities incur risks in addition to or slightly different than the typical risks of holding preferred stocks trust preferred securities are limitedlife preferred securities that are typically issued by corporations generally in the form of interestbearing notes or preferred securities issued by corporations or by an affiliated business trust of a corporation generally in the form of beneficial interests in subordinated debentures issued by the corporation or similarly structured securities the maturity and dividend rate of the trust preferred securities are structured to match the maturity and coupon interest rate of the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures trust preferred securities usually mature on the stated maturity date of the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures and may be redeemed or liquidated prior to the stated maturity date of such instruments for any reason on or after their stated call date or upon the occurrence of certain circumstances at any time trust preferred securities generally have a yield advantage over traditional preferred stocks but unlike preferred stocks distributions on the trust preferred securities are generally treated as interest rather than dividends for federal income tax purposes unlike most preferred stocks distributions received from trust preferred securities are generally not eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction certain of the risks unique to trust preferred securities include i distributions on trust preferred securities will be made only if interest payments on the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures are made ii a corporation issuing the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures may defer interest payments on these instruments for up to  consecutive quarters and if such election is made distributions will not be made on the trust preferred securities during the deferral period iii certain tax or regulatory events may trigger the redemption of the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures by the issuing corporation and result in prepayment of the trust preferred securities prior to their stated maturity date iv future legislation may be proposed or enacted that may prohibit the corporation from deducting its interest payments on the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures for tax purposes making redemption of these instruments likely v a corporation may redeem the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures in whole at any time or in part from time to time on or after a stated call date vi trust preferred securities holders have very limited voting rights and vii payment of interest on the interestbearing notes preferred securities or subordinated debentures and therefore distributions on the trust preferred securities is dependent on the financial condition of the issuing corporation convertible securities risks if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust or issuers of securities held by a trust may invest in convertible securities convertible securities generally offer lower interest or dividend yields than nonconvertible fixedincome securities of similar credit quality because of the potential for capital appreciation the market values of convertible securities tend to decline as interest rates increase and conversely to increase as interest rates decline however a convertible securitys market value also tends to reflect the market price of the common stock of the issuing company particularly when the stock price is greater than the convertible securitys conversion price the conversion price is defined as the predetermined price or exchange ratio at which the convertible security can be converted or exchanged for the underlying common stock as the market price of the underlying common stock declines below the conversion price the price of the convertible security tends to be increasingly influenced more by the yield of the convertible security than by the market price of the underlying common stock thus it may not decline in price to the same extent as the underlying common stock and convertible securities generally have less potential for gain or loss than common stocks however mandatory convertible securities as discussed below generally do not limit the potential for loss to the same extent as securities convertible at the option of the holder in the event of a liquidation of the issuing company holders of convertible securities would be paid before that companys common stockholders consequently an issuers convertible securities generally entail less risk than its common stock however convertible securities fall below debt obligations of the same issuer in order of preference or priority in the event of a liquidation and are typically unrated or rated lower than such debt obligations in addition contingent payment convertible securities allow the issuer to claim deductions based on its nonconvertible cost of debt which generally will result in deduction in excess of the actual cash payments made on the securities and accordingly holders will recognize income in amounts in excess of the cash payments received mandatory convertible securities are distinguished as a subset of convertible securities because the conversion is not optional and the conversion price at maturity is based solely upon the market price of the underlying common stock which may be significantly less than par or the price above or below par paid for these reasons the risks associated with investing in mandatory convertible securities most closely resemble the risks inherent in common stocks mandatory convertible securities customarily pay a higher coupon yield to compensate for the potential risk of additional price volatility and loss upon conversion because the market price of a mandatory convertible security increasingly corresponds to the market price of its underlying common stock as the convertible security approaches its conversion date there can be no assurance that the higher coupon will compensate for the potential loss senior loan risks if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust or issuers of securities held by a trust may invest in senior loans senior loans in which a closedend fund or an etf may invest o generally are of below investmentgrade or junk credit quality o may be unrated at the time of investment o generally are not registered with the sec or any state securities commission and o generally are not listed on any securities exchange the amount of public information available on senior loans generally will be less extensive than that available for other types of assets no reliable active trading market currently exists for many senior loans although a secondary market for certain senior loans has developed over the past several years senior loans are thus relatively illiquid liquidity relates to the ability of a closedend fund or an etf to sell an investment in a timely manner at a price approximately equal to its value on the closedend funds or the etfs books the illiquidity of senior loans may impair a closedend funds or an etfs ability to realize the full value of its assets in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation of such assets because of the lack of an active trading market illiquid securities are also difficult to value and prices provided by external pricing services may not reflect the true value of the securities however many senior loans are of a large principal amount and are held by a large number of financial institutions to the extent that a secondary market does exist for certain senior loans the market may be subject to irregular trading activity wide bidask spreads and extended trade settlement periods the market for senior loans could be disrupted in the event of an economic downturn or a substantial increase or decrease in interest rates this could result in increased volatility in the market and in the trusts net asset value if legislation or state or federal regulators impose additional requirements or restrictions on the ability of financial institutions to make loans that are considered highly leveraged transactions the availability of senior loans for investment by the closedend funds or the etfs may be adversely affected in addition such requirements or restrictions could reduce or eliminate sources of financing for certain borrowers this would increase the risk of default if legislation or federal or state regulators require financial institutions to dispose of senior loans that are considered highly leveraged transactions or subject such senior loans to increased regulatory scrutiny financial institutions may determine to sell such senior loans such sales could result in depressed prices if a closedend fund or an etf attempts to sell a senior loan at a time when a financial institution is engaging in such a sale the price a closedend fund or an etf could get for the senior loan may be adversely affected some senior loans are subject to the risk that a court pursuant to fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws could subordinate the senior loans to presently existing or future indebtedness of the borrower or take other action detrimental to lenders such court action could under certain circumstances include invalidation of senior loans any lender which could include a closedend fund or an etf is subject to the risk that a court could find the lender liable for damages in a claim by a borrower arising under the common laws of tort or contracts or antifraud provisions of certain securities laws for actions taken or omitted to be taken by the lenders under the relevant terms of a loan agreement or in connection with actions with respect to the collateral underlying the senior loan floatingrate securities risk if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust or issuers of securities held by a trust may invest in floatingrate securities certain closedend funds or etfs held by the trust may invest in securities that are structured as floatingrate instruments in which the interest rate payable on the obligations fluctuates on a periodic basis based upon changes in a base lending rate as a result the yield on these securities will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment causing the closedend funds or the etfs to experience a reduction in the income they receive from these securities a sudden and significant increase in market interest rates may increase the risk of payment defaults and cause a decline in the value of these investments and the value of the closedend funds or the etfs held by the trust smallcapitalization and midcapitalization stocks risk if set forth in part a of the prospectus a trust may invest in smallcapitalization or midcapitalization stocks investing in smallcapitalization stocks or midcapitalization stocks may involve greater risk than investing in largecapitalization stocks since they can be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements many small market capitalization companies smallcap companies or middle market capitalization companies midcap companies will have had their securities publicly traded if at all for only a short period of time and will not have had the opportunity to establish a reliable trading pattern through economic cycles the price volatility of smallcap companies and midcap companies is relatively higher than larger older and more mature companies the greater price volatility of smallcap companies and midcap companies may result from the fact that there may be less market liquidity less information publicly available or fewer investors who monitor the activities of these companies in addition the market prices of these securities may exhibit more sensitivity to changes in industry or general economic conditions some smallcap companies or midcap companies will not have been in existence long enough to experience economic cycles or to demonstrate whether they are sufficiently well managed to survive downturns or inflationary periods further a variety of factors may affect the success of a companys business beyond the ability of its management to prepare or compensate for them including domestic and international political developments government trade and fiscal policies patterns of trade and war or other military conflict which may affect industries or markets or the economy

trust will be distributed on a prorated basis of onetwelfth of the estimated annual income to the trust for the ensuing  months all distributions will be net of applicable expenses there is no assurance that any actual distributions will be made since all dividends received may be used to pay expenses in addition excess amounts from the capital account of a trust if any will be distributed at least annually to the unitholders then of record proceeds received from the disposition of any of the securities after a record date and prior to the following distribution date will be held in the

distribution to the unitholders as of each record date will be made on the following distribution date or shortly thereafter and shall consist of an amount substantially equal to such portion of the unitholders pro rata share of the dividend distributions then held in the income account after deducting estimated expenses because dividends are not received by a trust at a constant rate throughout the year such distributions to unitholders are expected to fluctuate however if the trust uses income averaging the trust prorates the income distribution on an annual basis and annual income distributions are expected to vary from year to year if the amount on deposit in the income account is insufficient for payment of the amount of income to be distributed on a monthly basis the trustee shall advance out of its own funds and cause to be deposited in and credited to such income account such amount as may be required to permit payment of the monthly income distribution the trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the trust without interest out of income received by the trust subsequent to the date of such advance and subject to the condition that any such reimbursement

determined by the evaluator based on the value of the underlying securities unitholders who wish to dispose of their units should inquire of their broker as to current market prices in order to determine whether there is in existence any price in excess of the redemption price and if so the amount thereof unitholders who sell or redeem units prior to such time as the entire deferred sales

units for redemption such unitholder should make sure that the trustee has been provided a certified tax identification number in order to avoid this possible backup withholding in the event the trustee has not been previously provided such number one must be provided at the time redemption is requested any amounts paid on redemption representing unpaid dividends shall be withdrawn from the

may result in lower prices than might otherwise be realized the price received upon redemption may be more or less than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of the securities in the portfolio at the time of redemption unitholders of a trust that holds closedend funds or other investment company securities who request a distribution in kind will be subject to any b fees or other service or distribution fees applicable to the underlying securities the right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for more than three business days following the day on which

exchange commission trading on the new york stock exchange is restricted ii for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal by the trustee of securities is not reasonably practicable or it is not reasonably practicable to fairly determine the value of the underlying securities in accordance with the trust agreement or iii for such other period as the securities and exchange commission may by order permit the trustee is not liable to any person in any way for any loss or damage which may result from any such suspension or postponement computation of redemption price the redemption price per unit as well as the secondary market public offering price will generally be determined on the basis of the last sale price of the securities in a trust the redemption price per unit is the pro rata share of each unit in a trust determined generally on the basis of i the cash on hand in the trust or moneys in the process of being collected and ii the value of the securities in the trust less a amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges payable out of the trust b any amount owing to the trustee for its advances and c the accrued expenses or remaining deferred sales fees of the trust during the initial offering period the redemption price and the secondary market repurchase price will also include estimated organizational costs the evaluator may determine the value of the securities in the trust in the following manner if the securities are listed on a national or foreign securities exchange or the nasdaq national market system such evaluation shall generally be based on the last available sale price on or immediately prior to the evaluation time on the exchange or nasdaq national market system which is the principal market therefor which shall be deemed to be the new york stock exchange if the securities are listed thereon unless the evaluator deems such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation or if there is no such available sale price on such exchange at the last available bid prices offer prices for primary market purchases of the securities securities not listed on the new york stock exchange but principally traded on the nasdaq national market system will be valued at the nasdaq national market systems official closing price if the securities are not so listed or if so listed the principal market therefor is other than on such exchange or there is no such available sale price on such exchange such evaluation shall generally be based on the following methods or any combination thereof whichever the evaluator deems appropriate i on the basis of the current bid price offer prices for primary market purchases for comparable securities unless the evaluator deems such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation ii by determining the valuation of the securities on the bid side offer side for primary market purchases of the market by appraisal or iii by any combination of the above notwithstanding the foregoing the evaluator or its designee will generally value foreign securities primarily traded on foreign exchanges at their fair value which may be other than their market price if the trust holds securities denominated in a currency other than us dollars the evaluation of such security is based upon us dollars based on current bid side offer side for primary market purchases exchange rates unless the evaluator deems such prices inappropriate as a basis for valuation retirement plans a trust may be well suited for purchase by individual retirement accounts

the main us federal income tax consequences of owning units of the trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor trust status your trust intends to qualify as a regulated investment company under the federal tax laws if your trust qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law the trust generally will not pay federal income taxes distributions trust distributions are generally taxable after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that separates your trusts distributions into two categories ordinary income distributions and capital gains dividends ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate however as further discussed below certain ordinary income distributions received from the trust may be taxed at the capital gains tax rates generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units to determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other taxable transactions as described below in addition your trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash the income from your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales fee if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year under the health care and education reconciliation act of  income from a trust may also be subject to a new  medicare tax imposed for taxable years beginning after  this tax will generally apply to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts which are  in the case of married couples filing joint returns and  in the case of single individuals dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies however certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust from certain corporations may be reported by the trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units capital gains and losses and certain ordinary income dividends if you are an individual the maximum marginal stated federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  for taxpayers in the  tax bracket  for taxpayers in the    and  tax brackets and  for taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets some portion of your capital gains dividends may be attributable to the trusts interest in a master limited partnership which may be subject to a maximum marginal stated federal income tax rate of  rather than the rates set forth above in the case of capital gains dividends the determination of which portion of the capital gains dividend if any is subject to the  tax rate will be made based on rules prescribed by the united states treasury capital gains may also be subject to the medicare tax described above net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations ordinary income dividends received by an individual unitholder from a regulated investment company such as the trust are generally taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust itself your trust will provide notice to its unitholders of the amount of any distribution which may be taken into account as a dividend which is eligible for the capital gains tax rates inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may receive an inkind distribution of trust securities when you redeem units or up to  business days before your trust terminates however this ability to request an inkind distribution will terminate at any time that the number of outstanding units has been reduced to  or less of the highest number of units issued by the trust by electing to receive an inkind distribution you will receive trust securities plus possibly cash this distribution will be treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or loss generally based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received the internal revenue service could however assert that a loss could not be currently deducted exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future series of the trust the exchange would generally be considered a sale for federal income tax purposes deductibility of trust expenses expenses incurred and deducted by your trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you in some cases however you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as income in these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income some individuals may also be subject to further limitations on the amount of their itemized deductions depending on their income foreign tax credit if your trust invests in any foreign securities the tax statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your trust paid to other countries in this case dividends taxed to you will include your share of the taxes your trust paid to other countries you may be able to deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes investments in certain foreign corporations if the trust holds an equity interest in any passive foreign investment companies pfics which are generally certain foreign corporations that receive at least  of their annual gross income from passive sources such as interest dividends certain rents and royalties or capital gains or that hold at least  of their assets in investments producing such passive income the trust could be subject to us federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those equity interests even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its unitholders the trust will not be able to pass through to its unitholders any credit or deduction for such taxes the trust may be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences in this case the trust would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such pfic shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income under this election the trust might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions from pfics and its proceeds from dispositions of pfic stock during that year and such income would nevertheless be subject to the distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the  excise tax dividends paid by pfics are not treated as qualified dividend income foreign investors if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you should be aware that generally subject to applicable tax treaties distributions from your trust will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax purposes other than dividends which the trust properly reports as capital gain dividends and will be subject to us income taxes including withholding taxes subject to certain exceptions described below however distributions received by a foreign investor from your trust that are properly reported by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met distributions in respect of units may be subject to a us withholding tax of  in the case of distributions to i certain nonus financial institutions that have not entered into an agreement with the us treasury to collect and disclose certain information and are not resident in a jurisdiction that has entered into such an agreement with the us treasury and ii certain other nonus entities that do not provide certain certifications and information about the entitys us owners dispositions of units by such persons may be subject to such withholding

set forth in their report thereon appearing elsewhere herein and is included in reliance on such report given on the authority of such firm as experts in accounting and auditing description of ratings standard  poors issue credit ratings a standard  poors issue credit rating is a forwardlooking opinion about the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation a specific class of financial obligations or a specific financial program including ratings on mediumterm note programs and commercial paper programs it takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated the opinion reflects standard  poors view of the obligors capacity and willingness to meet its financial commitments as they come due and may assess terms such as collateral security and subordination which could affect ultimate payment in the event of default issue credit ratings can be either longterm or shortterm shortterm ratings are generally assigned to those obligations considered shortterm in the relevant market in the us for example that means obligations with an original maturity of no more than  days including commercial paper shortterm ratings are also used to indicate the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to put features on longterm obligations the result is a dual rating in which the shortterm rating addresses the put feature in addition to the usual longterm rating mediumterm notes are assigned longterm ratings the ratings and other credit related opinions of standard  poors and its affiliates are statements of opinion as of the date they are expressed and not statements of fact or recommendations to purchase hold or sell any securities or make any investment decisions standard  poors assumes no obligation to update any information following publication users of ratings and credit related opinions should not rely on them in making any investment decision standard  poors opinions and analyses do not address the suitability of any security standard  poors financial services llc does not act as a fiduciary or an investment advisor while standard  poors has obtained information from sources it believes to be reliable standard  poors does not perform an audit and undertakes no duty of due diligence or independent verification of any information it receives ratings and credit related opinions may be changed suspended or withdrawn at any time longterm issue credit ratings issue credit ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations o likelihood of paymentcapacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation o nature of and provisions of the obligation and o protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangement under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights issue ratings are an assessment of default risk but may incorporate an assessment of relative seniority or ultimate recovery in the event of default junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy as noted above such differentiation may apply when an entity has both senior and subordinated obligations secured and unsecured obligations or operating company and holding company obligations aaa an obligation rated aaa has the highest rating assigned by standard  poors the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong aa an obligation rated aa differs from the highestrated obligations only to a small degree the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong a an obligation rated a is somewhat susceptible to the adverse economic conditions and changes in circumstances bbb an obligation rated bbb exhibits adequate capacity to meet financial commitments but more subject to adverse economic condition bbb considered the lowest investmentgrade by market participants obligations rated bb b ccc cc and c are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics bb indicates the least degree of speculation and c the highest while such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions bb considered highest speculative grade by market participants bb an obligation rated bb is less vulnerable in the nearterm but faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial and economic conditions b an obligation rated b is more vulnerable to adverse business financial and economic conditions but currently has the capacity to meet financial commitments ccc an obligation rated ccc is currently vulnerable and dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions to meet its financial commitments cc an obligation rated cc is currently highly vulnerable c a c rating is assigned to obligations that are currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment obligations that have payment arrearages allowed by the terms of the documents or obligations of an issuer that is the subject of a bankruptcy petition or similar action which have not experienced a payment default among others the c rating may be assigned to subordinated debt preferred stock or other obligations on which cash payments have been suspended in accordance with the instruments terms or when preferred stock is the subject of a distressed exchange offer whereby some or all of the issue is either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other instruments having a total value that is less than par d an obligation rated d is in payment default the d rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired unless standard  poors believes that such payments will be made during such grace period the d rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on an obligation are jeopardized plus  or minus  the ratings from aa to ccc may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories nr this indicates that no rating has been requested that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating or that standard  poors does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy guggenheim defined portfolios guggenheim portfolio prospectuspart b december   where to learn more you can contact us for
