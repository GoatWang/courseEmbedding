§ aa  usc §  and  usc § b iv s tatutory and legal background  section a of the exchange act provides that “ery person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than  percent of any class of any equity security…which is registered pursuant to” section  of the exchange act who is a “director or case cv document  filed in txsd on  page  of   hou an officer of the issuer of such

those securities “within any period of less than six months…shall be…recoverable by the issuer” usc § pb section b “imposes strict liability regardless of motive including trades not actually based on inside information” dreiling v am express co  fd   th cir   sec rule alal promulgated under the exchange act sets forth how the term beneficial owner is defined for the purposes of section b liability it notes that a “beneficial owner” means “any person who is deemed a beneficial owner pursuant to section d of the exchange act and the rules thereunder  ”  cfr aa section d of the exchange act as clarified by sec rule d states “w o re persons agree to act together for the purpose of acquiring holding voting or disposing of equity securities of an issue the group formed thereby shall be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership for purposes of sections d and g of the exchange as of the date of such agreement of all equity securities of that issuer beneficially owned by any such persons

period cadian capital  wl  at   group activity can be found even where the agreement between the parties lacks definite terms further the agreement may be formal or informal and may be proved through direct or circumstantial evidence dreiling v america online inc  fd   th cir   “tmeaning of section d is that the members combined in furtherance of a common objective” wellman v dickinson  fd   d cir  cert denied  us   the plain language of the statute does not require a group to be committed to any “specific set of terms” but rather “demands only an agreement for the purpose of acquiring holding or disposing of securities” morales v freund  fd   n d cir  morales v quintel entertainment inc  fd    d cir  additionally parties can agree to act in furtherance of some common objective v g roup activity  in this case the disclosed relationships and commonalities between and among the gates capital defendants and fund entities permit the inference that the defendants agreed to act together for the purposes of acquiring holding and disposing of flotek common stock it is difficult to draw any other conclusion gates capital’s form adv filing was made on behalf case cv document  filed in txsd on  page  of   hou of gates capital and its relying adviser gates lp listing all of the fund entities showing that all of the defendants are under common control  the gates capital defendants all bear the same gates capital name and have the same registered agent in delaware most all of the gates capital defendants and fund entities operate out of the same office in new york which is the business address of mr jeffrey gates as well  each of the fund entities employed the same auditor located in new york where gates capital is located the same prime broker in new york and the same custodians  furthermore the ownership and management relationships among all of the defendants form a complete web jeffrey l gates is the sole shareholder president and portfolio manager of gates capital gates capital is in turn the managing member and  or more owner of gates gp gates gp is the general partner of gates lp gates lp is the relying adviser to gates capital and the investment adviser to all of fund entities the feeder fund invests in the master fund whose general partner is gates partners gates partners is also the general partner of each of ecf fund and ecf fund ii all of the gates capital defendants and the fund entities are linked  stated differently gates capital manages the fund entities and controls the fund entities’ holdings in flotek through the corporate structure three of the fund entities share a general partner gates partners the one fund entity that does not share that general partner the feeder fund invests into the master fund which does have the same general partner gates partners moreover gates lps stated principal business purposes is to serve as  see gates capital sec form adv dated september   available at the sec website https advisorinfosecgov  see gates capital sec form d dated july   at item d on p  available at the sec website httpswwwsecgovedgarsearchedgarcompanysearchhtml case cv document  filed in txsd on  page  of   hou investment manager to three of the fund entities  and is controlled by an entity gates gp whose managing member is gates capital  defendants therefore constitute a group for purposes of determining beneficial ownership under §§ d and b of the exchange act at all relevant times the gates capital group was a greater than  beneficial owner of flotek common stock and the defendants are therefore subject to liability under section b gates capital group garnered shortswing profits in a series of the transactions within certain six month periods set forth herein in violation of section b these profits should be disgorged vi g ates capital’s ownership in the fund entities  gates capital had a financial incentive to create the fund entities and manage their investments as gates capital andor gates lp earned a management fee of an unknown percentage of the assets under management as well as performancebased fees  because the gates capital defendants had an interest in the fund entities those entities did not beneficially own flotek common stock for the benefit of third parties in the ordinary course of business therefore the registered investment advisor exemption from section b liability under  cfr § aav providing that registered investment advisors under section  of the investment advisers act of  or under the laws of any state “shall not be deemed the beneficial owner of securities of such class held for the benefit of third parties or in customer of fiduciary accounts in the ordinary course of business” is not applicable to the gates capital defendants  id case cv document  filed in txsd on  page  of   hou vii p urchase and sale transactions  while the gates capital group was a greater than  beneficial owner the defendants purchased and sold shares of flotek common stock at various times within several six month periods between  and  for example the gates capital group purchased at least  shares between march   and june   and sold at least  shares between june   and september   additionally the gates capital group purchased at least  shares between december   and march   and sold at least  shares between march   and june    the gates capital group also violated section a of the exchange act by failing to report its greater than  beneficial ownership on sec form  which is required to be filed under sec rule a the gates capital group continued to violate section a and sec rule a by failing to report its purchases and shares of flotek common stock on sec form  while the gates capital group was a greater than  beneficial owner due to these sec reporting violations it is not possible to compute with precision the amount of shortswing profits garnered by the gates capital group from its shortswing trading shares of flotek common stock upon information and belief shortswing profits total in the millions of dollars viii c laim i against the gates capital group  plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in paragraphs  through  as if fully set forth herein  as alleged in paragraphs  and  herein during several six month periods the gates capital group engaged in purchase and sale transactions in flotek common stock which resulted in disgorgeable shortswing profits case cv document  filed in txsd on  page  of   hou  each of the defendants is liable for its respective shortswing profits ix c laim ii against the gates capital defendants  flotek repeats and realleges the allegations contained in paragraphs  through  as if fully set forth herein  as alleged in paragraphs  through  herein the gates capital defendants are members of the gates capital group who engaged in transactions on behalf of the fund entities which yielded shortswing profits subject to disgorgement  as alleged in paragraphs  through  herein the gates capital defendants have pecuniary interests in shortswing profits realized by the fund entities and are liable to disgorge to plaintiff their shortswing profits to the extent of their respective pecuniary interests in the transactions  plaintiff is unable to precisely compute the gates capital defendants’ pecuniary interests in the transactions x p rayer wherefore
