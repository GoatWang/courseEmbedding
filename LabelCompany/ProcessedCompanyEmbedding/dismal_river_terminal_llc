circumstances and provided that ak steel has given at least two years prior notice of its intention to terminate the agreements and certain other conditions are met no other coke sales contract has an early termination clause our core business model is predicated on providing steelmakers an alternative to investing capital in their own captive coke production facilities we direct our marketing efforts principally towards steelmaking customers that require coke for use in their blast furnaces while our steelmaking customers are operating in an environment that is challenged by global overcapacity our customers have continued to see increases in steel pricing and positive signals on trade and infrastructure during the first half of  despite the improved market trends over the last year ak steel and united states steel corporation us steel have kept portions of their ashland kentucky works facility and granite city works facility idled as they await further signs of market stability while market challenges remain our customers continue to comply with the terms of their longterm takeorpay contracts with us our granite city facility and the first phase of our haverhill

the partnership owns and operates a coal logistics business which provides coal handling andor mixing services to thirdparty customers as well as to our own cokemaking facilities the partnerships coal logistics business consists of convent marine terminal cmt kanawha river terminals llc krt and suncoke lake terminal llc lake terminal the partnerships coal logistics business has collective capacity to mix andor transload approximately  million tons of coal annually and store approximately  million tons cmt is one of the largest export terminals on the us gulf coast and has direct rail access and

harbor cokemaking operations the company also owns dismal river terminal llc drt which is located in virginia adjacent to our jewell cokemaking facility and was formed to accommodate jewell in its direct procurement of thirdparty coal beginning in  coal is transported from the mine site in numerous ways including rail truck barge or ship the partnerships coal terminals act as intermediaries between coal producers and coal end users by providing transloading storage and mixing services the partnership does not take possession of coal in its coal logistics business but instead earns revenue by providing coal handling andor mixing services to its customers on a fee per ton basis mixing andor handling services are provided to steel coke including some of our domestic cokemaking facilities electric utility and coal producing customers table of contents the financial performance of the partnerships coal logistics business is substantially dependent upon a limited number of customers the partnerships cmt customers are impacted by seaborne export market dynamics fluctuations in the benchmark price for coal delivery into northwest europe as referenced in the argusmccloskeys coal price index report api index price contribute to the partnerships customers decisions to place tons into the export market and thus impact transloading volumes through the partnerships terminal facility the partnerships krt terminals are primarily impacted by the domestic coal markets in which its customers operate and generally benefit from extreme weather conditions in april  the company announced the termination of discussions with the conflicts committee of the board of directors of the partnership regarding our proposal to acquire all of the partnerships common units not already owned by the company simplification transaction announced on october   the conflicts committee and its independent advisors reviewed the proposal made by the company and had several discussions with the company regarding the potential transaction at this time the parties determined that they will not be able to reach an agreement and have therefore terminated discussions

analysis of changes described in analysis of segment results  see analysis of changes described in liquidity and capital resources table of contents items impacting comparability debt activities during the second quarter of  the partnership refinanced its debt obligations the partnership received  million of proceeds net of an original issue discount of  million from the issuance of the  percent  partnership notes and  million of proceeds from borrowings under the partnerships amended and restated credit facility the partnership used these proceeds to purchase and redeem all of its  percent  partnership notes including principal of  million and a premium of  million to repay the  million outstanding on the partnership term loan and to repay  million on the partnership revolver in connection with the debt issuance the company and the partnership incurred debt issuance costs of  million which were included in longterm debt and financing obligation on the consolidated balance sheets as of june   as a result of the debt refinancing the three and six months ended june   included a loss on extinguishment of debt on the consolidated statement of operations of  million and  million respectively which consisted primarily of the premium paid of  million irs final regulations on qualifying income in january  the internal revenue service irs announced its decision to exclude cokemaking as a qualifying income generating activity in its final regulations the final regulations issued under section de of the internal revenue code relating to the qualifying income exception for publicly traded partnerships however the final regulations include a transition period for activities that were reasonably interpreted to be qualifying income and carried on by publicly traded partnerships prior to the final regulations the partnership previously received a willlevel opinion from its counsel vinson  elkins llp that the partnerships cokemaking operations generated qualifying income prior to the final regulations therefore the partnership believes it had a reasonable basis to conclude its cokemaking operations were considered qualifying income before the issuance of the new regulations and as such expects to maintain its treatment as a partnership through the transition period cokemaking entities in the partnership will become taxable as corporations on january   after the transition period ends as a result of the final regulations the partnership recorded deferred income tax expense of  million to set up its initial deferred income tax liability during the first quarter of  primarily related to differences in the book and tax basis of fixed assets which are expected to exist at the end of the year transition period when the cokemaking operations become taxable as the company consolidates the partnership the entire deferred income tax expense was recognized during the first quarter of  however the company had already recorded  million of the deferred income tax liability in its financial statements related to the companys share of the deferred tax liability for the book and tax differences in its investment in the partnership therefore the net impact to the companys deferred tax expense was  million during the six months ended june   this incremental tax impact is solely attributable to the partnerships public unitholders as such an equal reduction to noncontrolling interest was recorded as a result the final regulations have no impact to net income attributable to the company in  we finalized the required permitting and engineering plan for a potential new cokemaking facility to be constructed in kentucky however in june  due to our focus on renewing our existing customer contracts and the lack of any longterm customer commitment for a majority of the facilitys capacity we decided to terminate the project as a result during the second quarter of  the company wroteoff previously capitalized engineering and land deposit costs of  million during the second quarter of  the company table of contents wroteoff expiring land deposits related to the project of  million these costs were included in selling general

each calendar year based on the weightedaverage contract price of thirdparty coal purchases at our haverhill i cokemaking facility hhi benchmark historically jewells actual coal costs have been higher than the hhi benchmark resulting in an underrecovery of coal costs at jewell during the three and six months ended june   we have narrowed the difference between the hhi benchmark and jewells actual coal costs lessening the underrecovery and improving adjusted ebitda by  million and  million as compared to the same prior year periods respectively pass through coal cost underrecovery during the fourth quarter of  as part of our ordinary course coal sourcing activities haverhill middletown and ak steel each entered into arrangements with a coal supplier for  fulfillment as a result of unfulfilled coal supply commitments by this coal supplier substitute coal suppliers are currently meeting the shortfall resulting in a higher price presently we are aggressively pursuing the coal supplier and sharing a portion of the increased coal cost differential with ak steel resulting in a negative impact to revenue and adjusted ebitda of  million and  million during the three and six months ended june   respectively we expect this impact to lower revenue and adjusted ebitda by approximately  million for the year ended december   coal mining business divestiture and impairment in april  the company successfully disposed of its coal mining business to revelation energy llc revelation who assumed substantially all of our remaining coal mining assets mineral leases real estate and a substantial portion of our mining reclamation obligations under the terms of the agreement revelation received  million from the company to take ownership of the assets and liabilities during

periods contingent consideration in connection with the cmt acquisition the partnership entered into a contingent consideration arrangement that requires the partnership to make future payments to the cline group based on future volumes over a specified threshold price and contract renewals during the first quarter of  the partnership amended the contingent consideration terms with the cline group
