the necco family in  chase and company merged with both fobes hayward  company and wright  moody to officially form the new england confectionery company or necco as it is affectionately known over the years necco prospered producing many well known products but its success was propelled by its most beloved candy necco wafers due to its enduring popularity the original recipe for the necco wafer has remained essentially unchanged over the years and the wafers today are still made in the same original eight flavors of chocolate licorice cinnamon lemon lime orange wintergreen and clove the ingredients are simply sugar corn syrup gelatin gums colorings and flavorings – sweet simplicity from the time of their creation necco wafers have been enjoyed the world over in  explorer donald macmillan took necco wafers on his arctic explorations using them for nutrition and as rewards for eskimo children later in the ’s admiral byrd took ½ tons of necco wafers on an expedition to the south pole which amounted to about a pound a week for each of his men during their twoyear stay in the antarctic during world war ii the us government requisitioned a major portion of the production of necco wafers since the candy doesn’t melt and is difficult to break during transit it was perfect for shipping overseas to the troops though they were first created some time ago necco wafers have stood the test of time every day new fans are discovering their sweetness while longtime loyal fans are still relishing the feelings of nostalgia that come with unwrapping and savoring each wafer in every roll today necco produces approximately four billion necco wafers on an annual basis to put this in perspective if the wafers were placed edge to edge they could wrap around the world… twice  in

side the dl clark company continued to expand and prosper at that location for  years manufacturing some of americas bestknown candies the company experimented with a variety of ingredients that had never been used in candy before clark introduced confections filled with coconut mint and peanut butter and was an overall industry leader in marketing candy bars three of its best creations were clark zagnut and clark coconut crunch bar clark scored an important marketing success when it introduced the fivecentsized clark bar initially the bar was individually wrapped to facilitate shipment

later with the necco family where its name was changed to slap stix today it is still one of the most beloved nostalgic chewy treats – a unique caramel lollipop enjoyed by all ages sky bar® the story of the sky bar begins with its creation in  a chocolate bar with four unique fillings was a monumental development in the candy industry at that time accordingly the first public appearance had to be equally as impressive so necco first announced sky bar by means of a dramatic skywriting advertising campaign necco was the first candy manufacturer in this country to introduce a molded chocolate bar with four distinctly different centers enrobed in chocolate the four flavor fillings are fudge caramel peanut and vanilla nougat the same four that appear today sky bar was an instant success and enjoyed widespread popularity in  the blackout and curfew in times square was lifted on veday after three years of darkness only six display signs had their lighting equipment ready for operation and necco’s sky bar was one of them this welcoming of the “lights” was celebrated by more than  people over the years following its introduction sky bar was heavily advertised on television and radio and also through a number of wellread print publications sky bar still remains the only chocolate bar to have four different flavors in the same bar a truly unique and delectable treat   squirrel nut zippers® the squirrel brand dates back to  when it was started as the austin t merrill company in massachusetts  the company’s ownership changed in  when the firm was officially incorporated as squirrel brands salted nut company at this time two longtime employees perley g gerrish and fred s green took over the business with goals of expansion and product innovation as the company grew it moved from its boston location to cambridge ma in  and then again to a larger building on boardman street in cambridge in  from salted and roasted peanuts to chewy candy favorites squirrel nut company developed a loyal and enthusiastic customer base it even supplied candy and roasted nuts to the armed forces some of their brands have included butter chews nut twins nut chews and nut yippee as well as a wide range of peanut butter kisses and salt water taffy their flagship product was “squirrel nut zippers” a vanilla caramel and nut taffy the interesting name actually came from an illegal drink served secretly during prohibition the name is fun and unique and one that many fans loved for example during the ’s a retro swing band named themselves the “squirrel nut zippers” and even sometimes gave out the candy during their performances in  squirrel brand company which at the time was one of the oldest familyowned candy companies was purchased by southern style nuts and the entire production operation was moved to denison tx  soon after the move in  necco picked up the license to manufacture the squirrel brand company’s brands from southern style nuts at last squirrel nut zippers had come back home to massachusetts where their sweet storied history began over a century ago sweethearts® sweethearts the sweet candy hearts with the quirky sayings have been a beloved childhood staple for many generations and are the bestselling valentine’s day candy each year necco manufactures about two billion hearts in order to keep up with the passionate demand for this american classic given its evergrowing popularity its hard to believe that the concept behind today’s sweethearts was created around the time that abraham lincoln was president the conversation hearts of the ’s mottoes seemed to have come into prominence during the time when “cockles” a small crisp candy made of sugar and flour formed in the shape of a cockle or scallop shell were a favorite on the market the early cockles contained mottoes which were printed on thin colored paper and rolled up inside in the s daniel chase the brother of neccos founder father oliver chase began printing sayings on the candy he experimented first with hand tools and then devised a machine in which a felt roller pad moistened with vegetable coloring usually red pressed against the die the die printed the words on the lozenge paste and the double purpose machine cut the lozenges  grownups were entertained and passed the hearts around at parties for weddings there were weddingday lozenges with humorously longwinded prophecies such as  “married in satin love will not be lasting” “married in pink he will take to drink” and “married in white you have chosen right” the present day sweethearts date back to  back then besides hearts they also produced candy in other various shapes such as postcards baseballs horseshoes and watches while todays sayings are on average much shorter some of the original sayings are still in rotation including be mine be good be true kiss me in honor of neccos th anniversary in  a saying was brought back from the early s the one i love and in  the longtime favorite “let’s read” also reappeared in the mix capturing some classic charm in the early s necco’s then vice president walter marshall began an initiative to update the sayings each year retiring some while adding others the first new phrase “fax me” gained a lot of attention from sweetheart fans following this notable effort   each year necco now receives hundreds of saying suggestions from romantics candy lovers and school kids from old tech call me” to new tech email me sweethearts keep the pulse on the heartbeat of the nation while most people love to eat them sweethearts have also been used in other ingenious ways over the years to propose marriage to teach children statistics and reading to decorate cakes and as borders for frames the uses for this sweet treat are seemingly endless one thing sweetheart lovers can count on each year is the candys simple familiar formula both sweethearts and necco wafers use the same batter sugar corn syrup gelatin gums coloring and flavoring once the dough is rolled out imprinted with sayings and then stamped out in the familiar heart shape it goes through a minute drying cycle to reach its proper consistency to meet the high demand for sweethearts necco continuously produces them from late february through midjanuary of the following year and amazingly the entire annual production approximately  billion individual sweethearts sells out in just six weeks one thing is for sure no matter what the cute sayings are fans will always love to celebrate valentine’s day with sweethearts   maryjane mail  mary janes products mary janes
