topperforming hedge fund is sticking with wagers on a stronger yen and a weaker pound after the positions paid off following the uk referendum to leave the european union the dymon asia currency value fund jumped an estimated  percent on the day the brexit vote result was announced and has gained  percent in the first half of this year for investors using less leverage according to gerald chan head of distribution for dymon asia capital singapore pte fund investors willing to amplify bets through the use of borrowed money saw a  percent return in the six months he said the fund which oversees  million including leverage has outperformed peers as many of the world’s biggest investors have been caught offguard by jolts including government and central bank interventions and political events such as the brexit vote macro funds which trade in the currency stock bond and commodity markets have been stymied by abrupt reversals of trends and exaggerated market swings macro hedge funds managed by brevan howard asset management discovery capital management and omni partners are among those that have posted losses this year the eurekahedge macro hedge fund index edged up  percent in the first half of the year according to preliminary data us outperforms the us is the best performer among major economies and investors will continue to flock to safe assets such as the dollar and gold in the event of a global economic meltdown chan said while the yen will benefit as there isn’t much room for bank of japan to expand easing measures one of our core themes is to be long the dollar gold and yen against a basket of short developed asian currencies such as the korean won taiwan dollar and singapore dollar” chan said as the managers expect the asian currencies to be hurt by a gradual depreciation in the yuan the fund is also short commodityrelated currencies like the australian and new zealand dollars as well as the pound pound bear the fund took a bearish bet on the pound against the dollar in the leadup to the brexit vote dymon fund managers believed the campaign to exit the eu had a  percent chance of winning in the referendum while the markets were pricing in a  percent probability of the remain camp prevailing said chan the dymon fund bought and has kept options against sterling allowing it to profit from the brexit win said chan dymon believes the brexit vote would lead to capital outflows and postponement of investments into the uk because of nearterm uncertainties the country will see an interest rate cut by midjuly and a fall in the pound’s exchange rate to  per dollar he said the pound touched a year low of  last week as property funds froze redemptions echoing the realestate tremors at the start of the  financial crisis bets that the chinese currency would strengthen were the biggest contributor toward the fund’s firsthalf return according to chan it started the year owning options on the expectation of the yuan depreciating in the offshore market it reversed the trade in the first quarter after changes in china’s currencyfixing mechanism convinced dymon’s managers that the government would defend the yuan at all costs when us hedge funds were betting on a collapse of the currency chan said since the end of the first quarter dymon’s managers have been negative on the prospects on the yuan gold bet the fund’s bet on gold prices to rise amid government easing and a growing negative interestrate environment was also a strong contributor toward the firsthalf return according to chan the fund increased the bet after the brexit vote anticipating that governments worldwide may be compelled to continue easing monetary policies and investors would seek to protect their wealth with the metal amid global uncertainties he said wagers on the australian dollar to depreciate against the greenback and yen were also a profit contributor the firm said dymon went bearish on the australian dollar after the country surprised the market by posting a  percent consumer price index decline from the previous quarter in late april leading its central bank to cut interest rates in may by contrast the bank of japan’s surprise announcement of a negative interestrate strategy in late january triggered a plunge in stocks and the yen chan said the fund bought profitable options that bet on the markets underestimating the odds of the australian rate cut and the boj’s restraint from further easing at the end of april he added danny yong a former goldman sachs group inc and citadel trader started dymon asia macro fund with  million in  with billionaireinvestor paul tudor jones’s tudor investment corp as his first outside backer assets of his singaporebased firm have since grown to nearly  billion the  billion flagship fund gained  percent in the first half helped by a  percent profit spurred by brexit said chan the dymon currency fund makes more concentrated investments for clients that desire higher returns and can accept more risks the more leveraged share class started in may  has returned nearly  percent since inception according to chan it continues to see net inflows he said without giving numbers bloomberg stay

mreit data home  how to invest  singapore’s very own investment legend danny yong of dymon asia singapore’s very own investment legend danny yong of dymon asia by ong kai kiat on september   tweet pin it dymon asia was founded by danny yong in  with us million in aum today dymon asia has us billion in assets under management for context only  of hedge fund survive to their th year and only the top  go past the us billion mark dymon asia was ranked no  globally by bloomberg for its  return in  temasek holdings invested  million to start a hedge fund platform with dymon asia in may  danny yong started his career at jp morgan then moving to goldman sachs and citadel before founding dymon asia in the ‘investment legend’ series with the fifth person i have covered famous investors like warren buffet of berkshire hathaway ray dalio of bridgewater associates and david einhorn of greenlight capital all of them are based in the united states but today i would like to introduce to you a local singaporean legend – danny yong founder and chief investment officer of dymon asia dymon asia put singapore on the investment world map and is the first notable largescale hedge fund from singapore with us billion in assets under management aum global recognition for dymon asia so what is so outstanding about dymon asia why does it command global respect and recognition from professional in the ultracompetitive hedge fund industry well first and foremost dymon asia was no  globally among the  topperforming large hedge funds above us billion in aum in  source bloomberg according to bloomberg dymon asia returned  on us billion in aum it is also the only macro strategy hedge fund to make it to the top  the list is dominated by the united states and europe with only three hedge funds from asia featuring – singaporebased quantedge capital at no  with  returns on us billion in aum and hong kongbased golden china at no  with  returns on us billion in aum on a side note quantedge is managed by a team of  math wizards with degrees from harvard wharton oxford mit and berkeley they have a passion for actuarial science – the discipline that applies mathematical and statistical methods to assess risk in insurance finance and other industries and professions in addition to being a global top  performing large hedge fund dymon asia is the only singaporebased macro fund to be recognized by hsbc source hsbc dymon asia did especially well in  returning  when other notable macro funds on the list were returning between  to  in fact dymon’s only calendar year loss was in  when it was founded just before the global financial crises besides accolades from bloomberg and hsbc we have to note that the hedge fund industry is very competitive dymon asia is still going strong in its th year of existence – a milestone less than  of asian hedge funds actually reach in other words more than nine out of ten hedge funds which started the race in  with dymon asia are defunct now due to variety of reasons such as underperformance liquidity and regulatory issues according to cambridge associates source cambridge associates in addition only the top  of asian hedge funds actually cross the us billion in aum mark dymon asia’s success is more notable given that the majority of hedge funds are longshort equity macro hedge funds like dymon asia only form  of hedge funds source cambridge associates lastly it should be noted that temasek holdings invested  million in dymon asia in may  temasek holdings would not invest with yong just because dymon asia is a singapore success story intensive due diligence would have been undertaken before a halfbillion dollar decision is made after all singaporeans have high expectations of our sovereign wealth fund when news of temasek performing well is released it hardly makes a wave however when losses are reported there is a huge public backlash from the populace temasek holding’s ceo ho ching stepped down in february  when the fund lost  billion out of its  billion investment in merrill lynch during the peak of the financial crisis this happened six long years ago but i suspect most people can still recall the merrill lynch fiasco temasek made record net profits of  billion for the financial year of  and total shareholder return was  — the highest in the last five years this was announced recently in july but can you remember it success is taken for granted but failure results in massive public outcry temasek executives have to screen their investments very carefully or risk their careers in the global investment industry hence this  million investment is a strong endorsement of the capabilities of danny yong and dymon asia danny yong’s background dymon asia’s achievements alone would more than justify danny yong inclusion as a local investment legend however yong didn’t come from the most advantageous of family backgrounds and his is a classic ragstoriches story let us trace danny yong’s journey to see how he ended up where he is today yong’s father died of cancer when he was  years old his mom motivated him to work hard so that people will not look down on him as seen from this ntu interview in february  growing up in a single family motivated him to keep pushing his boundaries he would wake up at  am every morning to run and his discipline allowed him to break into the national badminton team at the age of  yong was at catholic junior college then and he had to juggle between his ‘a’ levels studies and the rigours of national team badminton in order to save time yong would sleep at the badminton courts of the singapore badminton association just so he could save the twohour commute to study for his exams and train for badminton this sacrifice is nothing to yong “i don’t think sleeping at the courts was very extreme i had school work to get done and i had to train to stay on top of my chosen sport – i just did what i had to do to me if you want to do something you do it properly” this drive opened the path to nanyang business school in that competitive environment he graduated with a firstclass honours degree in banking and finance in  however this was almost not enough for him to be selected by jp morgan as an asian currency derivatives trader he had to compete with  other applicants for the job and his application was initially placed in the ‘reject’ pile luckily for yong a trader at jp morgan was thumbing through the reject pile and recognised yong’s photo and recused his application from the reject list he eventually went on to secure the job to this day yong admits there that may not be a dymon asia if not for that one small action that changed everything after a threeyear stint with jp morgan yong joined goldman sachs in february  and would end up as the head of trading for south asia derivatives he then joined citadel in november  two years later he became chief investment officer and managing partner at abax global capital which is partly owned by morgan stanley in july  yong founded dymon asia with us million in funding from billionaire trader paul tudor jones’s tudor investment corp a few months later lehman brothers collapsed in september  which sent the global economy into a tailspin yong would eventually part ways with abax in  to focus on dymon asia ingredients for success it is clear that yong has gotten to where he is today based on tenacity hard work and passion yong came from a singleparent family and instead of holding him back he used it to spur him to greater heights while others may have beaten at the cards life deals them he was determined to prove that he was no less able than anyone just because he lost his dad at a young age he carried this tenacity into the other areas of his life and applied the same resolve and hard work in his studies and badminton this enabled him to earn a first class honours degree which opened doors into the financial industry for him even today as the successful founder and cio of a us billion hedge fund yong still brings the same work ethic and high standards into the office every day instead of sleeping overnight at the badminton courts he has graduated to sleeping in his office at times just so he can monitor global markets across different time zones yong continues to work so hard now even though dymon asia is now well established because he loves what he does and his passion for investing “this is what i love doing it’s what i enjoy look at the guys from the us like soros in his s and louis bacon in his s they’re all still going strong to do well in investing one has to be  per cent committed the day one feels like slowing down it is better to just retire in this business you are either  per cent engaged or not at all there is no inbetween i am fortunate that i have a passion for investing if you’re in this only for the money you will burn out quickly and end up quitting altogether” – danny yong nbs alumni his hard work tenacity and passion were all evident when yong first founded dymon asia on the cusp of the global financial crisis immediately after its inception the fund posted its biggest loss of  from july to september  as the crisis started to accelerate that meant that dymon asia lost us million of its investors’ money in the first five months of its launch but yong responded to the setback the way he knows best and powered on taking dymon asia from strength to strength to where it is today conclusion it is not every day that someone becomes the founder of a multibilliondollar hedge fund it requires a certain set of skills talent and drive to reach the top like danny yong but even he admits a little bit of luck came his way as well when a jp morgan trader rescued his application and give him the break he needed in the financial industry but even then if dymon asia never happened one might still think that danny yong would still be a success somewhere else because of his tenacity and drive that’s allowed to deal with adversity that has come his way on his journey to reaching the top are you new to stock investing get up to speed with this quickstart manual thatll show you how to
