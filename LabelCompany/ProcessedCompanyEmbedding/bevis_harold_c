turn over the call to harold bevis our president and chief executive officer who will provide opening remarks harold harold c bevis thank you cliff and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us this afternoon to review xeriums third quarter  results at this time i would like to refer you to the business update slide deck that was posted to our website for this call starting on slide  in the third quarter we had sales of  million up approximately  on a constant currency basis by segment our rolls and service sales were up  primarily due to incremental sales from the companys acquisition of spencer johnston which was completed in the second quarter in the machine clothing business sales declined  compared to the prior year our repositioning projects have generated a large volume of new products that are now in production or existing products which are being manufactured at new locations this has resulted in some production inefficiencies as our team debottlenecks new production which we expect to resolve in  by contrast the demand side of the equation speaks to the success of our repositioning as highlighted by the growth in our backlog compared to the prior year third quarter adjusted ebitda was  million or  of sales compared to  million or  of sales for the prior year before getting into the details its important to put the comparable in context as the yearoveryear change included a  million negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates on an applestoapples basis our operating ebitda margin was down approximately  million to  million compared to the prior year the main issues for the decline in adjusted ebitda are production problems in two of the companys machine clothing plants where they have both missed output and have margin compression in the machine clothing business particularly in latin america we expect similar conditions in q and therefore we are revising our fullyear adjusted ebitda outlook to be approximately  million we believe these conditions will be temporary and we will discuss them further as weve previously reported we closed on the refinancing of all of the companys outstanding debt in the third quarter this was an important milestone for our company and allows sufficient time for us to execute our deleveraging plan this action was additive to our debt in the quarter based on the fees associated with the refinancing and based upon our current plan this marks the peak of our leverage through this investment cycle associated with the repositioning of the company turning to cash flow we have now reported our third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow following the completion of our repositioning investments over the prior couple of years in the quarter free cash flow was  million which compares to  million usage of cash last year notably higher free cash flow was achieved just by a  million unfavorable impact from a shift in interest payment timing relating to our refinancing yeartodate weve generated  million of free cash flow moving to slide  in the third quarter we continued to implement the companys repositioning plan as i previously noted our accelerated capex cycle is now complete and we are moving to the execution and rampup phase of our strategic plan this includes more than  million of growth capacity which we have installed globally combined with a total of  million in product introductions  million of which were in field trial in the third quarter of  with respect to our cost reduction programs our team has continued to work diligently to identify opportunities to improve our margin profile and in the third quarter we realized  million of gross cost takeout these efforts are most apparent on the sga line for us which delivered a  basis point reduction versus prior year additionally we have implemented the lean six sigma program at all  plants globally during the second year of the program projects have been aimed at waste reduction lead time reduction and quality improvement becoming operationally leaner and efficient has been a goal of ours and through lean six sigma we look to further enhance improvements weve made already the combination of lower capital spending the reduction of costs the benefits of a repositioned company in the right markets with right products has led to a sharp improvement in our cash flow compared to prior year we continue to expect a total of  million to  million of free cash flow for this year and consistent with our prior communications we expect to continue to generate free cash flow and pay down debt for the foreseeable future and it is the top priority our top priority to reduce our leverage back to normal levels turning to backlog on page  our backlog has improved over the past year this improvement is the direct result of the success of our repositioning projects and wins from our new products we have maintained our focus where the market is strongest both geographically and by end market and by end market this includes a focus on markets which are growing which include pulp boxboard containerboard and tissue this market growth is driven by a secular shift in consumer behavior away from brickandmortar to click shopping and we are happy to report that we have been successful in penetrating these markets moving to our revised expectations which is also detailed in our press release we have reduced our fullyear adjusted ebitda expectation to approximately  million from  million at the prior midpoint looking at slide  the main driver of our revised guidance is due to gross margin issues which i would like to cover our sales sga and free cash flow are fine our gross margins have been compressed and the main problems are relating to production problems at two of our plants and margin compression in machine clothing business particularly in brazil we view these issues as temporary and we are already underway with correcting our production problems with respect to the impact of currency we are shifting our production appropriately to line up to our lowest cost facilities with as much volume as possible in order to offset currency headwinds while we expect these actions to show a meaningful improvement to our ebitda margins we do expect it to take a few quarters to fully implement aside from these issues we are working to address our sales are on plan our cost out programs continue to progress on plan and in addition we are also able to constantly hold our free cash flow guidance despite lower operating ebitda through the implementation of tight working capital management and tight capital spending management as we turn to close out  we are in an exciting and challenging time for our company our repositioning projects are largely complete and our new products are providing a meaningful offset to declining rates and our backlog is strengthening cash flow has been positive all year and as a result of our refinancing we have sufficient runway ahead of us to execute our new leveraging plans we expect q to be similar to q with the gross margin compression issues covered earlier however we do expect these results to be significantly better than q of  with that ill turn the call over to cliff for a closer look at the numbers clifford pietrafitta thank you harold moving to our financials on slide  revenue in the third quarter of  was  million compared with the prior quarter of  million on a constant currency basis sales were up  compared to the third quarter of  higher sales during the period reflected a  yearoveryear increase in the companys roll covers segment mainly attributable to the recent acquisition of spencer johnston partially offset by a  decrease in machine clothing on a constant currency basis the decline in machine clothing was primarily due to temporary production output issues in north america which the company is in the process of addressing by division our machine clothing segment net sales decreased  on a constant currency basis to  million in the third quarter of  compared to  million in the third quarter of  the decline was mostly from decreased volume in north america indiscernible machine clothing gross margin excluding plant startup costs was  in q  compared to  in q  the decline in gross profit margin reflects higher brazilian cost and inflation unfavorable product mix and margin compression in certain regions moving to our rolls segment net sales for the third quarter of  increased  at constant currency coming in at  million compared with the prior year level of  million higher rolls sales were the result of our acquisition of spencer johnston rolls gross margin excluding startup costs in the third quarter of  was  compared to third quarter of  gross margin of  the decline was primarily due to higher brazilian cost and inflation and unfavorable product mix moving back to our consolidated results third quarter  adjusted ebitda was  million before giving effect to  million of negative foreign exchange impacts compared with the third quarter of  adjusted ebitda of  million as previously mentioned our ebitda was held down by lower gross margin rates due to the issues previously discussed but was partially offset by lower sga cost driven by our cost down programs cash taxes were  million in q  for the full year  we expect that cash taxes will be approximately  million cash taxes are primarily impacted by income the company earns in tax paying jurisdictions relative to income it earns in nontaxpaying jurisdictions primarily the united states on a gaap basis third quarter  loss per share was  compared to third quarter  earnings per share of  nongaap third quarter  basic earnings per share was  per share compared to third quarter nongaap  basic earnings per share of  free cash flow was  million in the quarter compared to third quarter  free cash flow of negative  million the increase is primarily the result of our reduced capital expenditures and includes a  million unfavorable impact from the refinancing as we have stated before it is our priority to delever and use available cash to pay down debt our net debt at the end of the third quarter of  was  million the increase in debt from the third quarter of  is primarily due to the acquisition of spencer johnston and costs associated with our debt refinancing completed during this third quarter our net debt leverage ratio on a pro forma basis is x after factoring in the impact of the spencer johnston acquisition turning to slide  id like to review the big picture compared to prior year brazil economic impacts were the biggest issue the company has faced this year negatively impacting our  yeartodate adjusted ebitda by approximately  million secondly as previously mentioned we have experienced some production issues which have impacted our gross margins and are in the process of being corrected next we have been actively introducing new products to the market which will allow us to penetrate new sales areas and contribute to profitability in the future in summary we now expect full year adjusted ebitda to be approximately  million assuming our current sales production and currency outlook we continue to expect  free cash flow to be in the range of  million to  million i will now turn the call back over to harold for final comments before we take your questions harold c bevis thank you cliff as we assess our progress were excited to be fully repositioning xerium to address the changed market and while our metrics are not uniformly positive we are beginning to see the benefits of our restructuring in the underlying cash generating power of our business we are gaining traction with new products and in new geographies and we are confident of our ability to generate strong returns for our shareholders id like to thank our shareholders and our bondholders for their ongoing support and our employees for their dedication to providing worldclass products and services to our customers operator with that id like to open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of anthony young your line is open anthony young just to understand the cost side a little bit better in the bold points you guys talked about unfavorable currency impact of  million i mean is that currency impact a translation impact like one time in the quarter or is your cost structure sort of higher now than probably in the past harold c bevis anthony  million of the  million relates to an fx gain that was in the third quarter of  which was not present in  the rest of that the other  million relates to combination translation transaction currency effects that we experienced during the quarter anthony young okay thats helpful and then on the capex you have capex at  million or your gaap capex for the quarter  million are you guys really is this are you at a maintenance level or are you below a maintenance level or do you think this is sustainable harold c bevis our maintenance level is about  million a year and were spending about  million so were doing  million of discretionary projects both on cost out and on repositioning most of it is on repositioning so we are still moving assets to emerging countries and expanding capacity – one of our problems as i mentioned is that we are bottlenecked a little bit on some of our successful new product rampups and weve had to install new capacity to keep up and bring other plants into the production of those products so most of the discretionary spending is around the commercial repositioning and were way above maintenance level thats just  million anthony young okay and just to circle back on the brazil servicing i mean was it a new – what were some of the problems that you were having there i guess as far – the two facilities you said you were having problems i think they were in brazil what are some of the problems you are having there specifically and was there a workforce problem or… harold c bevis theres two things on the production problems that were having they are at two plants in north america and it is our two machine clothing plants in north america we only have two starkville mississippi and kentville nova scotia canada both of them are very backed up with long lead times and we had irregular wins so the wins have been clogged up under certain machines and we werent ready for that and we now have redistributed the production to some other global plants as well as expanding our capacity and ability to get further output from those plants so the plant issues were associated with holding our sales back in north america really because weve had a lot of new wins in tissue and in board and packaging and we were clogged up in the plants the margin compression issue which is brazil is twofold it is inflation being much higher than we expected the inflation rates this year which were statutory have come in around  and most of our plants settled in this quarter and the reais has been appreciating so we have a doublewhammy the market is in sales dollars is a us sales dollar market and our costs are in reais and so weve had our cost going up and then translation in the us dollars going down and so it showed up on the cogs line because our sga we called in check there and showed progress on the sga line and so what brazil has gone through this year has cost us  million yearoveryear we didnt foresee that we saw a portion of it in the last quarter and we now are convinced ph that this is a steadystate situation and weve embedded it into our outlook so were expecting that one to hang around for a few quarters weve looked at the inflation outlooks and the currency outlooks there is a better feeling now that they have indiscernible president of brazil but we view this as being gradual so that is two separate issues that have impacted us there anthony anthony young okay right now this is helpful i appreciate the additional color on the situation thanks guys operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of john rolfe from argand capital your line is open john rolfe you mentioned in slide  that youre committed to doing about  million of free cash flow indiscernible harold c bevis yes john rolfe can you kind of give us the components of that from ebitda interest expense cash taxes and capex i guess indiscernible harold c bevis i can tell you that our operating discipline here is to not spend money until we have the money so we first monitor our operating cash inflows from the business and were maintaining a very high level of buffer and then we decide the pace at which were going to do our investments and so were able to tightly shift our free cash flow guidance with regards to the components of cash inflow and outflow cliff do you want to walk through that clifford pietrafitta sure john we just did the refi of the bond so we got about  million interest not going forward with the new debt structure our capital expenditures this year were probably about  million and our cash taxes as we mentioned in the press release about  million so if you add that up about  million we are running about  million it will be in the low  million going forward so basically were talking about the  million is really the difference between those rough members i just gave you john rolfe okay so is it fair to assume though i mean going forward i would assume that you guys would hope to be growing that ebitda number modestly kind of yearoveryear and at the same time i would assume that we should see that interest expense start to creep down as you pay off some debt are those both reasonable assumptions harold c bevis yes john this is harold were not going to give  ebitda guidance right now but we do see our margin compression issues as being temporary they are definitely holding back our ebitda right now so yes we do see an improvement in that dynamic and we see it over the next couple of quarters but with regards to the production issues they are already underway as a matter of fact so we do see strengthening in our volumes as our new products take hold and we are working to maintain good lead times as we enter and penetrate into these new markets so we do see increasing volumes and we do see our current margin issues subsiding and our rolls business is doing quite well the spencer johnston pickup has really helped us in a lot of specialty services and they are mainly not in paper and so they are really helping our diversification efforts so we do see a rising ebitda but were not going to give numbers regarding  at this moment in time john rolfe understood i was just trying to understand kind of directionally as we look out over that four year period so youve talked a little about ebitda and i assume that youre still committed to paying down debt so we should see that interest expense coming down over time as well is that a right assumption harold c bevis thats right john rolfe okay harold c bevis yes youre correct and if and when the ebitda correction happens and we have higher free cash flow we will definitely strongly consider paying down more debt than that but right now our model is conservative and were just basing our outlook on these numbers that weve shared with you today operator there are no further audio questions at this time id like to turn the call back over to harold bevis harold c bevis thank you very much for calling in we appreciate it and we look forward to speaking with you in the next call we are very happy with the repositioning efforts that are underway at the company were working on these temporary margin issues that have held back our ebitda for the moment and we look forward to reporting our progress in the next call together thank you operator this concludes todays conference call you may now disconnect copyright policy
