carbon corporation employees  sales  billion  naic  basic chemical manufacturing union carbide corporation is the worlds largest producer of ethylene glycol commonly used as antifreeze and is a leading manufacturer of the worlds most widely used plastic polyethylene in spite of a disaster at its bhopal india pesticide plant in  that resulted in numerous deaths and serious health problems for people living in the region as well as a devastating takeover attempt that followed the corporation remained one of top  exporters in the united states in the early s union carbide pioneered the petrochemicals industry and introduced the first two modern plastics the company became known as chemist to the chemical industry and metallurgist to the metals industry because of its production of many of the building blocks of those two industries origins the union carbide  carbon corporation ucc was formed in  from the combination of four companies union carbide co incorporated  linde air products co incorporated  national carbon co inc incorporated  and prestolite co inc incorporated  the new entity was organized as a holding company with its four members acting relatively autonomously and cooperating where their businesses converged the merger combined what had often been competing interests to form an industrial chemicals powerhouse the oldest member of the quartet union carbide had been formed to manufacture calcium carbide which was used in the production of metal alloys a byproduct of alloying calcium carbide with aluminum was acetylene a gas that company executives hoped would prove useful for street and household lighting when thomas edisons electric incandescent light bulbs proved more practical for most lighting however it looked as if union carbides acetylene lighting business was obsolete luckily a french researcher discovered that acetylene could be burned in oxygen to produce a hot metalcutting flame a whole new market for the gas emerged and ucc was ready to take advantage of it the company continued to manufacture calcium carbide at plants in sault ste marie michigan and niagara falls new york and by  the union carbides capital stock stood at  million union carbide combined americas first commercial highcarbon ferrochrome process which had been developed by company founder major james t moorhead in the late s with a metal alloying business acquired in  the subsidiary created a line of metals composed of iron and one or more other metals known in the industry as ferroalloys ferroalloys made the production of alloy steels more efficient because they could be incorporated more easily with steel to create new metals with specific properties union carbides lowcarbon ferrochrome for example was a precursor of modern stainless steel union carbide had been involved with the linde air products co through joint acetylene experiments for about six years before the formation of the ucc holding company as one of americas first oxygenproducing concerns and after  part of one of the countrys largest chemical companies linde soon became the worlds largest producer of industrial gases such as acetylene hydrogen and nitrogen these gases formed the foundation of the petrochemical industry the prestolite company had been one of union carbides primary competitors for most of the two companies histories but three years of cooperative acetylene experiments among ucc prestolite and linde made the merger smoother before the turn of the th century national carbon co had produced the first commercial dry cell battery and offered it under the eveready trademark the wellknown brand would be a ucc staple for the next seven decades with combined research efforts and a national push for new technologies to help win world war i further developments came in rapid succession at union carbide new products included batteries for portable radios and corrosion and heatresistant ferroalloys that strengthened the steel used to build skyscrapers bridges and automobiles the governments need for ethylene during the great war also generated interest in hydrocarbon byproducts these substances were made from calcium carbide and would later become the raw materials for the production of plastics synthetic rubber fibers solvents explosives and industrial chemicals in  the first production of synthetic ethylene began ethylene would develop into the industrys most important industrial hydrocarbon eventually used in polyethylene plastics polystyrene styrofoam and antifreeze among other products union carbides prestone brand ethylene glycol soon became the topselling antifreeze a position it held throughout the th century the new corporate structure enabled ucc to leverage the combined assets of its four primary subsidiaries and embark on an acquisitions spree that was not halted even by the great depression in  alone the company acquired an acetylene manufacturer created canadian subsidiaries of national carbon co and prestolite and purchased a new headquarters at nd street and madison avenue in new york city this new home served the company until the late s during the s union carbide expanded its overseas interests with the acquisition of a norwegian hydroelectric plant in  and a calcium carbideferroalloy plant in that same country in  the holding company added to its battery business with the purchase of manhattan electrical supply co in  ucc annexed two domestic industrial gas interests in  and strengthened its industrial electric furnace business with the acquisition of the acheson graphite corporation in  us vanadium co acquired one of the most vital acquisitions ucc made during the s was that of us vanadium cos colorado mine mill and reduction plant in  carbides subsequent vanadium research was a truly corporate venture that coordinated several of the companys subsidiaries and eventually involved the company in the governments atomic energy program uraniumbearing materials were located and provided by us vanadium ucc scientists demonstrated that gaseous diffusion could be used to separate quantities of uranium and contracted with the federal government in  to operate the oak ridge gaseous diffusion plant after intensive research uccs linde company perfected a refining process for treating uranium concentrates a plant was built and operated by the electro metallurgical company acquired in  to provide extensive metallurgical research and manufacture uranium finally union carbide and carbon research laboratories contributed to the development of the atomic weapon itself in  ucc acquired the bakelite corporation which developed the first modern plastic phenol formaldehyde in  carbide made permanentpress fabrics possible with its development of glyoxal union carbide earned a reputation for developing raw materials for the chemical and metals industries during world war ii since natural rubber was in very short supply during the war the company resumed its experiments with butene a hydrocarbon that was developed into a synthetic rubber modern neoprene is a familiar example of butenes application postwar prosperity camouflaged nagging problems at ucc the company was chalking up a bad track record of discovering new substances and processes but not capitalizing on them for example ucc pioneered urethanes but did not commit enough financial resources to the new field in time to profit the company also made permanentpress fabrics possible with its development of glyoxal but could not come up with a consumer product that maximized its profit potential it often ended up riding the coattails of movements it had spawned union carbides program of internal promotion engendered company loyalty but it also stifled creativity the company started a slide into relative mediocrity that with few exceptions would consume the next three decades company perspectives union carbide corporation is a chemical and polymers company with over  employees the company possesses some of the industrys most advanced process and catalyst technologies and operates some of the most costefficient largescale production facilities in the world union carbide primarily produces chemicals and polymers that undergo one or more further conversions by customers before reaching consumers some of these materials are highvolume commodities while others are specialty products meeting the needs of smaller market niches the enduses served include paints and coatings packaging wire and cable household products personal care pharmaceuticals automotive textiles agriculture and oil and gas a succession of wellmeaning chief executives kept ucc in turnaround mode under the direction of cfo morse g dial carbide absorbed its major operating subsidiaries and formally relinquished its holding company status in  dial hoped to reverse the excessive autonomy at ucc by creating a presidents office composed of the corporations division heads the company name was changed to union carbide corporation in  to reflect its reorganization from a holding company to a diversified corporation by that time union carbide and carbon corporation had established some  plants in the united states and canada in addition to overseas affiliates the company went from having  autonomous divisions to just four primary domestic groups union carbide chemicals co linde co union carbide plastics co and union carbide consumer products co even though these corporate segments were technically divisions the retention of the word company in each sections name represented the perpetuation of the decentralized management structure of a holding company and its detrimental effect on union carbide continued ucc develops polyethylene polyethylene a plastic used in squeeze bottles highdensity polyethylene as well as in films and sheeting lowdensity polyethylene became union carbides largest dollarvolume product after world war ii an olefins division was set up in the s to supply lowcost raw materials for the chemicals and plastics industry in the s for several years the company sold these plastics to other manufacturers however carbide finally did capitalize on this discovery in  when glad branded plastic wraps bags and straws were introduced within just four years glad became the leading brand in its market by the s union carbide occupied the top spot in many of its primary fields including industrial gases carbon electrodes for industrial electric furnaces batteries atomic energy polyethylene plastic and ferroalloys in  the conglomerates sales topped  billion for the first time from  to  union carbide parlayed a few plants in a dozen countries into  major subsidiary and associated companies with plants in  countries serving over  markets international operations of the conglomerate contributed  percent of its annual sales and by middecade the company name was changed to union carbide international co to reflect its increased global presence in spite of consistently rising sales which doubled from  to  to  million union carbides profits plummeted and stayed low from  to  carbide could claim leading market shares but top shares of lowmargin commodities still equaled low profits industrywide overcapacity in ferroalloys ran as high as  percent in the early s and prices for these products fell  percent the company was compelled to cut its ferroalloys work force by  percent and close a major plant at niagara falls to make matters worse the market for lowdensity polyethylene stagnated for the first time in over  years union carbide was still the secondlargest chemical producer in the united states but it invariably lagged behind most of its competitors in terms of growth and profitability during this period misguided investments in petroleum pharmaceuticals semiconductors mattresses and undersea equipment combined with a  billion petrochemicals complex at taft louisiana which ran in the red for the last three years of the s further tarnished union carbides standing not surprisingly the conglomerates stock dropped from  in  to  in  as the company earned a reputation for aimless fumbling according to business week unfortunately for union carbide environmental complaints about the companys marietta ohio ferroalloy plant came to a head in  when consumer champion ralph nader brought a decade of local residents complaints into the national spotlight for four years the conglomerate had largely ignored public and government efforts to make it clean up several plants that were polluting the air over west virginia union carbides resistance to outside influence gave it the public image of a reactionary bully concerned only with profits and scornful of the environment a stigma that the company would bear for years to come in  ucc capitulated to federal orders that it immediately use more expensive lowsulphur coal to reduce noxious sulfur dioxide emissions by  percent the company was given a fall  deadline to install  million in advanced emissions scrubbers the bad news continued as the recession of  and  hammered commodities companies like ucc with the chemicals and plastics markets entering another cycle of overcapacity from  to  uccs sales grew by only  percent annually well below the industry average cfo and president f perry wilson who had been promoted to those offices in  made his bid to turn union carbide around his restructuring plan included three primary changes first he tried to pare back peripheral activities and focus on plastics and chemicals among the businesses sold were a bedding company most of uccs oil and gas interests a pollutionmonitoring devices business a plastic container line a fibers business a jewelry line and an insect repellant business second he worked to shift the corporate focus from market share to profitability finally wilson tried to plan capital and capacity investments so that ucc could avoid the inefficiencies and plummeting prices that had accompanied industrywide overcapacity in the past key dates  the company is incorporated as union carbide  carbon corporation and acquires

tosco corporation  union carbide is acquired by the dow chemical company a new business development department was formed in  to coordinate the three areas outside of chemicals and plastics that wilson did not sell biomedical systems marine foods and agricultural systems another key organizational change was the disbanding of the consumer  related products division which had contributed  percent of uccs annual revenues the eveready business was split off into a battery products division while glad and prestone were coordinated in a division with the production of their raw materials despite the fragmentation of the consumer products division wilson said that he hoped that consumer products would contribute  percent of uccs revenues in the future he recognized that these relatively stable highmargin product lines sustained union carbide through economic downturns for a few years it looked as if the new strategy was working from  to  earnings per share rose  percent ucc increased productivity dramatically during the late s and early s to keep its corporate head above water from  to  physical output of chemicals and plastics rose  percent while perpound production costs were cut by onethird william s sneath continued these trends when he became chairman and ceo in  still the company found itself increasingly strapped for cash steadily rising expenses in europe resulted in a  million loss in  which forced carbide to divest virtually all of its european petrochemicals and plastics operations that same year ucc was forced by its creditors to retire  million in longterm debt which forced it to borrow another  million in  that year carbides standard  poors credit rating fell from aa to a and its stock fell as low as  percent below its  book value chairman sneath embarked on another round of costcutting in  pruning the executive staff by  and divesting a total of  businesses sneath retained five primary businesses graphite electrodes batteries agricultural products polyethylene and industrial gases by  carbide had  employees at over  plants mines and laboratories in  countries bringing in over  billion in annual sales sneath embarked on a plan to invest profits into highmargin consumer goods and specialty chemicals disaster strikes in india the disaster at union carbides pesticide plant in bhopal india in december  struck the corporation just as it was beginning to make lasting strides toward profitability ucc had established battery plants in india as early as the mids and had seven plants with  employees there by  indias chronic food shortages precipitated a governmentsponsored green revolution in the s with the countrys socialist government eager to join union carbide in establishing pesticide and fertilizer plants in  the indian government granted union carbide a license to manufacture pesticides and a plant was built on the sparsely populated outskirts of the regional capital of bhopal the plant drew more than  people to bhopal by  this plant was built owned and operated by union carbide india limited ucil in which union carbide corporation held just over half the stock in december  at least five tons of methyl isocyanate gas mic seeped out of the plant over a  minute period union carbide maintained that the accident which killed  people and permanently injured another  was sabotage newsweek magazine called the incident the worst industrial accident in history according to a statement posted on the union carbide web site an initial investigation by union carbide experts reported that a large volume of water had apparently been introduced into the mic tank causing a chemical reaction forcing the chemical release valve to open and allowed the gas to leak a committee of experts working on behalf of the indian government conducted its own investigation and reached the same conclusion an independent investigation by the engineering consulting firm arthur d little determined that the water could only have been introduced into the tank deliberately since safety systems were in place and operational that would have prevented water from entering the tank by accident five senior indian executives of union carbide were arrested the indian government charged warren anderson chairman of union carbides board with corporate and criminal liability and accused the union carbide management of cruel and wanton negligence many class action suits were filed against union carbide on behalf of the victims in april  a court in india ordered carbide to pay  million in interim damages union carbide and the indian government reached a muchcriticized settlement for  million in  in  carbide sold its share of the bhopal plant to macleod russell india limited proceeds of the sale were used to fund a hospital in bhopal for victims of the tragedy in addition to the human toll the incident set off a chain reaction at carbide by  the companys market value dropped by twothirds to less than  billion and gaf corporations samuel heyman accumulated enough stock to mount a hostile takeover bid of  billion after working for two decades to expand its consumer products lines carbide was forced to sell off its consumer products division a profitable group that included glad trash bags eveready batteries prestone and stp automotive products for  million the corporation borrowed  billion raised a total of  billion in asset sales and repurchased  billion in stock to repulse heymans attack carbide scaled back to the three main business lines chemicals and plastics industrial gases and carbon products that were once its strength and benefited from sharply reduced interest rates and falling costs of petrochemical feedstocks nevertheless the company had lost the safety net provided by its consumer products union carbides debt stood at  percent of capital and its equity was cut to a quarter of its former value income rose  percent in  to  million but high debt service made it hard for the company to develop and introduce new products in  ucc reduced its debt by more than  million and increase equity by almost  million by  union carbides corporate identity had begun to take clearer shape sales hit  billion onethird below the  peak profits were up to more than  million and the company had a new ceo robert d kennedy his goals for the company included growth an ambitious prospect in the face of depleted finances his solution was to trim operating expenses and generate profits between  and  payroll was reduced from  employees to  while carbide set up joint ventures with british petroleum co and alliedsignal corporation and made a few modest acquisitions in  carbide advanced slightly on its long journey toward financial recovery net income was  million profits in the chemicals and plastics divisions put carbide in the number two spot on the list of the top ten publicly traded companies in america the company succeeded in reducing its debttocapital ratio to below  percent and invested  million in research and development that year the company introduced its proprietary lihde oxygen combustion system which used pure oxygen to burn organic wastes carbides fate was far from settled a  billion debt stymied both diversification and overseas expansion carbides sales were dependent on cyclical commodities such as polyethylene and as the chemical industry stumbled earnings declined net income decreased  percent from  the brightest prospects were in the industrial gas unit carbide remained number one in north america in that industry with  billion in sales the company launched a work simplification program in the early s the program had a cost reduction goal of  million a year by the end of  carbide progressed toward this goal by repurchasing  million shares spinning off two small businesses and selling  percent of its carbon business in  as a fitting mark to union carbides th anniversary in  the company had the years bestperforming stock on the dow jones list of  industrials carbide was half way to achieving its  million cost reduction goal and had endured a loss of  million the dramatically smaller corporation had shifted its focus from diversification to becoming a lowcost leader in basic chemicals this strategy included uncharacteristic environmentalism carbide anticipated inevitable government mandates on waste reduction and recycling when it started reprocessing plastic bottles in  after bhopal uccs efforts helped raise industry performance standards and levels worldwide and the company was praised for its responsible care efforts expansion through joint ventures during the s union carbide expanded its business worldwide by engaging in joint ventures with both american and foreign companies in  carbide announced a joint venture with enichem a european chemicals company to develop manufacture and sell polyethylene under the name polimeri europa each company would own  percent of the new firm the arrangement would make carbide and enichem the largest producers of polyethylene in western europe enichems existing polyethylene plants in germany france and italy were made part of the new company while a new tonsayear plant in brindisi italy was planned the year  saw further expansion internationally when carbide announced a joint venture with chinas shanghai petrochemical co ltd to manufacture and sell latex polymer emulsions under the name shanghai petrochemical union carbide emulsion systems co ltd the new company would construct a plant in jinshanwei china near shanghai a second expansion into the chinese market came later in  with carbides subsidiary amerchol corp announcing that it would be constructing a plant in guangdong province china carbide teamed with exxon chemical company in  to create the joint venture company univation technologies combining both carbides and exxons patented polyethylene manufacturing processes univation would manufacture polyethylene using these processes and license the technologies univation would also license the super condensed mode technology which doubles polyethylene production carbide expanded its presence in asia with the  announcement of a joint venture with petronas the national oil company of malaysia the two firms would build a petrochemical complex in malaysia focusing on ethylene oxide and its derivatives and oxo alcohols and oxo derivatives in  the kerteh integrated petrochemicals complex opened with union carbide owning  percent of the project another joint venture was announced in  carbide and tosco corp joined in a – venture to combine their polypropylene business the deal was expected to take carbide ranked eighth in north america among makers of polypropylene into the top five producers under the agreement tosco would build a  millionpoundperyear plant in linden new jersey while carbide would contribute its two plants in seadrift texas and norco louisiana acquisition by dow chemical on august   it was announced that union carbide would become a subsidiary of the dow chemical company the next two years saw negotiations between the two firms on the terms of the deal negotiations were also held with the european commission and the federal trade commission to get government approval of such a large merger as part of the agreement dow was obliged to divest some of its holdings including its gasphase polyethylene metallocene technology while carbide had to divest its  percent ownership in polimeri europa its joint venture with enichem finally all discussion was over and dow acquired carbide for  billion on february   the deal created the worlds secondlargest chemical company just behind dupont according to michael parker chairman and ceo of dow quoted by robert brown in chemical market reporter while the negotiations took longer than first imagined we are pleased with the outcome and consider it a winwin for everyone involved union carbide chairman and ceo william h joyce called the deal according to joseph chang in chemical market reporter the right move at a good time in a consolidating chemical industry where fewer more powerful companies will exist the combination of dow and union carbide now sets the standard for the industry since the acquisition carbide has seen generally positive financial growth in  the company posted net sales of  billion and a profit of  million in  net sales were  billion with a profit of  million the next two years saw losses on lower net sales  sales were  billion with a loss of  million while  sales were  billion with a loss of  million in  however carbide moved into the black again with net sales of  billion and a profit of  million this trend continued in  with net sales of  billion and a profit of  million for the first quarter of  carbide reported net sales of  billion and a profit of  million as union carbide faced the st century with rising sales and profits its chemical products

metals composed of iron and one or more other metals known in the industry as ferroalloys ferroalloys made the production of alloy steels more efficient because they could be incorporated more easily with steel to create new metals with specific properties union carbide’s lowcarbon ferrochrome for example was a precursor of modern stainless steel union carbide had been involved with the linde air products co through joint acetylene experiments for about six years before the formation of the ucc holding company as one of america’s first oxygenproducing concerns and after  part of one of the country’s largest chemical companies linde soon became the world’s largest producer of industrial gases like acetylene hydrogen and nitrogen these gases formed the foundation of the petrochemical industry the prestolite company had been one of union carbide’s primary competitors for most of the two companies’ histories but three years of cooperative acetylene experiments among ucc prestolite and linde made the merger more smooth before the turn of the century national carbon co had produced the first commercial dry cell battery and offered it under the eveready trademark the wellknown brand would be a ucc staple for the next seven decades with combined research efforts and a national push for new technologies to help win world war i new developments came in rapid succession at union carbide new products included batteries for portable radios and corrosion and heatresistant ferroalloys that strengthened the steel used to build skyscrapers bridges and automobiles the government’s need for ethylene during “the great war” also generated interest in hydrocarbon byproducts these substances were made from calcium carbide and would later become the raw materials for the production of plastics synthetic rubber fibers solvents explosives and industrial chemicals in  the first production of synthetic ethylene began ethylene would develop into the industry’s most important industrial hydrocarbon eventually used in polyethylene plastics polystyrene styrofoam and antifreeze among other products union carbide’s prestone brand ethylene glycol soon became the topselling antifreeze a position it held throughout the twentieth century the new corporate structure enabled ucc to leverage the combined assets of its four primary subsidiaries and embark on an acquisitions spree that wasn’t even halted by the great depression in  alone the company acquired an acetylene manufacturer created canadian subsidiaries of national carbon co and prestolite and purchased a new headquarters at nd street and madison avenue in new york city this new home served the company until the late s during the s union carbide expanded its overseas interests with the acquisition of a norwegian hydroelectric plant in  and a calcium carbideferroalloy plant in that same country in  the holding company added to its battery business with the purchase of manhattan electrical supply co in  ucc annexed two domestic industrial gases interests in  and strengthened its industrial electric furnace business with the acquisition of the acheson graphite corporation in  one of ucc’s most vital acquisitions of the s was the purchase of us vanadium co’s colorado mine mill and reduction plant in  carbide’s subsequent vanadium research was a truly corporate venture that coordinated several of the company’s subsidiaries and eventually involved the company in the government’s atomic energy program uraniumbearing materials were located and provided by us vanadium ucc scientists demonstrated that gaseous diffusion could be used to separate quantities of uranium and contracted with the federal government in  to operate the oak ridge gaseous diffusion plant after intensive research ucc’s linde company perfected a refining process for treating uranium concentrates a plant was built and operated by the electro metallurgical company acquired in  to provide extensive metallurgical research and manufacture uranium finally union carbide and carbon research laboratories contributed to the development of the atomic weapon itself in  ucc acquired the bakelite corporation which developed the first modern plastic phenol formaldehyde and in  carbide made permanentpress fabrics possible with its development of glyoxal union carbide earned a reputation for developing raw materials for the chemical and metals industries during world war ii since natural rubber was in very short supply during the war the company resumed its experiments with butene a hydrocarbon that was developed into a synthetic rubber modern neoprene is a familiar example of butene’s application postwar prosperity camouflaged nagging problems at ucc the company was chalking up a bad track record of discovering new substances and processes but not capitalizing on them for example ucc pioneered urethanes but didn’t commit enough financial resources to the new field in time to profit the company also made permanentpress fabrics possible with its development of glyoxal but couldn’t come up with a consumer product that maximized its profit potential it often ended up riding the coattails of movements it had spawned union carbide’ s program of internal promotion engendered company loyalty but also stifled creativity the company started a slide into relative mediocrity that with few exceptions would consume the next three decades a succession of wellmeaning chief executives kept ucc in “turnaround mode” under the direction of cfo morse g dial carbide absorbed its major operating subsidiaries and formally relinquished its holding company status in  dial hoped to reverse the excessive autonomy at ucc by creating a “president’s office” composed of the corporation’s division heads the company name was changed to union carbide corporation in  to reflect its reorganization from a holding company to a diversified corporation by that time union carbide and carbon corporation had established some  plants in the united states and canada in addition to overseas affiliates the company went from having  autonomous divisions to just four primary domestic groups union carbide chemicals co linde co union carbide plastics co and union carbide consumer products co even though these corporate segments were technically divisions the retention of the word “company” in each section’s name represented the perpetuation of the decentralized management structure of a holding company and its detrimental effect on union carbide continued polyethylene a plastic used in squeeze bottles highdensity polyethylene as well as in films and sheeting lowdensity polyethylene became union carbide’s largest dollarvolume product after world war ii an olefins division was set up in the s to supply lowcost raw materials for the chemicals and plastics industry in the s for several years the company sold these plastics to other manufacturers but carbide finally capitalized on this discovery in  when glad branded plastic wraps bags and straws were introduced within just four years glad became the leading brand in its market by the s union carbide occupied the top spot in many of its primary fields including industrial gases carbon electrodes for industrial electric furnaces batteries atomic energy polyethylene plastic and ferroalloys in  the conglomerate’s sales topped  billion for the first time and from  to  union carbide parlayed a few plants in a dozen countries into  major subsidiary and associated companies with plants in  countries serving over  markets international operations of the conglomerate contributed  percent of its annual sales and middecade the company name was changed to union carbide international co to reflect its increased global presence but in spite of consistently rising sales which doubled from  to  to  million union carbide’s profits plummeted and stayed low from  to  carbide could claim leading market shares but top shares of lowmargin commodities still equaled low profits industrywide overcapacity in ferroalloys ran as high as  percent in the early s and prices for these products fell  percent the company was compelled to cut its ferroalloys work force by  percent and close a major plant at niagara falls to make matters worse the market for lowdensity polyethylene stagnated for the first time in over  years union carbide was still the united states’ secondlargest chemical producer but it invariably lagged behind most of its competitors in terms of growth and profitability during this period misguided investments in petroleum pharmaceuticals semiconductors mattresses and undersea equipment combined with a  billion petrochemicals complex at taft louisiana which ran in the red for the last three years of the s further tarnished union carbide’s standing not surprisingly the conglomerate’s stock dropped from  in  to  in  as the company “earned a reputation for aimless fumbling” according to business week unfortunately for union carbide environmental complaints about the company’s marietta ohio ferroalloy plant came to a head in  when consumer champion ralph nader brought a decade of local residents’ complaints into the national spotlight for four years the conglomerate had largely ignored public and government efforts to make it clean up several plants that were polluting the air over west virginia union carbide’s resistance to outside influence gave it the public image of a reactionary bully concerned only with profits and scornful of the environment a stigma that would haunt the company for years to come in  ucc capitulated to federal orders that it immediately use more expensive lowsulphur coal to reduce noxious sulfur dioxide emissions by  percent the company was given a fall  deadline to install  million in advanced emissions scrubbers the bad news continued as the recession of  hammered commodities companies like ucc with the chemicals and plastics markets entering another cycle of overcapacity from  to  ucc’s sales grew by only  percent annually well below the industry average cfo and president f perry wilson who had been promoted to those offices in  made his bid to turn union carbide around his restructuring plan included three primary changes first he tried to pare back peripheral activities and focus on plastics and chemicals among the businesses sold were a bedding company most of ucc’s oil and gas interests a pollutionmonitoring devices business a plastic container line a fibers business a jewelry line and an insect repellant business second he worked to shift the corporate focus from market share to profitability finally wilson tried to plan capital and capacity investments so that ucc could avoid the inefficiencies and plummeting prices that had accompanied industrywide overcapacity in the past a new business development department was formed in  to coordinate the three areas outside of chemicals and plastics that wilson didn’t sell biomedical systems marine foods and agricultural systems another key organizational change was the disbanding of the consumer  related products division which had contributed  percent of ucc’s annual revenues the eveready business was split off into a battery products division while glad and prestone were coordinated in a division with the production of their raw materials despite the fragmentation of the consumer products division wilson said that he hoped that consumer products would contribute  percent of ucc’s revenues in the future he recognized that these relatively stable highmargin product lines sustained union carbide through economic downturns for a few years it looked as if the new strategy was working from  to  earnings per share rose  percent ucc increased productivity dramatically during the late s and early s to keep its corporate head above water from  to  physical output of chemicals and plastics rose  percent while perpound production costs were cut by onethird william s sneath continued these trends when he became chairman and ceo in  still the company found itself increasingly strapped for cash steadily rising expenses in europe resulted in a  million loss in  which forced carbide to divest virtually all of its european petrochemicals and plastics operations that same year ucc was forced by its creditors to retire  million in longterm debt which forced it to borrow another  million in  that year carbide’s standard  poor’s credit rating fell from a a to a  and its stock fell as low as  percent below its  book value chairman sneath embarked on another round of costcutting in  pruning the executive staff by  and divesting a total of  businesses sneath retained six primary businesses graphite electrodes batteries agricultural products polyethylene and industrial gases by  carbide had  employees at over  plants mines and laboratories in  countries bringing in over  billion in annual sales sneath embarked on a plan to invest profits into highmargin consumer goods and specialty chemicals the massive disaster at union carbide’s pesticide plant in bhopal india in december  struck the corporation just as it was beginning to make lasting strides toward profitability ucc had established battery plants in india as early as the mids and had seven plants with  employees there by  india’s chronic food shortages precipitated a governmentsponsored “green revolution” in the s with the country’s socialist government eager to join union carbide in establishing pesticide and fertilizer plants in  the indian government granted union carbide a license to manufacture pesticides and a plant was built on the sparsely populated outskirts of the regional capital of bhopal the plant drew more than  people to bhopal by  union carbide officials estimated that at least five tons of methyl isocyanate mic seeped out of the plant in just  minutes one day in december  the accident killed over  people and permanently injured another  newsweek magazine called the incident “the worst industrial accident in history” five senior indian executives of union carbide were arrested the indian government charged warren anderson chairman of union carbide’s board with “corporate and criminal liability” and accused the union carbide management of “cruel and wanton negligence” many class action suits were filed against union carbide on behalf of the victims in april  a court in india ordered carbide to pay  million in “interim” damages union carbide and the indian government reached a muchcriticized settlement for  million in  in addition to the human toll the tragedy set off a chain reaction at carbide by  the company’s market value dropped by twothirds to less than  billion and gap corp’s samuel heyman accumulated enough stock to mount a hostile takeover bid of  billion after working for two decades to expand its consumer products lines carbide was forced to sell off its consumer products division a profitable group that included glad trash bags eveready batteries prestone and stp automotive products for  million the corporation borrowed  billion raised a total of  billion in asset sales and repurchased  billion in stock to repulse heyman’s attack carbide scaled back to the three main business lines— chemicals and plastics industrial gases and carbon products— that were once its strength and benefitted from sharply reduced interest rates and falling costs of petrochemical feedstocks but the company had lost the safety net provided by its consumer products union carbide’s debt stood at  percent of capital and its equity was cut to a quarter of its former value income rose  percent in  to  million but high debt service made it hard for the company to develop and introduce new products in  ucc reduced its debt by more than  million and increase equity by almost  million by  union carbide’s corporate identity had begun to take clearer shape sales hit  billion onethird below the  peak profits were up to more than  million and the company had a new ceo robert d kennedy his goals for the company included growth—an ambitious prospect in the face of depleted finances his solution was to trim operating expenses and generate profits between  and  payroll was reduced from  employees to  while carbide set up joint ventures with british petroleum co and alliedsignal corp and made a few modest acquisitions in  carbide advanced slightly on its long journey toward financial recovery net income was  million profits in the chemicals and plastics divisions put carbide in the number two spot on the list of the top ten publicly traded companies in america the company succeeded in reducing its debttocapital ratio to below  percent and invested  million in research and development that year the company introduced its proprietary lihde oxygen combustion system which used pure oxygen to burn organic wastes carbide’s fate was far from settled a  billion debt stymied both diversification and overseas expansion carbide’s sales were dependent on cyclical commodities such as polyethylene and as the chemical industry stumbled earnings declined net income decreased  percent from  the brightest prospects were in the industrial gas unit—carbide remained number one in north america in that industry with  billion in sales the company launched a “work simplification program” in the early s the program had a cost reduction goal of  million a year by the end of  carbide progressed toward this goal by repurchasing  million shares spinning off two small businesses and selling  percent of its carbon business in  as a fitting mark to union carbide’s th anniversary in  the company had the year’s bestperforming stock on the dow jones list of  industrials carbide was half way to achieving its  million cost reduction goal and had endured a loss of  million the dramatically smaller corporation had shifted its focus from diversification to becoming a lowcost leader in basic chemicals this strategy included uncharacteristic environmentalism carbide anticipated “inevitable government mandates on waste reduction and recycling” when it started reprocessing plastic bottles in  after bhopal ucc’s efforts helped raise industry performance standards and levels worldwide and the company was praised for its “responsible care” efforts sales showed a slight gain in the  first quarter closing at  billion the sale of union carbide’s organosilicon business for  million completed kennedy’s program to divest  million in assets although

cleveland ohio with the help of charles f brush as a result of this invention a company was formed in  to make street light carbons and later carbon electrodes for electric furnaces soon the eveready trademark became a part of this company four years later it produced the first commercial dry cell battery and then in  built one of the first industrial research laboratories in the united states meanwhile in north carolina in  two men attempted to make aluminum in an electric furnace thomas l willson and major james t morehead produced calcium carbide resulting in acetylene these two chemicals were considered mere laboratory curiosities at the time but morehead convinced several chicago entrepreneurs in the use of acetylene for city and home lighting and the union carbide company was formed in  to manufacture calcium carbide morehead didn’t give up hope for his electric furnace idea in fact in  he with the help of guillaume de chalmot produced america’s first commercial highcarbon ferrochrome and furnished ferrochrome for armorplate during the spanishamerican war electric lighting became practical during this time eliminating any expansion for union carbide’s acetylene lighting business but their calcium carbide plants continued to operate in sault ste marie michigan and niagara falls new york in  their capital stock was  par value  dividends were at  percent with charles f dieterich as president george o knapp as vice president and ab proal as secretary and treasurer their main office was located in chicago illinois in  the company purchased an alloys business and a metals research laboratory and established a separate division to produce alloys for steelmaking under the direction of dr fredrick m becket its chief metallurgist the new company began a line of alloying metals that were respected in the field one example is their creation of lowcarbon ferrochrome resulting in the development of modern stainless steels the discovery in france of a hot metalcutting flame resulting from burning acetylene in oxygen created a high demand for such resources charles brush interested several electrode producers in forming the first oxygenproducing company in  this company later became the corporation’s present linde division in  union carbide bought interest in the oxygen company therefore bringing together for the first time the carbon and carbide interests union carbide’s major competitor during this period was the prestolite company the largest single purchaser of calcium carbide for acetylene lamps for automobiles when an alternative form of acetylene was requested dr george o curme jr was hired by prestolite in  to find it he consulted scientists from the linde company and union carbide to conduct research on the gas the cooperative efforts resulted in the formation of the union carbide and carbon corporation in  the government’s need for ethylene during the world war i regenerated interest in hydrocarbon byproducts in  the first production of synthetic ethylene began dr curme and his associate james a rafferty predicted a future need for synthetic organic chemicals and america’s petrochemical industry and the corporation’s chemicals business were established in  with combined research efforts new developments occurred rapidly new products included ethylene glycol today’s presione antifreeze and coolant batteries for portable radios quiet flickerless carbons used for the first sound movies and ferroalloys to improve the steels used to build skyscrapers bridges and automobiles the company’s technology included the production of corrosion and heatresistant alloys six years later it acquired vanadium interests on the colorado plateau which eventually supplied the uranium for atomic energy graphite skills were added to the corporation’s carbon activities in  with the acheson graphite corporation the chicago world’s fair in  enabled union carbide to exhibit more than half of the known chemical elements to the public today union carbide works with more than  of the  chemical elements named by scientists with the advent of world war ii union carbide focused its attention on developing raw material resources and utilization of byproducts carbide resumed its butadiene studies begun years before to succeed in developing a synthetic rubber and soon acquired the bakelike corporation increasing its technology in the field of plastics carbide was also responsible for research on vanadium that eventually involved the corporation in the government’s atomic energy program scientists demonstrated that gaseous diffusion could be used to separate quantities of uranium union carbide and the manhattan engineer district entered into a contract on  january  to operate the oak ridge gaseous diffusion plant after intensive research linde perfected a refining process for treating uranium concentrates a plant was built and operated by the electro metallurgical company presently the metals division to provide extensive emergency metallurgical research and to manufacture uranium graphite products and special carbons were developed and manufactured by national carbon presently carbon products uraniumbearing materials were located and provided by the united states vanadium now part of the metals division also constructing three plants for treating uranium ores with newly developed processes finally union carbide and carbon research laboratories contributed to the development of the atomic weapon itself following world war ii union carbide expanded polyethylene a plastic used in squeeze bottles as well as in films and sheeting became its largest dollarvolume product other materials such as gases and carbon products also continued to succeed restructuring of the union carbide company began during the ’s interest in new fields of technology emerged the metals division was established to handle worldwide ore procurement and a food casings business formally the visking company was also established by  union carbide and carbon corporation had established some  plants in the united states and canada in addition to overseas affiliates the public was becoming increasingly aware of its activities so the company decided to change its name to the union carbide corporation in  consumer products such as eveready batteries and presione antifreeze continued to increase in sales to accommodate this a separate division strictly for consumer products was established in  then in the early ’s the glad line of plastic wraps bags and straws was introduced and became a leading brand in its field international operations of union carbide was restructured in  to accommodate new subsidiaries including union carbide pan america inc union carbide europe inc union carbide eastern inc union carbide africa and middle east inc and union carbide canada limited a  owned subsidiary a new division was named in —filmspackaging division previously the visking casings business consolidating activities in food casings and related products during the late ’s and early ’s union carbide decided to sell and dissolve some of its businesses in order to

department in  two years later the consumer products division was elminiated to form a battery products division preston and glad products acquired the home and automotive products division the agricultural products division developed in  began producing sevin insecticide temik pesticide and similar materials in  a comprehensive longterm program was established by union carbide with the following objectives “strengthening the assignment of individual responsibilities and accountabilities strengthening business management methods allocating resources selectively in strategic planning units and practicing good corporate citizenship at home and abroad” with the advent of new strategies came new materials and processes including molecular sieve adsorbents and catalysts specialized electronic materials foamed plastics biomedical systems pollution abatement systems energy converting coal to gases and liquids for fuel miniature batteries food chemicals to increase food yield raising salmon trout and other fish species shrimp fishing off the coast of india thornel carbongraphite fibers used in aerospace gold club shafts tennis rackets and fishing rods in addition to these developments union carbide had established additional pesticide and fertilizer producing plants in particular bhopal india during the mid’s india was experiencing a chronic food shortage the central government’s “green revolution” included increasing use of pesticides when union carbide approached new delhi authorities with an offer to build a plant in bhopal they were gladly accepted in  the indian government granted union carbide a license to manufacture pesticides and the plant was built union carbide owning  percent and india’s private companies owning  percent the plant was built on the outskirts of the city not densely populated at that time but with construction came more residents more than  people eventually lived in this capital of madhya pradesh union carbide increased its ties with the local government and helped the city to build a park the company also hired local residents for management positions by the late ’s union carbide had established itself as having one of the better safety records in the chemical industry throughout all its subsidaries including india but a massive disaster at the bhopal plant in december  led to the deaths of some  people with a huge additional number possibly permanently disabled it has been called “the worst industrial accident in history” newsweek  after the incident bhopal police arrested five senior indian executives of union

caused cancer an attorney for union carbide claims the company “clearly did not cause the plaintiff’s disease” and “the verdict in this case is outrageous and unsupported by the facts” an attorney for parex usa inc another named defendant in the case commented that the jury “was being ruled by passion and prejudice there was little evidence that the plaintiff’s quality of life has been affected so far other than the fact he knew he had cancer” because asbestosrelated disease does not develop for  to  years or more after exposure the company will continue to receive lawsuit claims for injuries

asbestos product manufactured by union carbide is calidria chrysotile asbestos the company mined and milled calidria near king city california in the s reportedly its own scientists indicated that calidria asbestos caused more damage to the lungs of rats than other types of asbestos union carbide officials knew that any health effects from asbestos would not surface for up to  years in one

asbestosis lung cancer and mesothelioma a rare aggressive and incurable cancer asbestos exposure can happen wherever asbestos is present at home a public building such as a school or government office a war fought on foreign soil or on the job click to expand in fact occupational exposure is the no  cause of asbestos disease that means roofers carpenters electricians plumbers firefighters auto mechanics insulators factory workers and many others are at a high risk of exposure those who worked in construction shipyards power plants oil refineries and steel mills also faced the likelihood of high asbestos exposure on the job us military veterans were the most vulnerable of all — accounting for almost a third of all cases — because of the military’s past reliance on asbestos products especially on navy ships for much of the th century until its longterm toxicity became well known thousands of everyday products used asbestos because it was coveted for its heat resistance versatility and tensile strength get a free mesothelioma guide free information books wristbands and more for patients and caregivers get your free guide get your free mesothelioma guide how exposure happens asbestos disease starts with the unknowing inhalation or ingestion of microscopic asbestos fibers while no level of asbestos exposure is considered safe most problems arise after repeated and longterm exposures to the carcinogen environmental and secondhand exposure to asbestos is rarer but it still happens regularly most everyone in their lifetime has inhaled some quantity of asbestos but these trace amounts rarely cause health problems asbestosrelated disease is  percent preventable that fact motivates me it should motivate all of us if we stopped using asbestos by definition we could stop asbestos disease — dr ken takahashi director of the asbestos diseases research institute harmful exposures occur in a wide range of occupational settings home and commercial renovation or remodeling can be especially hazardous because many common building materials already contain asbestos when asbestos products start to deteriorate or are cut sanded drilled or disturbed in any way microscopic fibers enter the air for example the alaska department of environmental conservation adec took issue with the sandblasting practices of alaskabased shipbuilding and repair facility seward ships drydock the adec issued seward a notice of violation for uncontrolled fugitive particulate emissions at its sandblasting operations if workers sandblasted asbestoscontaining materials such as paint insulation or joint compounds off of a vessel the asbestos fibers released would no longer be confined to the sandblasted area and people elsewhere in the shipyard could inhale them fibers can remain airborne for hours placing anyone nearby in danger once inhaled they can become trapped in the respiratory tract where they may stay for life health risks of exposure once inhaled asbestos fibers can become lodged in the thin lining surrounding the lungs and cause inflammation making breathing increasingly difficult they eventually will cause scarring which can lead to genetic mutations and cancer in the early stages symptoms of these diseases often mirror those of less serious illnesses and may not be diagnosed until  to  years after the initial exposure each year approximately  to  americans are diagnosed with mesothelioma a rare cancer caused almost exclusively by asbestos exposure an estimated  americans die annually from an asbestosrelated disease currently an estimated  people in the country are diagnosed with some form of asbestosrelated illness pleural plaques these are the most common indication of asbestos exposure they are characterized by fibrous thickening of the lining around the lungs asbestosis asbestosis is characterized by inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue which prevents the lungs from expanding and relaxing normally copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd is not directly caused by asbestos but exposure increases the risk of developing the disease mesothelioma this is a rare aggressive and incurable asbestoscaused cancer lung cancer asbestosrelated lung cancer accounts for approximately  percent of all lung cancer cases asbestos exposure also increases the chances of developing lung cancer where exposure occurs exposure can occur while living near job sites or contaminated environments using asbestoscontaining products or working in certain occupations including the us military exposure can also occur during natural or manmade disasters military every branch of the us armed forces incorporated asbestos people on us navy ships and operators of military vehicles and aircraft from the early s to the s were most at risk since that time thousands of veterans who worked in the following vessels have suffered illnesses related to asbestos exposure during their service battleships aircraft carriers cruisers auxiliary vessels submarines destroyers frigates learn more about veterans and mesothelioma products thousands of products were manufactured using asbestos fibers asbestos may be found in insulation drywall ceiling and floor tiles cements paint and more most homes and commercial buildings built before  contain asbestos products search our asbestos products index occupations workers from practically all trades were likely exposed to asbestos fibers while on the job drywall tapers electricians firefighters auto mechanics and many other occupations may be at risk while asbestos regulation was more relaxed in the past today the law requires all employers to protect workers from asbestos and other jobrelated health risks see if your occupation was at risk for exposure job sites asbestos exposure may occur while on the job many workplaces utilized the mineral in their products and facilities placing millions of workers at risk for exposure shipyards power plants metal works schools chemical plants oil refineries environmental exposure occurs when asbestos fibers are released into the air through mining the disturbance of a natural asbestos deposit or the result of natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes and earthquakes in  the journal of toxicology and environmental health published a study that showed occupational exposure to asbestos has declined in recent years but there has been a rise in environmental exposure in specific geographic areas the study also used the findings to explain why the percentage of women and younger patients with asbestos disease has been rising researchers at the university of hawaii cancer center conducted a similar study in  that highlighted the need to be more aware of environmental exposure in nevada northern california is also home to some of the largest naturally occurring deposits of asbestos  attack on the world trade center the terrorist attack at the world trade center in new york city on sept   released more than  tons of asbestos into the air causing a sudden and very serious exposure problem for rescue recovery and cleanup workers who remained at the site for months according to a  study published in the new england journal of medicine about  percent of those workers suffered new or worsened respiratory problems it found that  percent of workers tested had abnormal lung function tests

find out who concealed asbestos risks from their employees learn more read about the asbestos cover up a  study tested the effects of environmental exposure in a population living near an asbestos manufacturing plant the study examined rates of malignant pleural mesothelioma mpm and other asbestosrelated conditions in shubra elkheima egypt an industrial city containing the sigwart company asbestos plant it compared disease rates in individuals working in the plant those living near the plant and those in a control group with no known asbestos exposure in total the study had more than  participants the rate of mpm was highest in the group with environmental asbestos exposure with  percent of this group having the cancer the group with occupational exposure had a strikingly lower rate of only  percent as expected the control group had the fewest incidences with a rate of  percent these rates varied for other illnesses such as diffuse pleural thickening overall the study found a slightly higher but still comparable rate of asbestosrelated illnesses in asbestos workers than in nearby residents improper abatement if asbestos materials are removed from a home or structure there is a high risk of exposure to airborne fibers if proper abatement procedures are not followed it is important to adhere to federal safety regulations regarding the removal and disposal of the materials to minimize health risks secondhand exposure people can get an asbestosrelated disease without ever working with or around the toxic mineral secondhand exposure or indirect exposure can be just as dangerous as firsthand exposure while any kind of exposure is much less common today than even  years ago women faced an increased risk for secondhand exposure when asbestos use was high during the midth century at that time men comprised the majority of the industrial working class the occupations within these industrial settings often required workers to handle asbestoscontaining products workers returning home might carry fibers on their hair skin and clothes and indirectly expose their families and others living with them occurrences of secondhand exposure secondhand exposure is the cause for a significant portion of mesothelioma cases among women and children if children are exposed to asbestos indirectly at an early age they may develop an asbestosrelated disease in their adult years there are four common forms of secondhand asbestos exposure laundry the clothing of workers who handled asbestos products provided a significant risk for secondhand exposure because of the jagged structure of the fibers the microscopic particles could easily attach to clothing anyone handling or washing these work clothes likely experienced indirect exposure furniture if a worker didn’t change out of asbestos contaminated clothing before returning home fibers could have become embedded in the couch chairs carpet bed and other pieces of furniture hugs if a worker came home with fibers attached to their hair skin or clothes and later hugged their children or spouse family members were likely indirectly exposed to the carcinogen some mesothelioma cases have developed from children sitting on the lap of their father or grandfather after he came home from work while family members didnt have any direct contact with asbestoscontaining products the amount of dust brought home was enough to cause mesothelioma or a related disease later in life between  and  researchers at mount sinai medical center in new york city studied the health of  family members from the  workers employed at a factory in patterson new jersey researchers discovered five cases of mesothelioma among factory workers family members sources of asbestos dust were also found in the homes of former patterson factory workers  years after the factory shut down compensation for asbestos exposure let us help you gain access to trust funds and other forms of compensation for mesothelioma victims get help now get financial assistance legal claims for secondhand exposure like plaintiffs who are directly exposed to asbestos claimants indirectly injured by asbestos may be eligible for compensation in order to bring a successful legal claim they must be able to trace their exposure to a defendant who is liable for failure to warn or protect against the dangers this usually involves investigating the work history of a family member who was exposed on the job john panza jr diagnosed with mesothelioma in  for example john panza jr a yearold english professor was diagnosed with mesothelioma in  for more than  years his father worked at a brake plant where national friction products corp products were drilled and abraded as a child panza helped his father wash his work clothes in  panza filed a lawsuit against national friction alleging he inhaled fibers from the companys products that contaminated his fathers clothes in  an ohio jury found national friction liable for panzas illness it ordered the company to pay panza and his wife  million the award included  in economic damages  million in noneconomic damages and  million for the wifes loss of consortium claim protecting yourself and loved ones despite the continued presence of asbestos in the workplace and in everyday life people can protect themselves by being vigilant workers should use protective equipment provided by employers it is important to follow proper safety procedures and workplace practices approved respirators should be worn when working around asbestos fibers it also is important to take precautions against bringing home any asbestos from work and endangering a family any clothing or shoes worn on the job should be left and cleaned at the job site showers should be taken before returning home safety equipment and good practices today protect you against future asbestos exposure problems if you think your work conditions are unsafe or your employer isn’t

and other forms of compensation for you or your loved ones get help now at the heart of this disparity is the industry’s notion that corporate profits outweigh good health and the value of life since the late s american companies like the johns manville corporation amassed great wealth by mining manufacturing and selling asbestoscontaining products centuries later medical evidence revealed johns manville and numerous other companies not only knew about the potentially deadly effects of exposure but also went to great lengths to conceal the information from workers and consumers in decades past asbestos use was far more pervasive in the united states contaminated materials were prevalent in industries like shipbuilding construction power generation and heavy manufacturing since an

asbestos liabilities history of manufacturing although asbestos mining existed for thousands of years it was only during the industrial revolution of the late s that the industry flourished a natural resistance to heat chemicals and electricity made the fiber desirable for innumerable industrial applications soon enough manufacturers incorporated asbestos insulation into steam engines piping and locomotives thousands of other uses later emerged and manufacturers began putting it in products like boilers gaskets cement roofing materials and automotive brake pads by the early th century some companies realized that their primary source of income was severely injuring employees and consumers but rather than making efforts to improve workplace safety standards some companies chose to ignore or bury information that would undoubtedly damage their business and reputation internal documents indicate that johns manville executives were aware of the risks as early as  the company conducted private medical studies around this time and the negative results remained confidential for decades asbestos use increased throughout world war ii largely because of military shipbuilding contracts the us government required asbestos insulation be used in us navy and us coast guard vessels for several decades after the war hundreds of companies grew and prospered by incorporating asbestos materials into thousands of industrial and household products in addition to johns manville other leading asbestos manufacturers include owens corningfibreboard corp raybestosmanhattan co national gypsum corporation wr grace  co celotex corp by the s scientists had gathered ample evidence of asbestoss harmful effects one landmark occupational study conducted by dr irving selikoff in  showed a clear link between the mineral and various cancers results indicated that between  and  an excessive number of insulation workers died of asbestosis and cancer including lung cancer mesothelioma stomach cancer and colorectal cancer selikoffs findings were bolstered by medical evidence gathered in the wake of a subsequent decline in asbestos use the result was a significant downturn for americas asbestos industry the us environmental protection agency epa dealt another blow to the industry with the clean air act of  it established the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap which placed stringent restrictions on the use of asbestos and other harmful airborne contaminants several new regulations directly affected the industry specifically companies that milled sprayed or disposed of asbestos materials by the late s many companies began phasing the mineral out of their products although the us geological survey asserts that us asbestos use has fallen  percent since  it is not yet banned in the united states limited amounts of chrysotile asbestos remain in brake pads and other friction materials building materials like cement and in various textiles fast fact a c  s stated it would no longer use materials made with friable asbestos in  but bankruptcy documents revealed it may have been used for at least another decade products during the peak era of asbestos consumption it was incorporated into approximately  types of products one of the most common commercial applications was within insulation products a use that spanned industries including construction shipbuilding and industrial manufacturing countless other types of building materials were manufactured with asbestos including ceiling tiles joint compounds cement drywall and roofing materials these products have a high potential to expose workers during building renovations and demolitions as many related activities release toxic fibers into the air the toxic fibers have also been spun into various textile products such as rope cloth and garments shipyard workers who installed tainted insulation often wore protective gloves and aprons that also contained the dangerous ingredient another leading sector that continues to use asbestos materials is the automotive industry many car parts that withstand high temperatures and friction such as gaskets and brake pads contained some percentage of asbestos industries  occupations according to the world health organization about  million people experience workplace exposure worldwide by far the most dangerous occupations involved mining and processing the mineral these activities released massive amounts of toxic fibers into the air another industry at high risk for exposure is that of construction while drywall hangers and insulation workers faced constant exposure risks many other professions in carpentry may have been exposed simply by working on the same project shipyard workers especially during the world war ii era experienced heavy exposure as well tainted insulation was once a staple aboard seafaring vessels and cramped working conditions made its installation especially hazardous also at risk were pipefitters boiler workers and electricians who serviced us navy and us coast guard ships litigation  specific lawsuits a staggering number of related lawsuits surfaced over the past four decades jeopardizing assets of any company associated with asbestos according to one litigation report from  an estimated  people filed related claims against at least  corporations some mesothelioma lawsuits resulted in multimilliondollar verdicts or outofcourt settlements when courts find companies liable for a person’s injury or death they must provide compensatory damages including pain and suffering medical expenses lost income and loss of consortium many times courts also demand additional punitive damages from companies for their wrongdoings in one standout  case us steel was ordered

objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump
