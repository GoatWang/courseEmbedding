glutaminase inhibitor cb arginase inhibitor cb science publications news investors press releases events  presentations stock information financial information corporate governance shareholder services contact us pipeline cb arginase inhibitors cb has the potential to be an important new therapeutic agent with a novel mechanism of action for the treatment of a broad range of cancers genetically mandated alterations in the fundamental metabolic pathways of tumors often cause a dramatic rise in the uptake of the nutrients glucose and glutamine removal of glutamine leads to a substantial reduction in cell growth or induces cell death in certain types of cancer cells indicating that these cells are dependent on or “addicted” to glutamine normal cells do not show this pronounced dependence on glutamine the enzyme glutaminase which converts glutamine to glutamate has been identified as a critical choke point in the utilization of glutamine by cancer cells cb is a potent selective reversible and orally bioavailable inhibitor of human glutaminase inhibition of glutaminase also results in accumulation of glutamine in tumors glutamine which is frequently depleted in the tumor microenvironment due to uptake by tumor cells has been shown to be an important nutrient for tcell growth cb could potentially have an impact on the treatment of cancer by first starving the tumor cell and second facilitating the activation of tcells in the nutrientdeprived tumor microenvironment in preclinical studies cb has been shown to halt the growth of or kill cancer cells across a range of tumor types the compound has demonstrated antitumor activity in several different tumor models in animals in preclinical toxicology studies cb was well tolerated in animals at doses above those shown to inhibit tumor growth cb has also shown strong synergy with immunomodulatory agents and several kinase inhibitors that target growth factor pathways calithera’s clinical program seeks to identify cancers that will be most sensitive to cb to allow the greatest benefit for patients and to pursue the most efficient path to regulatory approval based on our preclinical data we believe several specific tumor types will be sensitive to glutaminase inhibition and benefit from treatment with cb calithera is currently conducting multiple phase b combination trials of cb in solid tumors cb administered as a single agent has resulted in clinical responses in renal cell cancer and acute myeloid leukemia and clinical benefit in several other tumor types calithera is currently enrolling patients in a series of combination phase b cohorts in specific solid tumor types of cb in combination with standard therapies and immuneoncology agents phase  trials in renal cell carcinoma and triple negative breast cancer are planned to begin in  results of calithera’s preclinical and clinical studies of cb have been presented at several scientific conferences and these data may be

candidates against novel tumor metabolism and immunology targets tumor metabolism and tumor immunology have emerged as promising new fields for cancer drug discovery and recent clinical successes with therapeutic agents in each field have demonstrated the potential to create fundamentally new therapies for cancer patients we have accumulated significant experience and understanding of tumor metabolism and tumor immunology and are applying our medicinal chemistry capabilities to identify small molecules that exploit these pathways to date we have utilized this expertise to internally discover cb our firstinclass oncology product candidate that is now in clinical testing we plan to continue to leverage our expertise to discover and develop additional product candidates advance those product candidates through clinical testing and if approved ultimately commercialize meaningful therapies for patients with cancer tumor metabolism many types of cancer cells develop a unique dependence on specific metabolic pathways upon which normal cells are not reliant the primary goal of drugs targeting tumor metabolism pathways is to take advantage of cancerspecific nutrient dependencies to block cancer growth the field of tumor metabolism seeks to exploit the unique ways in which cancer cells take up and utilize nutrients in order to grow and survive it is now recognized that cancer cells rely on certain metabolic processes or pathways to a much greater extent than normal cells accordingly when these metabolic pathways are blocked cancer cells are essentially starved of critical nutrients and stop growing or die whereas normal cells are largely unaffected changes in cellular metabolism are remarkably consistent across many tumor types yet fundamentally different from normal cells providing the potential to develop broadly applicable agents that target these altered pathways but have less toxicity than standard cytotoxic agents our lead product candidate in tumor metabolism cb takes advantage of the pronounced dependency many cancers have on the nutrient glutamine for growth and survival cb inhibits glutaminase an enzyme required by cancer cells to utilize glutamine effectively tumor immunology the field of tumor immunology seeks to activate the body’s own immune system to attack and kill cancer cells genetically diverse tumor types have developed mechanisms to escape destruction by the body’s immune system one key mechanism is through suppression of cytotoxic t cells that would otherwise attack and kill the cancer cells arginine is an amino acid that is fundamental to the function of cytotoxic t cells without arginine tumor specific cytotoxic t cells fail to express a functional t cell receptor on their surface and as a result are unable to activate proliferate or mount an effective antitumor response we believe that inhibitors of arginase can promote an antitumor immune response by restoring arginine levels thereby allowing activation of the body’s cancerfighting immune cells   calithera biosciences inc all rights reserved back to top zacks investment research downgraded calithera biosciences inc nasdaqcala to

candidates against novel tumor metabolism and immunology targets tumor metabolism and tumor immunology have emerged as promising new fields for cancer drug discovery and recent clinical successes with therapeutic agents in each field have demonstrated the potential to create fundamentally new therapies for cancer patients we have accumulated significant experience and understanding of tumor metabolism and tumor immunology and are applying our medicinal chemistry capabilities to identify small molecules that exploit these pathways to date we have utilized this expertise to internally discover cb our firstinclass oncology product candidate that is now in clinical testing we plan to continue to leverage our expertise to discover and develop additional product candidates advance those product candidates through clinical testing and if approved ultimately commercialize meaningful therapies for patients with cancer tumor metabolism many types of cancer cells develop a unique dependence on specific metabolic pathways upon which normal cells are not reliant the primary goal of drugs targeting tumor metabolism pathways is to take advantage of cancerspecific nutrient dependencies to block cancer growth the field of tumor metabolism seeks to exploit the unique ways in which cancer cells take up and utilize nutrients in order to grow and survive it is now recognized that cancer cells rely on certain metabolic processes or pathways to a much greater extent than normal cells accordingly when these metabolic pathways are blocked cancer cells are essentially starved of critical nutrients and stop growing or die whereas normal cells are largely unaffected changes in cellular metabolism are remarkably consistent across many tumor types yet fundamentally different from normal cells providing the potential to develop broadly applicable agents that target these altered pathways but have less toxicity than standard cytotoxic agents our lead product candidate in tumor metabolism cb takes advantage of the pronounced dependency many cancers have on the nutrient glutamine for growth and survival cb inhibits glutaminase an enzyme required by cancer cells to utilize glutamine effectively tumor immunology the field of tumor immunology seeks to activate the body’s own immune system to attack and kill cancer cells genetically diverse tumor types have developed mechanisms to escape destruction by the body’s immune system one key mechanism is through suppression of cytotoxic t cells that would otherwise attack and kill the cancer cells arginine is an amino acid that is fundamental to the function of cytotoxic t cells without arginine tumor specific cytotoxic t cells fail to express a functional t cell receptor on their surface and as a result are unable to activate proliferate or mount an effective antitumor response we believe that inhibitors of arginase can promote an antitumor immune response by restoring arginine levels thereby allowing activation of the body’s cancerfighting immune cells   calithera biosciences inc all rights reserved back to top calanasdaq gs stock quote  calithera biosciences inc  bloomberg markets error

critical enzyme in tumor cells its other product candidate cb is being developed for hematology and oncology indications cb is a potent and selective orally bioavailable inhibitor of the enzyme arginasecb is a selective reversible and orally bioavailable inhibitor of human glutaminase cb binds to a site on glutaminase that is distinct from the site that binds glutamine thereby reducing the potential for undesirable side effects due to inhibition of other enzymes and receptors that bind glutamine in preclinical studies cb has been shown to halt the growth of or kill cancer cells across a range of tumor types in addition cb has shown synergy with immunomodulatory agents and several kinase inhibitors that target growth factor pathways the company is enrolling patients in a series of combination phase ib cohorts in specific solid tumor types arginine is an amino acid that is fundamental to the function of cytotoxic t cells in response to tumorsecreted factors myeloidderived suppressor cells mdscs accumulate in the tumor and secrete the enzyme arginase resulting in depletion of arginine from the tumor microenvironment cb has single agent antitumor activity in syngeneic

surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time and best of all by using
