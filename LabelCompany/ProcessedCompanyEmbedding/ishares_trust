persistent drivers of returns across equities and other asset classes discover how smart beta etfs capture single or multiple factors transparently and efficiently what is smart beta sara shores global head of smart beta for blackrock explains how smart beta seeks to  enhance returns  improve diversification  reduce risk video what is smart beta view transcript smart beta is one of the fastest growing categories in the industry today you can hardly open a newspaper without reading a headline about it but what is smart beta well… let’s ask google what is smart beta there’s  million search results but the  result is from the financial times and it says “smart beta is a rather elusive concept in modern finance” is smart beta really elusive well it is to some and that’s why we’re here today to try to talk about the basics of smart beta and dispel some of the confusion smart beta seeks to enhance returns improve diversification and reduce risk for investors it’s really a combination of what we think of as active and passive investing it’s active in that it aims to outperform a cap weighted index after taking into consideration risk return and cost but it’s passive in that implementation is transparent and based on preset rules ideally those rules are objective enough that you can write them down and give them to somebody else to implement it often comes in the form of an etf or an index fund and smart beta strategies capture many of the themes that have historically been present in traditional active strategies but usually at a much lower fee how does smart beta do that well to answer that question we have to understand “factors” factors are investment characteristics that help explain the risk and return behavior of a security for example stocks in the same industry tend to move together or bonds with a similar maturity would tend to move together you might think of it as the dna of a stock or a bond so just like your dna might govern your stubborn streak or the color of your eyes a stocks dna its factors help explain a lot about its behavior now some but not all factors have historically had a positive and persistent return over the long term and those are the ones we are most interested in smart beta ideas are also well understood by the marketplace let’s look at value and i’m going to ask google sara googles value so the definition of value from the webster’s dictionary is something that can be bought at a low or a fair price and put in an investment context what that means is that less expensive securities have historically outperformed their more expensive peers so over the longterm investors are rewarded for holding those lower profile potentially riskier names so smart beta strategies try to target those ideas that are value creating well understood persistent and diversifying over time now many of these concepts are not new ideas like value or quality have long puttered the stock selection framework for active managers but what is new is the idea that we can capture them with consistency and inexpensively in a passively oriented portfolio and that is a pretty powerful idea so there you have it smart beta it’s a smart way of thinking about investing beyond traditional active and passive seek to manage risk with ishares edge minimum volatility etfs investors have the opportunity to gain broad market

funds seek to track the investment results of their underlying benchmark less fees and expenses tracking error is a measure of how closely a fund follows the index to which it is benchmarked over a

etfs may experience more than minimum volatility as there is no guarantee that the underlying indexs strategy of seeking to lower volatility will be successful there can be no assurance that performance will be enhanced or risk will be reduced for funds that seek to provide exposure to certain quantitative investment characteristics factors exposure to such investment factors may detract

etfs explore smart beta ishares smart beta etfs primarily focus on factors that have historically been persistent drivers of returns across equities and other asset classes discover how smart beta etfs capture single or multiple factors transparently and efficiently what is smart beta sara shores global head of smart beta for blackrock explains how smart beta seeks to  enhance returns  improve diversification  reduce risk video what is smart beta view transcript smart beta is one of the fastest growing categories in the industry today you can hardly open a newspaper without reading a headline about it but what is smart beta well… let’s ask google what is smart beta there’s  million search results but the  result is from the financial times and it says “smart beta is a rather elusive concept in modern finance” is smart beta really elusive well it is to some and that’s why we’re here today to try to talk about the basics of smart beta and dispel some of the confusion smart beta seeks to enhance returns improve diversification and reduce risk for investors it’s really a combination of what we think of as active and passive investing it’s active in that it aims to outperform a cap weighted index after taking into consideration risk return and cost but it’s passive in that implementation is transparent and based on preset rules ideally those rules are objective enough that you can write them down and give them to somebody else to implement it often comes in the form of an etf or an index fund and smart beta strategies capture many of the themes that have historically been present in traditional active strategies but usually at a much lower fee how does smart beta do that well to answer that question we have to understand “factors” factors are investment characteristics that help explain the risk and return behavior of a security for example stocks in the same industry tend to move together or bonds with a similar maturity would tend to move together you might think of it as the dna of a stock or a bond so just like your dna might govern your stubborn streak or the color of your eyes a stocks dna its factors help explain a lot about its behavior now some but not all factors have historically had a positive and persistent return over the long term and those are the ones we are most interested in smart beta ideas are also well understood by the marketplace let’s look at value and i’m going to ask google sara googles value so the definition of value from the webster’s dictionary is something that can be bought at a low or a fair price and put in an investment context what that means is that less expensive securities have historically outperformed their more expensive peers so over the longterm investors are rewarded for holding those lower profile potentially riskier names so smart beta strategies try to target those ideas that are value creating well understood persistent and diversifying over time now many of these concepts are not new ideas like value or quality have long puttered the stock selection framework for active managers but what is new is the idea that we can capture them with consistency and inexpensively in a passively oriented portfolio and that is a pretty powerful idea so there you have it smart beta it’s a smart way of thinking about investing beyond traditional active and passive
