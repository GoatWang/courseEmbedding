knights of columbus michael j mcgivney an irishamerican catholic priest founded the knights of columbus in new haven connecticut he gathered a group of men from st marys parish for an organizational meeting on october   and the order was incorporated under the laws of the state of connecticut on march   although the first councils were all in that state the order spread throughout new england and the united states in subsequent years by  there were  councils comprising  knights twenty years later in  there were  knights in  councils the order was intended as a mutual benefit society these organizations which combined social aspects and ritual were especially flourishing during the latter third of the nineteenth century the socalled golden age of fraternalism as a parish priest in an immigrant community mcgivney saw what could happen to a family when the main income earner died and wanted to provide insurance to care for the widows and orphans left behind he also had to temporarily leave his seminary studies to care for his family when his father died however roman catholics in the late th century were regularly excluded from labor unions popular fraternal organizations and other organized groups that provided social services and papal encyclicals issued by the holy see prohibited catholics from participating as lodge members within freemasonry mcgivney wished to provide them with an alternative he also believed that catholicism and fraternalism were not incompatible and wanted to found a society to encourage men to be proud of their americancatholic heritage mcgivney traveled to boston to examine the massachusetts catholic order of foresters and to brooklyn to learn about the recently established catholic benevolent league both of which offered insurance benefits he found the latter to be lacking the excitement he thought was needed if his organization were to compete with the secret societies of the day he expressed an interest in establishing a new haven court of the foresters but the charter of massachusetts foresters prevented them from operating outside their commonwealth mcgivneys committee of st marys parishioners decided to form a club that was entirely original christopher columbus is the patron and namesake of the knights the name of columbus was also partially intended as a mild rebuke to anglosaxon protestant leaders who upheld the explorer a catholic genovese italian working for catholic spain as an american hero yet simultaneously sought to marginalize recent catholic immigrants in taking columbus as their patron they were expressing their belief that not only could catholics be full members of american society but were instrumental in its foundation mcgivney had originally conceived of the name sons of columbus but james t mullen who would become the first supreme knight successfully suggested that knights of columbus would better capture the ritualistic nature of the new organization by the time of the first annual convention in  the order was prospering the five councils throughout connecticut had a total of  members groups from other states were requesting information the charter of  included four statements of purpose including to promote such social and intellectual intercourse among its members as shall be desirable and proper and by such lawful means as to them shall seem best the new charter showed members desire to expand the organization beyond a simple mutual benefit insurance society the original insurance system devised by mcgivney gave a deceased knights widow a  death benefit each member was assessed  upon a death and when the number of knights grew beyond  the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase each member regardless of age was assessed equally as a result younger healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older there was also a sick benefit deposit for members who fell ill and could not work each sick knight was entitled to draw up to  a week for  weeks roughly equivalent to  in  dollars if he remained sick after that the council to which he belonged regulated the sum of money given to him creation of the fourth degreeedit from the very early days of the order members wanted to create a form of hierarchy and recognition for senior members this issue was discussed at the national meeting of  as early as  supreme knight james t mullen had proposed a patriotic degree with its own symbolic dress the k of c established the grand cross of the knights of columbus but awarded it only to cristobal colón y de la cerda duke of veragua and descendant of columbus when he visited the us in  about  members attended the first exemplification of the fourth degree at the lenox lyceum in new york on february   the event was infused with catholic and patriotic symbols and imagery that celebrated american catholic heritage the two knights leading the ceremony for example were the expositor of the constitution and the defender of the faith the ritual soon spread to other cities the new fourth degree members returned to their councils forming assemblies composed of members from several councils those assemblies chose the new members in  the board of directors officially approved a new degree exemplifying patriotism orderwide using the new york city model there was from early on a desire to receive within its ranks only the best and each candidate was required to produce a certificate from his parish priest attesting that he had received holy communion within the past two weeks persecution by the ku klux klanedit not long after the establishment of the fourth degree during the nadir of american race relations a bogus oath was circulated claiming that fourth degree knights swore to exterminate freemasons and protestants as well as flay burn alive boil kill and otherwise torture anyone including women and children when called upon to do so by church authorities it is a strange paradox according to some commentators that the degree devoted to patriotism should be accused of antiamericanism the bogus oath was based on a previous oath falsely attributed to the jesuits more than three centuries earlier the ku klux klan which was growing into a powerful force through the s spread the bogus oath far and wide as part of their campaign against catholics during the  presidential election the klan printed and distributed a million copies of the oath in an effort to defeat catholic democratic candidate al smith thomas s butler us representative from pennsylvania read it into the congressional record the bogus oath was refuted by the committee of public information a wartime propaganda agency of the us government misunderstanding catholicism the klan alleged that knights were only loyal to the pope and that they advocated the overthrow of the united states government across the country local state and the supreme councils offered rewards to anyone who could prove that the widely circulated oath was authentic no one could but that did not stop the klan from continuing to publish and distribute copies numerous state councils and the supreme council believed that this violent wave of religious prejudice was actuated by mercenary motives and that publication would stop if fines were imposed and jail time assessed they began suing distributors for libel this caused an end to such publication as the order did not wish to appear motivated by a vengeful spirit it asked for leniency from judges when sentencing offenders to help combat this misconception of what the fourth degree was about the actual oath taken by fourth degree members was submitted to various groups of prominent noncatholic men around the country for them to examine many made public declarations attesting to the loyalty and patriotism of the knights after examining the true oath a committee of highranking california freemasons a group singled out for violence in the bogus oath declared in  the ceremonial of the order of the knights of columbus teaches a high and noble patriotism instills a love of country inculcates a reverence of civic duty and holds up the constitution of our country as the richest and most precious possession of a knight of the order pierce v society of sistersedit after world war i many americans had a revival of concerns about assimilation of immigrants and worries about foreign values they expected public schools to teach children to be american numerous states drafted laws

including catholic schools it was promoted by groups such as the knights of pythias the federation of patriotic societies the oregon good government league the orange order and the ku klux klan the compulsory education act required almost all children in oregon between eight and sixteen years of age to attend public school by  roger nash baldwin an associate director of the aclu and a personal

in the making of america by frederick schrader as the th century progressed some councils in the united states became integrated but many were not church officials and organizations encouraged integration by the end of the s supreme knight luke e hart was actively encouraging councils to accept black candidates in  hart attended a special meeting at the white house hosted by president john f kennedy to discuss civil rights with other religious leaders a few months later a notre dame alumnus application was rejected by a local council because he was black six council officers resigned in protest and the incident made national news hart declared that the process for membership would be revised at the next supreme convention but died before he could see it take place the  supreme convention was scheduled to be held at the roosevelt hotel in new orleans a few days before the convention new supreme knight john w mcdevitt learned the hotel only admitted white guests and

external links historyedit the knights were founded during the golden age of fraternalism in the united states foundingedit michael j mcgivney founder of the knights of columbus michael j mcgivney an irishamerican catholic priest founded the knights of columbus in new haven connecticut he gathered a group of men from st marys parish for an organizational meeting on october   and the order was incorporated under the laws of the state of connecticut on march   although the first councils were all in that state the order spread throughout new england and the united states in subsequent years by  there were  councils comprising  knights twenty years later in  there were  knights in  councils the order was intended as a mutual benefit society these organizations which combined social aspects and ritual were especially flourishing during the latter third of the nineteenth century the socalled golden age of fraternalism as a parish priest in an immigrant community mcgivney saw what could happen to a family when the main income earner died and wanted to provide insurance to care for the widows and orphans left behind he also had to temporarily leave his seminary studies to care for his family when his father died however roman catholics in the late th century were regularly excluded from labor unions popular fraternal organizations and other organized groups that provided social services and papal encyclicals issued by the holy see prohibited catholics from participating as lodge members within freemasonry mcgivney wished to provide them with an alternative he also believed that catholicism and fraternalism were not incompatible and wanted to found a society to encourage men to be proud of their americancatholic heritage mcgivney traveled to boston to examine the massachusetts catholic order of foresters and to brooklyn to learn about the recently established catholic benevolent league both of which offered insurance benefits he found the latter to be lacking the excitement he thought was needed if his organization were to compete with the secret societies of the day he expressed an interest in establishing a new haven court of the foresters but the charter of massachusetts foresters prevented them from operating outside their commonwealth mcgivneys committee of st marys parishioners decided to form a club that was entirely original christopher columbus is the patron and namesake of the knights the name of columbus was also partially intended as a mild rebuke to anglosaxon protestant leaders who upheld the explorer a catholic genovese italian working for catholic spain as an american hero yet simultaneously sought to marginalize recent catholic immigrants in taking columbus as their patron they were expressing their belief that not only could catholics be full members of american society but were instrumental in its foundation mcgivney had originally conceived of the name sons of columbus but james t mullen who would become the first supreme knight successfully suggested that knights of columbus would better capture the ritualistic nature of the new organization by the time of the first annual convention in  the order was prospering the five councils throughout connecticut had a total of  members groups from other states were requesting information the charter of  included four statements of purpose including to promote such social and intellectual intercourse among its members as shall be desirable and proper and by such lawful means as to them shall seem best the new charter showed members desire to expand the organization beyond a simple mutual benefit insurance society the original insurance system devised by mcgivney gave a deceased knights widow a  death benefit each member was assessed  upon a death and when the number of knights grew beyond  the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase each member regardless of age was assessed equally as a result younger healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older there was also a sick benefit deposit for members who fell ill and could not work each sick knight was entitled to draw up to  a week for  weeks roughly equivalent to  in  dollars if he remained sick after that the council to which he belonged regulated the sum of money given to him creation of the fourth degreeedit from the very early days of the order members wanted to create a form of hierarchy and recognition for senior members this issue was discussed at the national meeting of  as early as  supreme knight james t mullen had proposed a patriotic degree with its own symbolic dress the k of c established the grand cross of the knights of columbus but awarded it only to cristobal colón y de la cerda duke of veragua and descendant of columbus when he visited the us in  about  members attended the first exemplification of the fourth degree at the lenox lyceum in new york on february   the event was infused with catholic and patriotic symbols and imagery that celebrated american catholic heritage the two knights leading the ceremony for example were the expositor of the constitution and the defender of the faith the ritual soon spread to other cities the new fourth degree members returned to their councils forming assemblies composed of members from several councils those assemblies chose the new members in  the board of directors officially approved a new degree exemplifying patriotism orderwide using the new york city model there was from early on a desire to receive within its ranks only the best and each candidate was required to produce a certificate from his parish priest attesting that he had received holy communion within the past two weeks persecution by the ku klux klanedit not long after the establishment of the fourth degree during the nadir of american race relations a bogus oath was circulated claiming that fourth degree knights swore to exterminate freemasons and protestants as well as flay burn alive boil kill and otherwise torture anyone including women and children when called upon to do so by church authorities it is a strange paradox according to some commentators that the degree devoted to patriotism should be accused of antiamericanism the bogus oath was based on a previous oath falsely attributed to the jesuits more than three centuries earlier the ku klux klan which was growing into a powerful force through the s spread the bogus oath far and wide as part of their campaign against catholics during the  presidential election the klan printed and distributed a million copies of the oath in an effort to defeat catholic democratic candidate al smith thomas s butler us representative from pennsylvania read it into the congressional record the bogus oath was refuted by the committee of public information a wartime propaganda agency of the us government misunderstanding catholicism the klan alleged that knights were only loyal to the pope and that they advocated the overthrow of the united states government across the country local state and the supreme councils offered rewards to anyone who could prove that the widely circulated oath was authentic no one could but that did not stop the klan from continuing to publish and distribute copies numerous state councils and the supreme council believed that this violent wave of religious prejudice was actuated by mercenary motives and that publication would stop if fines were imposed and jail time assessed they began suing distributors for libel this caused an end to such publication as the order did not wish to appear motivated by a vengeful spirit it asked for leniency from judges when sentencing offenders to help combat this misconception of what the fourth degree was about the actual oath taken by fourth degree members was submitted to various groups of prominent noncatholic men around the country for them to examine many made public declarations attesting to the loyalty and patriotism of the knights after examining the true oath a committee of highranking california freemasons a group singled out for violence in the bogus oath declared in  the ceremonial of the order of the knights of columbus teaches a high and noble patriotism instills a love of country inculcates a reverence of civic duty and holds up the constitution of our country as the richest and most precious possession of a knight of the order pierce v society of sistersedit after world war i many americans had a revival of concerns about assimilation of immigrants and worries about foreign values they expected public schools to teach children to be american numerous states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common american culture and in  the voters of oregon passed the oregon compulsory education act the law was primarily aimed at eliminating parochial schools including catholic schools it was promoted by groups such as the knights of pythias the federation of patriotic societies the oregon good government league the orange order and the ku klux klan the compulsory education act required almost all children in oregon between eight and sixteen years of age to attend public school by  roger nash baldwin an associate director of the aclu and a personal friend of thensupreme advocate and future supreme knight luke e hart offered to join forces with the order to challenge the law the knights of columbus pledged an immediate  to fight the law and any additional funds necessary to defeat it the case became known as pierce v society of sisters a seminal united states supreme court decision that significantly expanded coverage of the due process clause in the fourteenth amendment in a unanimous decision the court held that the act was unconstitutional and that parents not the state had the authority to educate children as they thought best racial integration in the usedit in the s there was growing antisemitism in the united states a lingering antigerman sentiment left over from world war i and antiblack violence was prevalent throughout the country to combat the animus targeted at racial and religious minorities including catholics the order formed a historical commission which published a series of books among other activities the knights of columbus racial contributions series of books included three titles the gift of black folk by w e b du bois the jews in the making of america by george cohen and the germans in the making of america by frederick schrader as the th century progressed some councils in the united states became integrated but many were not church officials and organizations encouraged integration by the end of the s supreme knight luke e hart was actively encouraging councils to accept black candidates in  hart attended a special meeting at the white house hosted by president john f kennedy to discuss civil rights with other religious leaders a few months later a notre dame alumnus application was rejected by a local council because he was black six council officers resigned in protest and the incident made national news hart declared that the process for membership would be revised at the next supreme convention but died before he could see it take place the  supreme convention was scheduled to be held at the roosevelt hotel in new orleans a few days before the convention new supreme knight john w mcdevitt learned the hotel only admitted white guests and immediately threatened to move to another venue the hotel changed its policy and so did the order the convention amended the admissions rule to require onethird of those voting to reject a new member in  the supreme convention amended its rules again requiring a majority of members voting to reject a candidate recent historyedit in  the cause for mcgivneys canonization was opened in the archdiocese of hartford and then was placed before the congregation for the causes of saints in  the father michael j mcgivney guild was formed in  to promote his cause and currently has more than  members membership in the knights of columbus does not automatically make one a member of the guild nor is membership restricted to knights members must elect to join on march   pope benedict xvi approved a decree recognizing mcgivneys heroic virtue significantly advancing the priests process toward sainthood mcgivney may now be referred to as the venerable servant of god if the cause is successful he would be the first priest born in the united states to be canonized as a saint degrees and principlesedit the order is dedicated to the principles of charity unity fraternity and patriotism a first degree exemplification ceremony by which a man joins the order explicates the virtue of charity he is then said to be a first degree knight of columbus after participating the subsequent degrees each of which focuses on another virtue he rises to that status upon reaching the third degree a gentleman is a full member priests do not participate directly in degree exemplifications as laymen do but rather take the degree by observationcitation needed the first ritual handbook was printed in  but contained only sections teaching unity and charity supreme knight mullen along with primary ritual author daniel colwell believed that the initiation ceremony should be held in three sections in accord with the trinity of virtues charity unity and brotherly love the third section expounding fraternity was officially adopted in  fourth

golden age of fraternalism in the united states foundingedit michael j mcgivney founder of the knights of columbus michael j mcgivney an irishamerican catholic priest founded the knights of columbus in new haven connecticut he gathered a group of men from st marys parish for an organizational meeting on october   and the order was incorporated under the laws of the state of connecticut on march   although the first councils were all in that state the order spread throughout new england and the united states in subsequent years by  there were  councils comprising  knights twenty years later in  there were  knights in  councils the order was intended as a mutual benefit society these organizations which combined social aspects and ritual were especially flourishing during the latter third of the nineteenth century the socalled golden age of fraternalism as a parish priest in an immigrant community mcgivney saw what could happen to a family when the main income earner died and wanted to provide insurance to care for the widows and orphans left behind he also had to temporarily leave his seminary studies to care for his family when his father died however roman catholics in the late th century were regularly excluded from labor unions popular fraternal organizations and other organized groups that provided social services and papal encyclicals issued by the holy see prohibited catholics from participating as lodge members within freemasonry mcgivney wished to provide them with an alternative he also believed that catholicism and fraternalism were not incompatible and wanted to found a society to encourage men to be proud of their americancatholic heritage mcgivney traveled to boston to examine the massachusetts catholic order of foresters and to brooklyn to learn about the recently established catholic benevolent league both of which offered insurance benefits he found the latter to be lacking the excitement he thought was needed if his organization were to compete with the secret societies of the day he expressed an interest in establishing a new haven court of the foresters but the charter of massachusetts foresters prevented them from operating outside their commonwealth mcgivneys committee of st marys parishioners decided to form a club that was entirely original christopher columbus is the patron and namesake of the knights the name of columbus was also partially intended as a mild rebuke to anglosaxon protestant leaders who upheld the explorer a catholic genovese italian working for catholic spain as an american hero yet simultaneously sought to marginalize recent catholic immigrants in taking columbus as their patron they were expressing their belief that not only could catholics be full members of american society but were instrumental in its foundation mcgivney had originally conceived of the name sons of columbus but james t mullen who would become the first supreme knight successfully suggested that knights of columbus would better capture the ritualistic nature of the new organization by the time of the first annual convention in  the order was prospering the five councils throughout connecticut had a total of  members groups from other states were requesting information the charter of  included four statements of purpose including to promote such social and intellectual intercourse among its members as shall be desirable and proper and by such lawful means as to them shall seem best the new charter showed members desire to expand the organization beyond a simple mutual benefit insurance society the original insurance system devised by mcgivney gave a deceased knights widow a  death benefit each member was assessed  upon a death and when the number of knights grew beyond  the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase each member regardless of age was assessed equally as a result younger healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older there was also a sick benefit deposit for members who fell ill and could not work each sick knight was entitled to draw up to  a week for  weeks roughly equivalent to  in  dollars if he remained sick after that the council to which he belonged regulated the sum of money given to him creation of the fourth degreeedit from the very early days of the order members wanted to create a form of hierarchy and recognition for senior members this issue was discussed at the national meeting of  as early as  supreme knight james t mullen had proposed a patriotic degree with its own symbolic dress the k of c established the grand cross of the knights of columbus but awarded it only to cristobal colón y de la cerda duke of veragua and descendant of columbus when he visited the us in  about  members attended the first exemplification of the fourth degree at the lenox lyceum in new york on february   the event was infused with catholic and patriotic symbols and imagery that celebrated american catholic heritage the two knights leading the ceremony for example were the expositor of the constitution and the defender of the faith the ritual soon spread to other cities the new fourth degree members returned to their councils forming assemblies composed of members from several councils those assemblies chose the new members in  the board of directors officially approved a new degree exemplifying patriotism orderwide using the new york city model there was from early on a desire to receive within its ranks only the best and each candidate was required to produce a certificate from his parish priest attesting that he had received holy communion within the past two weeks persecution by the ku klux klanedit not long after the establishment of the fourth degree during the nadir of american race relations a bogus oath was circulated claiming that fourth degree knights swore to exterminate freemasons and protestants as well as flay burn alive boil kill and otherwise torture anyone including women and children when called upon to do so by church authorities it is a strange paradox according to some commentators that the degree devoted to patriotism should be accused of antiamericanism the bogus oath was based on a previous oath falsely attributed to the jesuits more than three centuries earlier the ku klux klan which was growing into a powerful force through the s spread the bogus oath far and wide as part of their campaign against catholics during the  presidential election the klan printed and distributed a million copies of the oath in an effort to defeat catholic democratic candidate al smith thomas s butler us representative from pennsylvania read it into the congressional record the bogus oath was refuted by the committee of public information a wartime propaganda agency of the us government misunderstanding catholicism the klan alleged that knights were only loyal to the pope and that they advocated the overthrow of the united states government across the country local state and the supreme councils offered rewards to anyone who could prove that the widely circulated oath was authentic no one could but that did not stop the klan from continuing to publish and distribute copies numerous state councils and the supreme council believed that this violent wave of religious prejudice was actuated by mercenary motives and that publication would stop if fines were imposed and jail time assessed they began suing distributors for libel this caused an end to such publication as the order did not wish to appear motivated by a vengeful spirit it asked for leniency from judges when sentencing offenders to help combat this misconception of what the fourth degree was about the actual oath taken by fourth degree members was submitted to various groups of prominent noncatholic men around the country for them to examine many made public declarations attesting to the loyalty and patriotism of the knights after examining the true oath a committee of highranking california freemasons a group singled out for violence in the bogus oath declared in  the ceremonial of the order of the knights of columbus teaches a high and noble patriotism instills a love of country inculcates a reverence of civic duty and holds up the constitution of our country as the richest and most precious possession of a knight of the order pierce v society of sistersedit after world war i many americans had a revival of concerns about assimilation of immigrants and worries about foreign values they expected public schools to teach children to be american numerous states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common american culture and in  the voters of oregon passed the oregon compulsory education act the law was primarily aimed at eliminating parochial schools including catholic schools it was promoted by groups such as the knights of pythias the federation of patriotic societies the oregon good government league the orange order and the ku klux klan the compulsory education act required almost all children in oregon between eight and sixteen years of age to attend public school by  roger nash baldwin an associate director of the aclu and a personal friend of thensupreme advocate and future supreme knight luke e hart offered to join forces with the order to challenge the law the knights of columbus pledged an immediate  to fight the law and any additional funds necessary to defeat it the case became known as pierce v society of sisters a seminal united states supreme court decision that significantly expanded coverage of the due process clause in the fourteenth amendment in a unanimous decision the court held that the act was unconstitutional and that parents not the state had the authority to educate children as they thought best racial integration in the usedit in the s there was growing antisemitism in the united states a lingering antigerman sentiment left over from world war i and antiblack violence was prevalent throughout the country to combat the animus targeted at racial and religious minorities including catholics the order formed a historical commission which published a series of books among other activities the knights of columbus racial contributions series of books included three titles the gift of black folk by w e b du bois the jews in the making of america by george cohen and the germans in the making of america by frederick schrader as the th century progressed some councils in the united states became integrated but many were not church officials and organizations encouraged integration by the end of the s supreme knight luke e hart was actively encouraging councils to accept black candidates in  hart attended a special meeting at the white house hosted by president john f kennedy to discuss civil rights with other religious leaders a few months later a notre dame alumnus application was rejected by a local council because he was black six council officers resigned in protest and the incident made national news hart declared that the process for membership would be revised at the next supreme convention but died before he could see it take place the  supreme convention was scheduled to be held at the roosevelt hotel in new orleans a few days before the convention new supreme knight john w mcdevitt learned the hotel only admitted white guests and immediately threatened to move to another venue the hotel changed its policy and so did the order the convention amended the admissions rule to require onethird of those voting to reject a new member in  the supreme convention amended its rules again requiring a majority of members voting to reject a candidate recent historyedit in  the cause for mcgivneys canonization was opened in the archdiocese of hartford and then was placed before the congregation for the causes of saints in  the father michael j mcgivney guild was formed in  to promote his cause and currently has more than  members membership in the knights of columbus does not automatically make one a member of the guild nor is membership restricted to knights members must elect to join on march   pope benedict xvi approved a decree recognizing mcgivneys heroic virtue significantly advancing the priests process toward sainthood mcgivney may now be referred to as the venerable servant of god if the cause is successful he would be the first priest born in the united states to be canonized as a saint degrees and principlesedit the order is dedicated to the principles of charity unity fraternity and patriotism a first degree exemplification ceremony by which a man joins the order explicates the virtue of charity he is then said to be a first degree knight of columbus after participating the subsequent degrees each of which focuses on another virtue he rises to that status upon reaching the third degree a gentleman is a full member priests do not participate directly in degree exemplifications as laymen do but rather take the degree by observationcitation needed the first ritual handbook was printed in  but contained only sections teaching unity and charity supreme knight mullen along with primary ritual author daniel colwell believed that the initiation ceremony should be held in three sections in accord with the trinity of virtues charity unity and brotherly love the third section expounding fraternity was officially adopted in  fourth degreeedit knights of columbus color corps marching in full regalia for a st patricks day parade in fort collins colorado

golden age of fraternalism in the united states foundingedit michael j mcgivney founder of the knights of columbus michael j mcgivney an irishamerican catholic priest founded the knights of columbus in new haven connecticut he gathered a group of men from st marys parish for an organizational meeting on october   and the order was incorporated under the laws of the state of connecticut on march   although the first councils were all in that state the order spread throughout new england and the united states in subsequent years by  there were  councils comprising  knights twenty years later in  there were  knights in  councils the order was intended as a mutual benefit society these organizations which combined social aspects and ritual were especially flourishing during the latter third of the nineteenth century the socalled golden age of fraternalism as a parish priest in an immigrant community mcgivney saw what could happen to a family when the main income earner died and wanted to provide insurance to care for the widows and orphans left behind he also had to temporarily leave his seminary studies to care for his family when his father died however roman catholics in the late th century were regularly excluded from labor unions popular fraternal organizations and other organized groups that provided social services and papal encyclicals issued by the holy see prohibited catholics from participating as lodge members within freemasonry mcgivney wished to provide them with an alternative he also believed that catholicism and fraternalism were not incompatible and wanted to found a society to encourage men to be proud of their americancatholic heritage mcgivney traveled to boston to examine the massachusetts catholic order of foresters and to brooklyn to learn about the recently established catholic benevolent league both of which offered insurance benefits he found the latter to be lacking the excitement he thought was needed if his organization were to compete with the secret societies of the day he expressed an interest in establishing a new haven court of the foresters but the charter of massachusetts foresters prevented them from operating outside their commonwealth mcgivneys committee of st marys parishioners decided to form a club that was entirely original christopher columbus is the patron and namesake of the knights the name of columbus was also partially intended as a mild rebuke to anglosaxon protestant leaders who upheld the explorer a catholic genovese italian working for catholic spain as an american hero yet simultaneously sought to marginalize recent catholic immigrants in taking columbus as their patron they were expressing their belief that not only could catholics be full members of american society but were instrumental in its foundation mcgivney had originally conceived of the name sons of columbus but james t mullen who would become the first supreme knight successfully suggested that knights of columbus would better capture the ritualistic nature of the new organization by the time of the first annual convention in  the order was prospering the five councils throughout connecticut had a total of  members groups from other states were requesting information the charter of  included four statements of purpose including to promote such social and intellectual intercourse among its members as shall be desirable and proper and by such lawful means as to them shall seem best the new charter showed members desire to expand the organization beyond a simple mutual benefit insurance society the original insurance system devised by mcgivney gave a deceased knights widow a  death benefit each member was assessed  upon a death and when the number of knights grew beyond  the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase each member regardless of age was assessed equally as a result younger healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older there was also a sick benefit deposit for members who fell ill and could not work each sick knight was entitled to draw up to  a week for  weeks roughly equivalent to  in  dollars if he remained sick after that the council to which he belonged regulated the sum of money given to him creation of the fourth degreeedit from the very early days of the order members wanted to create a form of hierarchy and recognition for senior members this issue was discussed at the national meeting of  as early as  supreme knight james t mullen had proposed a patriotic degree with its own symbolic dress the k of c established the grand cross of the knights of columbus but awarded it only to cristobal colón y de la cerda duke of veragua and descendant of columbus when he visited the us in  about  members attended the first exemplification of the fourth degree at the lenox lyceum in new york on february   the event was infused with catholic and patriotic symbols and imagery that celebrated american catholic heritage the two knights leading the ceremony for example were the expositor of the constitution and the defender of the faith the ritual soon spread to other cities the new fourth degree members returned to their councils forming assemblies composed of members from several councils those assemblies chose the new members in  the board of directors officially approved a new degree exemplifying patriotism orderwide using the new york city model there was from early on a desire to receive within its ranks only the best and each candidate was required to produce a certificate from his parish priest attesting that he had received holy communion within the past two weeks persecution by the ku klux klanedit not long after the establishment of the fourth degree during the nadir of american race relations a bogus oath was circulated claiming that fourth degree knights swore to exterminate freemasons and protestants as well as flay burn alive boil kill and otherwise torture anyone including women and children when called upon to do so by church authorities it is a strange paradox according to some commentators that the degree devoted to patriotism should be accused of antiamericanism the bogus oath was based on a previous oath falsely attributed to the jesuits more than three centuries earlier the ku klux klan which was growing into a powerful force through the s spread the bogus oath far and wide as part of their campaign against catholics during the  presidential election the klan printed and distributed a million copies of the oath in an effort to defeat catholic democratic candidate al smith thomas s butler us representative from pennsylvania read it into the congressional record the bogus oath was refuted by the committee of public information a wartime propaganda agency of the us government misunderstanding catholicism the klan alleged that knights were only loyal to the pope and that they advocated the overthrow of the united states government across the country local state and the supreme councils offered rewards to anyone who could prove that the widely circulated oath was authentic no one could but that did not stop the klan from continuing to publish and distribute copies numerous state councils and the supreme council believed that this violent wave of religious prejudice was actuated by mercenary motives and that publication would stop if fines were imposed and jail time assessed they began suing distributors for libel this caused an end to such publication as the order did not wish to appear motivated by a vengeful spirit it asked for leniency from judges when sentencing offenders to help combat this misconception of what the fourth degree was about the actual oath taken by fourth degree members was submitted to various groups of prominent noncatholic men around the country for them to examine many made public declarations attesting to the loyalty and patriotism of the knights after examining the true oath a committee of highranking california freemasons a group singled out for violence in the bogus oath declared in  the ceremonial of the order of the knights of columbus teaches a high and noble patriotism instills a love of country inculcates a reverence of civic duty and holds up the constitution of our country as the richest and most precious possession of a knight of the order pierce v society of sistersedit after world war i many americans had a revival of concerns about assimilation of immigrants and worries about foreign values they expected public schools to teach children to be american numerous states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common american culture and in  the voters of oregon passed the oregon compulsory education act the law was primarily aimed at eliminating parochial schools including catholic schools it was promoted by groups such as the knights of pythias the federation of patriotic societies the oregon good government league the orange order and the ku klux klan the compulsory education act required almost all children in oregon between eight and sixteen years of age to attend public school by  roger nash baldwin an associate director of the aclu and a personal friend of thensupreme advocate and future supreme knight luke e hart offered to join forces with the order to challenge the law the knights of columbus pledged an immediate  to fight the law and any additional funds necessary to defeat it the case became known as pierce v society of sisters a seminal united states supreme court decision that significantly expanded coverage of the due process clause in the fourteenth amendment in a unanimous decision the court held that the act was unconstitutional and that parents not the state had the authority to educate children as they thought best racial integration in the usedit in the s there was growing antisemitism in the united states a lingering antigerman sentiment left over from world war i and antiblack violence was prevalent throughout the country to combat the animus targeted at racial and religious minorities including catholics the order formed a historical commission which published a series of books among other activities the knights of columbus racial contributions series of books included three titles the gift of black folk by w e b du bois the jews in the making of america by george cohen and the germans in the making of america by frederick schrader as the th century progressed some councils in the united states became integrated but many were not church officials and organizations encouraged integration by the end of the s supreme knight luke e hart was actively encouraging councils to accept black candidates in  hart attended a special meeting at the white house hosted by president john f kennedy to discuss civil rights with other religious leaders a few months later a notre dame alumnus application was rejected by a local council because he was black six council officers resigned in protest and the incident made national news hart declared that the process for membership would be revised at the next supreme convention but died before he could see it take place the  supreme convention was scheduled to be held at the roosevelt hotel in new orleans a few days before the convention new supreme knight john w mcdevitt learned the hotel only admitted white guests and immediately threatened to move to another venue the hotel changed its policy and so did the order the convention amended the admissions rule to require onethird of those voting to reject a new member in  the supreme convention amended its rules again requiring a majority of members voting to reject a candidate recent historyedit in  the cause for mcgivneys

mcgivney founder of the knights of columbus michael j mcgivney an irishamerican catholic priest founded the knights of columbus in new haven connecticut he gathered a group of men from st marys parish for an organizational meeting on october   and the order was incorporated under the laws of the state of connecticut on march   although the first councils were all in that state the order spread throughout new england and the united states in subsequent years by  there were  councils comprising  knights twenty years later in  there were  knights in  councils the order was intended as a mutual benefit society these organizations which combined social aspects and ritual were especially flourishing during the latter third of the nineteenth century the socalled golden age of fraternalism as a parish priest in an immigrant community mcgivney saw what could happen to a family when the main income earner died and wanted to provide insurance to care for the widows and orphans left behind he also had to temporarily leave his seminary studies to care for his family when his father died however roman catholics in the late th century were regularly excluded from labor unions popular fraternal organizations and other organized groups that provided social services and papal encyclicals issued by the holy see prohibited catholics from participating as lodge members within freemasonry mcgivney wished to provide them with an alternative he also believed that catholicism and fraternalism were not incompatible and wanted to found a society to encourage men to be proud of their americancatholic heritage mcgivney traveled to boston to examine the massachusetts catholic order of foresters and to brooklyn to learn about the recently established catholic benevolent league both of which offered insurance benefits he found the latter to be lacking the excitement he thought was needed if his organization were to compete with the secret societies of the day he expressed an interest in establishing a new haven court of the foresters but the charter of massachusetts foresters prevented them from operating outside their commonwealth mcgivneys committee of st marys parishioners decided to form a club that was entirely original christopher columbus is the patron and namesake of the knights the name of columbus was also partially intended as a mild rebuke to anglosaxon protestant leaders who upheld the explorer a catholic genovese italian working for catholic spain as an american hero yet simultaneously sought to marginalize recent catholic immigrants in taking columbus as their patron they were expressing their belief that not only could catholics be full members of american society but were instrumental in its foundation mcgivney had originally conceived of the name sons of columbus but james t mullen who would become the first supreme knight successfully suggested that knights of columbus would better capture the ritualistic nature of the new organization by the time of the first annual convention in  the order was prospering the five councils throughout connecticut had a total of  members groups from other states were requesting information the charter of  included four statements of purpose including to promote such social and intellectual intercourse among its members as shall be desirable and proper and by such lawful means as to them shall seem best the new charter showed members desire to expand the organization beyond a simple mutual benefit insurance society the original insurance system devised by mcgivney gave a deceased knights widow a  death benefit each member was assessed  upon a death and when the number of knights grew beyond  the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase each member regardless of age was assessed equally as a result younger healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older there was also a sick benefit deposit for members who fell ill and could not work each sick knight was entitled to draw up to  a week for  weeks roughly equivalent to  in  dollars if he remained sick after that the council to which he belonged regulated the sum of money given to him creation of the fourth degreeedit from the very early days of the order members wanted to create a form of hierarchy and recognition for senior members this issue was discussed at the national meeting of  as early as  supreme knight james t mullen had proposed a patriotic degree with its own symbolic dress the k of c established the grand cross of the knights of columbus but awarded it only to cristobal colón y de la cerda duke of veragua and descendant of columbus when he visited the us in  about  members attended the first exemplification of the fourth degree at the lenox lyceum in new york on february   the event was infused with catholic and patriotic symbols and imagery that celebrated american catholic heritage the two knights leading the ceremony for example were the expositor of the constitution and the defender of the faith the ritual soon spread to other cities the new fourth degree members returned to their councils forming assemblies composed of members from several councils those assemblies chose the new members in  the board of directors officially approved a new degree exemplifying patriotism orderwide using the new york city model there was from early on a desire to receive within its ranks only the best and each candidate was required to produce a certificate from his parish priest attesting that he had received holy communion within the past two weeks persecution by the ku klux klanedit not long after the establishment of the fourth degree during the nadir of american race relations a bogus oath was circulated claiming that fourth degree knights swore to exterminate freemasons and protestants as well as flay burn alive boil kill and otherwise torture anyone including women and children when called upon to do so by church authorities it is a strange paradox according to some commentators that the degree devoted to patriotism should be accused of antiamericanism the bogus oath was based on a previous oath falsely attributed to the jesuits more than three centuries earlier the ku klux klan which was growing into a powerful force through the s spread the bogus oath far and wide as part of their campaign against catholics during the  presidential election the klan printed and distributed a million copies of the oath in an effort to defeat catholic democratic candidate al smith thomas s butler us representative from pennsylvania read it into the congressional record the bogus oath was refuted by the committee of public information a wartime propaganda agency of the us government misunderstanding catholicism the klan alleged that knights were only loyal to the pope and that they advocated the overthrow of the united states government across the country local state and the supreme councils offered rewards to anyone who could prove that the widely circulated oath was authentic no one could but that did not stop the klan from continuing to publish and distribute copies numerous state councils and the supreme council believed that this violent wave of religious prejudice was actuated by mercenary motives and that publication would stop if fines were imposed and jail time assessed they began suing distributors for libel this caused an end to such publication as the order did not wish to appear motivated by a vengeful spirit it asked for leniency from judges when sentencing offenders to help combat this misconception of what the fourth degree was about the actual oath taken by fourth degree members was submitted to various groups of prominent noncatholic men around the country for them to examine many made public declarations attesting to the loyalty and patriotism of the knights after examining the true oath a committee of highranking california freemasons a group singled out for violence in the bogus oath declared in  the ceremonial of the order of the knights of columbus teaches a high and

historyedit the knights were founded during the golden age of fraternalism in the united states foundingedit michael j mcgivney founder of the knights of columbus michael j mcgivney an irishamerican catholic priest founded the knights of columbus in new haven connecticut he gathered a group of men from st marys parish for an organizational meeting on october   and the order was incorporated under the laws of the state of connecticut on march   although the first councils were all in that state the order spread throughout new england and the united states in subsequent years by  there were  councils comprising  knights twenty years later in  there were  knights in  councils the order was intended as a mutual benefit society these organizations which combined social aspects and ritual were especially flourishing during the latter third of the nineteenth century the socalled golden age of fraternalism as a parish priest in an immigrant community mcgivney saw what could happen to a family when the main income earner died and wanted to provide insurance to care for the widows and orphans left behind he also had to temporarily leave his seminary studies to care for his family when his father died however roman catholics in the late th century were regularly excluded from labor unions popular fraternal organizations and other organized groups that provided social services and papal encyclicals issued by the holy see prohibited catholics from participating as lodge members within freemasonry mcgivney wished to provide them with an alternative he also believed that catholicism and fraternalism were not incompatible and wanted to found a society to encourage men to be proud of their americancatholic heritage mcgivney traveled to boston to examine the massachusetts catholic order of foresters and to brooklyn to learn about the recently established catholic benevolent league both of which offered insurance benefits he found the latter to be lacking the excitement he thought was needed if his organization were to compete with the secret societies of the day he expressed an interest in establishing a new haven court of the foresters but the charter of massachusetts foresters prevented them from operating outside their commonwealth mcgivneys committee of st marys parishioners decided to form a club that was entirely original christopher columbus is the patron and namesake of the knights the name of columbus was also partially intended as a mild rebuke to anglosaxon protestant leaders who upheld the explorer a catholic genovese italian working for catholic spain as an american hero yet simultaneously sought to marginalize recent catholic immigrants in taking columbus as their patron they were expressing their belief that not only could catholics be full members of american society but were instrumental in its foundation mcgivney had originally conceived of the name sons of columbus but james t mullen who would become the first supreme knight successfully suggested that knights of columbus would better capture the ritualistic nature of the new organization by the time of the first annual convention in  the order was prospering the five councils throughout connecticut had a total of  members groups from other states were requesting information the charter of  included four statements of purpose including to promote such social and intellectual intercourse among its members as shall be desirable and proper and by such lawful means as to them shall seem best the new charter showed members desire to expand the organization beyond a simple mutual benefit insurance society the original insurance system devised by mcgivney gave a deceased knights widow a  death benefit each member was assessed  upon a death and when the number of knights grew beyond  the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase each member regardless of age was assessed equally as a result younger healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older there was also a sick benefit deposit for members who fell ill and could not work each sick knight was entitled to draw up to  a week for  weeks roughly equivalent to  in  dollars if he remained sick after that the council to which he belonged regulated the sum of money given to him creation of the fourth degreeedit from the very early days of the order members wanted to create a form of hierarchy and recognition for senior members this issue was discussed at the national meeting of  as early as  supreme knight james t mullen had proposed a patriotic degree with its own symbolic dress the k of c established the grand cross of the knights of columbus but awarded it only to cristobal colón y de la cerda duke of veragua and descendant of columbus when he visited the us in  about  members attended the first exemplification of the fourth degree at the lenox lyceum in new york on february   the event was infused with catholic and patriotic symbols and imagery that celebrated american catholic heritage the two knights leading the ceremony for example were the expositor of the constitution and the defender of the faith the ritual soon spread to other cities the new fourth degree members returned to their councils forming assemblies composed of members from several councils those assemblies chose the new members in  the board of directors officially approved a new degree exemplifying patriotism orderwide using the new york city model there was from early on a desire to receive within its ranks only the best and each candidate was required to produce a certificate from his parish priest attesting that he had received holy communion within the past two weeks persecution by the ku klux klanedit not long after the establishment of the fourth degree during the nadir of american race relations a bogus oath was circulated claiming that fourth degree knights swore to exterminate freemasons and protestants as well as flay burn alive boil kill and otherwise torture anyone including women and children when called upon to do so by church authorities it is a strange paradox according to some commentators that the degree devoted to patriotism should be accused of antiamericanism the bogus oath was based on a previous oath falsely attributed to the jesuits more than three centuries earlier the ku klux klan which was growing into a powerful force through the s spread the bogus oath far and wide as part of their campaign against catholics during the  presidential election the klan printed and distributed a million copies of the oath in an effort to defeat catholic democratic candidate al smith thomas s butler us representative from pennsylvania read it into the congressional record the bogus oath was refuted by the committee of public information a wartime propaganda agency of the us government misunderstanding catholicism the klan alleged that knights were only loyal to the pope and that they advocated the overthrow of the united states government across the country local state and the supreme councils offered rewards to anyone who could prove that the widely circulated oath was authentic no one could but that did not stop the klan from continuing to publish and distribute copies numerous state councils and the supreme council believed that this violent wave of religious prejudice was actuated by mercenary motives and that publication would stop if fines were imposed and jail time assessed they began suing distributors for libel this caused an end to such publication as the order did not wish to appear motivated by a vengeful spirit it asked for leniency from judges when sentencing offenders to help combat this misconception of what the fourth degree was about the actual oath taken by fourth degree members was submitted to various groups of prominent noncatholic men around the country for them to examine many made public declarations attesting to the loyalty and patriotism of the knights after examining the true oath a committee of highranking california freemasons a group singled out for violence in the bogus oath declared in  the ceremonial of the order of the knights of columbus teaches a high and noble patriotism instills a love of country inculcates a reverence of civic duty and holds up the constitution of our country as the richest and most precious possession of a knight of the order pierce v society of sistersedit after world war i many americans had a revival of concerns about assimilation of immigrants and worries about foreign values they expected public schools to teach children to be american numerous states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common american culture and in  the voters of oregon passed the oregon compulsory education act the law was primarily aimed at eliminating parochial schools including catholic schools it was promoted by groups such as the knights of pythias the federation of patriotic societies the oregon good government league the orange order and the ku klux klan the compulsory education act required almost all children in oregon between eight and sixteen years of age to attend public school by  roger nash baldwin an associate director of the aclu and a personal friend of thensupreme advocate and future supreme knight luke e hart offered to join forces with the order to challenge the law the knights of columbus pledged an immediate  to fight the law and any additional funds necessary to defeat it the case became known as pierce v society of sisters a seminal united states supreme court decision that significantly expanded coverage of the due process clause in the fourteenth amendment in a unanimous decision the court held that the act was unconstitutional and that parents not the state had the authority to educate children as they thought best racial integration in the usedit in the s there was growing antisemitism in the united states a lingering antigerman sentiment left over from world war i and antiblack violence was prevalent throughout the country to combat the animus targeted at racial and religious minorities including catholics the order formed a historical commission which published a series of books among other activities the knights of columbus racial contributions series of books included three titles the gift of black folk by w e b du bois the jews in the making of america by george cohen and the germans in the making of america by frederick schrader as the th century progressed some councils in the united states became integrated but many were not church officials and organizations encouraged integration by the end of the s supreme knight luke e hart was actively encouraging councils to accept black candidates in  hart attended a special meeting at the white house hosted by president john f kennedy to discuss civil rights with other religious leaders a few months later a notre dame alumnus application was rejected by a local council because he was black six council officers resigned in protest and the incident made national news hart declared that the process for membership would be revised at the next supreme convention but died before he could see it take place the  supreme convention was scheduled to be held at the roosevelt hotel in new orleans a few days before the convention new supreme knight john w mcdevitt learned the hotel only admitted white guests and immediately threatened to move to another venue the hotel changed its policy and so did the order the convention amended the admissions rule to require onethird of those voting to reject a new member in  the supreme convention amended its rules again requiring a majority of members voting to reject a candidate recent historyedit in  the cause for mcgivneys canonization was opened in the archdiocese of hartford and then was placed before the congregation for the causes of saints in  the father michael j mcgivney guild was formed in  to promote his cause and currently has more than  members membership in the knights of columbus does not automatically make one a member of the guild nor is membership restricted to knights members must elect to join on march   pope benedict xvi approved a decree recognizing mcgivneys heroic virtue significantly advancing the priests process toward sainthood mcgivney may now be referred to as the venerable servant of god if the cause is successful he would be the first priest born in the united states to be canonized as a saint degrees and principlesedit the order is dedicated to the principles of charity unity fraternity and patriotism a first degree exemplification ceremony by which a man joins the order explicates the virtue of charity he is then said to be a first degree knight of columbus after participating the subsequent degrees each of which focuses on another virtue he rises to that status upon reaching the third degree a gentleman is a full member priests do not participate directly in degree exemplifications as laymen do but rather take the degree by observationcitation needed the first ritual handbook was printed in  but contained only sections teaching unity and charity supreme knight mullen along with primary ritual author daniel colwell believed that the initiation ceremony should be held in three sections in accord with the trinity of virtues charity unity and brotherly love the third section expounding fraternity was officially adopted in  fourth

golden age of fraternalism in the united states foundingedit michael j mcgivney founder of the knights of columbus michael j mcgivney an irishamerican catholic priest founded the knights of columbus in new haven connecticut he gathered a group of men from st marys parish for an organizational meeting on october   and the order was incorporated under the laws of the state of connecticut on march   although the first councils were all in that state the order spread throughout new england and the united states in subsequent years by  there were  councils comprising  knights twenty years later in  there were  knights in  councils the order was intended as a mutual benefit society these organizations which combined social aspects and ritual were especially flourishing during the latter third of the nineteenth century the socalled golden age of fraternalism as a parish priest in an immigrant community mcgivney saw what could happen to a family when the main income earner died and wanted to provide insurance to care for the widows and orphans left behind he also had to temporarily leave his seminary studies to care for his family when his father died however roman catholics in the late th century were regularly excluded from labor unions popular fraternal organizations and other organized groups that provided social services and papal encyclicals issued by the holy see prohibited catholics from participating as lodge members within freemasonry mcgivney wished to provide them with an alternative he also believed that catholicism and fraternalism were not incompatible and wanted to found a society to encourage men to be proud of their americancatholic heritage mcgivney traveled to boston to examine the massachusetts catholic order of foresters and to brooklyn to learn about the recently established catholic benevolent league both of which offered insurance benefits he found the latter to be lacking the excitement he thought was needed if his organization were to compete with the secret societies of the day he expressed an interest in establishing a new haven court of the foresters but the charter of massachusetts foresters prevented them from operating outside their commonwealth mcgivneys committee of st marys parishioners decided to form a club that was entirely original christopher columbus is the patron and namesake of the knights the name of columbus was also partially intended as a mild rebuke to anglosaxon protestant leaders who upheld the explorer a catholic genovese italian working for catholic spain as an american hero yet simultaneously sought to marginalize recent catholic immigrants in taking columbus as their patron they were expressing their belief that not only could catholics be full members of american society but were instrumental in its foundation mcgivney had originally conceived of the name sons of columbus but james t mullen who would become the first supreme knight successfully suggested that knights of columbus would better capture the ritualistic nature of the new organization by the time of the first annual convention in  the order was prospering the five councils throughout connecticut had a total of  members groups from other states were requesting information the charter of  included four statements of purpose including to promote such social and intellectual intercourse among its members as shall be desirable and proper and by such lawful means as to them shall seem best the new charter showed members desire to expand the organization beyond a simple mutual benefit insurance society the original insurance system devised by mcgivney gave a deceased knights widow a  death benefit each member was assessed  upon a death and when the number of knights grew beyond  the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase each member regardless of age was assessed equally as a result younger healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older there was also a sick benefit deposit for members who fell ill and could not work each sick knight was entitled to draw up to  a week for  weeks roughly equivalent to  in  dollars if he remained sick after that the council to which he belonged regulated the sum of money given to him creation of the fourth degreeedit from the very early days of the order members wanted to create a form of hierarchy and recognition for senior members this issue was discussed at the national meeting of  as early as  supreme knight james t mullen had proposed a patriotic degree with its own symbolic dress the k of c established the grand cross of the knights of columbus but awarded it only to cristobal colón y de la cerda duke of veragua and descendant of columbus when he visited the us in  about  members attended the first exemplification of the fourth degree at the lenox lyceum in new york on february   the event was infused with catholic and patriotic symbols and imagery that celebrated american catholic heritage the two knights leading the ceremony for example were the expositor of the constitution and the defender of the faith the ritual soon spread to other cities the new fourth degree members returned to their councils forming assemblies composed of members from several councils those assemblies chose the new members in  the board of directors officially approved a new degree exemplifying patriotism orderwide using the new york city model there was from early on a desire to receive within its ranks only the best and each candidate was required to produce a certificate from his parish priest attesting that he had received holy communion within the past two weeks persecution by the ku klux klanedit not long after the establishment of the fourth degree during the nadir of american race relations a bogus oath was circulated claiming that fourth degree knights swore to exterminate freemasons and protestants as well as flay burn alive boil kill and otherwise torture anyone including women and children when called upon to do so by church authorities it is a strange paradox according to some commentators that the degree devoted to patriotism should be accused of antiamericanism the bogus oath was based on a previous oath falsely attributed to the jesuits more than three centuries earlier the ku klux klan which was growing into a powerful force through the s spread the bogus oath far and wide as part of their campaign against catholics during the  presidential election the klan printed and distributed a million copies of the oath in an effort to defeat catholic democratic candidate al smith thomas s butler us representative from pennsylvania read it into the congressional record the bogus oath was refuted by the committee of public information a wartime propaganda agency of the us government misunderstanding catholicism the klan alleged that knights were only loyal to the pope and that they advocated the overthrow of the united states government across the country local state and the supreme councils offered rewards to anyone who could prove that the widely circulated oath was authentic no one could but that did not stop the klan from continuing to publish and distribute copies numerous state councils and the supreme council believed that this violent wave of religious prejudice was actuated by mercenary motives and that publication would stop if fines were imposed and jail time assessed they began suing distributors for libel this caused an end to such publication as the order did not wish to appear motivated by a vengeful spirit it asked for leniency from judges when sentencing offenders to help combat this misconception of what the fourth degree was about the actual oath taken by fourth degree members was submitted to various groups of prominent noncatholic men around the country for them to examine many made public declarations attesting to the loyalty and patriotism of the knights after examining the true oath a committee of highranking california freemasons a group singled out for violence in the bogus oath declared in  the ceremonial of the order of the knights of columbus teaches a high and noble patriotism instills a love of country inculcates a reverence of civic duty and holds up the constitution of our country as the richest and most precious possession of a knight of the order pierce v society of sistersedit after world war i many americans had a revival of concerns about assimilation of immigrants and worries about foreign values they expected public schools to teach children to be american numerous states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common american culture and in  the voters of oregon passed the oregon compulsory education act the law was primarily aimed at eliminating parochial schools including catholic schools it was promoted by groups such as the knights of pythias the federation of patriotic societies the oregon good government league the orange order and the ku klux klan the compulsory education act required almost all children in oregon between eight and sixteen years of age to attend public school by  roger nash baldwin an associate director of the aclu and a personal friend of thensupreme advocate and future supreme knight luke e hart offered to join forces with the order to challenge the law the knights of columbus pledged an immediate  to fight the law and any additional funds necessary to defeat it the case became known as pierce v society of sisters a seminal united states supreme court decision that significantly expanded coverage of the due process clause in the fourteenth amendment in a unanimous decision the court held that the act was unconstitutional and that parents not the state had the authority to educate children as they thought best racial integration in the usedit in the s there was growing antisemitism in the united states a lingering antigerman sentiment left over from world war i and antiblack violence was prevalent throughout the country to combat the animus targeted at racial and religious minorities including catholics the order formed a historical commission which published a series of books among other activities the knights of columbus racial contributions series of books included three titles the gift of black folk by w e b du bois the jews in the making of america by george cohen and the germans in the making of america by frederick schrader as the th century progressed some councils in the united states became integrated but many were not church officials and organizations encouraged integration by the end of the s supreme knight luke e hart was actively encouraging councils to accept black candidates in  hart attended a special meeting at the white house hosted by president john f kennedy to discuss civil rights with other religious leaders a few months later a notre dame alumnus application was rejected by a local council because he was black six council officers resigned in protest and the incident made national news hart declared that the process for membership would be revised at the next supreme convention but died before he could see it take place the  supreme convention was scheduled to be held at the roosevelt hotel in new orleans a few days before the convention new supreme knight john w mcdevitt learned the hotel only admitted white guests and immediately threatened to move to another venue the hotel changed its policy and so did the order the convention amended the admissions rule to require onethird of those

mcgivney in new haven connecticut in  it was named in honor of the mariner christopher columbus originally serving as a mutual benefit society to working class and immigrant catholics in the united

mcgivney founder of the knights of columbus michael j mcgivney an irishamerican catholic priest founded the knights of columbus in new haven connecticut he gathered a group of men from st marys parish for an organizational meeting on october   and the order was incorporated under the laws of the state of connecticut on march   although the first councils were all in that state the order spread throughout new england and the united states in subsequent years by  there were  councils comprising  knights twenty years later in  there were  knights in  councils the order was intended as a mutual benefit society these organizations which combined social aspects and ritual were especially flourishing during the latter third of the nineteenth century the socalled golden age of fraternalism as a parish priest in an immigrant community mcgivney saw what could happen to a family when the main income earner died and wanted to provide insurance to care for the widows and orphans left behind he also had to temporarily leave his seminary studies to care for his family when his father died however roman catholics in the late th century were regularly excluded from labor unions popular fraternal organizations and other organized groups that provided social services and papal encyclicals issued by the holy see prohibited catholics from participating as lodge members within freemasonry mcgivney wished to provide them with an alternative he also believed that catholicism and fraternalism were not incompatible and wanted to found a society to encourage men to be proud of their americancatholic heritage mcgivney traveled to boston to examine the massachusetts catholic order of foresters and to brooklyn to learn about the recently established catholic benevolent league both of which offered insurance benefits he found the latter to be lacking the excitement he thought was needed if his organization were to compete with the secret societies of the day he expressed an interest in establishing a new haven court of the foresters but the charter of massachusetts foresters prevented them from operating outside their commonwealth mcgivneys committee of st marys parishioners decided to form a club that was entirely original christopher columbus is the patron and namesake of the knights the name of columbus was also partially intended as a mild rebuke to anglosaxon protestant leaders who upheld the explorer a catholic genovese italian working for catholic spain as an american hero yet simultaneously sought to marginalize recent catholic immigrants in taking columbus as their patron they were expressing their belief that not only could catholics be full members of american society but were instrumental in its foundation mcgivney had originally conceived of the name sons of columbus but james t mullen who would become the first supreme knight successfully suggested that knights of columbus would better capture the ritualistic nature of the new organization by the time of the first annual convention in  the order was prospering the five councils throughout connecticut had a total of  members groups from other states were requesting information the charter of  included four statements of purpose including to promote such social and intellectual intercourse among its members as shall be desirable and proper and by such lawful means as to them shall seem best the new charter showed members desire to expand the organization beyond a simple mutual benefit insurance society the original insurance system devised by mcgivney gave a deceased knights widow a  death benefit each member was assessed  upon a death and when the number of knights grew beyond  the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase each member regardless of age was assessed equally as a result younger healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older there was also a sick benefit deposit for members who fell ill and could not work each sick knight was entitled to draw up to  a week for  weeks roughly equivalent to  in  dollars if he remained sick after that the council to which he belonged regulated the sum of money given to him creation of the fourth degreeedit from the very early days of the order members wanted to create a form of hierarchy and recognition for senior members this issue was discussed at the national meeting of  as early as  supreme knight james t mullen had proposed a patriotic degree with its own symbolic dress the k of c established the grand cross of the knights of columbus but awarded it only to cristobal colón y de la cerda duke of veragua and descendant of columbus when he visited the us in  about  members attended the first exemplification of the fourth degree at the lenox lyceum in new york on february   the event was infused with catholic and patriotic symbols and imagery that celebrated american catholic heritage the two knights leading the ceremony for example were the expositor of the constitution and the defender of the faith the ritual soon spread to other cities the new fourth degree members returned to their councils forming assemblies composed of members from several councils those assemblies chose the new members in  the board of directors officially approved a new degree exemplifying patriotism orderwide using the new york city model there was from early on a desire to receive within its ranks only the best and each candidate was required to produce a certificate from his parish priest attesting that he had received holy communion within the past two weeks persecution by the ku klux klanedit not long after the establishment of the fourth degree during the nadir of american race relations a bogus oath was circulated claiming that fourth degree knights swore to exterminate freemasons and protestants as well as flay burn alive boil kill and otherwise torture anyone including women and children when called upon to do so by church authorities it is a strange paradox according to some commentators that the degree devoted to patriotism should be accused of antiamericanism the bogus oath was based on a previous oath falsely attributed to the jesuits more than three centuries earlier the ku klux klan which was growing into a powerful force through the s spread the bogus oath far and wide as part of their campaign against catholics during the  presidential election the klan printed and distributed a million copies of the oath in an effort to defeat catholic democratic candidate al smith thomas s butler us representative from pennsylvania read it into the congressional record the bogus oath was refuted by the committee of public information a wartime propaganda agency of the us government misunderstanding catholicism the klan alleged that knights were only loyal to the pope and that they advocated the overthrow of the united states government across the country local state and the supreme councils offered rewards to anyone who could prove that the widely circulated oath was authentic no one could but that did not stop the klan from continuing to publish and distribute copies numerous state councils and the supreme council believed that this violent wave of religious prejudice was actuated by mercenary motives and that publication would stop if fines were imposed and jail time assessed they began suing distributors for libel this caused an end to such publication as the order did not wish to appear motivated by a vengeful spirit it asked for leniency from judges when sentencing offenders to help combat this misconception of what the fourth degree was about the actual oath taken by fourth degree members was submitted to various groups of prominent noncatholic men around the country for them to examine many made public declarations attesting to the loyalty and patriotism of the knights after examining the true oath a committee of highranking california freemasons a group singled out for violence in the bogus oath declared in  the ceremonial of the order of the knights of columbus teaches a high and noble patriotism instills a love of country inculcates a reverence of civic duty and holds up the constitution of our country as the richest and most precious possession of a knight of the order pierce v society of sistersedit after world war i many americans had a revival of concerns about assimilation of immigrants and worries about foreign values they expected public schools to teach children to be american numerous states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common american culture and in  the voters of oregon passed the oregon compulsory education act the law was primarily aimed at eliminating parochial schools including catholic schools it was promoted by groups such as the knights of pythias the federation of patriotic societies the oregon good government league the orange order and the ku klux klan the compulsory education act required almost all children in oregon between eight and sixteen years of age to attend public school by  roger nash baldwin an associate director of the aclu and a personal friend of thensupreme advocate and future supreme knight luke e hart offered to join forces with the order to challenge the law the knights of columbus pledged an immediate  to fight the law and any additional funds necessary to defeat it the case became known as pierce v society of sisters a seminal united states supreme court decision that significantly expanded coverage of the due process clause in the fourteenth amendment in a unanimous decision the court held that the act was unconstitutional and that parents not the state had the authority to educate children as they thought best racial integration in the usedit in the s there was growing antisemitism in the united states a lingering antigerman sentiment left over from world war i and antiblack violence was prevalent throughout the country to combat the animus targeted at racial and religious minorities including catholics the order formed a historical commission which published a series of books among other activities the knights of columbus racial contributions series of books included three titles the gift of black folk by w e b du bois the jews in the making of america by george cohen and the germans in the making of america by frederick schrader as the th century progressed some councils in the united states became integrated but many were not church officials and organizations encouraged integration by the end of the s supreme knight luke e hart was actively encouraging councils to accept black candidates in  hart attended a special meeting at the white house hosted by president john f kennedy to discuss civil rights with other religious leaders a few months later a notre dame alumnus application was rejected by a local council because he was black six council officers resigned in protest and the incident made national news hart declared that the process for membership would be revised at the next supreme convention but died before he could see it take place the  supreme convention was scheduled to be held at the roosevelt hotel in new orleans a few days before the convention new supreme knight john w mcdevitt learned the hotel only admitted white guests and immediately threatened to move to another venue the hotel changed its policy and so did the order the convention amended the admissions rule to require onethird of those voting to reject a new member in  the supreme convention amended its rules again requiring a majority of members voting to reject a candidate recent historyedit in  the cause for mcgivneys

degree exemplifications as laymen do but rather take the degree by observationcitation needed the first ritual handbook was printed in  but contained only sections teaching unity and charity supreme

love the third section expounding fraternity was officially adopted in  fourth degreeedit knights of columbus color corps marching in full regalia for a st patricks day parade in fort collins colorado
