sanofisynthélabo was formed in  when sanofi merged with synthélabo at the time of the merger sanofi was the second largest pharmaceutical group in france in terms of sales and synthélabo was the third largest the merged company was based in paris france– the merged companies focused on pharmaceuticals divesting several businesses soon after the merger including beauty diagnostics animal health and

products and in the s during the aids epidemic merieux and other companies were involved in scandals related to hivcontaminated haemophilia blood products that were sold to developing nations in mid  aventis and millennium pharmaceuticals a us biotechnology company formed to discover new drugs based on the thennew science of genomics announced that aventis would make a m investment in millennium and would pay m to millennium in research fees over five years one of the largest such deals between a big pharmaceutical company and a biotech company at the time in late  in the midst of the recall of starlink its genetically modified maize product aventis announced that it had determined to sell off aventis cropscience the seed and pesticide business unit it had created from the agriculture businesses of its predecessors in october  bayer and aventis announced that bayer would acquire the unit for about  billion with the unit becoming bayer cropscience and making bayer the worlds secondlargest agrochemical company behind syngenta in  aventis entered into a collaboration with regeneron a new york biotechnology company to develop regenerons vegfinhibiting drug aflibercept in the

colorectal cancer in combination with other agents under the brand name zaltrap in  sanofiaventis mergeredit sanofiaventis was formed in  when sanofisynthélabo acquired aventis in early  sanofisynthélabo made a hostile takeover bid worth € billion for aventis initially aventis rejected the bid because it felt that the bid offered inferior value based on the companys share value and the board of aventis went so far as to enact poison pill provisions and to invite novartis to enter merger negotiations the threemonth takeover battle concluded when sanofisynthélabo launched a friendly bid of € billion in place of the previously rejected hostile bid the french government played a strong role desiring what it called a local solution by putting heavy pressure on sanofisynthélabo to raise its bid for aventis and for aventis to accept the offer and by rejecting aventis poison pill proposal one of the largest risks in the deal for both sides was the fate of the patents protecting clopidogrel plavix which was one of the topselling drugs in the world at the time and the major source of sanofis revenue postmerger activitiesedit in  iraqis infected with hiv sued sanofi and baxter due to hivcontaminated haemophilia blood products sold by merieux in the s in  the us patents on clopidogrel plavix were challenged when a canadian generics company apotex filed an abbreviated new drug application under the hatchwaxman act received fda approval and started marketing a generic clopidogrel while sanofiaventis and its partner on the drug bristol myers squibb bms were able to get an injunction to stop apotex from selling the drug the case became complicated when settlement negotiations fell apart twice  the second time due to an oral agreement made by bms ceo peter dolan that bms failed to disclose to the federal trade commission during the review of the settlement agreement to ensure that it did not violate antitrust law when apotex disclosed the oral agreement to the ftc the ftc launched an investigation that led to dolan being fired by bms apotex finally lost on the patent litigation issues after its third appeal was decided in favor of bmssanofi in november  apotex had to pay  million in damages and  million in interest for infringing the patent which it paid in full by february  apotex also sued bms and sanofi for  billion for allegedly breaching the settlement agreement and apotex lost a jury trial in march  in  sanofiaventis expanded on aventis prior relationship with regeneron in the new deal sanofiaventis agreed to pay regeneron

messer chemicals merieux has been in the business of selling blood products and in the s during the aids epidemic merieux and other companies were involved in scandals related to hivcontaminated haemophilia blood products that were sold to developing nations in mid  aventis and millennium pharmaceuticals a us biotechnology company formed to discover new drugs based on the thennew science of genomics announced that aventis would make a m investment in millennium and would pay m to millennium in research fees over five years one of the largest such deals between a big pharmaceutical company and a biotech company at the time in late  in the midst of the recall of starlink its genetically modified maize product aventis announced that it had determined to sell off aventis

was formed in  when sanofisynthélabo acquired aventis in early  sanofisynthélabo made a hostile takeover bid worth € billion for aventis initially aventis rejected the bid because it felt that the bid offered inferior value based on the companys share value and the board of aventis went so far as to enact poison pill provisions and to invite novartis to enter merger negotiations the threemonth takeover battle concluded when sanofisynthélabo launched a friendly bid of € billion in place of the previously rejected hostile bid the french government played a strong role desiring what it called a local solution by putting heavy pressure on sanofisynthélabo to raise its bid for aventis and for aventis to accept the offer and by rejecting aventis poison pill proposal one of the largest risks in the deal for both sides was the fate of the patents protecting clopidogrel plavix which was one of the topselling drugs in the world at the time and the major source of sanofis revenue postmerger activitiesedit in  iraqis infected with hiv sued sanofi and baxter due to hivcontaminated haemophilia blood products sold by merieux in the s in  the us patents on clopidogrel plavix were challenged

its partner on the drug bristol myers squibb bms were able to get an injunction to stop apotex from selling the drug the case became complicated when settlement negotiations fell apart twice  the second time due to an oral agreement made by bms ceo peter dolan that bms failed to disclose to the federal trade commission during the review of the settlement agreement to ensure that it did not violate antitrust law when apotex disclosed the oral agreement to the ftc the ftc launched an investigation that led to dolan being fired by bms apotex finally lost on the patent litigation issues after its third appeal was decided in favor of bmssanofi in november  apotex had to pay  million in damages and  million in interest for infringing the patent which it paid in full by february  apotex also sued bms and sanofi for  billion for allegedly breaching the settlement agreement and apotex lost a jury trial in march  in  sanofiaventis expanded on aventis prior relationship with regeneron in

laboratoires robert  carrière founded in  in  the french cosmetics group l’oréal acquired the majority of its share capital in  synthelabo acquired laboratories delalande and laboratoires delagrange and through this deal picked up the product metoclopramide sanofisynthélabo was formed in  when sanofi merged with synthélabo at the time of the merger sanofi was the second largest pharmaceutical group in france in terms of sales and synthélabo was the third largest the merged company was based in paris france– the merged companies focused on pharmaceuticals divesting several businesses soon after the merger including beauty diagnostics animal health and nutrition custom chemicals and two medical equipment businesses aventisedit aventis was formed in  when french company rhônepoulenc sa merged with the german corporation hoechst marion roussel which itself was formed from the  merger of hoechst ag with cassella roussel uclaf and marion merrell dow the merged company was based in

messer chemicals merieux has been in the business of selling blood products and in the s during the aids epidemic merieux and other companies were involved in scandals related to hivcontaminated haemophilia blood products that were sold to developing nations in mid  aventis and millennium pharmaceuticals a us biotechnology company formed to discover new drugs based on the thennew science of genomics announced that aventis would make a m investment in millennium and would pay m to millennium in research fees over five years one of the largest such deals between a big pharmaceutical company and a biotech company at the time in late  in the midst of the recall of starlink its genetically modified maize product aventis announced that it had determined to sell off aventis cropscience the seed and pesticide business unit it had created from the agriculture businesses of its predecessors in october  bayer and aventis announced that bayer would acquire the unit for about  billion with the unit becoming bayer cropscience and making bayer the worlds secondlargest agrochemical company behind syngenta in  aventis entered into a collaboration with regeneron a new york

in clinical trials regeneron and sanofi got the drug approved in metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with other agents under the brand name zaltrap in  sanofiaventis mergeredit sanofiaventis was formed in  when sanofisynthélabo acquired aventis in early  sanofisynthélabo made a hostile takeover bid worth € billion for aventis initially aventis rejected the bid because it felt that the bid offered inferior value based on the companys share value and the board of aventis went so far as to enact poison pill provisions and to invite novartis to enter merger negotiations the threemonth takeover battle concluded when sanofisynthélabo launched a friendly bid of € billion in place of the previously rejected hostile bid the french government played a strong role desiring what it called a local solution by putting heavy pressure on sanofisynthélabo to raise its bid for aventis and for aventis to accept the offer and by rejecting aventis poison pill proposal one of the largest risks in the deal for both sides was the fate of the patents protecting clopidogrel plavix which was one of the topselling drugs in the world at the time and the major source of sanofis revenue postmerger activitiesedit in  iraqis infected with hiv sued sanofi and baxter due to hivcontaminated haemophilia blood products sold by merieux in the s in  the us patents on clopidogrel plavix were challenged

its partner on the drug bristol myers squibb bms were able to get an injunction to stop apotex from selling the drug the case became complicated when settlement negotiations fell apart twice  the second time due to an oral agreement made by bms ceo peter dolan that bms failed to disclose to the federal trade commission during the review of the settlement agreement to ensure that it did not violate antitrust law when apotex disclosed the oral agreement to the ftc the ftc launched an investigation that led to dolan being fired by bms apotex finally lost on the patent litigation issues after its third appeal was decided in favor of bmssanofi in november  apotex had to pay  million in damages and  million in interest for infringing the patent which it paid in full by february  apotex also sued bms and sanofi for  billion for allegedly breaching the settlement agreement and apotex lost a jury trial in march  in  sanofiaventis expanded on aventis prior relationship with regeneron in

laboratoires robert  carrière founded in  in  the french cosmetics group l’oréal acquired the majority of its share capital in  synthelabo acquired laboratories delalande and laboratoires delagrange and through this deal picked up the product metoclopramide sanofisynthélabo was formed in  when sanofi merged with synthélabo at the time of the merger sanofi was the second largest pharmaceutical group in france in terms of sales and synthélabo was the third largest the merged company was based in paris france– the merged companies focused on pharmaceuticals divesting several businesses soon after the merger including beauty diagnostics animal health and nutrition custom chemicals and two medical equipment businesses aventisedit aventis was formed in  when french company rhônepoulenc sa merged with the german corporation hoechst marion roussel which itself was formed from the  merger of hoechst ag with cassella roussel uclaf and marion merrell dow the merged company was based in

messer chemicals merieux has been in the business of selling blood products and in the s during the aids epidemic merieux and other companies were involved in scandals related to hivcontaminated haemophilia blood products that were sold to developing nations in mid  aventis and millennium pharmaceuticals a us biotechnology company formed to discover new drugs based on the thennew science of genomics announced that aventis would make a m investment in millennium and would pay m to millennium in research fees over five years one of the largest such deals between a big pharmaceutical company and a biotech company at the time in late  in the midst of the recall of starlink its genetically modified maize product aventis announced that it had determined to sell off aventis cropscience the seed and pesticide business unit it had created from the agriculture businesses of its predecessors in october  bayer and aventis announced that bayer would acquire the unit for about  billion with the unit becoming bayer cropscience and making bayer the worlds secondlargest agrochemical company behind syngenta in  aventis entered into a collaboration with regeneron a new york

in clinical trials regeneron and sanofi got the drug approved in metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with other agents under the brand name zaltrap in  sanofiaventis mergeredit sanofiaventis was formed in  when sanofisynthélabo acquired aventis in early  sanofisynthélabo made a hostile takeover bid worth € billion for aventis initially aventis rejected the bid because it felt that the bid offered inferior value based on the companys share value and the board of aventis went so far as to enact poison pill provisions and to invite novartis to enter merger negotiations the threemonth takeover battle concluded when sanofisynthélabo launched a friendly bid of € billion in place of the previously rejected hostile bid the french government played a strong role desiring what it called a local solution by putting heavy pressure on sanofisynthélabo to raise its bid for aventis and for aventis to accept the offer and by rejecting aventis poison pill proposal one of the largest risks in the deal for both sides was the fate of the patents protecting clopidogrel plavix which was one of the topselling drugs in the world at the time and the major source of sanofis revenue postmerger activitiesedit in  iraqis infected with hiv sued sanofi and baxter due to hivcontaminated haemophilia blood products sold by merieux in the s in  the us patents on clopidogrel plavix were challenged when a canadian generics company apotex filed an abbreviated new drug application under the hatchwaxman act received fda approval and started marketing a generic clopidogrel while sanofiaventis and its partner on the drug bristol myers squibb bms were able to get an injunction to stop apotex from selling the drug the case became complicated when settlement negotiations fell apart twice  the second time due to an oral agreement made by bms ceo peter dolan that bms failed to disclose to the federal trade commission during the review of the settlement agreement to ensure that it did not violate antitrust law when apotex disclosed the oral agreement to the ftc the ftc launched an investigation that led to dolan being fired by bms apotex finally lost on the patent litigation issues after its third appeal was decided in favor of bmssanofi in november  apotex had to pay  million in damages and  million in interest for infringing the patent which it paid in full by february  apotex also sued bms and sanofi for  billion for allegedly breaching the settlement agreement and apotex lost a jury trial in march  in  sanofiaventis expanded on aventis prior relationship with regeneron in

laboratoires robert  carrière founded in  in  the french cosmetics group l’oréal acquired the majority of its share capital in  synthelabo acquired laboratories delalande and laboratoires delagrange and through this deal picked up the product metoclopramide sanofisynthélabo was formed in  when sanofi merged with synthélabo at the time of the merger sanofi was the second largest pharmaceutical group in france in terms of sales and synthélabo was the third largest the merged company was based in paris france– the merged companies focused on pharmaceuticals divesting several businesses soon after the merger including beauty diagnostics animal health and nutrition custom chemicals and two medical equipment businesses aventisedit aventis was formed in  when french company rhônepoulenc sa merged with the german corporation hoechst marion roussel which itself was formed from the  merger of hoechst ag with cassella roussel uclaf and marion merrell dow the merged company was based in schiltigheim near strasbourg france–– at the time of the merger rhônepoulencs business included the pharmaceutical businesses rorer centeon blood products and pasteur merieux vaccines the plant and

messer chemicals merieux has been in the business of selling blood products and in the s during the aids epidemic merieux and other companies were involved in scandals related to hivcontaminated haemophilia blood products that were sold to developing nations in mid  aventis and millennium pharmaceuticals a us biotechnology company formed to discover new drugs based on the thennew science of genomics announced that aventis would make a m investment in millennium and would pay m to millennium in research fees over five years one of the largest such deals between a big pharmaceutical company and a biotech company at the time in late  in the midst of the recall of starlink its genetically modified maize product aventis announced that it had determined to sell off aventis cropscience the seed and pesticide business unit it had created from the agriculture businesses of its predecessors in october  bayer and aventis announced that bayer would acquire the unit for about  billion with the unit becoming bayer cropscience and making bayer the worlds secondlargest agrochemical company behind syngenta in  aventis entered into a collaboration with regeneron a new york biotechnology company to develop regenerons vegfinhibiting drug aflibercept in the field of cancer which was then in phase i clinical trials aventis invested  million in regeneron and made an upfront payment of  million in cash regeneron partnered the drug with bayer healthcare in the field of proliferative eye diseases and under the name eylea it was approved by the fda in  after several setbacks in clinical trials regeneron and sanofi got the drug approved in metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with other agents under the brand name zaltrap in  sanofiaventis mergeredit sanofiaventis was formed in  when sanofisynthélabo acquired aventis in early  sanofisynthélabo made a hostile takeover bid worth € billion for aventis initially aventis rejected the bid because it felt that the bid offered inferior value based on the companys share value and the board of aventis went so far as to enact poison pill provisions and to invite novartis to enter merger negotiations the threemonth takeover battle concluded when sanofisynthélabo launched a friendly bid of € billion in place of the previously rejected hostile bid the french government played a strong role desiring what it called a local solution by putting heavy pressure on sanofisynthélabo to raise its bid for aventis and for aventis to accept the offer and by rejecting aventis poison pill proposal one of the largest risks in the deal for both sides was the fate of the patents protecting clopidogrel plavix which was one of the topselling drugs in the world at the time and the major source of sanofis revenue postmerger activitiesedit in  iraqis infected with hiv sued sanofi and baxter due to hivcontaminated haemophilia blood products sold by merieux in the s in  the us patents on clopidogrel plavix were challenged when a canadian generics company apotex filed an abbreviated new drug application under the hatchwaxman act received fda approval and started marketing a generic clopidogrel while sanofiaventis and its partner on the drug bristol myers squibb bms were able to get an injunction to stop apotex from selling the drug the case became complicated when settlement negotiations fell apart twice  the second time due to an oral agreement made by bms ceo peter dolan that bms failed to disclose to the federal trade commission during the review of the settlement agreement to ensure that it did not violate antitrust law when apotex disclosed the oral agreement to the ftc the ftc launched an investigation that led to dolan being fired by bms apotex finally lost on the patent litigation issues after its third appeal was decided in favor of bmssanofi in november  apotex had to pay  million in damages and  million in interest for infringing the patent which it paid in full by february  apotex also sued bms and sanofi for  billion for allegedly breaching the settlement agreement and apotex lost a jury trial in march  in  sanofiaventis expanded on aventis prior relationship with regeneron in the new deal sanofiaventis agreed to pay regeneron  million each year for five years under which regeneron would use its monoclonal antibody discovery platform to create new biopharmaceuticals which

laboratories delalande and laboratoires delagrange and through this deal picked up the product metoclopramide sanofisynthélabo was formed in  when sanofi merged with synthélabo at the time of the merger sanofi was the second largest pharmaceutical group in france in terms of sales and synthélabo was the third largest the merged company was based in paris france– the merged companies focused on pharmaceuticals divesting several businesses soon after the merger including beauty diagnostics animal health and nutrition custom chemicals and two medical equipment businesses aventisedit aventis

behring diagnostics centeon celanese chemicals and messer chemicals merieux has been in the business of selling blood products and in the s during the aids epidemic merieux and other companies were involved in scandals related to hivcontaminated haemophilia blood products that were sold to developing nations in mid  aventis and millennium pharmaceuticals a us biotechnology company formed to discover new drugs based on the thennew science of genomics announced that aventis would make a m investment in millennium and would pay m to millennium in research fees over five years one of the largest such deals between a big pharmaceutical company and a biotech company at the time in late  in the midst of the recall of starlink its genetically modified maize product aventis announced that it had determined to sell off aventis cropscience the seed and pesticide business unit it had created from the agriculture businesses of its predecessors in october  bayer and aventis announced that bayer would acquire the unit for about  billion with the unit becoming bayer cropscience and making bayer the worlds secondlargest agrochemical company behind syngenta in  aventis entered into a collaboration with regeneron a new york biotechnology company to develop regenerons vegfinhibiting drug aflibercept in the field of cancer which was then in phase i clinical trials aventis invested  million in regeneron and made an upfront payment of  million in cash regeneron partnered the drug with bayer healthcare in the field of proliferative eye diseases and under the name eylea it was approved by the fda in  after several setbacks in clinical trials regeneron and sanofi got the drug approved in metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with other agents under the brand name zaltrap in  sanofiaventis mergeredit sanofiaventis was formed in  when sanofisynthélabo acquired aventis in early  sanofisynthélabo made a hostile takeover bid worth € billion for aventis initially aventis rejected the bid because it felt that the bid offered inferior value based on the companys share value and the board of aventis went so far as to enact poison pill provisions and to invite novartis to enter merger negotiations the threemonth takeover battle concluded when sanofisynthélabo launched a friendly bid of € billion in place of the previously rejected hostile bid the french government played a strong role desiring what it called a local solution by putting heavy pressure on sanofisynthélabo to raise its bid for aventis and for aventis to accept the offer and by rejecting aventis poison pill proposal one of the largest risks in the deal for both sides was the fate of the patents protecting clopidogrel plavix which was one of the topselling drugs in the world at the time and the major source of sanofis revenue postmerger activitiesedit in  iraqis infected with hiv sued sanofi and baxter due to hivcontaminated haemophilia blood products sold by merieux in the s in  the us patents on clopidogrel plavix were challenged when a canadian generics company apotex filed an abbreviated new drug application under the hatchwaxman act received fda approval and started marketing a generic clopidogrel while sanofiaventis and its partner on the drug bristol myers squibb bms were able to get an injunction to stop apotex from selling the drug the case became complicated when settlement negotiations fell apart twice  the second time due to an oral agreement made by bms ceo peter dolan that bms failed to disclose to the federal trade commission during the review of the settlement agreement to ensure that it did not violate antitrust law when apotex disclosed the oral agreement to the ftc the ftc launched an investigation that led to dolan being fired by bms apotex finally lost on the patent litigation issues after its third appeal was decided in favor of bmssanofi in november  apotex had to pay  million in damages and  million in interest for infringing the patent which it paid in full by february  apotex also sued bms and sanofi for  billion for allegedly breaching the settlement agreement and apotex lost a jury trial in march  in  sanofiaventis expanded on aventis prior relationship with regeneron in the new deal sanofiaventis agreed to pay regeneron  million each year for five years under which regeneron would use its monoclonal antibody

group l’oréal acquired the majority of its share capital in  synthelabo acquired laboratories delalande and laboratoires delagrange and through this deal picked up the product metoclopramide sanofisynthélabo was formed in  when sanofi merged with synthélabo at the time of the merger sanofi was the second largest pharmaceutical group in france in terms of sales and synthélabo was the third largest the merged company was based in paris france– the merged companies focused on pharmaceuticals divesting several businesses soon after the merger including beauty diagnostics animal health and nutrition custom chemicals and two medical equipment businesses aventisedit aventis was formed in  when french company rhônepoulenc sa merged with the german corporation hoechst marion roussel which itself was formed from the  merger of hoechst ag with cassella roussel uclaf and marion merrell dow the merged company was based in schiltigheim near strasbourg france–– at the time of the merger

products and in the s during the aids epidemic merieux and other companies were involved in scandals related to hivcontaminated haemophilia blood products that were sold to developing nations in mid  aventis and millennium pharmaceuticals a us biotechnology company formed to discover new drugs based on the thennew science of genomics announced that aventis would make a m investment in millennium and would pay m to millennium in research fees over five years one of the largest such deals between a big pharmaceutical company and a biotech company at the time in late  in the midst of the recall of starlink its genetically modified maize product aventis announced that it had determined to sell off aventis cropscience the seed and pesticide business unit it had created from the agriculture businesses of its predecessors in october  bayer and aventis announced that bayer would acquire the unit for about  billion with the unit becoming bayer cropscience and making bayer the worlds secondlargest agrochemical company behind syngenta in  aventis entered into a collaboration with regeneron a new york biotechnology company to develop regenerons vegfinhibiting drug aflibercept in the

the field of proliferative eye diseases and under the name eylea it was approved by the fda in  after several setbacks in clinical trials regeneron and sanofi got the drug approved in metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with other agents under the brand name zaltrap in  sanofiaventis mergeredit sanofiaventis was formed in  when sanofisynthélabo acquired aventis in early  sanofisynthélabo made a hostile takeover bid worth € billion for aventis initially aventis rejected the bid because it felt that the bid offered inferior value based on the companys share value and the board of aventis went so far as to enact poison pill provisions and to invite novartis to enter merger negotiations the threemonth takeover battle concluded when sanofisynthélabo launched a friendly bid of € billion in place of the previously rejected hostile bid the french government played a strong role desiring what it called a local solution by putting heavy pressure on sanofisynthélabo to raise its bid for aventis and for aventis to accept the offer and by rejecting aventis poison pill proposal one of the largest risks in the deal for both sides was the fate of the patents protecting clopidogrel plavix which was one of the topselling drugs in the world at the time and the major source of sanofis revenue postmerger activitiesedit in  iraqis infected with hiv sued sanofi and baxter due to hivcontaminated haemophilia blood products sold by merieux in the s in  the us patents on clopidogrel plavix were challenged when a canadian generics company apotex filed an abbreviated new drug application under the hatchwaxman act received fda approval and started marketing a generic clopidogrel while sanofiaventis and its partner on the drug bristol myers squibb bms were able to get an injunction to stop apotex from selling the drug the case became complicated when settlement negotiations fell apart twice  the second time due to an oral agreement made by bms ceo peter dolan that bms failed to disclose to the federal trade commission during the review of the settlement agreement to ensure that it did not violate antitrust law when apotex disclosed the oral agreement to the ftc the ftc launched an investigation that led to dolan being fired by bms apotex finally lost on the patent litigation issues after its third appeal was decided in favor of bmssanofi in november  apotex had to pay  million in damages and  million in interest for infringing the patent which it paid in full by february  apotex also sued bms and sanofi for  billion for allegedly breaching the settlement agreement and apotex lost a jury trial in march  in  sanofiaventis expanded on aventis prior relationship with regeneron in the new deal sanofiaventis agreed to pay regeneron

takeover battle concluded when sanofisynthélabo launched a friendly bid of € billion in place of the previously rejected hostile bid the french government played a strong role desiring what it called a local solution by putting heavy pressure on sanofisynthélabo to raise its bid for aventis and for aventis to accept the offer and by rejecting aventis poison pill proposal one of the largest risks

its partner on the drug bristol myers squibb bms were able to get an injunction to stop apotex from selling the drug the case became complicated when settlement negotiations fell apart twice  the second time due to an oral agreement made by bms ceo peter dolan that bms failed to disclose to the federal trade commission during the review of the settlement agreement to ensure that it did not violate antitrust law when apotex disclosed the oral agreement to the ftc the ftc launched an investigation that led to dolan being fired by bms apotex finally lost on the patent litigation issues

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun

csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not
