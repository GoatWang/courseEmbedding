resources five distinct municipal strategies taxfree income in a rising rate environment a look at invesco limited term municipal income fund strategies for taxfree income in a rising rate environment investment insights municipal bond market watch qa  about risk changing fixed income market conditions risk the current low interest rate environment was created in part by the federal reserve board frb and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero increases in the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments particularly those with longer maturities in addition decreases in fixed income dealer marketmaking capacity may persist in the future potentially leading to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets as a result the value of the funds investments and share price may decline in addition because of changing central bank policies the fund may experience higher than normal shareholder redemptions which could potentially increase portfolio turnover and the funds transaction costs and potentially lower the funds performance returns debt securities risk the prices of debt securities held by the fund will be affected by changes in interest rates the creditworthiness of the issuer and other factors an increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longerduration debt securities and higher quality debt securities falling interest rates will cause the fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates falling interest rates may also reduce the funds distributable income because interest payments on floating rate debt instruments held by the fund will decline the fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments andor to repay principal in a timely manner if an issuer seeks to restructure the terms of its borrowings or the fund is required to seek recovery upon a default in the payment of interest or the repayment of principal the fund may incur additional expenses changes in an issuers financial strength the markets perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or the security may affect the value of debt securities the advisers credit analysis may fail to anticipate such changes which could result in buying a debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in advance of a price decline or other credit event derivatives risk a derivative is an instrument whose value depends largely on and is derived from the value of an underlying security currency commodity interest rate index or other asset each referred to as an underlying asset in addition to risks relating to the underlying assets the use of derivatives may include other possibly greater risks which are described below counterparty risk certain derivatives do not trade on an established exchange referred to as overthecounter otc derivatives and are simply financial contracts between the fund and a counterparty when the fund is owed money on an otc derivative the fund is dependent on the counterparty to pay or in some cases deliver the underlying asset unless the fund can otherwise sell its derivative contract to a third party prior to its expiration many counterparties are financial institutions such as banks and brokerdealers and their creditworthiness and ability to pay or perform may be negatively impacted by factors affecting financial institutions generally in addition in the event that a counterparty becomes bankrupt or insolvent the funds ability to recover the collateral that the fund has on deposit with the counterparty could be delayed or impaired for derivatives traded on a centralized exchange the fund generally is dependent upon the solvency of the relevant exchange clearing house which acts as a guarantor for each contractual obligation under such derivatives for payment on derivative instruments for which the fund is owed money leverage risk many derivatives do not require a payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative which creates a form of leverage as a result an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative leverage may therefore make the funds returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss the fund segregates or earmarks liquid assets with a value at least equal to the amount that the fund owes the derivative counterparty each day if any or otherwise holds instruments that offset the funds daily obligation under the derivatives instrument this process is sometimes referred to as cover the amount of liquid assets needed as cover will fluctuate over time as the value of the derivative instrument rises and falls if the value of the funds derivative positions or the value of the assets used as cover unexpectedly decreases the fund may be forced to segregate additional liquid assets as cover or sell assets at a disadvantageous time or price to meet its derivative obligations or to meet redemption requests which could affect management of the fund and the funds returns in certain market conditions losses on derivative instruments can grow larger while the value of the funds other assets fall resulting in the funds derivative positions becoming a larger percentage of the funds investments liquidity risk there is a smaller pool of buyers and sellers for certain derivatives particularly otc derivatives than more traditional investments such as stocks these buyers and sellers are often financial institutions that may be unable or unwilling to buy or sell derivatives during times of financial or market stress derivative instruments may therefore be less liquid than more traditional investments and the fund may be unable to sell or exit its derivative positions at a desirable time or price this risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions during which the fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions to the extent that the fund is unable to exit a derivative position because of market illiquidity the fund may not be able to prevent further losses of value in its derivatives holdings and the liquidity of the fund and its ability to meet redemption requests may be impaired to the extent that a substantial portion of the funds otherwise liquid assets must be used as margin or cover another consequence of illiquidity is that the fund may be required to hold a derivative instrument to maturity and take or make delivery of the underlying asset that the adviser would otherwise have attempted to avoid other risks compared to other types of investments derivatives may be harder to value and may also be less tax efficient as described under the taxes section of the prospectus in addition changes in government regulation of derivative instruments could affect the character timing and amount of the funds taxable income or gains and may limit or prevent the fund from using certain types of derivative instruments as a part of its investment strategy which could make the investment strategy more costly to implement or require the fund to change its investment strategy to the extent that the fund uses derivatives for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market or market segment there may be imperfect correlation between the value of the derivative instrument and the value of the instrument being hedged or the relevant market or market segment in which case the fund may not realize the intended benefits there is also the risk that during adverse market conditions an instrument which would usually operate as a hedge provides no hedging benefits at all the funds use of derivatives may be limited by the requirements for taxation of the fund as a regulated investment company high yield debt securities junk bond risk the funds investments in high yield debt securities commonly referred to as junk bonds and other lowerrated securities will subject the fund to substantial risk of loss these securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the issuers ability to pay interest and principal when due and are more susceptible to default or decline in market value due to adverse economic regulatory political or company developments than higher rated or investment grade securities prices of high yield debt securities tend to be very volatile these securities are less liquid than investment grade debt securities and may be difficult to sell at a desirable time or price particularly in times of negative sentiment toward high yield securities inverse floating rate obligations risk inverse floating rate obligations inverse floaters represent interests in bonds with interest rates that vary inversely to changes in shortterm rates as shortterm rates rise inverse floaters produce less income and as shortterm rates decline inverse floaters produce more income as a result the price of inverse floaters is expected to decline when interest rates rise and generally will decline further than the price of a bond with a similar maturity the price of inverse floaters is typically more volatile than the price of bonds with similar maturities interest rate risk and price volatility of inverse floaters can be particularly high if leverage is used in the formula that determines the interest payable by the inverse floater leverage may make the funds returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss and the value of and income earned on an inverse floater that has a higher degree of leverage are more likely to be eliminated entirely under adverse market conditions upon the occurrence of certain adverse events the special purpose trust that created the inverse floater may be collapsed and the underlying security liquidated and the fund could lose the entire amount of its investment in the inverse floater and may in some cases be contractually required to pay the negative difference if any between the liquidation value of the underlying security and the principal amount of the shortterm floating rate interests recent regulatory changes have prompted changes to the structure of tender option bonds the funds enhanced role under the revised structure may increase the funds operational and regulatory risk liquidity risk the fund may be unable to sell illiquid investments at the time or price it desires and as a result could lose its entire investment in such investments an investment may be illiquid due to a lack of trading volume in the investment or if the investment is privately placed and not traded in any public market or is otherwise restricted from trading certain restricted securities require special registration and pose valuation difficulties liquid securities can become illiquid during periods of market stress if a significant amount of the funds securities become illiquid the fund may not be able to timely pay redemption proceeds and may need to sell securities at significantly reduced prices management risk the fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the advisers judgment about markets interest rates or the attractiveness relative values liquidity or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the funds portfolio the fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect there can be no guarantee that the advisers investment techniques or investment decisions will produce the desired results additionally legislative regulatory or tax developments may affect the investments or investment strategies available to the investment manager in connection with managing the fund which may also adversely affect the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objective market risk the market values of the funds investments and therefore the value of the funds shares will go up and down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably market risk may affect a single issuer industry or section of the economy or it may affect the market as a whole the value of the funds investments may go up or down due to general market conditions which are not specifically related to the particular issuer such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions changes in the general outlook for revenues or corporate earnings changes in interest or currency rates regional or global instability or adverse investor sentiment generally the value of the funds investments may also go up or down due to factors that affect an individual issuer or a particular industry or sector such as changes in production costs and competitive conditions within an industry individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments such as bonds during a general downturn in the financial markets multiple asset classes may decline in value when markets perform well there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the fund will rise in value medium and lowergrade municipal securities risk securities which are in the medium and lowergrade categories generally offer higher yields than are offered by highergrade securities of similar maturity but they also generally involve more volatility and greater risks such as greater credit risk market risk liquidity risk and management risk furthermore many issuers of medium and lowergrade securities choose not to have a rating assigned to their obligations by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization as such the funds portfolio may consist of a higher portion of unrated securities as compared with an investment company that invests solely in highergrade securities unrated securities may not be as attractive to as many buyers as are rated securities a factor which may make unrated securities less able to be sold at a desirable time or price these factors may limit the ability of the fund to sell such securities at their fair value either to meet redemption requests or in response to changes in the economy or the financial markets municipal issuer focus risk the municipal issuers in which the fund invests may be located in the same geographic area or may pay their interest obligations from revenue of similar projects such as hospitals airports utility systems and housing finance agencies this may make the funds investments more susceptible to similar social economic political or regulatory occurrences making the fund more susceptible to experience a drop in its share price than if the fund had been more diversified across issuers that did not have similar characteristics from time to time the funds investments may include securities that alone or together with securities held by other funds or accounts managed by the adviser represents a major portion or all of an issue of municipal securities because there may be relatively few potential purchasers for such investments and in some cases there may be contractual restrictions on resales the fund may find it more difficult to sell such securities at a desirable time or price municipal securities risk the risk of a municipal obligation generally depends on the financial and credit status of the issuer constitutional amendments legislative enactments executive orders administrative regulations voter initiatives and the issuers regional economic conditions may affect the municipal securitys value interest payments repayment of principal and the funds ability to sell the security municipal obligations may be more susceptible to downgrades or defaults during recessions or similar periods of economic stress municipal securities structured as revenue bonds are generally not backed by the taxing power of the issuing municipality but rather the revenue from the particular project or entity for which the bonds were issued if the internal revenue service determines that an issuer of a municipal security has not complied with applicable tax requirements interest from the security could be treated as taxable which could result in a decline in the securitys value in addition there could be changes in applicable tax laws or tax treatments that reduce or eliminate the current federal income tax exemption on municipal securities or otherwise adversely affect the current federal or state tax status of municipal securities variablerate demand notes risk the absence of an active secondary market for certain variable and floating rate notes could make it difficult to dispose of these instruments and a portfolio could suffer a loss if the issuer defaults during periods in which a portfolio is not entitled to exercise its demand rights whenissued delayed delivery and forward commitment risks whenissued and delayed delivery transactions are subject to market risk as the value or yield of a security at delivery may be more or less than the purchase price or the yield generally available on securities when delivery occurs in addition the fund is subject to counterparty risk because it relies on the buyer or seller as the case may be to consummate the transaction and failure by the counterparty to complete the transaction may result in the fund missing the opportunity of obtaining a price or yield considered to be advantageous these transactions have a leveraging effect on the fund because the fund commits to purchase securities that it does not have to pay for until a later date these investments therefore increase the funds overall investment exposure and as a result its volatility typically no income accrues on securities the fund has committed to purchase prior to the time delivery of the securities is made although the fund may earn income on securities it has set aside to cover these positions zero coupon or payinkind securities risk zero coupon and payinkind securities may be subject to greater fluctuation in value and less liquidity in the event of adverse market conditions than comparably rated securities paying cash interest at regular interest payment periods prices on noncashpaying instruments may be more sensitive to changes in the issuers financial condition fluctuation in interest rates and market demandsupply imbalances than cashpaying securities with similar credit ratings and thus may be more speculative investors may purchase zero coupon and payinkind securities at a price below the amount payable at maturity because such securities do not entitle the holder to any periodic payments of interest prior to maturity this prevents any reinvestment of interest payments at prevailing interest rates if prevailing interest rates rise the higher yields and interest rates on payinkind securities reflect the payment deferral and increased credit risk associated with such instruments and that such investments may represent a higher credit risk than coupon loans payinkind securities may have a potential variability in valuations because their continuing accruals require continuing judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and the value of any associated collateral special tax considerations are associated with investing in certain lowergrade securities such as zero coupon or payinkind securities as of  atfcx nav change    nas may appear until data is available data is usually updated between  and  pm cst as of  yieldnbsp distribution yield with sales charge
