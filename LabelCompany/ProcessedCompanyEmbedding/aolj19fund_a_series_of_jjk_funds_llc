package we draft an operating agreement to set forth the ownership and management structure and procedures delaware requires that llcs have an operating agreement that will govern it however delaware does not require that the operating agreement be filed with the state or even be in writingit is recommended that you have a written signed agreement even in a singlemember delaware llc the operating agreement is important because it provides a decisionmaking structure that will benefit the llc when dealing with other entities increase protection and increase credibility for financial transactions the operating agreement will include provisions such as liability ownership dissolution and transfer of interest among othersmany incorporation services use boilerplate agreements without provisions

different directionsigning the llc operating agreementonce the delaware operating agreement has been drafted and approved all members should execute it most delaware llcs as a practical matter will not draft and finalize the operating agreement until after formation many formal requirements of corporations such as those related to voting and annual meetings are not required by llcs  to this extent many wellcrafted operating agreements will avoid bureaucracy to streamline your business operationswhile an operating agreement can be enforceable unsigned it is more difficult to prove that an unsigned operating agreement was agreed upon by all members in multimember llcs it is especially important to have a signed operating agreement should you change the agreement or ownership structure an amended and restated llc operating agreement should be signed each time the agreement changes top 0 reasons to form an llc in delaware delaware llcs offer the most protection for you and your business with twoway protectionby forming a delaware llc you safeguard your personal assets by building a shield between them and your business liabilities this means that if the business itself cannot pay a creditor then this shield makes it difficult for creditors to penetrate into your personal assets such as your house car and other personal possessionsdelaware explicitly makes the “charging order” the sole and exclusive remedy for creditors of llc members this prevents creditors of your business partners from taking over the company creditors of a member can only get an economic interest in the llc’s distributions to that member not a control interest or a right to liquidate the llc delaware’s laws provide the strongest shield of any statedelaware governs the internal affairs of your company including its liability shield the corporate protection or “corporate shield” afforded by the delaware llc act which protects the personal assets of individual owners from creditors of their business is thicker than any protection offered in any other state delaware llcs can operate in almost any state or countryyou can form a delaware llc no matter where your business activities take place or where you live in the united states outside the united states there are very few countries and individuals restricted from using a delaware llc and a delaware llc does not need to have a bank account or office in delaware a registered agent such as incnow maintains a physical address in delaware required to forward court and delaware government notices to you delaware treats you like an adult and lets you manage your businesswhen entering into a delaware llc it is flexible in ownership and management structure one individual can serve as both the owner and manager an llc is governed by its operating agreement allowing you to arrange your business affairs between owners as you see fit and have that arrangement enforced as written since the llc is a contractual entity it is important that the delaware courts honor the contract between the parties as written furthermore there is no required annual general meeting and there is much less administrative paperwork in general compared to a corporation managers are protected from lawsuitsthe llc agreement in delaware can reduce or eliminate fiduciary duties this allows business managers and controlling managing members the flexibility to take risks that are not readily questioned by minority investors provided such actions are not in bad faith even if the fiduciary duties are not waived or reduced business managers have the freedom to make business decisions even if losses result without manager liability provided the decisions are not selfdealing even selfdealing is not entirely prohibited instead selfdealing needs to be “entirely fair” to the other members no delaware income tax if your operations are in other states and other business tax loopholesthere is no delaware tax return to file for llcs that are formed in delaware provided they conduct no business in delawareas with llcs in other states profits are taxed personally at the member level but not at the llc level an llc is taxed as a sole proprietorship or partnership unless it elects scorporation or ccorporation tax statushaving an llc that elects to be taxed as an scorporation can save thousands in selfemployment taxes because your income can be split  between selfemployment income and “sdividend” income the sdividend can reduce your taxes by thousands for example splitting 0 of

appointed judges are highly experienced in business cases and effectively solve corporate disputes in a way that other states do not there are no jury trials in the court of chancery so court’s expertise is brought to bear in the decision of every case before the courtthe delaware court system can act very quickly sometimes the whole process from start to finish discovery and motions to trial decisions can be over in two months written decisions from the court of chancery are the standard and are often 00 pages long this wellreasoned process avoids arbitrary outcomes even appeals to the delaware supreme court can be expedited the delaware judges do their homework and read all the pleadings carefully before hearings and trials0 delaware has the most probusiness laws of any us statedelaware’s law is generally thought to be probusiness and has a “goldilocks” balance of being stable and slowly evolving – to be cutting edge without upsetting existing businesses because of the maturity of delaware’s law and the high volume of corporate cases handled by delaware’s judicial system there is predictability in outcomesthis means if there have been several similar cases to the one facing your llc there is less uncertainty about the judicial outcome which can be key in deciding to settle a dispute or invest the time and capital to litigate even when judges change it is not a
