one planned for sally grimes putting an extra item into an oversized shopping cart led to hillshire brands co buying another companyas the chief innovation officer of chicagobased hillshire brands grimes is constantly looking for unusual products and flavors — and determining if they are things hillshire should try to develop or acquirewhile at costco a display of golden island jerky caught her eye she bought a bag tasted it and took it to the office where she shared it with colleagues including hillshire ceo sean connollyflavorful and tender it was a hit and sparked grimes interest in learning more about the producti said can i give them a call grimes recalled she got the companys phone number from its website and left a message for its president anna kanthey began talking and a relationship blossomed in september  hillshire bought golden islandthe idea of hillshire swooping in to buy a company that makes a highend product would have seemed ridiculous a few years ago for a company better known for budgetfriendly staples like sausage biscuits and hot dogs but these days hillshire is on an acquisition tear as it looks for ways to stand out in the us packagedfood industry it announced plans this month to buy pinnacle foods the maker of birds eye frozen vegetables duncan hines cake mix and vlasic pickles for about  billionalong with pantry staples hillshire also is adding artisanal upscale products to its lineup and aiming to add an innovative spark to familiar lines such as jimmy dean sausage ball park franks and hillshire farm deli meatgrimes  is the person in charge of both efforts her role which has expanded in the past year with the additional title of president of the gourmet food group harnesses some  years in the food and consumer marketing worlds at kraft and newell rubbermaidif we use our imagination the possibilities are endless grimes saidwhen hillshire started out on its own in  after decades under the sara lee umbrella ceo sean connolly knew the company needed to focus on innovation to stand out in an increasingly crowded and slowgrowing us grocery market only  percent of its sales came from products introduced in the prior three years while industry leaders have levels closer to the midteens hillshire set a goal of getting to  to  percent by fiscal hillshire now has a roster of newer products in its lineup such as jimmy dean delights flatbread sandwiches and parks finest by ball park hot dogs next month it will launch  jimmy dean items that push the brand beyond breakfast those include frozen ham and cheddar cheese sandwiches on pretzel buns and smoked bacon macaroni and cheeseunder grimes the innovation department has shaved about  weeks off the companys product creation process bringing the average down to  weeks the flatbreads came out in about onethird of that time a company recordhillshires percentage of sales from new products hit  percent last year and is now closer to  percentwhen hillshire started on its own it decided to appoint an executive in charge of innovation a title that does not exist at major us food companiesin a lot of companies innovation is a mature process and where it is being executed its not a necessary role said connolly we were a new company we needed to make things happen quickly i needed to send a clear message to the entire enterprise that innovation was an imperative at hillshirethe question of who should take that job was answered when connolly heard about grimes through andy callahan who had worked with her years before at kraft foods and is now president of hillshires retail business connolly called grimes in june  when she was working at newell rubbermaid to talk about whether she would be interested in joining his companywhen i met sally it was clear to me that she just has a really good handle on our consumer base and what theyre passionate about what they struggle with and shes very creative in acting on what the consumer needs connolly saidand grimes who had helped transform the image of sharpie markers from a basic desk supply to a cool tool for creative expression felt it was the right time for a change she started at hillshire that julyi was so inspired by his vision to make hillshire into the most innovative food company in the united states she said plus i always thought i would find my way back into

team as “kids in a candy shop” following the company’s acquisition of hillshire brands sally grimes president and global growth officer for the company outlined the insights driving innovation at the company and highlighted some of the new products on tap for  during tyson’s investor day held dec  in new york grimes said four growth platforms the company is focusing on revolve around breakfast convenience snacking and “holistic wellness” “the first is what we call breakfast reinvented” she said “now over half of consumers want more options for frozen and refrigerated breakfast so this one is all about convenient complete options to start the day right” in  tyson foods will introduce jimmy dean simple scrambler’s which grimes described as a “new category in refrigerated breakfast” she added that the new product will offer a “fresh complete breakfast made in minutes” “the next one we call ‘smart shortcuts’” she said “americans spend just  minutes per day total on meal prep so this platform is all about delivering higher quality more unique meals without all the prep “the third one we call purposeful snacking twentyfive percent of consumers today are searching for protein on food labels and snacking has evolved from incidental to purposeful to satisfy cravings to keep going in between meals and support overall health so this is our platform for portable protein” to capitalize on the demand for portable protein tyson foods will be introducing ball park branded jerky in  “we are excited to build on our presence in the jerky category leveraging the strong approachable equity of ball park to disrupt the fastgrowing on trend jerky category” grimes said “now this is big the ball park brand benefits from high awareness a consumer base who likes dried snacks and equity around flame grilled taste we are confident that ball park will grow the jerky category by broadening jerky appeal with flame grilled jerky because meat from the grill just tastes better” grimes added that the hillshire snacking line of products will roll out nationally in  “it has been in test market for six months with strong performance” grimes said “and it is ready to roll out nationally hillshire snacking has not only delivered incremental sales to the category but it has exceeded the competition in test retailers for both incrementally of sales and overall size” when it was test marketed the snacking line featured two varieties one featuring italian salami or hot calabrese salami with cheese and crackers the second variety featured grilled meats in such flavors as sweet chili honey mustard or teriyaki the final growth platform tyson is focused on is holistic wellness which ms grimes said features “nutritious products for the most disciplined consumers across all day parts” next year tyson foods plans to expand its aidells line of processed meats into the breakfast category with the launch of two new chicken sausages that feature such infusions as apple or maple ms grimes said the launch is designed to complement the aidells line of chicken lunchmeat and meatballs that are currently in the marketplace grimes also took time in her presentation to delve into the macro market forces she said are shaping tyson’s new product development strategy “first the changing face of the consumer” she said “today only  of us households are a married couple with children and millennials are  of the us — this is the biggest demographic in our history “next altered shopping habits — spending is up but shoppers are making fewer trips spread across more stores formats and channels” she added that eating itself is evolving specifically the “what the when and the how consumers are eating is changing” ms grimes said “nearly onethird of dinners today are eaten alone and long gone are three square meals a day the average american actually eats  meals per day and our onthego lifestyles they are just leading us to fundamentally change the way we eat” finally grimes noted the continued economic challenges facing consumers are shaping tyson foods’ innovation strategies when she highlighted the fact that six in  households in the united states make less than  per year “we actually don’t have one innovation pipeline at tyson we have many pipelines” ms grimes said “one of the greatest assets of this company is our diverse portfolio of category leading brands we won’t just deliver new products but a strategic sustainable pipeline of innovation for each of our brands to drive growth” comment on this article we welcome your thoughtful comments please

search for similar articles by keyword tyson foods hillshire sally grimes president and chief global growth officer chicago – sally grimes’ career has evolved from successfully marketing and innovating macaroni markers and now meat products this past year her career culminated when she was appointed to the executive leadership team at tyson foods inc by president and ceo donnie smith as part of the  acquisition of the hillshire brands company as president and chief global growth officer she oversees insights innovation rd retail sales marketing services and international strategy with the goal of growing the company’s consumer and foodservice brands tyson foods not only acquired legacy brands that included ball park hillshire farm jimmy dean aidells and recently acquired golden island gourmet jerky but the people behind those brands the corporate courtship to recruit grimes and several other hillshire brands execs was led by smith “as excited as i am about our new brands i’m equally excited about the combined talent of the two companies” said smith last august “we all had the opportunity to connect with tyson leadership during the acquisition” says grimes adding that her decision to join the tyson team was fueled by chairman john tyson’s inspiring vision for the company and smith’s proven commitment to servant leadership “donnie is such an authentic genuine leader” she says grimes  didn’t begin her career in marketing but rather in the banking industry after earning a finance degree from valparaiso univ she went on to earn a master’s degree in business from the univ of chicago “fully intending to stay on the finance route” she says but discovered brand management along the way and a light went on “this was an opportunity to bring the art and science of business together” at that time her goal was to run her own business or brand with the resources of a big company backing her this led grimes from the univ of chicago to a brand management position at kraft foods while working up through the ranks at kraft for plus years she learned many of the skills and gained knowledge she applies every day in her current role at tyson her first brand assignment at the diverse company was on its iconic macaroni and cheese product line “then i got a call to go global” grimes says referring to the job offer to lead the marketing team at newell rubbermaid’s writing business which included the sharpie product line “how fun was that” she laughs under grimes sharpie was rebranded from a permanent marker most associated with professional athletes signing autographs to what she calls “an advocate of selfexpression” and took the marketing effort global targeting europe and brazil after more than five years at newell rubbermaid grimes realized what she learned marketing markers could apply to meat a leap she never considered until receiving a phone call from sean connolly then ceo of hillshire brands company in  grimes remembers connolly saying “‘hey we’re starting a  billion startup do you want to be a part of the team’” she had breakfast with him a few days later and after hearing his plan and vision for the “new” company grimes realized “how many times in your career do you get to be a part of a  billion startup” her decision was swift “literally within days i said ‘i am in’” says grimes who considered it a privilege to work with connolly and the leadership team he assembled read more about grimes and her role with tyson foods in an exclusive cover story that will be published in the june issue of meatpoultry

hillshire brands aims to speed new products to market sally grimes hillshire brands photo by kate macarthur special to blue sky oct    am sally grimes has a knack for reimagining products you think you already know at kraft foods inc she made macaroni and cheese microwaveable at newell rubbermaid inc she elevated the sharpie pen to a wand of artistic expression now as president of hillshire brands gourmet food group and chief innovation officer of hillshire brands co grimes is working to do the same for meat already she has overseen the launch of a new product called jimmy dean flatbread breakfast sandwiches in a companyrecord  weeks  the time from initial concept to first shipment she told us more about her approach to innovation  q hillshire has said it wants to be the most innovative company in the meat business what will that mean a historically we have averaged about  weeks of getting an innovation into the marketplace we set out a goal of hitting  weeks secondly historically we’ve been able to look ahead and understand about a year’s worth of innovation we set a goal of ensuring we had a threeyear sustainable pipeline at all times lastly and i would say most importantly historically we have averaged about  percent of our revenue from innovation and we set a goal to deliver  percent to  percent of revenue from innovation by fiscal year  and that third metric is really what i focus on q how will you make that happen a we homed in on two key focus areas first was getting deeper insights in some cases in the past we didnt go deep enough on understanding the consumer and in turn delivering a meaningful point of difference the second is all about stronger execution one of the things that we have instituted is rapid prototyping in the case of jimmy dean flatbreads we were able to leverage our innovation center where we have the ability to rapidly prototype products and get them in front of consumers quickly get the feedback make changes immediately and get in front of consumers again that’s one aspect of being more flexible and more nimble with this new process q how do you divide your efforts between incremental versus radical innovation a we have two key pillars to this growth strategy one is sustaining innovation this means packaging innovation quality improvement sustaining the growth of our core brands through new flavors and forms we’ve got some amazing iconic bands that havent been nurtured that much so that is critically important right now because we need the foundation from which to grow the second part is about extending the reach of our brands and our business beyond the products and categories in which we serve today it’s saying jimmy dean is not just about breakfast jimmy dean is not just about sausage jimmy dean is about hearty comfort food so how can we take that amazing iconic trademark into new categories new forms q how does innovation differ among the companies where youve worked a to put it into simple terms you ask three main questions will they want it meaning the consumer can we make it and can we make money at it at a very basic level i have followed that both at kraft and newell rubbermaid what is different about hillshire is a commitment from the top when you put that word innovation in your vision statement it means that innovation isnt just something that you’ll do
