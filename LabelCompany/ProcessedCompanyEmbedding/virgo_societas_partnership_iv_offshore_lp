unique ideas the art of investing begins with ideas we are innovators we like it when people stop us to tell us we are going the wrong direction we have always preferred the road not taken or the road less travelled our principles curiosity is critical we are always looking for the doors that will lead us down the path to a new idea or a relationship that spawns a new insight we believe that ideas emerge from aggregating thinking across a broader range of disciplines and from approaching the same subjects from multiple angles a good investor is an “imagineer” our principals a value investor is a cross between a social scientist and an engineer the interplay between business fundamentals individual emotions and herding crowds is the crux of value investing mindfulness and an awareness of this interaction between companies people and markets enables virgo to find mispriced assets and misunderstood companies a good investor is an imaginer our principles relationships are the foundation of our business we seek to connect great ideas and talented people our relationships enable us to express our ideas – to turn ideas into actionable opportunities people are also the key to executing our ideas – to building value beyond the purchase price of an acquired asset and whenever we have been down it has been our relationships that got us through virgo is dedicated to building a societas of authentic partnership relationships among virgo team members with management teams and with our investors our principles one must be crazily disciplined to be a successful investor one must be crazy enough to have a different view but disciplined enough to have that crazy view for good reasonfurthermore it is the methodical execution of one’s ideas that really matters at virgo we are incredibly curious but we are also obsessively focused our values we seek to make meaningful investments and to build meaningful businesses we want to build market leaders we want to reinvent companies that are navigating periods of volatility we seek to attract people that are looking to be a part of building something meaningful and lasting success in business is not clinical it is all about passion about focused emotion our values excellence is the end not the means our overriding objective is excellence and constant improvement we want to be a leader in everything we do money doesn’t bring happiness the pursuit of excellence does we take great pleasure in the craft of investing our desired legacy is the excellent execution of meaningful ideas together with people who share our values our values focus on the customer and all else will follow we seek to align ourselves with the right clients and to align everything we do with the best interests of our clients we focus on both the value we deliver to our clients and how we make our customers feel our values sing as the rat pack did we believe innovation emerges from an open environment founded on mutual respect and collaboration among talented entrepreneurs harmony not consensus is the goal our culture is based on powerful ideas and unconstrained debate the“truth” cannot be known with absolute certainty when it comes to the future of asset values and stock prices as such the principle skill of an investor is the ability to assess stories – to tell between the tales of the futureevery person at virgo brings a unique point of view and set of formative experiences to the firm’s pursuit of this “truth” of the best stories our values have fun last and certainly not least we founded virgo to have fun we love the challenge of investing and enjoy the comraderie of each other’s company as teddy roosevelt once said “far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing”
