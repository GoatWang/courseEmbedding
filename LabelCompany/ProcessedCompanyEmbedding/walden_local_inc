ziprecruiter blog — walden local meat co menu walden local meat co happy birthday henry july   birthday boy henry david thoreau is often associated with protecting untouched wilderness preserving land in its ‘original’ or prehuman state  but a closer look at thoreau’s legacy today reveals an evolving and more complex view of the role of conservation in a world in which virtually none of the earth’s surface has been impervious to heavy human influencethoreau inspired a generation – including john muir john f kennedy and theodore roosevelt – to protect land  not to lock up pieces of land to throw away the key but to promote working landscapes to be utilized to promote human interaction with nature  our national parks and forests systems including the cape cod national seashore to our east and the green and white mountain national forests to our north are wonderful examples in our own backyards  none of these places – although protected – remain untouched wilderness  instead they encourage a harmonious engagement of humans with their surroundings actively managed working landscapes designed to protect and build healthy ecosystemsthoreau is often cited as an inspiration for the creation of conservation and agricultural easements to preserve working agricultural landscapes  “a town is saved not more by the righteous men in it than by the woods and swamps that surround it” a brochure of the california state parks quotes thoreau explaining the genesis of that state’s easement programsin walden thoreau wrote extensively about the poor land management practices of his neighboring farmers in concord mass – explaining that a lack of crop rotation and allowing cattle to graze in mixed woodlots lead to both poor quality pastures and poor quality woodlots  although much of his writing criticizes our tendency to destroy and overutilize natural resources the answer was not for everyone to live alone in the woods  instead the answer is found in better land management practices  in agriculture this is referred to as “regenerative agriculture” – practices like management intensive grazing in which grassfed cattle are rotated through successive pastures with high stocking densities to build and retain soil fertility and in turn drive higher productivity of perennial pastures july  marks henry david thoreau’s th birthday  show your appreciation for preserving working landscapes by visiting a local farm hiking in the green or white mountains or even just sharing your favorite photograph of a landscape you love why grassfed understanding the true costs of industrial meat june   in  trucost released a report that monetized the value of the negative environmental externalities produced by the world’s largest business sectors the results of the report were damning especially for the industrial agriculture sector and specifically for cattle ranching and farming businesses of more than  regionsectors analyzed industrial cattle ranching and farming in south america had the second greatest overall environmental cost totaling to nearly  billion when compared to revenues of only  billion it’s quite easy to see that if these businesses were forced to pay for their pollution land degradation and overall disruption of ecosystem services they would not only not be profitable but they wouldn’t even be able to cover their capital costscattle ranching operations in south america aren’t the only ones to blame either cattle ranching in north america produced over  billion in negative land use externalities alone and that doesn’t account for air or water pollution greenhouse gas emissions or waste production because these operations do not have to pay for these costs they are able to sell exceptionally cheap products while still turning a profit that’s why you should be skeptical when you see ground beef advertised for lb that price certainly does not take into account the billions in environmental externalities produced during the lifecycle of the product and it certainly doesn’t even leave enough wiggle room to pay the farmer a living wage but that’s a discussion for another dayat walden we only work with partner farms who are stewards of the land and are committed to raising animals the right way this doesnt mean that they produce limited negative externalities  it means that they produce positive externalities through the implementation of  grassfed pasture systems practices that regenerate soil health  fertility and support functional working landscapes that sequester carbon and support perennial pasture growth as we’ve written about extensively in prior blog posts raising animals in a sustainable regenerative manner can in fact leave our land air and ecosystems in a better state than if they were left untouched by increasing carbon sequestration decreasing methane production and improving overall ecosystem health by restoring natural ecosystem services  feedlot manure lagoon in tascosa feedlot texas”  credit mishka henner  the alternative rotational grazing systems to grow  grassfed beef  in support of healthier soils animals and ultimately people moving forward june   as a connector or rural and urban communities we generally try to avoid politics when it comes to the paris agreement we can’t be silent—as it is so tied to the principles that led us to walden and guide our actions day to daythe paris agreement was a landmark step in climate action and a global symbol of good faith it is incredible that so much of the world came together to agree on anything let alone a topic as critical and contentious as climate change yet it is important to understand that it was a voluntary agreement not a binding law individual countries created emissions targets and pledged to try their best to get there there is no real enforcing or accountability beyond the eyes and opinions of the rest of the world as such we think our withdrawal from the agreement indicates shortsightedness with this decision the us joins nicaragua and syria the only two other nations which have not joined the agreementwe can learn from our new trio nicaragua believes that the agreement is not aggressive enough—allowing countries to set their own targets and not holding the biggest greenhouse gas ghg emitters to a strict enough standard as the single largest contributor to ghgs over the past century the us has a unique challenge to right our role in climate change and lead by exampleexiting the agreement represents an archaic perception of power we are demanding attention by being the biggest bully on the world playground instead of earning respect by acknowledging our responsibility leaving the agreement tarnishes the goodfaith on which it was built and isolates us from the rest of the world that chooses to consider the future the debate on the validity of climate change is over and we have more than enough proof that environmentallyminded decisions are critical to current and future economies public health and peacefortunately we don’t have to stop moving forward because of this symbolic step backward in yesterday’s statement barack obama reiterated the “bold american ambition that encouraged dozens of other nations to set their sights higher” in the crafting of the paris agreement it is up to towns cities and states—along with private companies—to take the lead in the absence of federal leadershipas we often write here agriculture is the single largest contributor to carbon emissions behind energy with livestock representing the lion’s share of the sectors impact we raise animals on grass sequester carbon and contribute to a net positive carbon footprint…and we look forward to doing our part chatting with one of our favorite farmers gerald hathaway of benson vt how do we make it work may   we are often asked how we manage to facilitate relationships with so many farmers while ensuring that we have the right amount of product at the right time without compromising on any of our standardsfirst when we were first getting started we wanted to develop real and lasting farm partnerships  many restaurants go out to farmers looking to order several hundred pounds of sirloin steaks on a monthly basis and are even willing to pay a high price and make a big commitment  but farmers that are experts at growing perennial pastures generally don’t also have inventory management logistics and customer service as a primary area of interest or expertise – making this type of order a red herring of sorts…one that creates lots of intractable problems for the farmer  what to do with all of the shanks  ground beef  how to deliver the product and ensure it stays coldinstead we make commitments for whole animals months in advance – and make good on those commitments even when our needs change  we generally don’t work to change hearts and minds of farmers – we find producers who were already operating in ways consistent with our values and affidavit standards and help them to grow their operations  this makes farm visits and ongoing monitoring pretty straightforward – we’re all after the same goalssecond kristen kilfoyle our talented supply chain director is a former intern of joel salatin of polyface farm which is on the leading edge of pasturebased programs in the us  kristen works with our farms to share best practices monitor performance and ensure the integrity of our products  based in new hampshire she visits our partner farms on a monthly basis and each of our processors weeklylastly our model works because of our amazing membership base  the predictability of our share program combined with some solid forecasting allow us to project out demand on a rolling month basis and then coordinate what we anticipate our needs to be with our farms and processors  our hope is that by connecting communities – our member base to our farm partners – we can create a more stable system of planning and pricing that promotes the longterm viability and financial sustainability of our farms we are a certified b corporation april   we are thrilled to announce we are now a certified b corporation® this is a tremendous step forward for our company as certification involves passing a series of rigorous tests to demonstrate companies meet higher standards of social and environmental impact transparency and accountability—much like fair trade or leed certification however this distinction is not just for a bag of coffee or building it applies to every decision we make as a businessultimately the designation is intended to legally protect our mission and our values and align us all around the idea that we will sometimes make decisions that do not provide short term profits but serve our mission of supporting and growing local agriculture unlike traditional corporations certified b corporations are required and happy to consider the impact of their decisions not only on their shareholders’ short term profit but also on their workers suppliers community consumers environment and other stakeholders putting our community first has always been a pillar of our company and becoming certified has been a wonderful opportunity to solidify our mission our view is that our mission aligns nicely with our long term business interests and the two do complement rather than compete with one anotherwe are honored to join companies such as patagonia seventh generation and more which we have admired for their socially minded decisionsalthough we’re usually pretty skeptical about certifications and terms especially when it comes to food we are thrilled to officially join the common goal of certified b corps to redefine success in business to mean more than just profits milk and honey ribs april   when we first began testing and collecting recipes we stumbled upon a phenomenal method for milk and honey baby back ribs it may seem odd to cook with milk when most recipes call for glazes sauces or rubs yet milk acts as a perfect buffer—heating the meat gently while basting it with cream as the milk evaporates the resulting ribs are impressively tender with a light brown toasted crustthis recipe has become a notorious favorite at walden especially in these intermediate weeks of spring where it may be too cold to grill and too warm for stew to maintain the delicate flavors we recommend sticking to the oven as originally imagined by cesare giaccone of osteria dei cacciatori we urge you to give his recipe a try milk and honey ribsfor more info on the versatility of ribs see hereas always let us know how it goes if you ever have a favorite recipe of your own feel free to submit it to infowaldenlocalmeatcom for a chance to publish in our monthly card tristate weather its wine o clock march   hey new england if you’re riding out the snow day like we are chances are you’re at home with a generous glass of wine and some food warming up the kitchen it’s no secret that wine and meat are two peas in a pod but often times we don’t give these two equal attentionin a recent piece eric asimov reminds us that wine is food just like cereals or steaks there are industrial chemicalladen wines churned out of factories and local carefully crafted varieties many “big box” wines have their flavors due to focus group reviews rather than ancestral family values treating wine as a food lets us consider it as an equal player on the table when it comes to sourcing and enjoyingit’s remarkable how many issues echo across the meat and wine industry—from costly label certifications to lessthantransparent production chemicals and additives in wine are normalized and hidden much the same way we find antibiotics and hormones in meat the term “organic” has a tenuous foothold in meat where it still allows animals to live in confinement and eat organic corn in wine organic requires the use of organic grapes and yeast with “no added sulphur dioxide a preservative that is used in all but the most natural of wines”yet a lot of factory wines use organic grapes and chemical additives on the other hand many small producers make wines that surpass organic standards but lack the finances to buy the certification in meat we have seen examples of both though walden prides itself on buying exclusively from farmers of the latter categoryas with any other food trusting your source is essential to getting a product you can feel good about we hope you enjoy your snow day and make sure to eat and drink welleric asimov is the new york times wine critic if you’re looking for a pairing he recommends “steaks and other rich fatty meats can take bigger more tannic reds while burgers might be better with juicier reds but it’s hard to go wrong unless the wine is simply not very good would a white go with a red meat believe it or not a big dry riesling or sometimes even a sweet auslese can be just the thing but i would try this only if you are feeling comfortably experimental”read more on the importance of sourcing your wine here oregon trail video game circa  waldens first and only product endorsement february   we grew up in the era of the oregon trail video game on the apple iic for nostalgia purposes you can play the original version online here and its just as awesome as we remember it  since then video games have indeed become considerably better graphically  unfortunately they can also represent the worst of our society violence crime profanity and frankly laziness  nothing against grand theft auto but i dont think any parents are arguing that this video game makes us better people enter walden a game  although we highly advise an in person visit to walden for those who cannot get there there is now a video game that we can wholeheartedly endorse  while we cant comment on the level of fun relative to gta until we have the opportunity to play it its a serious departure from most video games and its a wonderful way for children to explore emerson and thoreaus writings and the wonder of the woods just around the corner from us learn more about the game and watch a preview from the nytimes  why local part iii earn x your money february   we have written extensively here and elsewhere about why we think building a local food community matters see here and here  buying local is a way of reconnecting communities especially following our divisive elections  many of our farmers feel as though america is moving towards the dystopian society depicted in the hunger games series the impoverished rural sectors toil to produce raw materials that fuel the elite urban sectors  we think this needs to change there is no shared understanding or community when we are disconnected from where our food comes from  we are working on ways to solve the local food challenge by fostering connections and learnings across our farmer base and our member base as a mechanism to address this dividebeyond the greater societal benefit even if you are a pure capitalist and care not for societal benefit or anything of the sort  we still think you have a reason to purchase locally pure dollars and cents in your pocket  every dollar spent has a multiplier that is when you spend  it has a direct benefit of additional spending again and again   spent at a local coffee shop turns into a few cents to purchase supplies from a local distributor a few cents in wages to a working mother who buys groceries with her earnings a few cents for an owner to invest in another coffee shopa  canadian study found that for every  spent at a local retailer  stay within the local community  that same figure for a local restaurant    if you spent that same  at a chain retailer or chain restaurant just  and  respectively would stay in the community  that should matter to you as an individual because dollars staying in a community support lower prices and higher wages for you  but it should matter to you as a participant in a democratic society too because local spending combats the perception of a continued transfer of wealth from rural to urban america  more meaningfully it reconnects us with our neighbors in support of a mutually beneficial goal leaving behind a better community for our children than the one into which we were born   the feedlot a bovine bender december   like a wound being healed when landscapes are “reclaimed by nature” they are seen by some as returning to a purer state even the bucolic pastures and rolling hills we picture with grazing cattle are assumed to be worse than letting the “wild” be wild we get caught up arguing that using land for grassfeeding is the lesser of two evils when in fact making responsible use of pasture is better than leaving it alone this use is a net positive for the climate land animals and farmers—not to mention your health all ranchers both corn and grassfed do some level of rotational grazing but regenerative livestock management rlm strives to balance the scale of sustainability by finding the best middle ground between leaving land untouched and overgrazed at its core rlm is a “back to basics” move that mimics the natural movements of animals in the wild in practice rlm is a bit more scientific grazing a high density herd on land for a short time—requiring ranchers to adjust herd size and grazing times depending on the dynamic local rainfall soil grasses animal behavior temperature and morewhat this means for plantswhy don’t we just let the animals graze a large paddock on their own like they do out west shortterm high intensity grazing may seem like it’s over complicating a natural process however good pastures have a diverse mix of grasses with different tastes textures and nutritional content if you were given a buffet to pick from for a week it’s safe to say that the dessert section would probably be decimated while the steamed spinach would be only lightly touched this holds true for cows too left to their own devices they will gravitate towards their favorite grasses—munching them down to the roots and moving on curbing this urge is an important part of letting productive pastures flourish similarly in many forests prairies and even agricultural fields controlled burning is used to rejuvenate soil minerals and stimulate growth of diverse plant species without fire groups of species known as “climax communities” outcompete all other plants until the landscape becomes dominated by just a few types of species fire keeps these environments in check and lets new plants grow and enrich the ecosystem like fire a large group of cows moved frequently across smaller pastures will eat grasses more or less evenly when done well this mows the pasture down to  inches where it can easily regrow keeping pastures dynamic ultimately produces more forage and carbon sequestration than pastures that are mechanically harvested grazed longterm or left alone over the course of five years this was tested on  acres and found to double productivity per acrewhat this means for land compared to other classes of food industrial meat is a twostep process grow corn feed it to cows as a result it takes far more energy input to produce meat than grain many advocates of vegetarian or vegan diets use this as a point against meat production and as evidence that we could feed more people by eliminating meat from our diets yet cows sheep and other ruminants are naturally designed to turn indigestible grasslands into edible animal proteinwe have a vast resource of unusable grassland in the us— million acres unsuitable for any other type of agriculture yet in  we diverted up to a third of all feed grains corn grain oats etc produced in the us to feed animals grassfed cows are a winwin using underutilized land while freeing up colossal amounts of grain for human consumptionwhat this means for airwhen we think of greenhouse gases the primary metric of interest is co emissions fortunately cattle production is not a large emitter of carbon—paling in comparison to the vehiclesequipment used for clearcutting new agricultural farmland in fact by promoting plant growth and fertilizing land cows actually do a notable job of lowering co by promoting carbon sequestration in grasslands the lifetime value of grazing beef on grass actually comes out to  kg of co equivalent stored per kg of weight for every kg the cow gains  kg of carbon are removed from the atmospherethe elephant in the room is methane methane is much more potent than co—warming the atmosphere up to  times more than co however it is much shorter lived leaving the atmosphere after a decade or so when digesting food cows burp and fart methane …humans do too a popular critique of grassfeeding cows relies on the longer lifespan of these cattle without grain antibiotics hormones and other substances to promote speedy growth grassfed cows graze for an average of  more days and yield  less weight by living longer critics say they release more methane simple as thatthis oversimplified argument misses what grassfeeding contributes to the environment and ignores the fact that huge methane emissions come from liquefied manure storage lagoons found at feedlots the large concentration of animals in confined animal feeding operations cafos makes manure into an overabundant neverending waste problem in grassfeeding manure is stomped into the ground and used for what it was meant for fertilizer manure thus becomes a tool for plant growth healthy topsoil and nitrogenfixing soil bacteria—sequestering greenhouse gases instead of releasing themwhat this means for the animalsunfortunately when comparing grass and grainfeeding all of these other factors tend to come before the health and quality of the animal it may be a cliché but when it comes to beef “you are what you eat” does hold true rlm pastures are a mosaic of different plants all offering their own nutrients uniquely suited to the digestive systems of cows when cattle eat corn or other grains their stomach microbes ferment the starch this fermentation especially in large quantities leads to serious “acidosis” health problems from stomach bloat to even death these symptoms are akin to forcing someone gluten free or celiac to eat nothing but glutenwe’ve seen grainfeeding called a “luxury” for cows if you’re a kid running rampant through a candy store could be considered a “luxury” if you’re a rock star getting plastered on drugs and alcohol could be a “luxury”at the end of this bovine bender you’re left with a fatty steak depleted of nutrientsraising cows on unnatural diets promises a slew of health problems as a result many of these animals are given subtheraputic doses of antimicrobials to curb sickness when this was measured in  it was found that  million kg of antimicrobials were administered to livestock in the us each year that’s  of all antibiotics used in the us—with  of those deemed “medically important” for human medical therapy by the fda this is a big deal when unnecessary use creates antibiotic resistant pathogens rendering these drugs less effective when humans need them to fight off infections rlm and cornit makes sense that proponents of grainfeeding spend a lot of time thinking about what an animal takes the grainfeeding system takes a toll on feed water antibiotics hormones and ultimate environmental quality without the return found in rlm grazing the argument is that these established methods are more efficient saving space and time two less tangible but critical resources yet doing something efficiently but unsustainably will deplete resources before we’ve learned to cherish themgrainfeeding and nonrlm pasture operations break a successful natural cycle feedlots have a land fertility feed and waste problem instead of the cows naturally fertilizing their feed in the pasture the corn soy and grain they consume in a feedlot setting requires vast amounts of synthetic fertilizers herbicides and pesticides to grow this feed has to be trucked in from miles away the feed is unnatural to the cows body thus the animals need to be supported with antibiotics and hormones in confined spaces cramming the animals together leads to a decline in usable land and healthy soil and an unwieldy amount of manure finally this leaves an environmentally harmful wake behind that harms not only the land but also the atmosphere antibiotics manure lagoons and methane capture are efforts to mitigate problems that the industry created for itselfrlm can make beef production not just net zero but a net positive to climate change by closing the cycle when it comes to sequestration claims that take a stab at a lifecycle analysis of beef found that if you used restorative pasture raising on the world’s grasslands you could sequester more carbon than has been emitted since the industrial revolution so far rlm has been adopted by advocates in  million acres around the world the amount of grassfed beef sold retail has increased steadily since  but still accounts for than  of total sales by weightfortunately we’re not alone in championing rlm many leading advocates such as the nature conservancy nrdc and more insist on the importance of rlm but more research needs to be done—especially when it comes to projecting and

the joy of cooking a pastureraised bird november   the difference between a thanksgiving turkey raised outdoors on pasture and one raised inside in confinement is significant as a result of getting exercise to forage for part of their diet and consuming green grass turkeys raised on pasture tend to have smaller breasts and rich flavorful dark meat  nutritionally as a result of eating so much grass these turkeys have been shown to have significantly more vitamin e folic acid vitamin b and a higher omega to omega ratio  it’s also worth noting that they don’t contain arsenic  many industrial scale producers commonly add arsenic to poultry feed it is permitted by the usda at ppm or less which in small amounts improves growth rates… but it also happens to be a toxin and the primary ingredient in most rat poisonsso what to do with your pastureraised bird  we suggest a dry brine start today if you’re cooking thursday  we find that a typical “wet brine” can make the meat squishy and watery whereas a dry brine concentrates flavors and makes for a crispy golden skinusing about  tablespoon of salt per  lbs of bird plus black pepper and your favorite fresh herbs sage rosemary andor thyme work well rub the bird all over including underneath the skin as deep as possible above the breasts be careful not to tear the skin  place the bird on a open rack in your refrigerator allowing water to drip off of the bird to a tray below  allow to rest for  hoursplace a few onions and apples cut in half inside the bird’s cavity  heat oven to  and roast for  minutes remove from heat and cover breasts with foil  reduce temp to  degrees and cook for several hours general rule of thumb for a pastureraised bird is  min per lb  you should begin to check after about  hours – you’re looking for a temp range around  depending on your preferences note that we are lower than the usda’s recommended  degrees so please do so at your own riskbeware as a result of lower fat content and lower moisture from dry brining we have found that pastureraised birds tend to cook significantly faster than their industrial brethren  there is nothing worse than choking down chalky dry white meat and having to pull out the ketchup when the gravy runs out  remember you can always return the bird to the oven if it’s underdone if it’s overdone well you’re going to need to call doc brown for advice at that point   painting credit chase audette in memory of mike czerwinski october   earlier this week we lost a friend and colleague mike czerwinskimike joined us just  weeks ago but

interviewed him for the job he suggested that he had always been pretty shy and quiet  he was certainly right about this  it must have been a week before he spoke to anyone without being spoken to

national presidential stage and turn our attention toward our local ballot measures when it comes to daytoday life here in massachusetts downballot elections and local ballot questions can make quite a difference as advocates for local responsible agriculture we’ve spent a lot of time learning and talking about question question  can be seen from two angles on the farm side question  seeks to eliminate the confinement of veal calves breeding pigs and egglaying chickens which prohibits animals from moving and stretching freely this is not too much to ask of massachusetts agriculture there is not a single farm utilizing gestation crates for pigs and there is just one remaining farm raising laying hens in cages on the consumer side question  will prohibit the sale of these cageraised products in our local stores this is a tricky line to walk as removing the cheapest mostindustrial options from stores will likely lead to a bump in prices yet massachusetts is not a pioneer in this legislation arguably we are a laggard following in the footsteps of california michigan costco mcdonalds and the general climate of the egg industry  we believe cage free eggs will be the market standard in just a few short years this is good to hear as we feel that the cost of caged eggs is actually higher than it appearswith the negative externalities associated with this method of production being borne by all of us  if passed this legislation would not even come into full effect until  massachusetts will be transitioning in the same time span as national affordable voices such as mcdonalds denny’s and many other companies this industrywide movement means larger changes from more efficient designs for cagefree housing to affordable prices on better productsit’s important to reemphasize that battery cages represent the cheapest mostindustrial option in egg production there is a vast spectrum between industrial caged production and pastureraised eggs in election debates these nuances tend to be clustered into “good” and “bad” “yes” and “no” we equate “cagefree” with “good” merely because it is the lessbad option—a familiar idea this year in politics in truth “cagefree” merely means that the hens live in large industrial barns that house thousands of birds it’s not great but it’s a step up by implementing question  we are advocating a slight rise in the minimum standard  the ability to turn around does not ensure a chicken can express its natural behaviors  dust bathing scratching preening and hunting for bugs  but it is a starting point for an

transported to a place we imagine that food being prepared for us in the field or home when brands include place names this effect is magnified in choosing the name walden we were eager to reflect thoreau’s values of natural simplicity in our own company mission on the other hand walden is also an icon of our home and a landmark of where we produce our meat—new englandyet a recent investigation revealed that a british supermarket chain was branding foreign products with seemingly local farm names produce such as spinach from as far as senegal or honduras was sold with the label “redmere farms” when it came to meat cuts from both the uk and across europe were labeled with english names such as woodside farms or boswell farms although the origin of the products could be found in small

producers get to decide for themselves august   when it comes to food americans are lucky to worry about things like nutrition taste aesthetics…not necessarily safety when we walk the grocery store aisles we trust that what has been put before us is edible yet the fda has left a dangerous door open in its final rule on substances generally recognized as safe graslooking past the name—which inspires the same kind of confidence as “that trampoline is generally recognized as safe” or “that dog is generally friendly”—this rule creates a massive conflict of interest the gras ruling allows for food manufacturers to determine the safety of their own food additives thus companies that create additives use additives or sell additives get to decide the worth of their own products as pointed out in this article these rules were drawn up in a time when gras substances referred to vinegar or vegetable oil not complex chemicals nowadays this invites a “shoot first ask questions later”

meat and cancer concern you as a “real food dietitian” living on one of the farms that supplies walden i’m going to explain how these are not issues with pasturebased herbivores americans are facing soaring rates of obesity type  diabetes heart disease and cancer—partly because the food we’re eating isn’t giving us the nutrition we need our carbohydrateheavy intake and reliance on highly processed ultrapalatable industrially produced food is making us sick while at the same time leaving us malnourished according to the cdc the top us nutrition deficiencies are vitamin b vitamin c iron vitamin d and vitamin bred meat is the most common bioavailable source of many of these nutrients even the academy of nutrition and dietetics website lists beef as the  source for iron it’s a more complete and absorbable form of protein compared to plant proteins beef is also a fantastic source of b a nutrient that vegans must supplement in order to stay healthyi heard red meat causes cancerthe studies behind these claims are observational they show a correlation between meat intake and cancer but only correlations not cause these studies are relying on selfreported information from food frequency forms yet many people lie or at the very least forget what they ate it’s easy to remember things like “i ate red meat  times last week” but forget the sodas chips cake and cookies perhaps we “forget” how much we drink and smoke and inflate how much we exercise additionally vegetarians tend to have a much healthier lifestyle overall compared to those eating a standard american diet comparing an “average omnivore” to a vegetarian without adjusting for other lifestyle factors like exercise smoking and fast food intake is called “healthy user bias” and has been studied herein fact this study looked at people who shop at health food stores therefore attempting to adjust for lifestyle factors and compare vegetarians to omnivores and found no difference in mortalitybut we can sustainably engineer protein in labs…the argument that plantbased proteins engineered in labs is better for our health and the planet doesn’t hold much weight i’ve already addressed the health reasons for eating meat above so i’ll now address the sustainability argumentalternative proteins like “tofurkey” often seen as “sustainable” options engineered in labs are ignoring the incredible amount of input required per calorie of protein you can’t simply make protein out of thin air acres and acres of grains like soy wheat and corn are required for this process not to mention the amount of fossil fuels and water these crops use incredible amounts of herbicides and pesticides which not only require engineering of their own but also degrade the land on which they are usedlet’s compare this to grassfed beef from a local farm the cows eat grass free yes they drink water but they also produce manure read fertilizer which improves the soil bonus to provide nutrientdense bioavailable protein if you were to do a complete lifecycle analysis on this process and compare one pound of labproduced protein to one pound of locally produced holistically managed grassfed beef the clear winner would be

shallow definition especially when applied to critical resources to life such as feed water shelter and electricitysustainability means using more time and more space it means doing things at a

considering the recent repeal of country of origin labeling cool and several other questionable policies that affect us individually we should know where our candidates stand read here for an interesting piece by kim severson for the new york times on food in todays political landscape why is our chicken air chilled july   if you received walden chicken you will notice a new label “air chilled”this may not seem noteworthy…isn’t that the standard not necessarily an important element of chicken processing involves bringing the meat down to a refrigerated temperature as quickly as possible to minimize any growth of harmful bacteria  the most common cooling method in modern us poultry facilities utilizes a chlorinated bath  if youve ever seen or imagined this process it is quite messy after just a few chickens the water is well frankly not something youd enjoy for bathing  the water becomes a vehicle for transmitting bacteria across birds and adds a substantial amount of water to the meat—up to  of the weight this doesn’t just make the resulting chicken heavier and pricier it also dilutes and changes the flavor of the meat image source hawley associates a newer and alternative method of chilling uses air instead of using communal pools the chickens are hung individually and moved through a series of refrigerated chambers blasting cold air  the process is more expensive and less efficient than water baths  but it saves thousands of gallons of water when it comes to taste and hygiene we think it makes for a better chicken although this process is still a bit niche in the us it has been common practice for decades in europe as weve always said good things come to those who wait  instead of absorbing chlorinated water these chickens lose water weight making for a denser juicier and more flavorful meat with a skin that more easily crisps in the cooking process  in many ways air chilled chicken is analogous to the dry aging process of beef  most beef in this country is wetaged cut immediately after slaughter vacuumsealed aged in wet bags and then sold  days later  the week period spent in a refrigerated bag relaxes muscle fibers and releases some water which makes for a tenderer product  but it also creates an irony taste which many americans associate with the natural flavor of beef and leaves you with a bag full of water after you remove the meat  industrial producers like it for this reason water loss costs money and the process is highly efficient because the finished product is shipped quickly and doesnt require valuable storage space the alternative dry aging requires a whole side of beef to remain uncut and unpackaged at a specific temperature and humidity  the carcass can lose a significant amount of water weight sometimes up to  which concentrates natural flavors the beefs natural enzymes also begin to break down the connective tissue in the muscle leading to a significantly tenderer product  this is especially important for grassfed animals that can lack the fat content of cattle from a feedlot  for both beef and chicken these few extra steps make a big difference we believe better methods produce better products – both on the farm and in the processing facilityfor more info see here the pastureraised chicken operation at dan boffo and kristen kilfoyles farm in newport new hampshire chickens are back june   its that time of the year againchicken seasonchicken is the most popular meat in the usin fact it recently surpassed beef for the first time in over  years  unfortunately our chicken is only available seasonallybut we promise its worth the wait  and there is an important reason why its not available in januarywalden chicken is pastureraised—meaning the birds are raised outdoors in movable open air shelters note that this is very different from the term cagefree however winter temperatures and snowfall especially in new england mean barren land although hens can lay eggs in movable winter hoop houses we want our broiling chickens to grow up with full access not just to soil but also to living pasture we let them develop at their natural pace—unlike several store brands that use antibiotics and other additives to encourage faster growth why do we care so much about the pasture in short pastured chickens are happier healthier and tastier “pastured” is the latest of several poultry terms striving to close loopholes to sustainable humane farming for example the term “freerange” intended to allow chickens “access to the outdoors” and move away from factory farming yet beneath these surface intentions are a plethora of loopholes left to be interpreted by the farmer many wellintentioned commercial scale operations use freerange in good conscience others slap a “chicken door” on the side of a  footlong warehouse to allow chickens a few square feet of dirtpasture raising chickens has been shown to decrease bacteria content and increase omega fatty acids—specifically eicosapentaenoic acid these compounds are at the forefront of health supplements such as fish oils and play an important role in regulating metabolism and lowering inflammation and the chickens are eating them as a result of a more varied diet that contains forages grasses and insects we believe this is the best method for all involved the chickens and you too and it also happens to produce the tastiest chickens that are well worth the waitfor more on the science see here or hereto try some of this elusive chicken sign up for your own share walden farms salad dressings salad dressings home

program but ever man i think thats the best thing ive ever cooked  i was so proud of myself and i never would have done it without you  i think that your program is not just increasing access to

areas of rhode island from providence down to bristol warwick and up to woonsocket  several towns in fairfield county connecticut from fairfield to danburyareas of westchester and putnam county new york coastal new hampshireif you are outside the delivery area we are happy to deliver to a work or friends addressdo i need a bigger freezer  no  a lb order is about  cubic foot of space which fits fine in any home refrigerator  freezer assuming its not already full with items that you cant identify in which case its maybe time for a clean start  you can also skip anytime if you run out of room new york and connecticut delivery area click to enlarge sometimes we have a busy month or were traveling is there a way to skip or delay a delivery  what if its too much meat  no problem at all just email us at infowaldenlocalmeatcom and well put your deliveries on hold while youre away  you can restart at anytime without having to reenter all of your information  we also offer every other month or ever rd month shares if this works better for your family what will i get each month  can i customize my box or add to our share  each lb share generally comes with one pound of ground beef  type of sausage andor bacon and the remaining lbs a mix of cuts that you specify in the order form either roasts or steakschopsribs  larger sizes are generally the same proportion of cuts eg a lb share starts with lbs of ground beef and a sausage plus lbs of cuts you specify  you can opt out of anything you do not like beefporkchickenlamb or specific items or update your preferences anytime via our member site we also have monthly specials on various items like pastured eggs which we provide through a membersonly survey prior to our deliveries each month see here for a full product list  what farms do you work with we partner with about  different supplier partner farms in new england from maplewind farm in richmond vt to sugar river farm in newport nh to clifford waters farm in athol ma  all within  miles of us  in the spirit of transparency we print the town where the animal was raised and the name of the farmer on every cut label excluding ground beef and sausages which are made in larger batches but from the same farms  all of these farms accept visitors but generally ask that you schedule beforehand which were happy to facilitate  we visit our partner farms regularly and aim to develop long term productive and mutually beneficial partnerships based on our shared values  if you are a farmer and want to join our growing partnership see here  want to see us in your neighborhood thank you  well shoot you a note when we can get to your neighborhood can i purchase a gift  we can always accommodate gifts if the recipient is in our delivery area but do ask for a commitment of months or longer  if this is something youre interested in just email us at infowaldenlocalmeatcom how much should i order  here is a rough guideline is the meat fresh  our meat generally reaches our customers more quickly than a typical industrial producers would – mostly because it is traveling a shorter distance  what depletes the flavor of meat is not letting it age properly in the case of beef slowly freezing it or quickly defrosting it as in a microwave  after dry aging our beef is custom cut and flash frozen transported in a belowzero degree freezer and left for you packed with cold packs andor dry ice we believe this results in the best tasting meat possible after i defrost the meat how long can it stay in my refrigerator  if the vacuum seal of the package is not broken your meat has a shelf life in a refrigerator of more than  weeks  once you break the seal you should consume the meat in  days if ground  days for cuts  sausages  the best way to defrost is in a bowl of cold water or in your refrigerator overnight the worst way to defrost would be to use your microwave is it organic although all of our suppliers pledge not to use pesticides herbicides or antibiotics of any kind not all of our suppliers have pursued usda organic certification because it is tremendously costly for small producers  we have found that there are other perhaps more important indicators of quality and sustainability  most beef that is certified organic still comes from a cow raised in a feedlot where it is fed corn or grain which is completely unnatural for a grazing animal  although its great that the corn is organic any type of grain wreaks havoc on a cows digestive system and produces meat that is much less healthy higher in saturated fat and the badfat omegas  we think our own standards are much tougher  we ask our suppliers to sign this affidavit for beef this affidavit for pork this affidavit for lamb and this affidavit for poultry what if we arent home when you deliver  no problem  everything is packed with an ice pack in an insulated grocery bag so it will stay cold for several hours on your doorstep  if you do not have a safe drop spot for us to leave your delivery we would suggest delivering to an office location  is it expensive we believe meat that costs a few dollars per pound actually costs far more than that in environmental destruction the animal’s lack of wellbeing and longterm human health our prices are honest and offer great value relative to allnatural grocery stores  our full share includes items that would range from  to lb and we try to provide a balanced delivery each month to ensure everyone receives some high value items  we are also offering a very different product from what you see in a grocery store our animals are raised on pastures less than  miles from us moved regularly never fed antibiotics and have plenty of space to enjoy their lives they are raised by humans not machines on farms that are slowly rebuilding new englands agricultural heritage  and you can taste the difference   why don’t you charge more our prices are a fair reflection of what it costs to produce the highest quality products  our goal is to make them available to as many people as possible while covering our costs most of which goes towards supporting the small farms in new england that were trying to bring back when will i be billed  with the exception of your first order which is billed upon signup we bill all of our accounts on or around the st of the month  this is in support of our

are outside the delivery area we recommend an office delivery if you work in the city or youre welcome to pickup your order at our burlington ma offices connecticut delivery area click to enlarge want to see us in your neighborhood thank you  well shoot you a note when we can get to your neighborhood sometimes we have a busy month or were traveling is there a way to skip or delay a delivery  what if its too much meat  no problem at all just email us at infowaldenlocalmeatcom and well put your deliveries on hold while youre away  you can restart at anytime without having to reenter all of your information  we also offer every other month or ever rd month shares if this works better for your family what will i get each month  can i customize my box or add to our share  each lb share generally comes with one pound of ground beef  type of sausage andor bacon and the remaining lbs a mix of cuts that you specify in the order form either roasts or steakschopsribs  larger sizes are generally the same proportion of cuts eg a lb share starts with lbs of ground beef and a sausage plus lbs of cuts you specify  you can opt out of anything you do not like beefporkchickenlamb or specific items or update your preferences anytime via our member site we also have monthly specials on various items like pastured eggs which we provide through a membersonly survey prior to our deliveries each month see here for a full product list  what farms do you work with we partner with about  different supplier partner farms in new england from maplewind farm in richmond vt to sugar river farm in newport nh to chicken little farm in ipswitch ma  all within  miles of us  in the spirit of transparency we print the town where the animal was raised and the name of the farmer on every cut label excluding ground beef and sausages which are made in larger batches but from the same farms  all of these farms accept visitors but generally ask that you schedule beforehand which were happy to facilitate  we visit our partner farms regularly and aim to develop long term productive and mutually beneficial partnerships based on our shared values  if you are a farmer and want to join our growing partnership see here can i purchase a gift  we can always accommodate gifts if the recipient is in our delivery area but do ask for a commitment of months or longer  if this is something youre interested in just email us at infowaldenlocalmeatcom how much should i order  here is a rough guideline is the meat fresh  our meat generally reaches our customers more quickly than a typical industrial producers would – mostly because it is traveling a shorter distance  what depletes the flavor of meat is not letting it age properly in the case of beef slowly freezing it or quickly defrosting it as in a microwave  after days of dry aging our beef is custom cut and flash frozen transported in a belowzero degree freezer and left for you packed with cold packs andor dry ice we believe this results in the best tasting meat possible after i defrost the meat how long can it stay in my refrigerator  if the vacuum seal of the package is not broken your meat has a shelf life in a refrigerator of more than  weeks  once you break the seal you should consume the meat in  days if ground  days for cuts  sausages  the best way to defrost is in a bowl of cold water or in your refrigerator overnight the worst way to defrost would be to use your microwave is it organic although all of our suppliers pledge not to use pesticides herbicides or antibiotics of any kind not all of our suppliers have pursued usda organic certification because it is tremendously costly for small producers  we have found that there are other perhaps more important indicators of quality and sustainability  most beef that is certified organic still comes from a cow raised in a feedlot where it is fed corn or grain which is completely unnatural for a grazing animal  although its great that the corn is organic any type of grain wreaks havoc on a cows digestive system and produces meat that is much less healthy higher in saturated fat and the badfat omegas  we think our own standards are much tougher  we ask our suppliers to sign this affidavit for beef this affidavit for pork this affidavit for lamb and this affidavit for poultry what if we arent home when you deliver  no problem  everything is packed with an ice pack in an insulated grocery bag so it will stay cold for several hours on your doorstep  if you do not have a safe drop spot for us to leave your delivery we would suggest delivering to an office location  is it expensive we believe meat that costs a few dollars per pound actually costs far more than that in environmental destruction the animal’s lack of wellbeing and longterm human health our prices are honest and offer great value relative to allnatural grocery stores  our full share includes items that would range from  to lb and we try to provide a balanced delivery each month to ensure everyone receives some high value items  we are also offering a very different product from what you see in a grocery store our animals are raised on pastures less than  miles from us moved regularly never fed antibiotics and have plenty of space to enjoy their lives they are raised by humans not machines on farms that are slowly rebuilding new englands agricultural heritage  and you can taste the difference   why don’t you charge more our prices are a fair reflection of what it costs to produce the highest quality products  our goal is to make them available to as many people as possible while covering our costs most of which goes towards supporting the small farms in new england that were trying to bring back when will i be billed  with the exception of your first order which is billed upon signup we bill all of our accounts on or around the st of the month  this is in support of our mission as it helps us pay our farm partners on time and invest in new englands agricultural renaissance can i prepay my account for a discount  we do offer this option for members through our monthly specials list  we encourage you to try a month first
