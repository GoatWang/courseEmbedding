unique bourbon extensions are directly responsible for jeffersons growing reputation for fine quality products worthy of higher price points         the shortfall of its aged and blended bourbons of its  unique extensions has resulted in some distributors nationwide needing to supply some stores with just one case at a time until they could be restocked themselves         the more whiskey and bourbon castle brands can distill and age in its own distilleries and warehouses and at sea for future sales and consumption years down the road means they have more control over product consistency                      assurance of availability and it will lower the costofgoods on future income statements while increasing profit margins        each year going forward castle brands will be better

coordination bsc throughout the latters existence soe in london was tasked by hm treasury in july  as the lead british agency for the acquisition of foreign currency required in small denominations by members of the plethora of british covert wartime agencies as well as the escape packs of allied aircrew soe turned to bsc for help with this task the very close links between bsc and the oss meant that there was continual collaboration between the two agencies in support of this task some of the currencies acquired were seized from ships being searched in the contraband control bases such as bermuda gibraltar and aden or legitimately bought from legitimate passengers on those ships another source were the black markets in tangiers beirut istanbul and elsewhere by the sale of commodities such as gold platinum diamonds precious stones and swiss watches most of these items in short supply because of the allied blockade and restrictions on movement could be acquired by british government supply departments from within the british empire using sterling as the purchasing currency virtually every european currency was acquired as well as south american and far eastern currencies a statement from mid prepared for winston churchill cited the cumulative acquisitions to that date as being m french francs m belgian francs m dutch guilders m norwegian kroner m danish kroner m reichsmarks m spanish pesetas m us dollars and m argentine pesos excluding the us dollars and argentine pesos the balance had cost the british treasury around £m a major problem that both soe and bsc had to contend with was the sheer weight and volume of small denomination bank notes a number of surviving signals in soe files at national archives in kew mention tons of bank notes there is no doubt that contraband seizures by allied blockade authorities were recycled to support wartime covert activity mussons smuggling fleet which operated from gibraltar carrying soe and sis agents to and from
