 alton j pelowski supreme knight carl a anderson is pictured in his office at the knights of columbus headquarters in new haven conn the supreme knight serves as ceo of knights of columbus insurance the assets of which are invested according to faithbased ethical principles photo by tom serafin with more than  billion of life insurance in force and managing  billion in assets the knights of columbus has been a pillar of financial strength for its members and their families managing the assets of the knights’ toprated life insurance program the order’s investment staff screens portfolios in light of catholic teachings and has generated positive investment results for the insurance program beginning this month the order will offer similar investment strategies to catholic institutions making a series of products available to them through a new registered investment advisor subsidiary knights of columbus asset advisors llc supreme knight carl a anderson recently spoke with columbia editor alton j pelowski about the launch of the k of c asset advisors and how it will benefit the order and the broader catholic community columbia how are the order’s life insurance products related to the mission of the knights of columbus supreme knight from the very beginning father michael j mcgivney conceived of a fraternal benefit society to support the catholic community and the knights of columbus has taken seriously the responsibility of securing the financial future of our members and their families father mcgivney’s founding vision continued to be an inspiration as the order grew and adopted a modern life insurance program today the knights of columbus is among the largest companies in america as ranked on the fortune  list for nearly  consecutive years we have earned the highest rating from am best citing our impressive financial and fraternal strength in addition the order has been named a world’s most ethical company® by the ethisphere institute — one of only two such companies in the life insurance category at the foundation of these achievements there has always been an acute sense that we do not view our clients merely as customers rather we recognize them as fraternal brothers and that is a distinction that makes a great difference our approach puts our brother knights and their families before profits and requires us to manage all of the associated risks accordingly columbia and the order’s approach to investments is tied to its mission as well supreme knight yes our insurance program and investment philosophy relate to the fraternal vocation of every knight and to the paternal responsibility of the order as a whole by “paternal” i do not mean “paternalistic” and the negative connotations of that term rather i am referring to the authentic vocation of fathers which is to serve and protect their families pope francis referred to this vocation in his inaugural homily on march   when he reflected on st joseph who he said “exercises his role as protector … with an unfailing presence and utter fidelity” pope francis has also spoken about the grace of fatherhood and “spiritual paternity” which is realized in the defense of others just as a father has a special vocation to protect his family the knights of columbus has a special vocation to protect our members and their families who have entrusted their future financial security to us through our insurance program or annuity program as a distinctly catholic organization the order’s responsibility to defend and protect also goes beyond its individual members and their families in a particular way knights are called to witness to the virtue of charity and to build up the church columbia how does this catholic identity affect the kind of things that the order chooses to invest in supreme knight companies involved with funding things such as abortion contraception pornography embryonic stemcell research and human cloning are eliminated from the knights of columbus insurance program portfolios there is no minimum revenue test meaning that as little as one penny of revenue from any of those sources eliminates a company from further consideration our investment team has been managing screened portfolios on behalf of the insurance program for many years and has achieved positive financial returns for our insurance and annuity portfolios while fully adhering to catholic teachings columbia with that having been said what is knights of columbus asset advisors supreme knight knights of columbus asset advisors has been established to expand the scope of the order’s investments program it is a wholly owned subsidiary of the knights of columbus that is largely comprised of our current investment staff up until now our investment staff has been structured as a “captive investment firm” in other words our people have managed assets only for the order and at the same time we “outsource” very little investment decisionmaking to others with k of c asset advisors we will now be an secregistered investment advisor with the capacity to manage capital for catholic institutions unaffiliated with the order k of c asset advisors will be responsible for managing the insurance and annuity assets for our members and it will also have investment products available to other institutional investors including catholic dioceses hospitals parishes and schools columbia how did this program come about why launch it now supreme knight in its service to the church the knights of columbus has long included among its investments the support of capital projects in various dioceses and parishes the first investment of this kind took place in  when the supreme council provided a loan to st rose of lima church in meriden conn our churchloan program has approved more than  million of lowinterest loans to catholic churches and schools and currently includes more than  active accounts over the years many catholic institutions have also approached the knights of columbus about the possibility of managing their assets in our analysis we have found that there is a large institutional catholic marketplace that is highly fragmented meaning there are a large number of small providers and one of the biggest challenges confronting catholic institutional investors is the very small number of catholicscreened products that they can invest in given the size and scale of managing the knights of columbus general account we believe that k of c asset advisors will be in a unique position to provide a high quality service to institutions that seek security stability and catholicscreened investment options columbia what kinds of investment products and services will be offered supreme knight we expect that at its launch k of c asset advisors will offer both fixedincome and equity mutual funds the strategies for these funds will be consistent with those used by the investment team on behalf of our insurance program and very importantly these funds will comply with catholic moral teaching k of c asset advisors may also offer investment advisory and other services to certain customers in a separate account additionally certain customers will be offered an “outsourced chief investment officer” strategy through which it will partner with catholic institutions to develop goals and objectives and allocate assets in a manner designed to achieve those goals columbia will these funds be available to individuals supreme knight initially the mutual funds are expected to be available only to institutions however employees of institutional investors may have access to the funds via k and similar types of savings plans providing a catholicscreened option that was not previously available to them columbia is there anything else that members of the knights should know about knights of columbus asset advisors supreme knight the service and dedication that insurance members have received from our dedicated field force of agents and committed investments team will be unchanged we will continue to proudly offer products “by brother knights for brother knights” extending our proven catholicscreened investment strategies to other catholic institutions through k of c asset advisors will simply be an opportunity for the order to strengthen and support catholic communities in the future i believe this will become one of the great services the knights of columbus can make to the financial health and sustainability of our dioceses parishes religious communities schools colleges and health care facilities it makes sense for us to do so since members of the order are first and foremost members of the body of christ and the vitality of our church is directly related to the vitality of the knights of columbus about

principled investing  by joseph o’brien knights of columbus asset advisors allows catholic institutions to invest with integrity chief investment officer anthony v minopoli standing right and members of the knights of columbus investment team work in the trading room at the order’s headquarters it may seem strange to compare the knights of columbus to wall street’s old guard but the world’s largest catholic fraternal order’s history of addressing the financial needs of families actually predates the biggest and brightest investment firms father michael j mcgivney founded the knights of columbus in  three years before goldman sachs began its dance with the bulls and bears as the order’s fraternal benefit program developed the knights began formally managing investments with a loan to st rose of lima parish in meriden conn in  — just one year after jp morgan  company was established and  years before merrill lynch the knights of columbus has since grown to become a fortune  company and for decades has earned top ratings for financial strength in february  knights of columbus asset advisors llc formalized its longstanding role as the order’s institutional investment arm with the announcement of the new initiative supreme knight carl a anderson said “the catholic community has traditionally been served by investment managers with a broad rather than a catholic focus we believe a catholic firm committed to catholic values can offer a more compelling solution for catholic entities” since that time knights of columbus asset advisors has helped dozens of catholic institutions unaffiliated with the knights to invest in a manner consistent with the us bishops’ investment guidelines in addition the k of c subsidiary has provided historically compelling returns belowmarket fees and profitability that benefits the work of the knights of columbus and the church growth and service in october  the knights of columbus sponsored a conference in chicago on the topic of sustainable and ethical investments “our approach to sustainable investing works to understand the ‘personal’ consequences for all those affected by a particular trade or investment” the supreme knight said in remarks at the conclusion of the conference “the ethics of the investor matters so do the guiding philosophy and ethical standards of those people leading the company being invested in” according to anthony v minopoli president and chief investment officer of knights of columbus asset advisors the idea for the knights’ investment group was born of the  conference and followup conversations “the conference coupled with conversations about whether the knights could manage money for other organizations made us realize there was an opportunity there” he said in his research minopoli discovered a mostly untapped  billion catholic institutional investment market since the knights already had an internal investment team and more than  billion of assets under management it was an easy step to open these funds to the public said thomas duffy asset advisors vice president of investment strategy “for decades the knights had said ‘no thanks — we only invest our own money’” duffy explained “but we finally got to the point that we knew we should make this capability available as a service to the church and to catholic investors everywhere we can help them pursue strong riskadjusted returns while maintaining the integrity of their catholic beliefs” supreme knight anderson has affirmed that while the order is proud to provide this service in support of catholic communities both the investment team and dedicated field force has remained committed to serving members and their families “the knights of columbus will continue to evaluate new financial products that are beneficial to our members and our agents” the supreme knight said since early  nearly  clients in the united states including at least  dioceses and archdioceses have gotten on board with knights of columbus asset advisors currently two fixedincome funds are managed strictly by the asset advisors team while four equity funds are managed in collaboration with the renowned boston advisors management group “we’ve made sure to price these funds at levels below the industry averages across the board” duffy said “the fees are extremely competitive” knights of columbus asset advisors’ low fees often get the attention of financial officers of dioceses parishes catholic schools and hospitals religious orders and other catholic institutions and the fact that these investments are truly catholic — screened according to the guidelines of the us conference of catholic bishops — is keeping that attention duffy pointed out that investing is not a “morally neutral” activity but one that can be fraught with ethical pitfalls “for example” duffy said “someone who wants to invest in an index fund might not appreciate the fact that these funds are investing in firms that profit from say the production of abortifacients pornography or even land mines but as our bishops have explained it is inappropriate for catholics to profit from such illicit practices so in keeping with the bishops’ guidelines asset advisors screens out all those companies” while strict compliance means asset advisors has to dig a little deeper into their work minopoli said the investors’ peace of mind is worth the extra effort “there’s an old saying that the impossible takes  minutes longer here at the knights of columbus we’ll take the extra  minutes and get our investments the right way” minopoli said “investing in a way that is consistent with church teaching is important” he added “we can provide that comfort level because it’s part of our mandate as the knights of columbus — it’s part of who we are” catholic compliant confident the knights’ emphasis on ethical business practices extends beyond investments to all aspects of the organization and its insurance program for three consecutive years the order has been named a world’s most ethical company® by the ethisphere institute in addition the knights’ catholic identity further influences how profits are managed “it’s typical for an investment firm to give all their profits to its shareholders and partners” duffy said “but the knights of columbus asset advisors is a wholly owned subsidiary of the knights of columbus so our profits get upstreamed to the order which donated more than  million last year alone to help catholic causes and charities such as the special olympics” in other words rather than financing luxuries for its brokers the dividends from knights of columbus asset advisors’ work go where they are needed most “the hallmark of the knights’ giving is that it gets to the right place” minopoli affirmed “it gives us great satisfaction to know that as asset advisors grows and becomes truly profitable we are contributing money back to the knights of columbus and its charitable mission” the knights of columbus asset advisors team is proud of its performance relative to peers in the investing world “we don’t just compare well to other funds that are catholic”

confidence — just as we have been for years for those who have purchased knights of columbus insurance or annuities” for more than  consecutive years the knights of columbus — asset advisors’ parent company — has achieved the highest possible ratings for financial strength from am best “this speaks to our ability to produce strong riskadjusted returns” said duffy “the order likes to take smart risks to make sure that we get paid well for any risk we do take over time we’ve found these strategies to be extremely effective” according to the investors themselves there’s yet another reason to choose knights of columbus asset advisors as chief financial officer for the archdiocese of baltimore william baird sees to it that the church in baltimore achieves the best return on its investments for the last seven years baird has worked for the archdiocese but  years of experience in the secular investment world taught him that an investment is only as good as the team that supports it “for me investments are not only about whether they’re catholic compliant as important as that is but also about a process where you have the opportunity to get attractive returns through the managers you select” baird said “after my visit to new haven whether to invest with the knights became a pretty easy decision to make given the talent and caliber of tony’s team” like the baltimore archdiocese the sisters of life a new yorkbased religious order invests with asset advisors according to the order’s superior general mother agnes mary donovan the sisters of life do not see ethical investing as a

mother agnes “it is critically important to us that our investments in companies are building a culture of life the knights of columbus asset advisors researches the companies they invest in and
