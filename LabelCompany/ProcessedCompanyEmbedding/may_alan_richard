fledgling chicago  milwaukee electric railroad the amusement park boasted a baseball diamond electric fountain and refectory or casino building with dining rooms and a dance floor the prairiestyle martin theatre then called ravinia theatre is the only building on the grounds that dates back to that original construction over  years later ravinia festival is the oldest outdoor music festival in north america and is lauded for presenting worldclass music the festival attracts about  listeners to some  to  events that span all genres from classical music to jazz to music theater over each threemonth summer season over the years the festival has hosted such luminaries as louis armstrong the ballet russe luciano berio leonard bernstein lucrezia bori dave brubeck pablo casals van cliburn

and frank zappa in  walter damrosch leads the new york symphony society the first piece ever played at the park was bill bailey wont you please come home on a steam calliope soon after walter damrosch brought the new york philharmonic to the openair pavilion which also saw dance productions by ruth page and ted shawn this mix of popular diversions and music performances was not sufficient to keep the railroad afloat and in  the first incarnation of ravinia park came to an end and the property went into receivership a group of north shore residents convinced the high quality of presentations should continue purchased the park and founded the ravinia company under the leadership of philanthropist louis eckstein who served as impresario and personally subsidized the organization for  years

rosa raisa and tito schipa in may  the original wooden pavilion burned to the ground with the onset of the great depression that golden age ended and the woods fell silent for five years again local businessmen came to the rescue by forming the ravinia festival association a notforprofit organization dedicated to presenting music of the highest quality for less than cost in  ravinia became the summer residence of the chicago symphony orchestra which remains the centerpiece of the music festival today in  ecksteins widow donated the acre park to the festival association in may  the original

operation hickory was directed at reducing the combat strength and supporting infrastructure of north vietnamese army operating in and south of the dmz nd battalion rd marines boarded cha sea knight helicopters on the uss princeton to be inserted in the northeastern corner of the hickory operating area a few minutes later the choppers began to circle and gradually dropped elevation hotel made the opposed air assault into lz parrot  kilometers north northeast of con thien hill  the opposition was strong enough so the lz was closed to further landings until hotel and supporting arms had secured the area just as soon as the chopper landed we received small arms fire and mortar rounds most of the day was spent ferrying the battalion and supplies the hill top lz this was the marines first incursion into the dmz hotel st platoon moved toward its initial objective a village to the northnorthwest the village was fortified and defended by what appeared to be a reinforced nva platoon supported by mortars and artillery firing from within the dmz because it was the dmz we were instructed not to fire on the enemy unless they fired first another stupid rule from the politicians state side st squad had point and my fire team had point for the platoon lcpl mike sevard was point man i was number two and pfc mark landers was third we were short a man for the fire team the platoon moved down the trail as we came to the clearing next to a rice paddy we found our first dead marine from the day before we would retrieve the body when we left the area we continued for about  yards across the clearing next to the rice paddy all hell broke out the platoon was in an lshaped ambush long leg was across the paddy from us was shooting along our line of march and a machine nest was on the short leg shooting down our length i jumped behind a bush about three high and three feet around i began firing my m at the enemy across the paddy the calls for corpsman was coming from everywhere behind me i glanced forward to find lcpl sevard he was no where to be seen continuing firing i glanced behind me and saw pfc mark landers lying dead in the open area he had been killed immediately by a sniper i could hear our m machine gun start and then stop this happened several times we were having trouble gaining fire superiority i learned later two machine gunners were killed by nva snipers and two gunners wounded then i was knocked backward to the ground i was hit i crawled behind the bush and saw blood soaking the front of my shirt i called for corpsman then realized that was not going to happen i reach around to my back and found a hole and blood with my fingers i pulled up the front of my shirt and found a round hole in my side about half way down it was a bullet wound i tied one battle dressing over the front bullet hole and the second over the back bullet hole only minutes had passed since being hit i heard calls the platoon was falling back i could envision f fighters screaming in shortly dropping napalm all over this area i needed to get the hell out of here later i found out we had  kia and  wia in the initial assault the  marines and  corpsman lost were a co rd
