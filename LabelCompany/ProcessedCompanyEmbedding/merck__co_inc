of the fda’s budget five of the top  pharma and medical device companies for  are headquartered in the us johnson  johnson pfizer merck gilead and abbvie the underside of the industry reveals a history of fraud bribery product liability lawsuits and scandals that led to billions in settlements — a known cost of doing business for these companies who are “too big to jail” despite criminal charges and fines the companies continue to do business who is big pharma the majority of drugs and medical devices have ties to a small group of parent companies prescription drugs and devices manufactured by these companies bring in billions in profits the biggest drug makers may also have subsidiaries that manufacture medical devices pharmaceutical companies are typically larger and make more money than companies that focus on medical devices the most powerful drug and device companies are members of the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma — the industry’s us lobbying organization with the help of staggering profits and an army of  paid lobbyists the industry spreads its influence on capitol hill from  to  big pharma spent nearly  billion on lobbying

hospital beds boston scientific marlborough massachusetts ivc filters surgical mesh big pharma’s influence critics contend that big pharma uses manipulative tactics and expensive advertising to sway lawmakers the fda and the public to increase sales the public is exposed to pharma’s misleading promotions and advertising for example critics say abbvie and other companies who make testosterone replacement drugs such as androgel marketed their drugs as the fountain of youth to older men they created a marketing campaign around the condition “low t” that featured a quiz for men to selfdiagnose low t symptoms androgel above was marketed as the “fountain of youth” with few studies to back it up the testosterone market soared into the billions as a result but few studies back up drugcompany claims that the drug significantly enhances mood vitality and sexual performance studies also link these drugs to heart problems the fda added a warning on the label after millions of men were already exposed to the risk the american public is not the only sector of society influenced by big pharma’s techniques doctors scientists and research organizations medical journals teaching hospitals and university medical schools all exhibit disturbing conflicts of interest between their publicly stated missions and their financial and ideological subjection to big pharma doctors conduct research with funds from big pharma private charities and foundations account for a mere  percent of the estimated  billion spent on biomedical research in the us each year pharmaceutical and medical device companies contribute approximately  percent big pharma has a track record of hiring former government workers with valuable connections to gain political clout the trade group phrma has many current or former staff members who once served in the political arena including  who worked for a member of congress  who worked for a federal agency  who worked for a congressional committee two who worked for the white house one who worked in the court system using these connections to pursue industry goals big pharma has a significant competitive advantage over the public interest marketing research and development rd and drug cost americans pay more than any other country in the world for pharmaceuticals — in some cases thousands of dollars more per prescription big pharma says this occurs because of the astronomical costs of developing a new drug cost facts while companies claim each new drug costs them  billion the true cost is more like  million the truth is that us law allows drug companies to set the prices for drugs and protects them from freemarket competition other countries set a limit on what companies can charge based on the benefit of the drug the true cost of developing a drug is shrouded in mystery with many unverifiable figures reported by big pharma donald light a professor and expert on the pharma business model said that while companies claim each new drug costs them  billion the true cost is more like  million the industry also avoids talking about how much it spends on marketing which is almost double what it spends on research big pharma sways opinions the large amount of cash big pharma bestows on government representatives and regulatory bodies is small when compared with the billions it spends each year on directtoconsumer advertising the us is one of only two countries in the world whose governments allow prescription drugs to be advertised on tv the other is new zealand in  big pharma spent  billion on directtoconsumer ads and fired off about  ads an hour according to nielsen big pharma also employs doctors researchers and institutions the industry persuades doctors to allow ghostwriting paying physicians to attach their names to positive articles about a particular drug with the goal of seeing it published in a reputable medical journal paid copywriters were used in advertising paxil above often the commentary is little more than an advertisement penned by a company paid copywriter showcasing a new product big pharma used ghostwriting to promote numerous drugs including the antidepressant paxil the recalled weight loss drug fenphen the antiepilepsy drug neurontin the antidepressant zoloft and painkiller vioxx to name a few in addition even when a medical reviewer writes a comprehensive assessment of a new drug for a medical journal it is common practice for those supposedly unbiased professionals to be on big pharma’s payroll these slanted studies appear in medical journals that are widely hailed as collections of unbiased scientific evaluation and separated from the long financial arm of pharmaceutical industry influence yet richard smith former editor of the british medical journal says “all journals are bought — or at least cleverly used — by the pharmaceutical industry” big pharma tends to weaken the objectivity of even the most honest health professionals while encouraging them to overprescribe medications consider the numbers advertising instead of research for every  spent on “basic research” big pharma spends  on promotions and advertising distribution of free drug samples the us has one pharmaceutical sales representative for every five officebased physicians sponsorship of symposiums and medical conventions drug and medical device makers spend lavishly on doctors including covering meals travel seminars and conventions that sometimes look more like vacations many medical journals including the esteemed journal of the american medical association jama actively vie for the attention of big pharma advertising dollars billing themselves as the best way for drug companies to reach their professional readership how big pharma influences doctors and researchers part of big pharma’s formula for creating blockbuster drugs is promoting to physicians and providing kickbacks and incentives to prescribe their expensive brand name drugs fact in  big pharma spent  billion on physician advertising according to pew charitable trusts drug companies also buy doctors meals and pay them for “speaking engagements” in exchange for brand loyalty one  study in jama internal medicine found that when drug reps bought doctors just one meal costing less than  they were more likely to prescribe a promoted brand name drug according to propublica’s dollars for docs investigation  companies paid  billion to doctors and hospitals from august  to december  drug and device company payments to doctors from select companies august  to december  company payments depuy johnson  johnson  million stryker corporation  million astrazeneca  million pfizer  million janssen pharmaceuticals  million glaxosmithkline  million boston scientific  million big pharma and researchers then there are medical researchers who are hardly immune to big pharma’s financial power because drug companies sponsor clinical trials that researchers are paid to administer too often the academics and scientists are hired hands who supply human subjects and collect data according to the instructions of their corporate employers sponsors keep the data analyze it write the papers and decide whether and when and where to submit them for publication drug companies also stagemanage trials to produce predetermined outcomes that will put their products in the best light medical schools and big pharma big pharma has also infiltrated medical schools teachers department chairs and deans often sit on drug companies’ boards of directors this influences educational content money from big pharma supports programs within many medical schools and teaching hospitals and company reps are given access to young doctors to promote their company’s drugs the result is that doctors not only receive biased information but also learn a drugintensive style of medicine sales reps may influence these doctors to believe that newer more expensive drugs are always better than old ones in most states doctors must also take accredited education courses called continuing medical education cme the pharmaceutical industry provides a substantial proportion of the billions spent on cme annually and continues to use that support as a marketing tool in addition academic centers are able to receive royalties from big pharma on any drug or technology they help to create and patent as a result of research — sometimes underwritten with government funds columbia university for example received nearly  million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companies during the year life of its medical school’s patent on a method for synthesizing certain biological products columbia university received nearly  million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companiesbig pharma fraud settlements in a year period big pharma companies paid  settlements totaling  billion for marketing fraud according to public citizen’s  report pharmaceutical industry settlements  through  fact in a year period big pharma companies paid  settlements totaling  billion for marketing fraud the most common charge involved drugpricing scams against state medicaid programs this meant state taxpayers ended up footing the bill while big pharma made billions unlawful promotion of drugs yielded the biggest settlements but these investigations take many years to complete by then drug companies have made hundreds of millions or even several billion while the us department of justice fine is typically only a few million this makes it too profitable to stop breaking the law for many companies according to michael bobelian of forbes magazine manufacturer directory several of the biggest drug and medical device companies sell the majority of their products in the us many of these products are involved in product liability litigation some of the companies’ bestselling drugs brought in over a billion in

its portfolio is diverse from traditional childhood vaccines eg measles mumps rubella combination vaccines to newer vaccines with few other suppliers including for hpv gardasil® and rotavirus rotateq® opportunities strengthen internal process for aligning supply and demand merck  co inc can implement some or all of the strategies identified by the index to strengthen its internal process for aligning supply and demand for example it could establish a clear process for escalation and action on identified supply issues consider other suppliers when making supply allocation decisions and set up a clear process for reallocation of stocks in limited supply situations apply a more specific pricing policy and reduce key vaccine prices merck  co inc can outline how it defines pricing tiers and explicitly state how it takes different countries’ ability to pay into account in addition it can work with stakeholders to reduce the price of key vaccines eg gardasil® for hpv and rotateq® for rotavirus for all lics and middleincome countries mics particularly in the case of gavitransitioning countries in the future and current nongavi and nonpaho countries for this purpose merck  co inc can continue to work with pooled procurers and work directly with selfprocuring countries this can help increase the adoption of these vaccines in more mics invest more in rd merck  co inc can invest more in vaccine rd and engage in new projects to develop and adapt vaccines that meet the needs of people in countries in scope this will help the longterm sustainability of its vaccine business file

pricing to a expand access and b to ensure sufficient return on its investment in rd over time the company does not provide details of its pricing tiers the company’s access to vaccines policy takes multiple factors into account including the country’s level of economic development fiscal capacity for investments in health and actual health spending which could be seen as proxies for the country’s ability to pay extension of gavi prices to gavitransitioning countries merck  co inc is extending the current gavi prices for its quadrivalent hpv vaccine gardasil® and rotavirus vaccine rotateq® through  to gavitransitioned countries with gross national income per capita not exceeding usd  aboveaverage transparency like its peers merck  co inc does not systematically publish all prices for its vaccines in all countries in scope unlike most of its peers the company publishes its detailed vaccine pricing policy it states that it does not have a policy permitting or prohibiting governments from disclosing prices it leaves this to each government’s discretion limited registration filing in lics merck  co inc files the majority of its relevant vaccines for registration in some lower middleincome countries like its peers however it files only some of its vaccines for registration and in only some lics merck  co inc states that its decision to file for registration is based on where vaccines are needed the company commits to seeking who prequalification of eligible vaccines to expedite access in lics manufacturing  supply very strong in aligning supply and demand merck

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
