and ceo cke restaurants – ceo – chairman awards semper fidelis award marine corps scholarship foundation  businessperson of the year orange county business journal   address fidelity national financial  riverside avenue jacksonville florida  httpwwwfnfcom ■ william p foley ii was considered one of the most successful entrepreneurs and businessmen in the real estate services and specialty finance industries in  while running his own law firm foley organized a group of investors and led a leverage buyout of a small title insurance company in phoenix arizona twenty years and more than  acquisitions later that local firm then called fidelity national title insurance company became the largest title insurer in the country foley was credited with recognizing early on the growth opportunities in the title insurance industry through dozens of shrewd and complicated acquisitions and effective operational management he led fidelity to the top position in the title insurance industry in  following its acquisition of chicago title corporation by  fidelity controlled  percent of the title insurance market with annual revenues of  billion foley ascribed his success to one core principle staying focused on the customer in a november  article in california business  he said it takes years to get the business one deal at a time but once you get it you have customers for life as long as you treat them properly foley was also one who never stood still always looking forward to his next move were always looking over our shoulder he said in the santa barbara newspress in august  so when things are good thats the time to prepare the deal maker foley was interested in business early on while attending the us military academy in the s he preferred managing his stock portfolio to completing his studies by his own admission he fulfilled his military commitment by overseeing defense contracts at boeing company in seattle as an air force officer after his discharge he earned a degree in business from seattle university and then a law degree from the university of washington after receiving his law degree foley joined the phoenix firm of streich lang weeks cardon  french in  and two years later established foley clark  nye where he stayed until  it was during this period—while handling the legal work for a local savings and loan sl company—that foley first came in contact with fidelity national title insurance company a small title insurer in phoenix though it was a rather unglamorous and arcane business title insurance was critical to companies lenders and home owners the policies issued by title insurers shielded real estate title holders from losses that occurred from claims filed against a property foley helped the sl company acquire fidelity in  and then watched as its revenues grew from  million to  million during the next three years foley saw the potential for greater growth at fidelity so he formed an investor group to purchase the company in  the gamble paid off handsomely for foley who left his law practice to become chairman chief executive officer and president of the business that same year the company went public in  and began a series of acquisitions over the next  years that catapulted it to the top position in the title insurance industry fidelitys consistent growth was attributed to foley and his management teams aggressive acquisition of regional and ultimately national title insurance firms across the country focusing on residential real estate and businesses in core states like california texas and florida fidelity grew rapidly during the late s and early s every year our revenue would go up by  percent  percent said foley in the florida times union september   while foley executed dozens of acquisitions after fidelity became a public company three deals stand apart as key contributors to the companys growth the first was the  acquisition of western title insurance company which gave the arizonabased fidelity a major presence in california almost overnight according to foley we had a county operation in california  florida times union  september   the acquisition prompted the company to move its headquarters from scottsdale arizona to irvine california that same year the second event was the acquisition of meridian title insurance company in  at the time of the deal meridian had operations in  states and about  million in annual revenue the meridian acquisition gave fidelity a national presence according to foley  florida times union  september   and it propelled it to the numberseven position in the title insurance industry the third major event was the boldest one of all the  acquisition of the secondlargest title insurer in the country chicago title corporation with the purchase of chicago title fidelity went from being the fourthlargest to the largest title insurance company in the united states key business and leadership strategies a number of important business strategies and leadership skills have guided foleys management of fidelity from the beginning in california business  the reporter philip capelle described the way foley and his early partner frank p willey transformed fidelity after their leveraged buyout of the company foley and willey decided to curb the companys dependence on independent agents and to emphasize direct selling through its employees this approach gave fidelity control over costs and the ability to avoid the kinds of losses incurred by competitors november  foley and willey also steered fidelitys business toward the more stable residential sector as opposed to commercial real estate the move proved prescient by anticipating the us real estate boom of the s foley was also a disciple of the management guru tom peters and like peters he instilled a core value of superior customer service throughout fidelitys subsidiaries toward that end foley sought out talented executives to run his operations and he credited his ability to delegate as a key ingredient to his companys success im a very good delegator so thats one of the reasons the company has grown like it has he explained to the santa barbara newspress august   he tried to delegate to strong managers indeed foley has been criticized for axing executives at companies he acquired and replacing them with his own people if people are the problem we get rid of them if there are structural problems … we fix them he said to the orange county business journal january   another core competency of foley and his executive team was the ability to find good acquisition candidates in cathy taylors article in the orange county register  foley described his approach to selecting these companies stating that his first criterion is to find companies that have been mismanaged october   according to foley he typically looked for the characteristics that led to his purchase of fidelity in  ineffective managers who miss growth opportunities and ignore their customers changing needs he then researched the companys financial records and tried to identify the reasons why it was not increasing its revenue or adding to market share afterward foley created a to do list to fix the company and then negotiated hard for the acquisition i tell them here are the things you have to fix thats why you have to lower the asking price foley negotiated for a final price below net asset value meaning total assets minus debt goodwill patents and other intangibles foley and his team were also patient when negotiating an acquisition spending two or three years to close a deal we will keep changing and tuning the offer from a tax standpoint from a gaap accounting reporting standpoint he added  orange county register  october   problems along the way not all deals worked out as well as foley envisioned in the mids as it attempted to diversify into other businesses fidelity failed to close several deals including a couple of hostile takeovers foley reported to the florida times union that acquisitions were difficult for us because we were just a small company we were very aggressive… the reality was we were never very successful at hostile takeovers we irritated a lot of people and we wasted a lot of time so we stopped it foley added executing hostile takeovers wasnt my style september   foley also admitted that his ambitious deal making could get out of control im my own worst enemy i keep finding transactions to do  forbes  september   the fidelity holding company also had interests in the restaurant industry with its cke restaurants subsidiary of which foley served as chairman of the board and ceo cke operated a number of regional restaurant chains including hardees carls jrgreen burrito rallys checkers driveins home town buffets galaxy diners and taco bueno in  it was the fourthlargest seller of hamburgers in the united states after mcdonalds burger king and wendys though foley helped turn cke around after he took it over in  the company began losing money in the early s in the fiscal year ending january  it lost  million the  acquisition of the hardees chain of  restaurants turned out to be more problematic and costly than foley had anticipated the deal appeared cheap at the purchase price of  million but it turned out that more than five hundred of the units which were franchised to a company named advantica corporation were prepared to break away from the acquisition cke was forced to invest another  million to buy out advantica and keep the units—located mostly in the southeast—on board the extra costs doubled ckes debt which the company struggled to manage future diversification though fidelity never lost money in its year history under foley it aggressively diversified its services beginning in the s to withstand the cyclical downturns in the real estate market our downside is that were subject to the real estate cycle foley reported to the santa barbara newspress august   were attempting to diversify to get into more consistent revenue streams that will produce a recurring income stream and aftertax profit performance for our organization to this end fidelity expanded into other forms of real estate services such as flood insurance mortgage insurance property and casualty insurance appraisal services and the home warranty business it also made a number of acquisitions of real estate and finance technology companies such as alltel information services sanchez computer associates webtone technologies and aurum technologies these acquisitions positioned fidelity as a technologysolution business in the real estate and financial services industries not just an insurer such a planaheadforsurvival strategy fit with foleys temperament as a

foley sees many more investment opportunitiesthe new laird of wharekauhau wails i wish i had more depthamerican billionaire william p foley ii bill to pretty much everybody has been fielding those annoying little questions that writers of profiles this one anyway like to askwhat do you enjoy reading military history  ive just finished the  days about the siege of leningradfavourite music country and western especially female singers like patty loveless and gretchen wilsonits the last reply that brought on the depth wish country and western why not beethovens th or somethinghes joking or is he after talking to foley for a couple of hours im left feeling hes quite comfortable with who he is also that hes utterly unpretentious exhibit a the white tshirt under the old vneck with a few stains on the sleeve and speaks his mind at one stage he says id love to be a writer ive got a book ive been fooling with foreveradvertisementi do think he harbours some small regret that all those years of sitting at americas corporate poker table left parts of him unexercised if so that awareness itself reflects a degree of depth whats more foley is now cashing in his very large of stack of chips no hes not about to enrol in a beethoven appreciation course hes found himself another gaming table  a far more convivial one though not without its own tough oddswine is what foley is increasingly about these days hes collecting wineries with collateral dabblings such as his purchase last year with two other parties of wharekauhau the south wairarapa luxury lodge it was reported at the time to be worth more than  millionthe club of wealthy americans who have invested in the new zealand wine industry is small and discreet it includes las vegas casino magnate glenn schaeffer who is behind nelsons woollaston estate and wall street tycoon julian robertson who owns wairarapas iconic dry river winery and hawkes bay labels te awa and kidnapper cliffsfoley gained membership only recently his first acquisition was the new zealand wine fund in  previously a private investment vehicle for wealthy individuals the entity houses a cluster of marlborough brands including vavasour dashwood redwood pass boatshed bay goldwater and clifford bay for good measure foley also bought a  per cent stake in the seasoned new zealand wine distribution company eurovintagethis year he added to the portfolio pioneering martinborough winery te kairanga and now runs all his new zealand operations from the te kairanga office and hes not finished yettherell be some more opportunities im looking for appellations or locations martinborough is perfect  it has a great history for pinot noir so thats covered i would go to central otago but im all about not stressing out trying to get somewhere in marlborough i would keep on going id buy more vineyards  if there was a good brand available id buy that and really try and build up my production base get the company doing threequarters of a million cases in new zealand so weve got some size and mass and maybe add some more distribution horsepower so thats sort of my idea for new zealandat this time of pain and price cutting in the new zealand wine industry that manifesto seems barely credible here is someone who wants to invest where others have been losing their shirts where scared banks are calling the shots on highly leveraged operations where half of marlborough new zealand wines beating heart seems up for salethats the way foley likes ithe first came to this country in  intrigued by the quality of the new zealand wine he had tasted in california he started the trip in central otago and took in several wine regions in the wairarapa he found much to admire though not the journey over the rimutaka hill i much prefer to come in by chopper smitten by the ata rangi pinot noir  which remains his desert island new zealand pinot  martinboroughs aptitude for the grape excited him foleys goal now is for te kairanga to produce a pinot the equal of or better still superior to ata rangion that tour he stayed at wharekauhau for the first time loved it and idly thought what fun it would be to own the lodge with its accompanying sheep station he also talked to several wineries about investment possibilties his chequebook however never left his pocket he already had a wine foothold in california and was interested in establishing an annex in new zealand but bill foley was in no hurrythat changed after  that years monster vintage burdened new zealand wine with a massive oversupply while the global financial crisis added complex notes of its own once proud brands were relegated to discount bins the rush to get in had become a rush to get out the stage was set for foley to go bargain hunting some people say im cheap im always trying to find a value purchase and get some assets its a good time to buyfoleys own introduction to wine came in the mids relatively late in life a friend suggested they have a white burgundy and foley a wine ignoramus whose glass usually contained scotch or vodka found his interest piqued he began tasting talking and learning i knew nothing it was news to me that white burgundy was made from chardonnay and red burgundy from pinot noir a visit to burgundy followed and his interest spread to californian and eventually new zealand versions of those grape varietiesbesides his enjoyment of wine and a conviction that done properly it can make good business sense there are other reasons for foleys late midlife hes  sideways plunge into vats and vineyardshe was he says ready to move on from the businesses that had elevated him to the superrich categoryfidelity national financial inc fnf is a provider of title insurance a form of insurance commonplace in america that covers you in case something dodgy emerges in regard to the title of a property you own it was a small acorn when foley who was practising law at the time bought into it in  under foleys leadership he was ceo between  and  it burgeoned as the noted deal addict made one canny acquisition after the other it is now no  on the fortune  a list of americas largest companiesfor foleys part in  he was placed fourth on forbes magazines list of ceo compensation earning a total of usm nzm that year he remains chairman of fnfover the years his interests spread into other spheres generally they have been businesses that have weathered the recent global financial tempest wellin the mids when i was learning about wines i said im going to retire  the title business is kind of boring the markets no good and ive got to get my kids out of school in orange county    they were public schools and my kids werent learning anything so we moved to santa barbara thats where i got into the wine businessthe step from consumer to producer came in  when what was to evolve into foley family wines was formed and acquired a winery in the santa ynez valley in santa barbara countyas he gained experience in producing and selling wine he was beating an orderly retreat from other businessesthe big wine push began in  when further purchases came in rapid succession most of them have been made in californias glamour regions napa valley and sonoma and include cult brands such as chalk hill and merus by production volume he now ranks among the top  wine producers in the us in january foley was named man of the year for  by the american magazine wine enthusiasti love land foley cries gesturing to the open vista before wharekauhau beyond which the waters of palliser bay look typically restless its a happy cry a cry of liberation even i grew up on a cattle ranch in west texas i love wide open spaces    i love going in to the vineyards with our viticulturists and winemakers looking at the grapes    its a high for me i get immediate gratificationthe high of doing a successful business deal spikes up and then once youre done you have to find the next one in the wine business every day theres something to be done its a process and of course i get to be a deal guy toofamily is also a significant factor in the wine equation foley and his wife carol met in the late s when she was a united airlines flight attendant they were married  years ago near her hometown in the state of washington they had four children two boys two girls in rapid successionthey are a tight family and wine is bringing them closer one son rob runs the tasting room at chalk hill and foley is confident daughter courtney and the youngest patrick aka william p foley iii will take up roles with foley family winescourtney has been on the sales side at youngs market a west coast wine and spirit distributor i want to figure out a path for her im lobbying patrick to get that graduate diploma in oenology at lincoln then work harvests in new zealand trouble is hes got to learn how not to drink all the productmy kids are all workers none feel entitled but i want to make sure the people around them dont think theyre entitled they have to work their way up and learn the way everybody else doesa ring on bill foleys right hand gives a strong clue to the inner man its his class of  graduation ring from the storied army academy west pointfoley was a reluctant cadet he was in goofoff mode as the clock ran down on his senior year in high school and his father suggested he apply for a place in a military academy partly to irk his dad a career air force man foley replied i would only go to west point  thats where tough guys go he secretly hoped and expected he would never get in but an astonishing run of bad luck for those ahead of him on the waiting list saw him enter the gates of west point as a plebe freshman in the dream of most of the class was to be there i wasnt even interested once there i hated it all i wanted to do was get out but it was easier to stay than quit so i was in a group whose attitude was im here but im going to do everything i can to rebel and not do what they want me to doone compensation was military history a subject at which foley excelled a semester spent studying napoleon absorbed him later he would name one of his companies cannae after the clever strangling victory achieved by hannibal over rome in the second punic warafter west point he was spared the horrors of vietnam after failing a physical i couldnt fly because my eyes werent good enough thirty of his  classmates lost their lives in the conflict the others remain a close group i have great friends i can call any classmate anywhere and ask for something and theyll do it and id do the same for them its a fouryear bond thats hard to describe and my class was a very successful classwest point honed me it got me thinking the right way  how to lead guys into combat and make instant decisions i can prioritise i can multitask i do a good job of identifying a problem and seeing things in three dimensionsit also taught me how to delegate in my businesses i delegate people not only responsibility but also authority then people have to perform if they perform they survive they achieve and theyre rewarded so im all about teambuilding and letting people be masters of their own destiny west point taught me all that  but at the time i hated itfoley donates regularly and generously to west point he has done similarly to the republican party over the recent past though doesnt feel so inclined at present right now i really dont support much of anybody in politics im disgusted with all of themi tell him robertson and schaeffer his compatriots and confreres in new zealand wine investment have given generously to the arts in new zealand does he feel a similar philanthropic urge coming ongive me a while i would probably do something related to business maybe help with the business school at one of the universities i hate to say that because i know whats going to happen now  bill we just read about you and we have a naming opportunityfor bill foley you get
