financing equity crowd funding might work for you but if your idea is truly huge you may prefer to have professionals on your side heres why by barry schuler barry schuler is managing director for dfj growth and the former chairman and ceo of america online he is credited with being one of the pioneers of the modern internet bschuler managing director dfj growthbschuler  comments credit many entrepreneurs are excited about the prospect of raising capital via crowd equity courtesy of the jobs act successful crowdfunding sites such as kickstarter are already gearing up to broker the sale of your company’s equity much like they have helped launch companies by preselling new product ideas soon the drudgery of building a business plan and pitching your dreams to countless angels and venture capitalists will be replaced by a fresh pool of investors eager to rain money into the future googles and starbucks of the world  that all sounds terrific after all entrepreneurs have been bootstrapping companies with familyandfriends investments long before venture capitalists or any other institutional investors emerged from the primordial ooze in today’s world of social networks we all have dramatically extended connections why not keep it all in the family but as the old adage goes if it sounds too good to be true maybe there is a bit more to the story here are a few thoughts to ponder before considering this route moral obligation the instant you exchange equity for capital you have a moral obligation to do your very best to provide returns to investors no matter how you raise money even if your investors are faceless names you still owe them  dedication while a company that uses crowdfunding won’t have the kind of disclosure requirements public companies do at some level you will still have to keep stockholders in the loop fail to be proactive and you could have  investors calling you weekly for updates if things go badly and the overwhelming majority of startups fail you will have to handhold a bunch of grumpy people exactly at the moment you need handholding maybe it wont be as bad as having to face uncle moe at the thanksgiving table after smoking his  but as written the current jobs act would allow unsophisticated investors to buy your stock that translates into a heap of ongoing investor relations do you really want dumb money  institutional investors bring a level of professional structure you have to build a rational business plan and pass the scrutiny of an investment committee yes it is a big pain but getting some professional input can be quite valuable if ten seedstage investors give you a thumbs down it may be worth taking a step back and pondering if a snuggie for goldfish really is a brilliant idea it may be easier to raise crowd equity but it may not be the best path to ultimate success size matters it may be that crowd equity is perfect for smaller businesses that can get cashpositive based on an initial round of capital such as service businesses or restaurants but if you just invented the internetofeverything version of the mousetrap that tweets upon acquisition of the critter the traditional route might be better think about how big your idea can become and how much capital you will ultimately need then use that information as a filter if you are aiming big you will want professionals on your team follow on entrepreneurial success is a long windy and forked road great companies generally raise multiple rounds of capital sometimes a company has to change direction and needs to recapitalize even twitter began its life as an entirely different idea if a company does need fresh capital and can only raise it at a lower valuation the early investors can get very diluted maybe even wiped out venture capitalists are prepared to handle these situations how this will play out with crowd equity is unknown it could set the stage for the kind of shareholder suits commonly seen in public companies i am sure the “call saul” class of attorneys is already polishing up an ambulance for this one the next bubble we got the infamous dotcom bubble when retail investors bought into the initial public offerings of immature companies with little more than interesting ideas investment banks threw aside any modicum of discipline as they shoveled stock to a hungry public willing to bet without any business rationale we all know the outcome then congress set out to prevent this from happening again with a set of regulations known as sarbanesoxley the effect has been the death of microcap initial public offerings essentially expansion capital is now done largely in the private markets ironically the jobs act may set the stage for another scenario where the public gets sucked into the glamour of investing in big ideas without understanding the risk keep in mind that seed and earlystage venture investors preside over hundreds of company funerals for every big win it’s a very tough business as a growthstage investor i welcome unique new ways for companies to achieve critical mass how a great idea gets to growth stage is irrelevant as long as it is legal my message is very simple crowd equity is a brandnew untested concept it may be a boon for the many valid business ideas that don’t appeal to venture capitalists or it may be a boondoggle but if your idea has real chops and could potentially become an iconic company it may be worth it to avoid the new unknown “force” until we all discover who luke skywalker’s dad really is the opinions expressed here by inccom columnists
