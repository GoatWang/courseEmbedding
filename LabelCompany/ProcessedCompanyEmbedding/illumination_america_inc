sugarcube™ specs sugarcube™ lite specs sugarcube™ ultra specs microcube specs sugarcube™ cad drawings review product unsurpassed light intensity with led efficiency the sugarcube™ line of led fiber optic illuminators provides the highest intensity light for a variety of laboratory and technical needs each member of the cube family couples an exceptionally bright led with ushio’s powerful electronic driver circuitry for maximum light output the life of each led light source is equivalent to approximately  tungsten halogen bulbs allowing users to cut downtime and save thousands of dollars on bulb replacement the sugarcube™ line  a model for every application sugarcube™ standard  a high intensity led fiber optic illuminator available in white red nm blue nm and green nm sugarcube™ ultra  for the most demanding applications the sugarcube ultra is the most powerful led light engine available it replaces the previous sugarcube quad white model the output is  greater than the previous top of the line quad when using a mm llg please see the datasheet for specifics microcube  the microcube improves upon our sugarcube ultra model for light guides larger than mm diameter we have incorporated a pulse capability down to  microseconds with fast rise and fall times as well as a rear panel switch to select rising or falling edge triggers the microcube delivers industry leading flicker free light output and offers an expected led lifetime of up to  hours this new model offers significant reductions in both cost and size sugarcube™ lite  for lowcost highlumen output the sugarcube lite offers superior technology in a costeffective form factor its consumerfriendly pricing makes it ideal for many research and industrial uses the lite is available in bright white and can only be ordered from our website sugarcube™ multiwavelength solutions  we can connect multiple sugarcubes together to create a switchable multiwavelength system with a high output customization custom adapters can be created to meet your fiber optic requirements the wavelengths below are representative of some of the custom options available • nm • nm • nm • nm • nm • nm • nm •

radiant flux in milliwatts for the sugarcube ultra fiber optic light guide radiant flux mw ½” fiber bundle  mm liquid light guide llg  mm llg  the buttons on the front panel are not working  what should i domost likely the unit is in analog mode there is a button on the back of the unit to return it to front panel control i want to use a liquid light guide with the sugarcube ultra illuminator and am concerned about damage to the light guide do you have any experience using liquid light guides with that illuminatorif you are using a liquid light guide it should be fine with the sugarcube ultra we currently buy the sugarcube led illuminator from you and would like to know the thread of the screws that are used to affix the adapters to the frontall of our adapters use a  thread i am interested in buying a sugarcube and will be using it with a high frame rate camera i am concerned about variations in the intensity that might cause a ‘strobing effect’ with the camera please comment on the stability of the intensity of output over timethe sugarcube product is actually used frequently in high speed imaging applications due to its highintensity output and excellent stability while environmental factors will play a role in the stability we typically observe intensity stability of  under stable conditions we recommend allowing the sugarcube to warm up for  minutes to achieve this level of stability additionally one unique property about the sugarcube is that the led drive is dc current and not pulse width modulated pwm this offers a special advantage for high speed video as the light is not pulsed there is minimal ripple in the light and it has been shown to be flicker free at up to k frames per second fps i previously purchased the sugarcube quad from you is the ultra a direct replacementthe sugarcube ultra is a higher performance replacement for the quad it has the unique advantage of being able to couple large amounts of light into smaller light guides than the quad previously could due to the increased power density we recommend using high quality light guides such as fused fiber bundles liquid light guides etc what are the dimensions of the sugarcube can you provide a cad model of your sugarcubewe have a cad model of our sugarcube product located on the sugarcube page here     product applications aquarium av  photo cinema entertainment equipment
