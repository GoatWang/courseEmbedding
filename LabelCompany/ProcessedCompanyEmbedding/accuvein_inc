visualization technology report that they would be more likely to donate blood if this avoiding inadvertent arterial puncture though it is rare to puncture an artery in an attempt to cannulate a vein it does happen the brachial artery is located near the basilic vein and is one that is of importance since it is in an area that may be selected for venipuncture because arteries are deeper than veins these events the use of alcohol swabs how many times should an alcohol swab be used an alcohol swab should only be used once though alcohol is a disinfectant once the swab has been removed from its package it is no longer sterile it is important to use care while handling the swab and make sure only to use it on iv dwell times and phlebitis development this topic has been revisited several times by several outlets should ivs be left alone and not changed unless there is cause or reason to change them well a recent study attempted to link iv dwell times with phlebitis development and found the
