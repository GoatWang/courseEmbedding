freddie mac gses redwood trust residential mortgageback securities rmbs tig advisors redwood trust rwt and a few other players may have already emerged in the privatelabel residential mortgagebacked securities market but for now tig advisors – the overseer of the tig securitized asset fund – is comfortable investing in nonagency rmbs with a focus on bonds linked to mortgages originated before  the tig securitized asset fund just crossed its firstyear anniversary with its parent firm tig advisors now handling  billion in assets the fund specializes in securitized assets and is described as an actively traded longshort credit fund  right now  to  of the tig securitized asset fund is focused on nonagency rmbs while  to  is linked to cmbs the rest of the fund is comprised of assetbacked securities one of the firm’s founders david liu told housingwire  liu and tig show no signs of slowing down especially with privatelabel rmbs issuance still not robust enough to feed it in his interview with housingwire liu conveyed the impression that tig is very comfortable in finding an upside to legacy distressed mortgage securities the fund’s focus  legacy bonds issued before  – that are tied to subprime alta and prime mortgages he notes the focus on downgraded bonds that have a rich history dating back as far as 0 brings a definite upside considering the bonds are trading at a significant discount while investing in distressed bonds that have experienced some performance glitches over the years seems counterintuitive the fund has actually found its sweet spot given the age of many of the loans the market has created trillions of dollars of nonagency securities from 0 to ” he noted because of the housing crisis and the subprime crisis a lot of those bonds took significant losses and have been downgraded liu explained their value is clear – they come at a discount and are very seasoned given their age which means there is some price appreciation even if values did drop somewhat during the crash if you got a house in  and  you still have a few years of appreciation prior to the crash liu told housingwire so that gives you cushion in terms of the valuation we prefer these types of securities… they have a long history you have ten years of performance history if someone is making payments for  years you know he is going to most likely be making payments in the coming months liu admits the fund is always looking for opportunities and its leaders are watching the fannie mae freddie macrisk sharing deals closely since they were so well received the founder said being heavily invested in bonds tied to distressed residential home loans has another upside with the housing recovery now pushing the value of underlying collateral higher liu says this means homeowners are more likely to pay back the mortgage or make payments as values increase tig remains focused on this segment finding it beneficial for offering structural leverage tig simply
