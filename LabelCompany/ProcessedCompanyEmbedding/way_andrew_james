kenwood chef which is really on its last legs not only has it started sounding really rough when mixing but the paint has also flaked off all over and is generally in a poor state so im looking into buying a new mixer i quite often make a large volume of cakes  mixing batter for  cupcakes at a time is not unheard of  so the smaller kenwood prospero and patissier are out i also mix a lot of buttercream so need a good splashguard to stop the kitchen being covered in icing sugar ive come across the andrew james  litre version with a meat mincer attachment here and wondered if anyone has any experience of it and if so what you think of it thanks kevin glad you like it login  quick reply multiquote added quote multiquote added to spam report share on facebook share on twitter sorry

all thanked posts      th may   am      th may   am “ quick update i bought the mixer last sunday and it was delivered on tuesday brilliant service of course i got it out and had a look and it looked really good i had to fight the urge to invent things to bake so i could use it this morning however i made this loaf and used the machine it was easily able to cope with the kneading on full speed the machine did wobble about a bit but did not move from its spot on the worktop thanks to the suction fittings it is fairly noisy but not quite as bad as my old kenwood if had a couple of things from andrew james ie the halogen cooker and i couldnt fault them the loaf was delicious and rose wonderfully so i can only assume the machine did a very good job ill keep you updated aswhen i use it for other things kevin originally posted by kevie ” wow the bread looks really good i too been toying with the idea of getting a mixer like this good to see some good things being made with it  im being

bought the l little version about  months ago with no extra stuff like mincer etc just the stand mixer itself it is a bit noisy if you put it on high and the lifting mechanism has become a little stiff on mine however it does not affect its performance though ive made lots of bread with it kg of flour at a time and it copes just fine ive also used it to make sausage meat and it does the work beautifully saving me having to use my food processor as i previously did the metal flat beater does not come very close to the side but the flexi one does so its fine to use with batter i was toying with the idea of one day replacing it with kitchenaid when i can afford one but am now a bit unsure since the kitchenaid artisan is only w whilst this one is very powerful at w is the low wattage on the ka a problem at all hth glad you like it login  quick reply multiquote added quote multiquote added to spam report share on facebook share on twitter sorry there are currently no thanks for this

watts just refers to the amount of elec it needs to power the machine so theoretically the ka should be cheaper to run glad you like it login  quick reply multiquote added quote multiquote added to

scare to take the leap incase its not as good as it looks originally posted by missdee ” the mixer is fine well made  mixes to the edges of the bowl  very solid construction there was an odd smell the first couple of times i used it as the oil burned off but its been no trouble at all ive made breads  cakes  meringue allsorts of thingseverythings worked the bowl is not as big as the andrew james one was  but it does mix to the edgesand the dough hook actually mixes the dough rather than takes it on a tour of the bowlalso in the spirit of if im going to break it id better do it straight away i made over a kilo of bread doughand it surviveda kilo is obviously too much for the bowl size by the way oh and it looks gorgeous  im not sure its really good value for money  there are a lot of stand mixers on amazon for instance that have really good reviews the same functions and cost less this one for instance but not so prettyor amusing to own fight back  be happy glad you like it login  quick

thanks thesewingbird view public profile send private message find more posts view all thanked posts      th jan   pm not impressed      th jan   pm ive had my andrew james food mixer for just over  years it was my first food mixer i ever had i would say it was ok not something amazing but it did the job so i was happy after about  years it started to have problems when turning on the first speed it would not start working so i had to keep turning it up a speed until it starts and then turn back to speed  then it would work it was rather annoying but after a few months struggling with it the problem sorted out itself which was really bizarre but since everything was ok i kept using it up until recently it started to release black dust out from where the whiskbeater connects with the machine and eventually has stopped working altogether a bit disappointed really as now i have realized there is nowhere to find anyone to repair it as it is not well known brand i contacted aj customer services if they would advise on the repair its been a week since still waiting for their reply it doesnt look that they will though so considering the price it may be worth buying if you only need it occasionally but do consider aftercare i feel that i am facing to buy a new one and i dont think it will be andrew james again glad you like it login  quick reply multiquote added quote

more posts view all thanked posts      th feb   pm andrew james customer service      th feb   pm hi i just wanted to advise people that i have found the andrew james customer service to be very poor indeed i purchased one of their food processors which despite being only  months old developed a fault causing the cutting blade shaft to rub against the lid causing it to melt and contaminate the food in the bowl with plastic this was so extreme that a part originally attached to the internal shaft welded itself to the cutting tool despite this being a design fault reported by another users on amazon andrew james have blatantly refused to replace the parts damaged by the fault due to it being outside of their  month warranty they have been advised by myself and amazon of the eu directive that any consumer goods purchased in the eu has a full  year warranty under eu protection law yet they still refuse to replace the items but say that they would be willing to do so at a £ charge i think it says a lot about any company that it is prepared to defy eu legislation and loose a customer for the sake of what profit they are likely to make from selling the £ parts personally i wouldnt have another andrew james product i would suggest that anyone considering any of their products researches the customer feedback if anyone else has had similar issues with their multifunction processor please get in touch glad you like it login  quick reply multiquote added quote multiquote added to spam report share on facebook share on twitter users saying thanks  toulouse laplot posts

about buying andrew james      nd apr   am i bought and andrew james l stand mixer an andrew james hand mixer and an andrew james ice maker each broke down in a matter of months the stand mixer was replaced about  months ago the hand mixer replaced  months ago and the ice machine replaced  months ago now each has broken down again but the company is refusing to repair or replace them because they say the warranty applies to the original transaction not to the item thus all three are out of warranty their products are obviously of such appalling quality that they refuse to take any

pouring out the machine  a horrible noise started the machine got so hot i couldnt even touch it they say because its over a year old they can not do anything for me other than a small discount on a

as a chef and food writer i often get asked to review kitchen equipment most of which i turn down due my schedule i was asked however to review the  litre stand food mixer about  months ago i am very careful what i say in a review because i want my word and opinion to count for something i have used the mixer for the last  months to make bread cakes pastry mousses batters souffles ice creams and more and have found it to be a very good mixer especially for the price pluses it now comes with a  year guarantee large capacity well made looks good on the counter whisk is a lot sturdier than most more expensive models turns all the food when mixing is stable and has suckers to help keep it in place on your counter powerful motor for the price reliable no problems in  months of use and remember im a chef minuses it will sit on all standard counter tops but because of its height it is better to place it were there are no wall mounted cupboards above so you can easily lift the whiskbeater blade when you have finished mixing some say it is noisy but when i tested against other  litre mixers i found it to be about the same remember a  litre mixer is a serious bit of kitchen kit conclusions not everyone will want a mixer this big but if you do a lot of baking its a great piece of kit for the money i still have an old kenwood km which i have had for  years this model is not just a mixer but also a food processor liquidiser and juicer having a small kitchen a multifunctional piece of kit makes a lot of sense trouble is to the best of my knowledge no one makes anything like this now i guess why buy one kitchen gadget when the makers can sell you  glad you like it login  quick reply multiquote added quote multiquote added to spam report share on facebook share on

this is what we bought the mixer for we have been very disappointed as andrew james the manufacturer despite receiving photos descriptions etc delivered the wrong part  times  st time to the wrong
