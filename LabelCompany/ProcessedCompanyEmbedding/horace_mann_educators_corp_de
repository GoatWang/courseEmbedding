form only if        dtc notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for that global security and we do not appoint a successor depositary within  days after receiving that notice        at any time dtc ceases to be a clearing agency registered or in good standing under the securities exchange act of  as amended or other applicable statute or regulation and we do not appoint a successor depositary within  days after becoming aware that dtc has ceased to be registered as a clearing agency or        we determine that that global security will be exchangeable for definitive securities in registered form and notifies the trustee of its decision a global security that can be exchanged as described in the preceding sentence will be exchanged for definitive securities issued in authorized denominations in registered form for the same aggregate amount the definitive securities will be registered in the names of the owners of the beneficial interests in the global security as directed by dtc    table of contents we will make principal and interest payments on all debt securities represented by a global security to the paying agent which in turn will make payment to dtc or its nominee as the case may be as the sole registered owner and the sole holder of the debt securities represented by a global security for all purposes under the indenture accordingly we the trustee and any paying agent will have no responsibility or liability for        any aspect of dtc s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a debt security represented by a global security and        any other aspect of the relationship between dtc and its participants or the relationship between those participants and the owners of beneficial interests in a global security held through those participants or the maintenance supervision or review of any of dtc s records relating to those beneficial ownership interests dtc has advised us that its current practice is to credit participants accounts on each payment date with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of such global security as shown on dtcs records upon dtcs receipt of funds and corresponding detail information the underwriters or agents for the debt securities represented by a global security will initially designate the accounts to be credited payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in a global security will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices as is the case with securities held for customer accounts registered in street name and will be the sole responsibility of those participants bookentry notes may be more difficult to pledge because of the lack of a physical note dtc so long as dtc or its nominee is the registered owner of a global security dtc or its nominee as the case may be will be considered the sole owner and holder of the debt securities represented by that global security for all purposes of the debt securities owners of beneficial interests in the debt securities will not be entitled to have debt securities registered in their names will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the debt securities in definitive form and will not be considered owners or holders of debt securities under the indenture accordingly each person owning a beneficial interest in a global security must rely on the procedures of dtc and if that person is not a dtc participant on the procedures of the participant through which that person owns its interest to exercise any rights of a holder of debt securities the laws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of the securities in certificated form these laws may impair the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a global security beneficial owners may experience delays in receiving distributions on their debt securities since distributions will initially be made to dtc and must then be transferred through the chain of intermediaries to the beneficial owners account we understand that under existing industry practices if we request holders to take any action or if an owner of a beneficial interest in a global security desires to take any action which a holder is entitled to take under the indenture then dtc would authorize the participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to take that action and those participants would authorize the beneficial owners owning through such participants to take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them beneficial interests in a global security will be shown on and transfers of those ownership interests will be effected only through records maintained by dtc and its participants for that global security the conveyance of notices and other communications by dtc to its participants and by its participants to owners of beneficial interests in the debt securities will be governed by arrangements among them subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements in effect dtc has advised us that it is a limitedpurpose trust company organized under the new york banking law a banking organization within the meaning of the new york

with terms calculated to delay defer or prevent a change in control of us or to make it more difficult to remove our management for example a business combination could be impeded by issuing a series

market price of our common stock although our board of directors is required to make any determination to issue any preferred stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of our stockholders

after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions where there is an overallotment option in determining the source of securities to close out the short position an underwriter will consider among other things the price of securities available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase securities through the overallotment option if an underwriter sells more securities than could be covered by the overallotment option a naked short position the position can only be closed out by buying securities in the open market a naked short position is more likely to be created if an underwriter is concerned that there could be downward pressure on the price of the securities in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering        penalty bids permit representatives to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the securities originally sold by the
