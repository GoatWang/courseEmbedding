this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions which we could change in our discretion in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve due to the many variables inherent to the development of our drug candidates at this time such as the timing of patient enrollment and evolving regulatory requirements we cannot currently predict the stage of development we expect to achieve for our preclinical and clinical trial and drug candidates with the net proceeds of this offering we expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes such as acquiring the commercial rights to other drug products and expanding our research organization and infrastructure the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors including the results of the preclinical and clinical trial of our drug candidates our operating costs and expenditures and the amount of cash generated by our operations as a result our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering pending these uses we intend to invest the net proceeds in highquality investmentgrade shortterm fixed income instruments innovation platform competition the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive while we believe that our highly selective drug candidates experienced development team and chemistryfocused scientific approach provide us with competitive advantages we face potential competition from many different sources including major pharmaceutical specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing drugs andor new drugs that may become available in the future we compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical biotechnology and other related markets that address inhibition of kinases in cancer and immunological diseases there are other companies working to develop targeted therapies in the field of kinase inhibition for cancer and immunological diseases these companies include divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies of various sizes we also compete with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that develop and market monoclonal antibodies as targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer and immunological diseases many of our competitors either alone or with their strategic partners have substantially greater financial technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drug candidates obtaining regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products accordingly our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance our competitors drugs may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold than any drug we may commercialize and may render our drug candidates obsolete or noncompetitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our drug candidates we anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available below is a summary of existing therapies and therapies currently under development that may become available in the future which may compete with each of our seven clinicalstage drug candidates savolitinib while there are currently no approved selective cmet inhibitors on the market there are several cmet inhibitors currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma nonsmall cell lung cancer and gastric cancer such as capmatinib cmet inhibitor in development for renal cell carcinoma and nonsmall cell lung cancer cabozantinib vegfrcmetret inhibitor in development for renal cell carcinoma and nonsmall cell lung cancer tivantinib cmet inhibitor in development for nonsmall cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma tepotinib cmet inhibitor in development for nonsmall cell lung cancer foretinib vegfrcmet inhibitor in development for renal cell carcinoma glesatinib cmet and axl tyrosine kinase inhibitor in development for nonsmall cell lung cancer and amg  cmet kinase inhibitor in development for stomach cancer xalkori alk and cmet inhibitor marketed for nonsmall cell lung cancer is a multikinase inhibitor that less selectively inhibits cmet fruquintinib approved vegf inhibitors on the market for the treatment of colorectal cancer include avastin antivegf monoclonal antibody cyramza antivegfr monoclonal antibody stivarga vegfrtie inhibitor and zaltrap zivaflibercept vegf inhibitor cyramza is approved for the treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer and gastric cancer and avastin is also approved for nonsmall cell lung cancer in addition inlyta and caprelsa vandetanib use a similar mechanism of action as the vegf inhibitors on the market and are currently being studied for the treatment of colorectal cancer other vegfr inhibitors being developed for the treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer include anlotinib apatinib cabozantinib lenvatinib lucitanib tesevatinib and vandetanib vegfr inhibitors being developed for the treatment of gastric cancer include dovitinib telatinib and regorafenib in china apatinib has been approved for the treatment of thirdline gastric cancer sulfatinib sutent vegfr inhibitor and afinitor mtor inhibitor have been approved for the treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors lanreotide is a growth hormone release inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors both small molecules and monoclonal antibodies are being developed for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors compounds undergoing development for neuroendocrine tumors include vargatef nintedanib a tyrosine kinase inhibitor octreotide growth hormone and insulinlike growth factor inhibitor approved for neuroendocrine tumors milciclib tyrosine kinase inhibitor and zybrestat fosbretabulin a microtubuletubulin inhibitor being studied for thyroid cancer cometriq cabozantinib a cmetvegfrret inhibitor has been marketed for thyroid cancer and is being studied for neuroendocrine tumors in addition bevacizumab is an antivegf monoclonal antibody being studied for neuroendocrine tumors hmpl there has been extensive research on oral smallmolecule syk inhibitors due to the major unmet medical need in inflammation and oncology no small molecule drug candidates targeting syk specifically have been approved to date due to the severe offtarget toxicity as a result of poor kinase selectivity and possibly poor pharmacokinetic properties gs is a syk inhibitor currently in clinical studies for rheumatoid arthritis syk inhibitors currently in clinical studies for hematological cancers include entospletinib cerdulatinib and tak in addition janus tyrosine kinase or jak inhibitors such as tofacitinib jak inhibitor marketed for rheumatoid arthritis and in development for ulcerative colitis crohns disease and myelofibrosis ruxolitinib jak inhibitor marketed for myelofibrosis and in development for acute myelogenous leukemia baricitinib jak inhibitor in development for rheumatoid arthritis decernotinib jak inhibitor in development for rheumatoid arthritis and filgotinib jak inhibitor in development for rheumatoid arthritis and tnf† inhibitors marketed for rheumatoid arthritis such as enbrel remicade humira and cimzia are also expected to be potential competitors of hmpl if it is approved however most antitnf† monoclonal antibodies are applicable for severe disease only as these injectables significantly suppress the entire immune system for a substantial period of time epitinib although no egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been specifically approved for nonsmall cell lung cancer with brain metastasis or primary brain tumor many have been approved for the treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer with egfr activating mutations including gilotrif egfrher inhibitor iressa tarceva and conmana moreover tesevatinib egfrhervegfr kinase inhibitor and azd efgr tyrosine kinase inhibitor are in development for the treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer with brain metastasis while alecensa alectinib an alk inhibitor has already been approved theliatinib approved efgr inhibitors on the market include iressa and tarceva although these drugs reach insufficient drug concentrations to suppress wildtype egfr effectively in addition monoclonal antibodies such as erbitux which are approved for the treatment of certain egfr overexpression tumor types are less effective for egfr gene amplified patients other small molecule therapies currently being studied for the treatment of esophageal tumors include gilotrif and conmana hmpl pik† zydelig is a pik† inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of refractoryrelapsed follicular lymphoma small lymphocytic lymphoma as a monotherapy and chronic lymphatic leukemia in combination with rituxan in addition several drug candidates that inhibit pik† are in clinical development including duvelisib copanlisib gedatolisib incb gs tgr and amg  hmpl fgfr to date there are no approved therapies that specifically target the fgfr signaling pathway several small molecule fgfr tyrosine kinase inhibitors are in early clinical trials for solid tumors including azd bgj bay blu and jnj hmpl the current standard of care for inflammatory bowel disease starts with mesalazine while for the nonresponding patients various forms of corticosteroids and immunosuppressant drugs and antitumor necrosis factor agents are prescribed several antitnf† monoclonal antibody injectables such as cimzia humira remicade and simponi golimumab abandoned in phase i for crohns disease have been approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and crohns disease however most antitnf† monoclonal antibodies are applicable for severe disease only as these injectables significantly suppress the entire immune system for a substantial period of time commercial platform competition our commercial platforms prescription drugs business competes in the pharmaceutical industry in china which is highly competitive and is characterized by a number of established large pharmaceutical companies as well as some smaller emerging pharmaceutical companies the top  domestic pharmaceutical manufacturers only accounted for  of total pharmaceutical sales in  according to frost  sullivan our prescription drugs business faces competition from other pharmaceutical companies in china engaged in the development production marketing or sales of prescription drugs in particular cardiovascular drugs the barrier of entry for the prc pharmaceutical industry primarily relates to regulatory requirements in connection with the production of pharmaceutical products and new product launches the identities of the key competitors with respect to our prescription drugs business vary by product and in certain cases different competitors that have greater financial resources than us may elect to focus these resources on developing importing or inlicensing and marketing products in the prc that are substitutes for our products and may have broader sales and marketing infrastructure with which to do so we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition pricing sales network promotion activities product efficacy safety and reliability we believe our continued success will depend on our prescription drugs businesss capability to maintain profitability of its core product she xiang bao xin pills successfully market and distribute inlicensed products such as seroquel and concor obtain and maintain regulatory approvals develop drug candidates with market potential maintain an efficient operational model apply technologies to production lines attract and retain talented personnel maintain high quality standards and effectively market and promote the products sold by our prescription drugs business within the coronary heart disease market in china in  she xiang bao xin pills had approximately  market share and market leadership in shanghai with approximately  market share among oral chinese patented drugs key competitors for she xiang bao xin pills include tasly holding compound danshen dropping pill and shijiazhuang yiling pharmaceutical tong xin luo capsule according to frost  sullivan in addition our prescription drugs businesss inlicensed drug seroquel had approximately  market share of the chinese market for schizophrenia and bipolar drugs in  with key competitors including hunan dongting pharma and suzhou first pharma according to frost  sullivan our commercial platforms consumer health business competes in a highly fragmented market in asia particularly in our primary market in china we believe that our consumer health business competes primarily on the basis of brand recognition pricing sales network promotion activities product safety and reliability we believe our continued success will depend on our consumer health businesss capability to maintain profitability of its core products fu fang dan shen tablets and banlangen granules differentiate its products visavis those of competitors successfully market and distribute inlicensed products such as earths best infant formula maintain an efficient operational model attract and retain talented personnel maintain high quality standards and effectively market and promote the products sold by our consumer health business in china fu fang dan shen tablets and banlangen granules are generic overthecounter drugs marketed by several manufacturers hutchison baiyunshan is the market leader in these two particular subcategories with an estimated market share of approximately  for fu fang dan shen tablets and  for banlangen granules in  according to frost  sullivan key competitors include shanghai leiyunshang pharmaceutical yunnan baiyao and beijing tongrentang in the fu fang dan shen market and include beijing tongrentang and guangzhou xiangxue pharmaceutical for the banlangen market company description we are an innovative biopharmaceutical company based in china aiming to become a global leader in the discovery development and commercialization of targeted therapies for oncology and immunological diseases we have created a broad portfolio of drug candidates targeting eight molecular targets we have taken a chemistryfocused approach to develop highly selective small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are intended to have potentially global bestinclass efficacy and are deliberately engineered to improve drug exposure reduce known classrelated toxicities and allow different drug therapies to be combinable highlights of our pipeline include • seven clinicalstage drug candidates five of which have already achieved proofofconcept meaning positive outcome achieved in phase ibii studies with multiple potential global firstinclass or breakthrough therapy opportunities which means that such drug candidates could be eligible for accelerated approval by the us food and drug administration or the fda • out of these seven drug candidates four are wholly owned and three are partnered with leading pharmaceutical companies astrazeneca ab publ or astrazeneca eli lilly trading shanghai company limited or eli lilly and nestlé health science sa or nestlé health science •  active clinical trials in various countries with a further five planned to start during the first quarter of  • three phase iii clinical trials currently enrolling with a fourth expected to start during the first quarter of  and • subject to favorable clinical outcomes savolitinib has the potential to be submitted for new drug application or nda approval in late  in the united states and fruquintinib has the potential to be submitted for nda approval in late  or early  in china we believe our current drug candidates such as savolitinib targeting cmet and hmpl targeting syk have the potential to be global firstinclass therapies or as in the cases of fruquintinib targeting vegfr sulfatinib targeting vegfrfgfr epitinib targeting egfrm with brain metastasis and hmpl targeting pik† are sufficiently differentiated to potentially be global bestinclass next generation therapies with a superior profile compared to existing approved drugs that act against the relevant kinase targets kinases are a class of proteins and enzymes that function in many signaling pathways and have been shown to drive several key activities of cancer cells including growth survival and angiogenesis innovation platform—our pipeline of drug candidates has been developed and progressed by our inhouse research and development division known as our innovation platform which was launched in  since then we have assembled a leading drug research and development team of  scientists and staff based in china of which  have advanced technical degrees including  mds and  doctorate degrees as of january   this team has created a large scale and fullyintegrated drug discovery and development operation covering chemistry biology pharmacology toxicology chemistry and manufacturing controls for clinical and commercial supply clinical and regulatory and other functions which work seamlessly together we intend to continue to leverage this platform to produce investigational new drug or ind applications on drug candidates with global potential commercial platform—since  we have also developed a profitable commercial platform with the key element being our prescription drugs business which had a commercial network of over  medical sales representatives covering over   hospitals in  cities and towns in china as of january   we operate our prescription drugs business through our joint ventures shanghai hutchison pharmaceuticals and hutchison sinopharm in which we nominate management and run the daytoday operations the second element of our commercial platform is our consumer health business which focuses primarily on the manufacture marketing and distribution of overthecounter pharmaceutical products in china net income attributable to our company from the continuing operations of our commercial platform grew by  from  million in  to  million in  and further grew by  to  million in  we intend to leverage this commercial platform particularly our established prescription drugs business to support the launch of products from our innovation platform if they are approved for use in china outside of china we intend to commercialize our products if approved in the united states europe and other major markets on our own andor through partnerships with leading biopharmaceutical companies our history—our company was founded in  by hutchison whampoa limited which recently became a wholly owned subsidiary of ck hutchison holdings limited or ck hutchison which is a hong kongbased multinational conglomerate with operations in over  countries ck hutchison is the ultimate parent company of hutchison healthcare holdings limited which as of the date of this prospectus owns  of our total outstanding share capital we have taken a multisource approach to fund our innovation platform including through equity fundraising such as our initial public offering on the aim market of the london stock exchange in  partnering certain of our drug candidates utilizing cashflow generated from our commercial platform and bank borrowings some of which have been guaranteed by hutchison whampoa limited a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from our operations in china in particular from our commercial platform under chinas existing foreign investment and foreign
