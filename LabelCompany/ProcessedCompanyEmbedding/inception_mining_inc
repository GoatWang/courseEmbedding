announces the acquisition of clavo rico ltd oct    et from inception mining inc salt lake city oct   prnewswire  inception mining inc otc qb imii inception or the company is pleased to announce the acquisition of clavo rico ltd a privately held turks and caicos limited company pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated august   and addendum dated august   articles of merger were filed on october   and as a result clavo rico has merged with a subsidiary of inception and has become a whollyowned subsidiary of inception  inceptions officers will retain management control of the combined company and inception will continue implementing operational changes and control over the clavo rico operations      clavo rico ltds principal mining operations in honduras central america now operate as a whollyowned subsidiary of the company having positive revenue and significant resources  its mining concessions include several historical underground operations dating back to the early mayan era and the spanish occupation   the operating entity is engaged in processing a historical tailings  gpt body along with several open pit    gpt ore bodies utilizing a new  ton membranelined leach system and adr recovery plant  processing had increased to  oz per month prior to the last rain season at which time the company elected to install a new crushing circuit allowing for a planned increase in production of up to  ozs per month  expected production costs at this level are targeted at less than oz  the installation of a new cone crusher has allowed full production to resume   new ore bodies associated with the purchase have been preliminarily mapped and drilled preparatory to an expanded  reserve analysis and sufficient to begin mine planning leading to a  major expansion of operations the acquisition includes lands and equipment of the current mining operations and primary concession along with the rights to proceed with exploration and exploitation on the additional concessions  our team will focus on bringing those new bodies to production within the next two years and will also embark on a comprehensive mapping of the additional concessions michael ahlin the companys ceo stated in todays tumultuous resource market survival requires revenue and production cost control and superior ore grades coupled with very focused well thought out exploration programs the clavo rico acquisition fits that model  we are very fortunate to be able to couple a proven operation with our existing near production operation in idaho  the merger of our entities provides for a synergistic coupling of assets and structure that will allow us to grow and continue our expansion goals  clavo rico executive management has agreed to board positions and to remain available as needed to effect the transition  inception management will be retained to manage the combined operations the company also currently owns and operates the up and burlington patented mining claims near salmon idaho  the claims are a historicallyproven operation with a surface exposed vein of highgrade ore that allowed immediate access with minimal overburden removal  in  the company secured all necessary permitting completed access roads and improved all onsite roads necessary to complete phase one of its bulk sampling program and opening one of the historical adits  the companys  operations have been temporarily halted pending completion of the aboveannounced merger about inception mining inc                 we are a minerals resource company engaged in the
