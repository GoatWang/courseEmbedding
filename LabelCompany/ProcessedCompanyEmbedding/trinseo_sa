plastics including various specialty and technologically differentiated products tse has leading market positions in many of the markets in which it competes tse believes it has developed these strong market positions due to its technological differentiation diverse global manufacturing base longstanding customer relationships commitment to sustainable solutions and competitive cost positions tse believes that growth in overall consumer spending and construction activity increased demand in the automotive industry for higher fuel efficiency and lighterweight materials and improving living standards in emerging markets will result in growth in the global markets in which tse competes in addition tse believes its increasing business presence in developing regions such as china southeast asia latin america and eastern europe further enhances its prospects tse develops emulsion polymers and plastics products that are incorporated into a wide range of its customers products throughout the world including tires and other products for automotive applications carpet and artificial turf backing coated paper and packaging board food service packaging appliances medical devices consumer

indonesia and brazil additionally as of march   tse operated  research and development rd facilities globally including mini plants development centers and pilot coaters which tse believes are critical to its global presence and innovation capabilities seasonality quarterly results of operations are subject to fluctuations due to the seasonality of the business seasonal changes and weather conditions typically affect the construction and building materials end markets in particular sales volumes for construction and building materials generally rise in the warmer months and generally decline during the colder months of fall and winter abnormally cold or wet seasons may cause reduced purchases from our construction and building materials customers and therefore adversely affect our financial results however because seasonal weather patterns are difficult to predict tse cannot accurately estimate fluctuations in quarterly construction and building materials sales in any given year because of the seasonality of the business results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year dividend policy no dividends are planned intellectual property tse owns over  patents and has over  pending patent applications in various jurisdictions throughout the world covering processes and technology such as material formulations material process technology and various enduse industrial applications for its materials competition tses principal competitors in its synthetic rubber segment include asahi kasei corporation jsr corporation lanxess ag zeon corporation versalis spa and synthos sa in its synthetic rubber segment tse competes primarily based on its ability to offer
