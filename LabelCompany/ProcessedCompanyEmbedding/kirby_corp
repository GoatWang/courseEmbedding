sexual assault  fraud and rico  actions against unauthorized dealers  notes  references historyedit kirby sentria chrome edition the first kirby vacuums were designed by james b kirby – for george scott and carl fetzer after world war i although the kirby name was not used on a vacuum cleaner until the s james kirby invented the vacuette circa  and their primary competitors were the hoover company and the eureka company which both began operations in  and bissell who originally built carpet sweepers beginning in  the vacuette electric introduced in  with its removable floor nozzle and handle became the forerunner of todays multiattachment kirby vacuum models in  the company introduced the kirby model c the first product to carry jim kirbys name the vacuette was also briefly offered without an electric motor utilizing a springloaded worm gear driven by pulling the vacuum cleaner backwards then when pushing the machine forward the worm gear would power a turbine that provided the suction needed it was designed for rural areas that didnt have electricity and was very similar to the carpet sweeper while competitors have changed the orientation of the motor their products appearance materials used in construction and other features over the years kirby has remained with the original machines design materials used and functionality with enhancements added to aide in its operation and durability the company changes the appearance with revised color schemes and introduces new model names while keeping the core technology intact in  input from kirby distributors dealers management and customers guided kirby engineers in developing the kirby classic this ushered in the second generation models and was an instant success with soaring sales forcing the company to expand its manufacturing facilities outside of cleveland for the first time in  kirby west began operations in andrews texas at  nw  street the facility doubled the companys manufacturing capabilities the company did maintain a presence in canada at  burns street east in whitby which is no longer staffed berkshire hathaway bought kirby parent scott fetzer in  for  million two years prior ivan boesky had offered to buy scott fetzer for  a share or  million warren buffett has singled out scott fetzer to berkshires shareholders as the prototype for the kind of company — and acquisition — he was interested in according to berkshire managers absolutely no changes were made to the existing scott fetzer business or management and the entire business and its jet was preserved as of  kirby is the largest source of revenue and profit for scott fetzer with approximately  sales per year about a third of which are outside the united states in  scott fetzer sold the vacuums to about  factory distributors who in turn sell the vacuums doortodoor as an incentive to new customers kirby offers the service center vacuum rebuild program for original owners who have been registered with the company as long as the customer owns the machine as the registered owner if the cleaner needs repair they can send it back to the rebuild department and have it restored to “like new” condition the company will completely disassemble it repair or replace any worn kirby parts and sandblast polish and buff metal parts back to a shiny “new” appearance internal components are also thoroughly inspected and repaired with kirby replacement parts so that it will perform as originally designed kirby unit modelsedit a kirby g upright vacuum cleaner the kirby company generally produces only one model at a time kirbys vacuums made until  were made by frantz premier those made from  to  are branded and made by the scott  fetzer company after  all machines have been made by scott  fetzer though branded as kirby from  through the s continuous improvements and refinements were made to the kirby home care system one of the popular selling points is that it can be easily configured into a canister vacuum hand portable vacuum air pump floor polisher and more it can also be converted into a shampoo system for carpets and a sweeping dusting and mopping system for bare floors  the characteristic chrome appearance is due to the bulk of the machine is assembled from aluminum a tradition going back to the very early days of manufacture beginning in the s the generation series ushered in a new platform for the cleaner the addition of techdrive variable power assist eliminated  of the effort required to move the unit back and forth the current model the avalir continues the tradition that converts the vacuum into several different units beginning with the model  in  with most vacuum cleaner models the rubber drive belt that powers the brush bar an integral component with most modern machines remains in place and is only examined when it breaks vacuum attachments are available on other machines but dont require the drive belt to be disconnected kirby attachments are connected to the power unit and disconnecting the drive belt is usually involved in the process that add to its flexibility one of the key procedures for using a kirby vacuum is the correct way to adjust the carpet nozzle for the best possible results starting with the  model c to the most current machine the instruction manual states that the carpet nozzle should be gradually lowered into position with the toetouch latch incrementally adjusting the rug nozzle until the rotating vibrating brush establishes contact and the sound of the motor changes indicating suction has been achieved with the introduction of the model  the power switch was relocated from the top of the handle to the motor itself so the handle could be removed and the machine converted to a portable unit with a shoulder strap so that cleaning in difficult areas could be performed and the machine converted into a canistertype cleaner with a long hose attached to the front for dusting tasks starting with the model  adjusting the carpet nozzle employed what kirby called triple cushioned vibration rug cleaning action this involved briefly lifting the carpet up off the floor with the significant suction created by the machine thereby cushioning the area to be cleaned off of the floor while the rotating vibrating brush separated the carpet fibers thereby removing the embedded dirt and rejuvenating the carpet fibers earlier methods instructed that the carpet nozzle must maintain contact with the surface of the carpet utilizing the suction while later instruction manuals recommended the nozzle be slightly above with only the brush establishing contact and improving airflow around the surface being cleaned for delicate surfaces the drive belt that spins the brush can be detached so that only suction is used when the heritage model was introduced in  the brush performance indicator light was installed in the top of the carpet nozzle which consisted of magnets and a copper wire installed in the rotating vibrating brush a small led bulb would light up when the brush was spinning if the light appeared to blink or wasnt illuminated it meant the brush wasnt rotating at the desired speed and that the nozzle needed to be adjusted up or signifying that an inspection of the drive belt was needed collection and disposal of the dirt has also changed over the years but one component has remained called the saniemtor this is a component attached to the discharge tube leading away from the vacuum turbine chamber where the suction is created earlier versions used a dense duvetyne and later corduroy cotton fabric bag where the dirt lint and other debris collected allowing airflow to pass through and clean the air the sani emtor trapped heavier material in the bottom where a lid could be removed and the dirt disposed the cotton bag also has an integrated cleaning pocket within called the sanipocket introduced in  with the sanitronic where embedded dirt could be dislodged from the interior surface of the bag while keeping the dirt contained inside starting with the tradition model an internal disposable paper bag was introduced optionally in addition to the cotton cloth bag so that customers could decide which method they preferred when the generation  was introduced in  the only method of dirt collection was the disposable paper bag and was later labeled micron magic with the model g which can trap particles larger than three microns versatility has also been a marketing feature being able to configure the machine for various tasks the attachments available have come and gone over the years but some of the more popular ones remain available today a floor buffer attachment and bare floor dusting pad were introduced with the model c along with a handheld paint spray gun and upholstery shampoo dispenser called the sudsogun powered by attaching the hose to the turbine discharge tube have remained a carpet shampoo attachment called the rug renovator appeared with the dual sanitronic  in  another unusual attachment called the handibutler introduced with the model  used the turbine shaft at the front to power several devices offered as convenience features that could sharpen knives a cable could also be attached to a wire brush to remove rust from various surfaces along with a lambs wool polishing disk and a flannel buffing pad for more delicate tasks the handibutler was last offered with the tradition model and was replaced by the turbo sander with the legend model the turbo sander was equipped with a small turbine inside the device powered by the suction through the attachment hose which can accommodate various grades of sand paper scrubbing pads and a soft vinyl pad to be used as a massage unit that is still currently available during the mids with the popularity of deep shag carpeting a rake attachment called the shag king was attached in front of the carpet nozzle to lift the fibers while cleaning the carpet offered only on the classic omega classic iii and the tradition models another original attachment offered with the model c called the crystalator could be used to fumigate closets for insects and moths using moth balls which was no longer available with the legend model in the late s first generation edit model names start with the c followed by the c c  introduction of magic finger belt lifter for carpet nozzle removal              sanitronic vii dual sanitronic  introduction of twospeed motor for hose attachment and the rug renovator shampoo system ending with the dual sanitronic  second generation edit

presentedit model names start with the generation  first introduction of techdrive power assist followed with the g g gsix g g ultimate g ultimate g diamond edition sentria sentria ii ending with the avalir other unitsedit kirby ventured into small portable handheld units by reviving the vacuette in the s then later producing the battery powered split second for small or light duty cleaning which are powered by a v dc plug that runs in automobile cigarette lighters in the s they also briefly offered a commercial model called the comvac in three sizes called the   and the  they were very basic and didnt come with the additional attachments or the shiny chrome appearance which are no longer sold sales practiceedit since  new kirby home care systems have only been sold through inhome demonstrations by independent authorized kirby distributors the kirby company manufactures the unit and sells it to a group of authorized distributors each distributor is an independent business and as such sets their own price for the unit and conducts their own business operations independent distributors recruit dealers who are also independent contractors the dealers sell the unit doortodoor and are generally compensated only through commission criticism of marketing and sales practicesedit the practices of some of kirbys independent distributors have been subject to criticism the kirby is included by lon l fuller and melvin a eisenberg professors of contract law at harvard law school and uc berkeley school of lawcolumbia law school as a textbook example of unconscionability kirby has been subject to relentless criticism by consumer protection agencies as of  of the  state consumer protection agencies  had received a total of more than  complaints in just a few years between  and  the wisconsin department of agriculture trade and consumer protection received  complaints regarding kirby dealers and concluded from its investigation that kirby through its distributors engaged in a statewide pattern of trade practices violation of state consumerprotection laws many of the complaints involve older customers who lack the will to stand up to grueling sales pitches the wall street journal records examples where an elderly couple was unable to remove three kirby salesmen from their home for over five hours in another example a disabled woman who had been living alone in a mobile home on month in social security payments and suffering from alzheimers disease was discovered to own two kirby vacuum cleaners having paid  for the second one in  the florida agriculture and consumer services commissioner obtained  in refunds for  senior citizens according to the wall street journal the device costs more than four times what other topoftheline vacuum cleaners do kirby compares the price difference to that between luxury and economy cars yet luxurycar dealers dont make house calls in trailer parks but kirby dealers do the kirby vacuum cleaner is marketed exclusively doortodoor — often to people who can ill afford a  gadget but succumb to the sales pitch nonetheless in  the west virginia attorney general obtained more than  in refunds and credits for dissatisfied kirby buyers in  abcs primetime conducted a hiddencamera investigation in response to more than a thousand complaints regarding kirbys salespeople in june  the arizona attorney general filed suit against kirby distributors for violations of the telemarketing and consumer fraud and abuse prevention act seeking an injunction against any other home sales public authorities flooded with complaints about kirby vacuum cleaners is not a recent phenomenon even in the s and s kirby had been cited by various agencies a number of times and the detroit better business bureau had received so many complaints that it decided to turn the matter over to the wayne county prosecutor kirby asserts it is not liable from actions of its sales force whom it holds out as independent contractors its distributor code of ethics enumerates  principles including observe the highest standards of character honesty and integrity in dealings with my customers fellow distributors and other members of the kirby profession kirby also teaches its distributors directsales laws and requires them to resolve complaints within  hours under threat of termination litigationedit between  and  in alabama alone more than  lawsuits were filed against kirby and its affiliates and subsidiaries resulting in nearly  million in judgements and settlements twelve distributors of kirby vacuums in massachusetts were cited for violations of the commonwealths wage and hour laws by the massachusetts attorney generals office in july  the  distributors were cited for a variety of different wage and hour violations including nonpayment of wage nonpayment of minimum wage misclassification child labor retaliation and recordkeeping violations the distributors were fined a total of  for the violations and also ordered to pay restitution sexual assaultedit the supreme court of texas held kirby liable for a rape committed by one of its doortodoor salesmen finding that the manufacturer maintained control of its distributors and their salespeople by requiring its distributors to make sales via inhome visits and that the risk was foreseeable in that case the court found that — had the employees references been checked — kirby would have discovered complaints of inappropriate sexual behavior at his previous employer and an arrest and deferred adjudication for indecency with a child the north dakota supreme court also held kirby liable in a similar rape incident where the salesman was hired after being convicted of assault and with charges of criminal sexual misconduct in the third degree pending against him fraud and ricoedit a federal classaction lawsuit is pending against kirby under the civil action provisions of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico for allegedly selling used vacuums as new the complaint alleges that not only is kirby aware of this practice it participates in the scheme by among other things selling to its distributors duplicate or replacement original purchasers registration cards to be given to secondhand purchasers the complaint also alleges that kirby commonly sells distributors new empty boxes and packaging material for the obvious purpose of repackaging units that the distributor previously sold to a prior customer kirbys motion to dismiss was rejected after kirby refused discovery requests for its sales contracts and other documents judge clay d land compelled kirby to disclose the requested documents a classaction lawsuit was also filed against kirby in bullock county court in alabama over its sales practices specifically its use of credit cards issued expressly to fund kirby purchases under truth in lending laws kirby succeeded in persuading a trial judge to recuse himself actions against unauthorized dealersedit kirby has sued unauthorized kirby vacuum dealers for united states trademark infringement where the vacuums are identified by the kirby name and logo the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit has held that such use does not constitute trademark infringement the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit vacated an injunction granted in kirbys favor by a lower court in that circuit based on similar trademark claims against an unauthorized distributor kirby also did not prevail in a similar action against an unauthorized dealer in minnesota where it asserted trademark infringement false and unfair competition and trade disparagement the authorized dealer prevailed on a  counterclaim against kirby for defamation and then in a suit against an insurer who refused to defend the suit when the dealer refused kirbys settlement offer kirbys parent lost another such suit in minnesota based on trademark infringement and other related state law claims nor did kirby prevail in a tortious interference with contractual relations claim in washington against an unauthorized retailer the washington supreme court awarded attorneys fees to the retailer however kirby has prevailed in cases where unauthorized retailers went farther than using the name and logo to identify the vacuum cleaner misrepresenting themselves as the manufacturer and claiming the

kirby company manufactures the unit and sells it to a group of authorized distributors each distributor is an independent business and as such sets their own price for the unit and conducts their own business operations independent distributors recruit dealers who are also independent contractors the dealers sell the unit doortodoor and are generally compensated only through commission criticism of marketing and sales practicesedit the practices of some of kirbys independent distributors have been subject to criticism the kirby is included by lon l fuller and melvin a eisenberg professors of contract law at harvard law school and uc berkeley school of lawcolumbia law school as a textbook example of unconscionability kirby has been subject to relentless criticism by consumer protection agencies as of  of the  state consumer protection agencies  had received a total of more than  complaints in just a few years between  and  the wisconsin department of agriculture trade and consumer protection received  complaints regarding kirby dealers and concluded from its investigation that kirby through its distributors engaged in a statewide pattern of trade practices violation of state consumerprotection laws many of the complaints involve older customers who lack the will to stand up to grueling sales pitches the wall street journal records examples where an elderly couple was unable to remove three kirby salesmen from their home for over five hours in another example a disabled woman who had been living alone in a mobile home on month in social security payments and suffering from alzheimers disease was discovered to own two kirby vacuum cleaners having paid  for the second one in  the florida agriculture and consumer services commissioner obtained  in refunds for  senior citizens according to the wall street journal the device costs more than four times what other topoftheline vacuum cleaners do kirby compares the price difference to that between luxury and economy cars yet luxurycar dealers dont make house calls in trailer parks but kirby dealers do the kirby vacuum cleaner is marketed exclusively doortodoor — often to people who can ill afford a  gadget but succumb to the sales pitch nonetheless in  the west virginia attorney general obtained more than  in refunds and credits for dissatisfied kirby buyers in  abcs primetime conducted a hiddencamera investigation in response to more than a thousand complaints regarding kirbys salespeople in june  the arizona attorney general filed suit against kirby distributors for violations of the telemarketing and consumer fraud and abuse prevention act seeking an injunction against any other home sales public authorities flooded with complaints about kirby vacuum cleaners is not a recent phenomenon even in the s and s kirby had been cited by various agencies a number of times and the detroit better business bureau had received so many complaints that it decided to turn the matter over to the wayne county prosecutor kirby asserts it is not liable from actions of its sales force whom it holds out as independent contractors its distributor code of ethics enumerates  principles including observe the highest standards of character honesty and integrity in dealings with my customers fellow distributors and other members of the kirby profession kirby also teaches its distributors directsales laws and requires them to resolve complaints within  hours under threat of termination litigationedit between  and  in alabama alone more than  lawsuits were filed against kirby and its affiliates and subsidiaries resulting in nearly  million in judgements and settlements twelve distributors of kirby vacuums in massachusetts were cited for violations of the commonwealths wage and hour laws by the massachusetts attorney generals office in july  the  distributors were cited for a variety of different wage and hour violations including nonpayment of wage nonpayment of minimum wage misclassification child labor retaliation and recordkeeping violations the distributors were fined a total of  for the violations and also ordered to pay restitution sexual assaultedit the supreme court of texas held kirby liable for a rape committed by one of its doortodoor salesmen finding that the manufacturer maintained control of its distributors and their salespeople by requiring its distributors to make sales via inhome visits and that the risk was foreseeable in that case the court found that — had the employees references been checked — kirby would have discovered complaints of inappropriate sexual behavior at his previous employer and an arrest and deferred adjudication for indecency with a child the north dakota supreme court also held kirby liable in a similar rape incident where the salesman was hired after being convicted of assault and with charges of criminal sexual misconduct in the third degree pending against him fraud and ricoedit a federal classaction lawsuit is pending against kirby under the civil action provisions of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico for allegedly selling used vacuums as new the complaint alleges that not only is kirby aware of this practice it participates in the scheme by among other things selling to its distributors duplicate or replacement original purchasers registration cards to be given to secondhand purchasers the complaint also alleges that kirby commonly sells distributors new empty boxes and packaging material for the obvious purpose of repackaging units that the distributor previously sold to a prior customer kirbys motion to dismiss was rejected after kirby refused discovery requests for its sales contracts and other documents judge clay d land compelled kirby to disclose the requested documents a classaction lawsuit was also filed against kirby in bullock county court in alabama over its sales practices specifically its use of credit cards issued expressly to fund kirby purchases under truth in lending laws kirby succeeded in persuading a trial judge to recuse himself actions against unauthorized dealersedit kirby has sued unauthorized kirby vacuum dealers for united states trademark infringement where the vacuums are identified by the kirby name and logo the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit has held that such use does not constitute trademark infringement the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit vacated an injunction granted in kirbys favor by a lower court in that circuit based on similar trademark claims against an unauthorized distributor kirby also did not prevail in a similar action against an unauthorized dealer in minnesota where it asserted trademark infringement false and unfair competition and trade disparagement the authorized dealer prevailed on a  counterclaim against kirby for defamation and then in a suit against an insurer who refused to defend the suit when the dealer refused kirbys settlement offer kirbys parent lost another such suit in minnesota based on trademark infringement and other related state law claims nor did kirby prevail in a tortious interference with contractual relations claim in washington against an unauthorized retailer the washington supreme court awarded attorneys fees to the retailer however kirby has prevailed in cases where unauthorized retailers went farther than using the name and logo to identify the vacuum cleaner misrepresenting themselves as the manufacturer and claiming the existence of factory

criticism of marketing and sales practices  litigation  sexual assault  fraud and rico  actions against unauthorized dealers  notes  references historyedit kirby sentria chrome edition the first kirby vacuums were designed by james b kirby – for george scott and carl fetzer after world war i although the kirby name was not used on a vacuum cleaner until the s james kirby invented the vacuette circa  and their primary competitors were the hoover company and the eureka company which both began operations in  and bissell who originally built carpet sweepers beginning in  the vacuette electric introduced in  with its removable floor nozzle and handle became the forerunner of todays multiattachment kirby vacuum models in  the company introduced the kirby model c the first product to carry jim kirbys name the vacuette was also briefly offered without an electric motor utilizing a springloaded worm gear driven by pulling the vacuum cleaner backwards then when pushing the machine forward the worm gear would power a turbine that provided the suction needed it was designed for rural areas that didnt have electricity and was very similar to the carpet sweeper while competitors have changed the orientation of the motor their products appearance materials used in construction and other features over the years kirby has remained with the original machines design materials used and functionality with enhancements added to aide in its operation and durability the company changes the appearance with revised color schemes and introduces new model names while keeping the core technology intact in  input from kirby distributors dealers management and customers guided kirby engineers in developing the kirby classic this ushered in the second generation models and was an instant success with soaring sales forcing the company to expand its manufacturing facilities outside of cleveland for the first time in  kirby west began operations in andrews texas at  nw  street the facility doubled the companys manufacturing capabilities the company did maintain a presence in canada at  burns street east in whitby which is no longer staffed berkshire hathaway bought kirby parent scott fetzer in  for  million two years prior ivan boesky had offered to buy scott fetzer for  a share or  million warren buffett has singled out scott fetzer to berkshires shareholders as the prototype for the kind of company — and acquisition — he was interested in according to berkshire managers absolutely no changes were made to the existing scott fetzer business or management and the entire business and its jet was preserved as of  kirby is the largest source of revenue and profit for scott fetzer with approximately  sales per year about a third of which are outside the united states in  scott fetzer sold the vacuums to about  factory distributors who in turn sell the vacuums doortodoor as an incentive to new customers kirby offers the service center vacuum rebuild program for original owners who have been registered with the company as long as the customer owns the machine as the registered owner if the cleaner needs repair they can send it back to the rebuild department and have it restored to “like new” condition the company will completely disassemble it repair or replace any worn kirby parts and sandblast polish and buff metal parts back to a shiny “new” appearance internal components are also thoroughly inspected and repaired with kirby replacement parts so that it will perform as originally designed kirby unit modelsedit a kirby g upright vacuum cleaner the kirby company generally produces only one model at a time kirbys vacuums made until  were made by frantz premier those made from  to  are branded and made by the scott  fetzer company after  all machines have been made by scott  fetzer though branded as kirby from  through the s continuous improvements and refinements were made to the kirby home care system one of the popular selling points is that it can be easily configured into a canister vacuum hand portable vacuum air pump floor polisher and more it can also be converted into a shampoo system for carpets and a sweeping dusting and mopping system for bare floors  the characteristic chrome appearance is due to the bulk of the machine is assembled from aluminum a tradition going back to the very early days of manufacture beginning in the s the generation series ushered in a new platform for the cleaner the addition of techdrive variable power assist eliminated  of the effort required to move the unit back and forth the current model the avalir continues the tradition that converts the vacuum into several different units beginning with the model  in  with most vacuum cleaner models the rubber drive belt that powers the brush bar an integral component with most modern machines remains in place and is only examined when it breaks vacuum attachments are available on other machines but dont require the drive belt to be disconnected kirby attachments are connected to the power unit and disconnecting the drive belt is usually involved in the process that add to its flexibility one of the key procedures for using a kirby vacuum is the correct way to adjust the carpet nozzle for the best possible results starting with the  model c to the most current machine the instruction manual states that the carpet nozzle should be gradually lowered into position with the toetouch latch incrementally adjusting the rug nozzle until the rotating vibrating brush establishes contact and the sound of the motor changes indicating suction has been achieved with the introduction of the model  the power switch was relocated from the top of the handle to the motor itself so the handle could be removed and the machine converted to a portable unit with a shoulder strap so that cleaning in difficult areas could be performed and the machine converted into a canistertype cleaner with a long hose attached to the front for dusting tasks starting with the model  adjusting the carpet nozzle employed what kirby called triple cushioned vibration rug cleaning action this involved briefly lifting the carpet up off the floor with the significant suction created by the machine thereby cushioning the area to be cleaned off of the floor while the rotating vibrating brush separated the carpet fibers thereby removing the embedded dirt and rejuvenating the carpet fibers earlier methods instructed that the carpet nozzle must maintain contact with the surface of the carpet utilizing the suction while later instruction manuals recommended the nozzle be slightly above with only the brush establishing contact and improving airflow around the surface being cleaned for delicate surfaces the drive belt that spins the brush can be detached so that only suction is used when the heritage model was introduced in  the brush performance indicator light was installed in the top of the carpet nozzle which consisted of magnets and a copper wire installed in the rotating vibrating brush a small led bulb would light up when the brush was spinning if the light appeared to blink or wasnt illuminated it meant the brush wasnt rotating at the desired speed and that the nozzle needed to be adjusted up or signifying that an inspection of the drive belt was needed collection and disposal of the dirt has also changed over the years but one component has remained called the saniemtor this is a component attached to the discharge tube leading away from the vacuum turbine chamber where the suction is created earlier versions used a dense duvetyne and later corduroy cotton fabric bag where the dirt lint and other debris collected allowing airflow to pass through and clean the air the sani emtor trapped heavier material in the bottom where a lid could be removed and the dirt disposed the cotton bag also has an integrated cleaning pocket within called the sanipocket introduced in  with the sanitronic where embedded dirt could be dislodged from the interior surface of the bag while keeping the dirt contained inside starting with the tradition model an internal disposable paper bag was introduced optionally in addition to the cotton cloth bag so that customers could decide which method they preferred when the generation  was introduced in  the only method of dirt collection was the disposable paper bag and was later labeled micron magic with the model g which can trap particles larger than three microns versatility has also been a marketing feature being able to configure the machine for various tasks the attachments available have come and gone over the years but some of the more popular ones remain available today a floor buffer attachment and bare floor dusting pad were introduced with the model c along with a handheld paint spray gun and upholstery shampoo dispenser called the sudsogun powered by attaching the hose to the turbine discharge tube have remained a carpet shampoo attachment called the rug renovator appeared with the dual sanitronic  in  another unusual attachment called the handibutler introduced with the model  used the turbine shaft at the front to power several devices offered as convenience features that could sharpen knives a cable could also be attached to a wire brush to remove rust from various surfaces along with a lambs wool polishing disk and a flannel buffing pad for more delicate tasks the handibutler was last offered with the tradition model and was replaced by the turbo sander with the legend model the turbo sander was equipped with a small turbine inside the device powered by the suction through the attachment hose which can accommodate various grades of sand paper scrubbing pads and a soft vinyl pad to be used as a massage unit that is still currently available during the mids with the popularity of deep shag carpeting a rake attachment called the shag king was attached in front of the carpet nozzle to lift the fibers while cleaning the carpet offered only on the classic omega classic iii and the tradition models another original attachment offered with the model c called the crystalator could be used to fumigate closets for insects and moths using moth balls which was no longer available with the legend model in the late s first generation edit model names start with the c followed by the c c

procedures for using a kirby vacuum is the correct way to adjust the carpet nozzle for the best possible results starting with the  model c to the most current machine the instruction manual states

carpet up off the floor with the significant suction created by the machine thereby cushioning the area to be cleaned off of the floor while the rotating vibrating brush separated the carpet fibers thereby removing the embedded dirt and rejuvenating the carpet fibers earlier methods instructed that the carpet nozzle must maintain contact with the surface of the carpet utilizing the suction while

that spins the brush can be detached so that only suction is used when the heritage model was introduced in  the brush performance indicator light was installed in the top of the carpet nozzle which consisted of magnets and a copper wire installed in the rotating vibrating brush a small led bulb would light up when the brush was spinning if the light appeared to blink or wasnt illuminated it meant the brush wasnt rotating at the desired speed and that the nozzle needed to be adjusted up or signifying that an inspection of the drive belt was needed collection and disposal of the dirt has also changed over the years but one component has remained called the saniemtor this is a component attached to the discharge tube leading away from the vacuum turbine chamber where the suction is created earlier versions used a dense duvetyne and later corduroy cotton fabric bag where the dirt lint and other debris collected allowing airflow to pass through and clean the air the sani emtor trapped heavier material in the bottom where a lid could be removed and the dirt disposed the cotton bag also has an integrated cleaning pocket within called the sanipocket introduced in  with the

violations the distributors were fined a total of  for the violations and also ordered to pay restitution sexual assaultedit the supreme court of texas held kirby liable for a rape committed by one of its doortodoor salesmen finding that the manufacturer maintained control of its distributors and their salespeople by requiring its distributors to make sales via inhome visits and that the risk was foreseeable in that case the court found that — had the employees references been checked — kirby would have discovered complaints of inappropriate sexual behavior at his previous employer and an arrest and deferred adjudication for indecency with a child the north dakota supreme court also held kirby liable in a similar rape incident where the salesman was hired after being convicted of assault and with charges of criminal sexual misconduct in the third degree pending against him fraud and ricoedit a federal classaction lawsuit is pending against kirby under the civil action provisions of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico for allegedly selling used vacuums as new the complaint alleges that not only is kirby aware of this practice it participates in the scheme by among other things selling to its distributors duplicate or replacement original purchasers registration cards to be given to secondhand purchasers the complaint also alleges that kirby commonly sells distributors new empty boxes and packaging material for the obvious purpose of repackaging units that the distributor previously sold to a prior customer kirbys motion to dismiss was rejected after kirby refused discovery requests for its sales contracts and other documents judge clay d land compelled kirby to disclose the requested documents a classaction lawsuit was also

vacuums are identified by the kirby name and logo the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit has held that such use does not constitute trademark infringement the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit vacated an injunction granted in kirbys favor by a lower court in that circuit based on similar trademark claims against an unauthorized distributor kirby also did not prevail in a similar action against an unauthorized dealer in minnesota where it asserted trademark infringement false and unfair competition and trade disparagement the authorized dealer prevailed on a  counterclaim against kirby for defamation and then in a suit against an insurer who refused to defend the suit when the dealer refused kirbys settlement offer kirbys parent lost another such suit in minnesota based on trademark infringement and other related state law claims nor did kirby prevail in a tortious interference with contractual relations claim in washington against an unauthorized retailer the washington supreme court awarded attorneys fees to the retailer however kirby has prevailed in cases where unauthorized retailers went farther than using the name and logo to identify the

its doortodoor salesmen finding that the manufacturer maintained control of its distributors and their salespeople by requiring its distributors to make sales via inhome visits and that the risk was foreseeable in that case the court found that — had the employees references been checked — kirby would have discovered complaints of inappropriate sexual behavior at his previous employer and an arrest and deferred adjudication for indecency with a child the north dakota supreme court also held kirby liable in a similar rape incident where the salesman was hired after being convicted of

kirby commonly sells distributors new empty boxes and packaging material for the obvious purpose of repackaging units that the distributor previously sold to a prior customer kirbys motion to dismiss was rejected after kirby refused discovery requests for its sales contracts and other documents judge clay d land compelled kirby to disclose the requested documents a classaction lawsuit was also

appeals for the ninth circuit vacated an injunction granted in kirbys favor by a lower court in that circuit based on similar trademark claims against an unauthorized distributor kirby also did not prevail in a similar action against an unauthorized dealer in minnesota where it asserted trademark infringement false and unfair competition and trade disparagement the authorized dealer prevailed on a  counterclaim against kirby for defamation and then in a suit against an insurer who refused to defend the suit when the dealer refused kirbys settlement offer kirbys parent lost another such suit in minnesota based on trademark infringement and other related state law claims nor did kirby prevail in a tortious interference with contractual relations claim in washington against an unauthorized

unchanged at  to  compared to  earned in  news provided by kirby corporation apr    et share this article houston april   prnewswire  kirby corporation kirby nyse kex today announced net earnings attributable to kirby for the first quarter ended march   of  million or  per share compared with  million or  per share for the  first quarter  consolidated revenues for the  first quarter were  million compared with  million reported for the  first quarter david grzebinski kirbys president and chief executive officer commented our first quarter results were in line with our expectations  in our inland marine transportation market barge utilization was in the high  to low  range for the quarter  utilization was affected by operating restrictions caused by poor but seasonally normal weather conditions and stronger utilization in our black oil fleet primarily as a result of turnarounds and seasonal factors affecting the us gulf coast refining complex  in the coastal marine transportation market tank barge utilization was in the mid to low  range during the first quarter as the market continued to be impacted by barges moving from term contracts into the spot market  in response to continued difficult coastal market dynamics we have taken measures to cut costs reducing headcounts and temporarily taking barges out of service until market conditions improve mr grzebinski continued within our diesel engine services segment the landbased market continued to experience strong demand for remanufacturing of pressure pumping units and transmission overhauls  there was also a modest improvement during the quarter in the demand for the manufacture of new pressure pumping units and the sale of new transmissions  in the marine diesel engine services market revenues were down yearoveryear but operating profit increased as a result of cost control measures implemented in   in the power generation market demand was comparable to the  first quarter segment results – marine transportationmarine transportation revenues for the  first quarter were  million compared with  million for the  first quarter  operating income for the  first quarter was  million compared with  million for the  first quarter demand for inland tank barge transportation of petrochemicals refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals was stable while black oil and pressure barge demand was higher sequentially  kirbys inland tank barge utilization was in the high  to low  range during the quarter  both term and spot contract pricing were at lower levels relative to the first quarter of  although spot pricing remained stable compared to the  fourth quarter  operating conditions during the quarter were seasonally normal including periodic wind and fog which increased delay days and consequently reduced our efficiency on work performed under affreightment contracts  the operating margin for the inland business was in the midteens  in the coastal marine transportation market demand for the transportation of black oil petrochemicals and dry products was stable  demand for the transportation of refined petroleum products and crude oil was lower than the  first quarter and reflected general and seasonal weakness in the northeast and alaska  the growing number of vessels trading in the spot market continued to drive increased idle time and voyage costs  utilization for the coastal tank barge fleet was in the mid to low  range  additionally coastal marine results were negatively impacted by customer requested acceleration of regulatory shipyards on two large units during the quarter  the operating margin for the coastal marine business was in the negative midsingle digits the marine transportation segments  first quarter operating margin was  compared with  for the first quarter of  as a result of weaker pricing in the inland marine market and increased idle time in the coastal market as more barges operated in the spot market  segment results – diesel engine servicesdiesel engine services revenues for the  first quarter were  million with operating income of  million compared with  first quarter revenues of  million and an operating loss of  million the higher revenues and operating income as compared to the first quarter of  were due to elevated demand for the remanufacturing of pressure pumping units rebuilt transmissions and a modest uptick in the sale of new pressure pumping units  in our marine diesel engine services business revenues declined compared to the  first quarter due to customer deferrals of major overhauls particularly in the midwest and weak demand for new engines  gulf coast oilfield services activity remained slow  however cost controls implemented in the marine diesel engine services business last year contributed to an increase in operating income relative to the  first quarter  demand in the power generation market remained stable for the quarter both sequentially and compared to the  first quarter  the diesel engine services operating margin was  for the  first quarter compared with  for the  first quarter due primarily to increased activity in our landbased diesel engine services market and improved efficiency in our marine diesel engine services business cash generationebitda of  million for the  first quarter compares with ebitda of  million for the  first quarter  cash flow was used to fund capital expenditures of  million including  million for new inland tank barge and towboat construction  million for progress payments on the construction of a new coastal articulated tank barge and tugboat unit atb two  horsepower coastal tugboats and six  horsepower coastal atb tugboats final costs of  million on a  barrel coastal petrochemical tank barge delivered in december  and  million primarily for upgrades to the existing inland and coastal fleets  total debt as of march   was  million and kirbys debttocapitalization ratio was  outlookcommenting on the  second quarter and full year market outlook and guidance mr  grzebinski said our earnings guidance for the  second quarter is  to  per share compared with  per share for the  second quarter  our full year earnings guidance remains  to  per share  second quarter and full year guidance contemplates inland marine transportation utilization in the mid range at the low end and low  range at the high end  we believe tank barge retirements will continue in response to the weak pricing environment in the inland market further closing the gap between tank barge supply and demand  at the middle to high end of our full year guidance we have accounted for a modest improvement in pricing in the second half of the year  in our coastal market we expect utilization in the mid to low  range for the second quarter and full year the cost reduction measures taken in the  first quarter and early second quarter should allow us to operate at quarterly breakeven operating margins or a slight operating loss for the rest of the year mr grzebinski continued in our diesel engine services markets we anticipate pressure pumping remanufacturing and transmission overhaul service work in our landbased diesel engine services business will continue at relatively high levels for the second quarter and remain healthy for the remainder of the year  orders for new pressure pumping units and new transmissions in the second quarter have yet to materialize although we have received several customer inquiries  we expect a slight seasonal decline for the marine diesel engine and power generation businesses in the second quarter and steady results the remainder of the year kirby expects  capital spending to be in the  to  million range unchanged from previous guidance  capital spending guidance includes approximately  million in progress payments on new coastal equipment including a  barrel atb two  horsepower and six  horsepower coastal tugboats  the balance of  to  million is primarily for five new inland tank barges and capital upgrades and improvements to existing inland and coastal marine equipment and facilities as well as diesel engine services facilities  conference
