shorting vix  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»the secret appeal to shorting vixmar    am et includes svxy uvxy vmax vmin vxx xivby rex shares llcrex shares llc gold etf investing macro vixrex sharesas many diehard vix sellers already know it is very possible to make money with short vix positions without any significant movement at all in the vix in this article we will briefly explain the factors that go into this if you have not read greg kings previous article on shorting vix we would recommend you do so before reading this one taking the period of time since january  the first trading day of  to march  the day of this writing we see this phenomenon at work during that time the vix index moved from  to  while hitting a high of  and a low of  during the period overall the net move was  and the distance between the low and the high as measured from the starting level of vix for the period was  so even if someone picked the high to short vix and the low to buy it back timing the market perfectly the maximum return would have been  now keep in mind vix is uninvestable as is and that does not factor in transaction costs however during that same time frame a hypothetical static short position in continuously rolling vix futures as represented by the sp  vix shortterm futures index would have gained a staggering  moreover a daily compounding position in shorter duration vix futures contracts as represented by the returns on the net asset value of the rex volmaxx short vix weekly futures strategy etf nysemktvmin would have gained  over this same time frame note past performance is certainly no guarantee of future results with respect to the vix vix futures or vmin still how is it possible that short vix futures positions have risen more than the level of the vix has fallen spoiler alert the answer lies in the steepness of the vix futures curve lets remember that a short position in futures of any kind has three potential sources of return first is the most boring collateral yield futures are leverage instruments and so the cash collateral supporting them must have a yield to it ten years ago this made a lot more of a difference than it does today because rates were higher but it still counts for something a second source of return is the movements in the underlying index itself in this case vix how the vix moves up and down affects the corresponding prices of the vix futures and even though it may seem like a foregone conclusion that up movements in the vix equate to up movements in the vix futures that may not always be the case although most of the time it is which leads us to our third source of returns roll yield this last source is what tends to confuse investors the most holding a position for a time period longer than the duration of the underlying futures contract means the position must be rolled for example before april expiry an april vix contract that has been sold short must be bought back and the may vix contract sold in order to maintain the short position through this contract swapping process a profit or loss is achieved the above graph shows the vix futures curve as of the close on march   we can see that the march april and may prices are   and  respectively lets assume the curve were to stay the same shape over time and that the level of the vix does not move if we assume the april contract now at  follows the curve down and in a month closes where the march futures contract is now at  that short position would increase by the difference  or around  on the shorted notional the punch line here is that given our assumptions spot vix has not moved but value of the short vix futures position would have increased by  in one month this is the secret appeal to shorting vix the steepness of the curve lately has rewarded short position holders handsomely even though vix has not moved much although they are bearing the risk of vix rallying unexpectedly a significant one many still choose to employ this strategy and now you know why footnotes the market price return for vmin is  for the same period nav return for vmin from inception  to  was  and the market price return for vmin was  for the same period the funds expense ratio is  past performance does not guarantee future results performance quoted represents past performance which is no guarantee of future results investment return and principal value will fluctuate so you may have a gain or loss when shares are sold current performance may be higher or lower than that quoted shortterm performance is not a good indication of the funds future performance and an investment should not be made based solely on returns shares are bought and sold at market prices and not individually redeemed from the fund brokerage commissions will reduce returns nav is calculated using prices as of  pm eastern time the market price is the midpoint between the bid and the ask price as of the close of the exchange market price

investing investing involves risk including the possible loss of principal vmin is actively managed active management may increase transaction costs the vix index is not directly investable vmin

losses unlike most etfs vmax expects to effect its creations and redemptions in exchange for a significant cash component and a smaller component of inkind securities paying redemption proceeds in

made a redemption inkind as a result vmax may pay out higher or lower annual capital gains distributions than etfs that redeem in kind the vix index is not directly investable the settlement price of a vix futures contract is based on the calculation that determines the level of the vix index as a result the behavior of a vix futures contract may be different from traditional futures contracts whose settlement price is based on a specific tradable asset when economic uncertainty increases and there is an increase in expected volatility the value of vix futures contracts will likely also increase similarly when economic uncertainty recedes and there is an associated decrease in expected volatility the value of vix futures contracts will likely also decrease futures markets are highly

of contango or backwardation in the vix futures contracts market vmax’s investment strategy is subject to risks related to rolling the price of futures contracts further from expiration may be higher “contango” or lower  “backwardation” because of the frequency with which the fund expects to roll vix futures contracts the impact of such contango or backwardation may be greater than if the fund experienced less portfolio turnover short sales are transactions in which vmin sells a security it does not own if the security goes down in price between the time vmin sells the security and buys it back vmin will realize a gain on the transaction if the security goes up in price during the period vmin will realize a loss because a short position loses value as the security’s price increases and the market price of the shorted security could increase without limit the loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited short sales involve leverage because the fund borrows securities and then

accessing gold returns that keeps current asset allocations intact gold is the world’s oldest currency and gaining exposure to it can diversify investor portfolios away from their home currency like with any currency exposure to gold can be taken either in physical form or by synthetic exposure gold hedged investing involves “porting” gold returns into an existing portfolio by accessing exposure via gold futures positions overlaid as a “hedge” onto an equity position accessing gold this way rather than via any physicalbased holdings conserves investment capital within the portfolio for other

questions    what is gold hedged investing gold hedged investing is the application of an overlay to an investment portfolio that gives the portfolio exposure to the price movements of gold why not invest directly in gold a direct investment in gold such as owning either physical gold or a fund that owns physical gold requires an upfront payment to purchase the asset to finance this upfront payment an investor may need to sell other assets such as equities which can change an asset allocation mix a futures contract by contrast is an agreement to purchase the asset at a future point in time instead gold hedged investing takes exposure to the price fluctuations of gold via futures in an amount approximately equal to the amount of equity exposure and rolls the futures before they expire what makes gold a currency gold is considered to be money or a currency by many notable investors and financiers including j pierpont morgan alan greenspan and ray dalio founder of bridgewater at times the worlds largest hedge fund it is considered so because it meets the six tests necessary for any substance to be considered a currency durability portability divisibility uniformity acceptability and limited supply how is gold a us dollar hedge the value of a currency can only be measured vs another currency or vs a basket of goods in that sense gold is a usd hedge when measured in terms of gold as the correlation is  however gold may still be viewed as a good overall usd hedge when compared against a basket of foreign currencies that include eur jpy gbp and other major currencies as gold has  correlation with the baskets change against the dollar over the period from december   through december   can gold act as a hedge during tail events gold can reduce portfolio losses during some but not all events that give rise to sudden extreme market downturns these downturns are often referred to as tail events in particular gold can reduce portfolio losses during financialrelated economic downturns which may give rise to a flight to quality for more information see world gold council gold hedging against tail risk september  how is gold an em currency hedge emerging market currencies can often be expensive to hedge both because of interest rate differentials and high transaction costs that may be associated with trading such currencies however emerging market currency may fall sharply during flight to quality situations because flight to quality may positively impact the price of gold gold can act as a hedge against the risk of this type of situation why not gold hedge my own portfolio an investor with the ability to trade gold futures contracts and who was willing to periodically roll and rebalance their gold futures exposure could gold hedge their own portfolio does gold diversify a portfolio historically gold has shown low and sometimes negative correlations to equity markets while exhibiting positive returns over long time periods on this basis gold is generally considered a valid way to diversify equity portfolios is there contango or backwardation risk yes if gold hedged investing takes gold exposure via futures the total performance of the investment will be affected if the future level of gold is higher than the current price of gold a condition typically referred to as contango or lower than the current price of gold a condition typically referred to as backwardation however because it is relatively straightforward to hold and store gold the future price of gold may experience less fluctuation relative to its current price than may be the case for commodities that are perishable or expensive to store who is rex rex shares llc “rex” creates and delivers intelligently engineered etfs that address access and
