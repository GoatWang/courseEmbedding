feedback from people who have your cotton sheets i must have a perfectly made beds–crisp clean unwrinkled i believe i can get that with the cotton sheets however the color selection is limited so i would like to know the difference between the cotton and bamboo sheets i dread the great big creases that come standard with any store bought sheet no matter how high the cost what will be better for me thomas leeansweranswerdear dell the main differences between our cotton and bamboo bed linens are  while both are made from natural fibers our bamboo sheets have more drape meaning that if you put a bamboo sheet over a chair the fabric will pretty much conform to the shape of the chair  both fabrics are very smooth and strong however our bamboo fabric is somewhat softer in texture while many people consider our cotton fabric to be crisp feeling  we do not use any chemical additives on our cotton sheets including harsh resins required to make a  cotton fabric no iron which means our  pima cotton bed sheets are not wrinkle freeour bamboo fabric is somewhat naturally wrinkle free which one is best for you is a matter of personal preference if a crisp texture is most important then i recommend our  pima cotton bed linens if a naturally wrinkle free bed sheet is most important then i recommend our bamboo bed linens thomas lee dear dell the main differences between our cotton and
