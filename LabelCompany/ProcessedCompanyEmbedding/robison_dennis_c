antimicrobial activity of silver products jan  townsend letter alternative medicine magazine                      from the townsend letter january  order this issue the antimicrobial activity of selected silver products retracted may  by robert rowen md dennis harper dc and richard robison phd share this article the paper is hereby retracted all references to this article must show that it is officially retracted with the publication of the may  issue of the townsend letter the antimicrobial activity of a group of silverbased products was assessed by comparing their ability to kill mrsa methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus silver has been used for decades for its known antimicrobial effects– since many silverbased products have made claims of superiority over other brands two eminent oxidation therapy specialists dr dennis harper and dr robert rowen recognized the value of conducting an independent and unbiased study that would definitively assess the antimicrobial efficacy of several wellrecognized silver products to this end they contacted dr richard robison a microbiologist with many years of experience in disinfection and infection control the product identities were not disclosed prior to testing   purpose the core purpose of every silverbased health product is to kill pathogenic microorganisms in this initial study conducted at a major university laboratory the kill rates of five silverbased products on a common and feared microorganism mrsa a deadly pathogen responsible for killing thousands of people each year worldwide were determined methods rowen and harper acquired five silverbased products by purchase through normal retail channels harpers acquisitions were shipped to rowen who then blinded all five original bottles and randomly labeled each with letters a through e rowen alone kept key codes for identifying the products he sent the blinded products directly to the microbiology lab neither harper nor rowen was informed of the antimicrobial testing results the test results were sent directly from the microbiology lab to george gaboury president of the san francisco tesla institute a grassroots organization that promotes the advancement and greater public awareness of science after receiving the test results gaboury was independently sent the key codes by rowen gaboury then matched the lab results to the specific products a through e in public at a scheduled meeting of the tesla society the actual lab test results were reported to the group by gaboury in an unaltered format     each product was evaluated on the same day by the same technician using the same test organism suspension a suspension test was used similar to that described by march et al briefly the test suspension was prepared by growing a  ml culture of mrsa organisms atcc  in nutrient broth at  °c for  hours the  ml culture was pelleted by centrifugation washed with  ml sterile  mω purified water centrifuged again and resuspended in a final volume of  ml sterile purified water this produced a suspension containing about  billion organismsml a  ml aliquot of each test product was added to a  ml polypropylene sterile centrifuge tube tubes were equilibrated in a  °c water bath then  ml of the mrsa test suspension was added to each tube at time  after a minute contact time  ml of this disinfectantmrsa mixture was added to  ml of neutralizer solution the tube was mixed thoroughly and allowed to sit for  minutes the neutralized suspension was then serially diluted in  ml blanks of physiological saline solution pss the number of viable organisms in selected dilution tubes was assayed by membrane filtration one ml aliquots were plated in triplicate the membranes were washed with about  ml of sterile pss and removed to columbia agar plates the plates were incubated at  °c for  and  hours the number of colonies on each filter was counted and log reduction and percent kill values for each product were computed titers of the mrsa test suspension were computed and appropriate neutralizer and sterility controls were performed results there was a highly significant difference between the five formulations in their ability to kill mrsa in  minutes log reduction logss where s  concentration of viable organisms after the specified contact time and s the initial concentration of viable organisms at time  and percent kill ss × values can be seen in table  p  one silver product solution c was found to be approximately  times more effective in antimicrobial activity than the second most effective silverbased product solution a and approximately  times more powerful in antimicrobial activity than solutions b d and e     the complete study including testing methods and results can be requested by email contact information is listed at the end of this report discussion dennis harper dc nd and founder of o medical services specialist in ozone and vitamin treatment stated acs  extra strength could change the landscape in significantly strengthening antibiotics for fighting bacterial infections quickly and effectively i was challenged by my fellow peers to find the best silver product and up until now no one had independently tested the comparative bacterial kill rates on a range of silverbased solutions these results could pave the way for more effective patient treatment     rowen and harper have taught at acams oxidation workshop where many questions arose regarding conflicting data from various silver companies these questions led to performing this independent study rowen says until now it was a difficult process sorting out information attached to various silver products we harper and rowen consulted with dr richard robison professor of microbiology about designing a valid test he advised you are attempting to kill microorganisms with silver so keep it simple with a standard kill test performed in an identical manner on the various products a test which will demonstrate if the products actually do what you desire them to do     the kill rate effectiveness was assessed with a contact time of  minutes and the results are expressed as both log reductions and percent kill for accuracy plating on each dilution was performed in triplicate rowen says for the layman who might not understand the significance of logarithmic reduction consider the richter scale of earthquake magnitude which is expressed in a log format a  earthquake is  times more powerful than a  a  earthquake is  times more powerful than a  as revealed in this study solution c acs  extra strength had a log reduction of  compared with that of the second best product at  solution c acs  extra strength had greater than  log kill over the closest competitor representing a  times greater kill than solution a solution c acs  extra strength had a percent kill rate of  which was close to complete kill of the test suspension over  million mrsa organisms within  minutes     how does this research affect you and me harper added we cannot make broadstroke conclusions about any particular product based on the results of a single study and believe it would be inappropriate to do so in partnership we will continue to fund further independent studies to reinforce the consistency of these truly amazing results at the present we have identified a highly effective silverbased solution which when administered with antibiotics should provide far superior patient outcomes these test results are readily available to anyone who wants to contact me and find out more     rowen commented one must appreciate the log scale lets start with   billion organisms the initial dilution caused by mixing the organism with the disinfectant gives us  million organismsml at time zero exposure to the second best product caused a  log reduction a  kill in viable organisms leaving over  living mrsa organisms the product that caused a  log reduction  kill left less than  viable organisms the other three products left over  million living mrsa organisms in the given time period of exposure this is simply too huge a difference to ignore and begs that followup studies be conducted this may be a huge breakthrough in the management of infection especially in the light that silver is synergistic with oxidation therapy        rowen has been intensely involved as a clinician in oxidation therapy since  he currently serves as acams oxidation workshop chairman and teaches oxidation therapy seminars he practices in santa rosa california harper has been practicing ozone therapy for many years and practices in orofino idaho  he recently joined the acam oxidative workshop teaching staff for more information on data and medical issues please contact
