different things how do you launch a new product in the market by margarita hakobyan margarita hakobyan is a businesswoman and an entrepreneur that is addicted to creating as an owner of several businesses she brings a wide range of education and experience including business strategy business ethics and leadership margahakobyan founder solopreneursmargahakobyan write a comment credit getty images product launch is an intense stressful time but careful planning can help reduce your stress and give your team a solid plan to help manage the intensity if you cover these four issues early in the planning process your launch will be easier to manage and less frustrating overall it will also have better odds of success leading to a better company position over time  know your audience when you think of the audience for your product how specific is it do you have a very general idea of who your customer base is  women for example or small business owners  or have you drilled down deep into your customer profile the most successful products are carefully targeted in very specific ways at very specific customers take the example of cell phones while nearly everyone in the world has a cellphone these mobile phones were initially a very niche product marketed towards traveling businesspeople who needed a way to contact the office from the road part of building your launch is figuring out exactly who your audience is you should know demographic details about your customer profile age gender marital status occupation hobbies as well as habitual information where do they get their news what is their favorite publication how do they spend their free time knowing these details will help you understand where to find your customer and how to connect with them  solve the right problem every product on the market needs to solve a problem the easiest products to market exist where customers know they have a problem and are seeking a solution some products need to convince customers they have a problem and that the product is a solution these products have an uphill climb towards success the better you know your audience the easier it will be to identify their problems in a language they understand for example targeting a baby product that entertains a very young baby and gives parents a chance to set them down will not be as useful to a parent who intensely values baby wearing and intensive skintoskin time there are other parents however who will be extremely appreciative of your product the key is knowing where to find them identify exactly what problem you are solving and make sure that your audience agrees that the problem exists before you get too far into your launch  careful positioning against your competition every product has competition even industries that are being disrupted are competing against the status quo to successfully launch a product you need to know what your business is working against if your customers were not using your products or services whose would they be using sometimes the answer is another company offering the same services in this case your position points might revolve around pricing value adds and service capabilities sometimes the answer is another product in the same class for example each movie that comes out competes not just against other movies but against all the other things people do with their free time to convince people to go see the newest blockbuster thriller studios must convince their potential audience that the movie is worth their time when you know your audience and you understand what problem you are solving positioning your product will be easier and more accurate you will better understand where to place ads what content will be helpful in marketing and how to connect with your audience if you find yourself unsure of how to accomplish these tasks returning to the basic ideas of audience and problem will often narrow your position  feedback one of the most key elements of a product launch is getting feedback from your customers you can do all of the theoretical assessments on your audience before launch but nothing will compare to real feedback from your actual customers while not every piece of feedback you receive needs to be acted upon immediately watching customer feedback for trends and patterns will help you identify the next stage of your product evolution during the actual launch its important to course correct as necessary but not to try and implement new features or perfect the product prior to launch seth godin always talks about the importance of shipping and how our fear of shipping gets in the way of actually getting a business off the ground if customers are providing feedback about the service theyre receiving or the actual functionality of your product or service you will probably need to fix this as soon as possible if customers are asking for more functionality additional benefits or more perks you will probably have more success tracking these requests for later implementation product launch is a stressful time for a business owner or entrepreneur but it is not the end point of the business structure by planning for a product launch you can make sure that your launch is as successful as possible and modify the plan as necessary to continue into the next phase of development what advice would you offer to a company planning its first product launch the opinions expressed here by inccom columnists are their own not those of inccom published on mar   product marketing  wikipedia

marketing frequently differs from product management in hightech companies whereas the product manager is required to take a products requirements from the sales and marketing personnel and create a

tasks like giving product demonstrations in trade shows creating marketing collateral like hotsheets beatsheets cheat sheets data sheets and white papers this requires the product marketing manager to be skilled not only in competitor analysis market research and technical writing but also in more business oriented activities like conducting roi and npv analyses on technology investments strategizing how the decision criteria of the prospects or customers can be changed so that they buy the companys product visavis the competitors product etc one issue that faces product marketers is that they are chartered with developing much of the content for the various constituents sales marcom customers blogs etc creating content tends to be given more value than the actual research and thinking that is behind all the content in smaller hightech firms or startups product marketing and product management functions can be blurred and both tasks may be borne by one individual however as the company grows someone needs to focus on creating good requirements documents for the engineering team whereas someone else needs to focus on how to analyze the market influence the analysts and

networkonce you get feedback directly from your customers refine the packaging and price point before approaching your next marketwholesalers youll probably start with small independently owned local

profile logout resources articles the  commandments of product marketing the  commandments of product marketing may   whether you’re a fan of charlton heston or mel brooks you likely understand the concept of a commandment it is a foundational command or directive or an essential requirement with no compromise in the course of managing today’s crises and worrying about tomorrow’s problems we as productmarketing professionals can lose focus on the essentials needed to be an effective product marketer having been at the productmarketing game for about a dozen years at three different companies more if you count how many times i was acquired and having had the distinct honor of working for a master of product marketing i submit to you this list of the essentials which we call “the  commandments of product marketing” i hope they help guide new product marketers or reintroduce core productmarketing fundamentals to veteran practitioners the  commandments are built around the constituencies we as product marketers serve sales product management and business press and analysts competitors partners and most importantly customers  have an uptodate positioning document and buyer persona for your product how often do you start developing product or marketing materials without fully knowing who the target buyers are and what their pains are it happens more than it should when we are going too fast but without this fundamental understanding you run the risk of losing control of your message never forget you own the message  know the business plan for your product and have a measurable gotomarket plan for it regularly perform a marketing activity analysis against budget to measure this you can’t manage what you can’t measure and you can’t achieve an objective without understanding what it takes to get there i recommend setting a regular cadence of operational reviews with your functional marketing counterparts where you can review a standard set of results to measure what’s working and what’s not and when marketing issues come up during quarterly business reviews make sure your business leader is prepared with the numbers it’s your responsibility as steward of the marketing budget for the business  know how customers are using your product observing customers in their native habitats need not be intimidating ask for a ridealong with a sales rep or talk to an established customer willing to give you honest feedback customer reference program members are an ideal source for this use these conversations to determine if how you’re positioning your product is real or just hype be prepared for an opinion different from what you were expecting and take it in context with other conversations just because you have one conversation with one customer who says something completely divergent from what your buyer personas say doesn’t mean you have to shift how you market your product keep it real by speaking to a real customer at least once per month this is also a nonthreatening way to gather winloss data  know where your product’s customers and users are coming from this one can be tricky especially if your business lacks the operational maturity to have consolidated business metrics there will be someone—likely multiple people—who are able to tell you how many active customers you have for a product maintenance or support records the sizes and industry verticals of your customers hoover’s et al average sales price discount and margin bookings database from finance and new customers vs existing finance the trick is to consolidate this information so you have the right information when you need it for example wouldn’t it be great if—when your business leader indicated you needed to focus on selling to existing customers to drive penetration—you had that data at your fingertips and could weigh in on the addressable market  know your product’s license and maintenance revenue targets and progress toward those targets as a product marketer you are the vp of marketing for your product the main focus of your role as a marketer is contributing to revenue how are you influencing license bookings pretend for a moment you work for a “companyistheproduct” startup you own marketing for that product—and therefore the company—soup to nuts what do you need to know to be successful knowing your progress toward targets helps you move your marketing investments to meet current business objectives  know who sells your product also know what their comp plans look like sales reps are coin operated their behavior follows the money knowing how your reps are compensated helps you know what to focus on in salesenablement discussions for example if reps have their comp plan tied to growth in enterpriselevel accounts in their region they’re not going to respond to products and training that address a small to midmarket customer handinhand with this is an understanding of quotas average deal sizes whether they’re comped on other parts of the portfolio professional services etc this helps you better understand the folks who are taking your product to market and how to talk their language you can then be better positioned to influence compbased incentives or spiffs for your product  ensure sales partners field marketing and others can successfully evangelize for your product with accurate and uptodate sales tools gather feedback from the field and provide regular updates this seems like a nobrainer and will likely be  percent of your job notice the nuance here though your role as a product marketer likely revolves around building messaging enabling the sales force and influencing campaigns to drive leads and awareness but turning other marketing sharedservices personnel into advocates for your product increases internal mindshare and ultimately improves focus and results it’s not just about the blocking and tackling of producing sales tools and a good website but also ensuring the folks building those tools and that website or managing that event can tell the story well part of your success will be dependent on turning others not just sales into evangelists remember you’re likely competing with other products for mental shelf space across the company be aggressive it’s always easier to ask for forgiveness than permission  know your product’s top three competitors and be able to explain how your product is different i bet this is the no  request you get from sales but if you’re like many companies analyzing competitors is a tricky undertaking it’s frowned upon to download a competitor’s product under false pretenses or break the law in any way so you rely on publicly available materials that are either authored by the competitor or from an expensive thirdparty source my advice is to stay above it and simply provide strengths and advantages of your products  know who the key analysts and market influencers are and how they position your product in the market don’t rely exclusively on the analyst relations public relations or social media teams to give you regular updates on analyst reports or industry articles you need to take responsibility for knowing who your top influencers are and how they feel about your product and you can do that by subscribing to their blogs and twitter feeds also establish a quarterly cadence with those influencers to talk business strategy product updates etc it doesn’t even have to be formal and some of the best influencing i’ve done is over coffee or standing on a tradeshow floor begin with the end in mind how do you want this conversation to end courting these influencers is as critical to your success as educating your sales force ever had a deal go south when a customer said that analyst firm x hadn’t heard about your product before  know your product’s release schedule and roadmap and execute product releases on time another “duh” moment but seriously how many times have you been surprised that a product is ready to release and you nearly caused a delay in its release at the company i work for product management owns the release to marketingmanufacturing date but product marketing owns the generally available ga date when the product is actually live and sellable there are typically  business days between these two dates with some flexibility on either end which gives product marketers  days to shepherd sales tool updates marketing programs and sales training through the processes needed to post it all live to keep up on when the release is coming attend your product or program manager’s regular release meetings and be prepared with a plan on how you will market the product breaking it down remember the old maxim that you either are in sales or sales support master these  commandments and you will be better connected to the business be able to measure your results with what really matters bookings be closer to the customer than you ever thought possible and less likely to have to answer to sales remember you have execution teams to help you leverage them so you can be a marketing representative to the business overlaying these commandments on top of the pragmatic marketing process—and using the templates and tools available to you—adds rigor discipline and a professional quality to your role as product marketing and business representative to the marketing

articles webinars podcasts and more subscribe now what is product marketing  drift × what is product marketing dave gerhardtdecember   product marketing ●  min read you’ve heard about the importance of product marketing you know a few good product marketers heck maybe that’s even your job one problem try and explain what product marketing does to someone else uhhhh… frustrating isn’t it no matter how hard you try to explain what product marketing is and what product marketers do everyone has a different definition and this is especially true when you start comparing product marketing vs product management product marketing sits at the intersection of product sales and marketing — which means that the role can have a big impact — but also means that the role can be a little challenging to define see why thousands of businesses are using drift to generate lead and close deals faster a definition for product marketing before a product launch product marketers typically own positioning messaging gathering customer feedback and the overall gotomarket strategy for a product after a product launch product marketers help with sales enablement and focus on driving demand adoption and the overall success of the product that definition is the best way that we’ve found to explain the role of product marketing — by looking at what product marketers do before and after product launches and there’s more information in the slideshare below too but we also wanted to created this guide to help explain what product marketing is and what the product marketing job description typically looks like so let’s get to it the problem with defining product marketing google the term “product marketing” and you’ll see one definition after another trying to capture the essence of what product marketing managers do but most of those definitions are either from outdated marketing textbooks or offer contradicting explanations — one might tell you product marketing sits with product one might tell you product marketing sits with sales some refer to it as “a liaison between the company and the outside world” others try to be more specific explaining how product marketing deals with the p’s of marketing remember the p’s many focus on what a product marketer must achieve or do while others try to explain it by its role within the company — and not a single one seems to offer a clear enough definition of the term but where’s the confusion coming from one reason might be the lack of understanding of what product marketers actually do even with little knowledge about their day to day jobs most of us can understand what outcomes the majority of functions within a company are responsible for delivering sales people bring in more business finance keeps the books in order engineers build the product and support helps keep customers happy but product marketing… most people might have difficulty defining the outcome of a product marketer’s work the other reason might be that many companies use the term product marketing to describe other functions like product management for instance in some companies a product marketer’s sole responsibility is positioning in others they focus only on sales enablement or they are responsible for driving demand and adoption and then at some companies a product marketer is responsible for all of those things so what is product marketing actually responsible for at its core product marketers need a deep understanding of the customer and the market to ensure that a product and its new features are appropriately positioned on the market sales and marketing teams have all the necessary knowledge and materials enabling them to attract new customers the product could satisfy the target audience’s needs and overcome their pain points product demand and adoption are on continuous rise and the product remains relevant as markets evolve product marketing deliverables the tangible results of a product marketer’s work typically include buyer personas that provide structure and insight for a company positioning and messaging that that attracts and converts prospects and leads sales enablement materials that help reps close more deals competitive intelligence that gives the team a deep understanding of the market gotomarket strategy and launch plans that outline in detail how the product will be promoted and sold let’s look at a product marketer’s responsibilities in each stage leading up to a product launch to get a better look at the life of a product marketer stage  customer development prelaunch a product marketers job is to play a key role in defining the target market and understanding the potential customer stage  positioning  messaging after customer development it’s the product marketer’s job to turn those learnings into something actionable  this typically comes in the form of a positioning document or a list of key messages product marketers try to answer these three questions with their positioning who is this product for what does this product do why is this product different than what’s out there stage  teaching out positioning  messaging now that positioning and messaging has been developed it’s the product marketers job to make sure that everyone at the company knows it positioning won’t stick unless everyone is on the same page so it’s important for product marketers to get buyin and teach out they key messages across the organization stage  creating a launch plan product marketers own the creation of a launch plan which typically involves various teams from across an organization including traditional marketing sales support and more at the end of the day most product marketers are measured on demand whether it be new signups crosssells or feature adoption so creating an effective launch plan is critical to a successful launch stage  creating launch content launch content is the glue to any launch plan  product marketers will work with almost every team inside of an organization on launch content including everything from demo decks to product screenshots sales materials blog content landing pages and website updates stage  preparing the team internal communication can be just as important as external communication for a product launch it’s the product marketer’s job to make sure the entire time is prepped and ready to go before launch this usually means everything from making sure the website is ready to go live to making sure that the support team is ready to field calls stage  launch the launch is the defining moment for a product marketer  this is when the rubber meets the road and customers start coming in — but the best product marketers are ready to adjust everything for a launch on the fly ps we go indepth on each one of these steps in our free guide on how to launch a product product marketing vs traditional marketing now that you know all that there still might be one question what makes product marketing different from traditional marketing aren’t the two de facto the same in short no they’re not traditional marketing focuses on acquiring and converting customers traditional

customers driving demand and adoption all with the goal of creating happy successful customers one of the best way to think about product marketing vs traditional marketing is by looking at the

what they each do the quick version goes a little something like this if product management’s job is to create and define new products and features product marketing’s job is to bring those things to

school of business university of southern california los angeles ca  usa     the marketing mix product products come in several forms consumer products can be categorized as convenience goods for which consumers are willing to invest very limited shopping efforts thus it is essential to have these products readily available and have the brand name well known shopping goods in contrast are goods in which the consumer is willing to invest a great deal of time and effort for example consumers will spend a great deal of time looking for a new car or a medical procedure specialty goods are those that are of interest only to a narrow segment of the population—eg drilling machines industrial goods can also be broken down into subgroups depending on their uses it should also be noted that within the context of marketing decisions the term product refers to more than tangible goods—a service can be a product too a firm’s product line or lines refers to the assortment of similar things that the firm holds brother for example has both a line of laser printers and one of typewriters in contrast the firm’s product mix describes the combination of different product lines that the firm holds boeing for example has both a commercial aircraft and a defense line of products that each take advantage of some of the same core competencies and technologies of the firm some firms have one very focused or narrow product line eg kfc does only chicken right while others maintain numerous lines that hopefully all have some common theme this represents a wide product mix m for example makes a large assortment of goods that are thought to be related in the sense that they use the firm’s ability to bond surfaces together depth refers to the variety that is offered within each product line maybelline offers a great deal of depth in lipsticks with subtle differences in shades while morton salt offers few varieties of its product products may be differentiated in several ways some may be represented as being of superior quality eg maytag or they may differ in more arbitrary ways in terms of styles—some people like one style better than another while there is no real consensus on which one is the superior one finally products can be differentiated in terms of offering different levels of service—for example volvo offers a guarantee of free reliable towing anywhere should the vehicle break down american express offers services not offered by many other charge cards new product develolopment new product development tends to happen in stages although firms often go back and forth between these idealized stages the following sequence is illustrative of the development of a new product new product strategy development different firms will have different strategies on how to approach new products some firms have stockholders who want to minimize risk and avoid investing in too many new innovations some firms can only survive if they innovate frequently and have stockholders who are willing to take this risk for example hewlettpackard has to constantly invent new products since competitors learn to work around its patents and will be able to manufacture the products at a lower cost idea generation firms solicit ideas as to new products it can make ideas might come from customers employees consultants or engineers many firms receive a large number of ideas each year and can only invest in some of them screening and evaluation some products that after some analysis are clearly not feasible or are not consistent with the core competencies of the firm are eliminated business analysis ideas are now exposed to more rigorous analysis profit projections risks market size and competitive response are considered if promising market research may be done development the product is designed and manufacturing facilities are planned market testing frequently firms will try to “test” a product in one region to see if it will sell in reality before it is released nationally and internationally there is a lesser risk if the firm only commits money to advertising and other marketing efforts in one region retailers will also be more receptive in other parts of the country and world if it has been demonstrated that the product sold well in one region the firm may also experiment with different prices for the product commercialization facilities to manufacture the product on a larger scale are now put into operation and the firm starts a national marketing campaign and distribution effort the product life cycle products often go through a life cycle initially a product is introduced since the product is not well known and is usually expensive eg as microwave ovens were in the late s sales are usually limited eventually however many products reach a growth phase—sales increase dramatically more firms enter with their models of the product frequently unfortunately the product will reach a maturity stage where little growth will be seen for example in the united states almost every household has at least one color tv set some products may also reach a decline stage usually because the product category is being replaced by something better for example typewriters experienced declining sales as more consumers switched to computers or other word processing equipment the product life cycle is tied to the phenomenon of diffusion of innovation when a new product comes out it is likely to first be adopted by consumers who are more innovative than others—they are willing to pay a premium price for the new product and take a risk on unproven technology it is important to be on the good side of innovators since many other later adopters will tend to rely for advice on the innovators who are thought to be more knowledgeable about new products for advice at later phases of the plc the firm may need to modify its market strategy for example facing a saturated market for baking soda in its traditional use arm  hammer launched a major campaign to get consumers to use the product to deodorize refrigerators deodorizing powders to be used before vacuuming were also created it is sometimes useful to think of products as being either new or existing many firms today rely increasingly on new products for a large part of their sales new products can be new in several ways they can be new to the market—noone else ever made a product like this before for example chrysler invented the minivan products can also be new to the firm—another firm invented the product but the firm is now making its own version for example ibm did not invent the personal computer but entered after other firms showed the market to have a high potential products can be new to the segment—eg cellular phones and pagers were first aimed at physicians and other priceinsensitive segments later firms decided to target the more pricesensitive mass market a product can be new for legal purposes because consumers tend to be attracted to “new and improved” products the federal trade commission ftc only allows firms to put that label on reformulated products for six months after a significant change has been made diffusion of innovation the diffusion of innovation refers to the tendency of new products practices or ideas to spread among people usually when new products or ideas come about they are initially only adopted by a small group of people later many innovations spread to other people the bell shaped curve frequently illustrates the rate of adoption of a new product cumulative adoptions are reflected by the sshaped curve the saturation point is the maximum proportion of consumers likely to adopt a product in the case of refrigerators in the us the saturation level is nearly one hundred percent of households the figure will almost certainly be well below that for video games that even when spread out to a large part of the population will be of interest to far from everyone several specific product categories have case histories that illustrate important issues in adoption until some time in the s few physicians bothered to scrub prior to surgery even though new scientific theories predicted that small microbes not visible to the naked eye could cause infection younger and more progressive physicians began scrubbing early on but they lacked the stature to make their older colleagues follow atm cards spread relatively quickly since the cards were used in public others who did not yet hold the cards could see how convenient they were although some people were concerned about security the convenience factors seemed to be a decisive factor in the “tugofwar” for and against adoption the case of credit cards was a bit more complicated and involved a “chicken­andegg” paradox accepting credit cards was not a particularly attractive option for retailers until they were carried by a large enough number of consumers consumers in contrast were not particularly interested in cards that were not accepted by a large number of retailers thus it was necessary to “jump start” the process signing up large corporate accounts under favorable terms early in the cycle after which the cards became worthwhile for retailers to accept rap music initially spread quickly among urban youths in large part because of the low costs of recording later rap music became popular among a very different segment suburban youths because of its apparently authentic depiction of an exotic urban lifestyle hybrid corn was adopted only slowly among many farmers although hybrid corn provided yields of about  more than traditional corn many farmers had difficulty believing that this smaller seed could provide a superior harvest they were usually reluctant to try it because a failed harvest could have serious economic consequences including a possible loss of the farm agricultural extension agents then sought out the most progressive farmers to try hybrid corn also aiming for farmers who were most respected and most likely to be imitated by others few farmers switched to hybrid corn outright from year to year instead many started out with a fraction of their land and gradually switched to  hybrid corn when this innovation had proven itself useful several forces often work against innovation one is risk which can be either social or financial for example early buyers of the cd player risked that few cds would be recorded before the cd player went the way of the  track player another risk is being perceived by others as being weird for trying a “fringe” product or idea for example barbara mandrel sings the song “i was country when country wasn’t cool” other sources of resistance include the initial effort needed to learn to use new products eg it takes time to learn to meditate or to learn how to use a computer and concerns about compatibility with the existing culture or technology for example birth control is incompatible with religious beliefs that predominate in some areas and a computer database is incompatible with a large established card file innovations come in different degrees a continuous innovation includes slight improvements over time very little usually changes from year to year in automobiles and even automobiles of the s are driven much the same way that automobiles of the  were driven a dynamically continuous innovation involves some change in technology although the product is used much the same way that its predecessors were used—eg jet vs propeller aircraft a discontinuous innovation involves a product that fundamentally changes the way that things are done—eg the fax and photocopiers in general discontinuous innovations are more difficult to market since greater changes are required in the way things are done but the rewards are also often significant several factors influence the speed with which an innovation spreads one issue is relative advantage ie the ratio of risk or cost to benefits some products such as cellular phones fax machines and atm cards have a strong relative advantage other products such as automobile satellite navigation systems entail some advantages but the cost ratio is high lower priced products often spread more quickly and the extent to which the product is trialable farmers did not have to plant all their land with hybrid corn at once while one usually has to buy a cellular phone to try it out influence the speed of diffusion finally the extent of switching difficulties influences speed—many offices were slow to adopt computers because users had to learn how to use them some cultures tend to adopt new products more quickly than others based on several factors modernity the extent to which the culture is receptive to new things in some countries such as britain and saudi arabia tradition is greatly valued—thus new products often don’t fare too well the united states in contrast tends to value progress homophily the more similar to each other that members of a culture are the more likely an innovation is to spread—people are more likely to imitate similar than different models the two most rapidly adopting countries in the world are the us and japan while the us interestingly scores very low japan scores high physical distance the greater the distance between people the less likely innovation is to spread opinion leadership the more opinion leaders are valued and respected the more likely an innovation is to spread the style of opinion leadersmoderates this influence however in less innovative countries opinion leaders tend to be more conservative ie to reflect the local norms of resistance it should be noted that innovation is not always an unqualifiedly good thing some innovations such as infant formula adopted in developing countries may do more harm than good individuals may also become dependent on the innovations for example travel agents who get used to booking online may be unable to process manual reservations sometimes innovations are disadopted for example many individuals disadopt cellular phones if they find out that they don’t end up using them much brands and branding an essential issue in product management is branding different firms have different policies on the branding on their products while m puts its brand name on a great diversity of products proctor  gamble on the opposite extreme maintains a separate brand name for each product in general the use of brand extensions should be evaluated on the basis of the compatibility of various products—can the same brand name represent different products without conflict or confusion coca cola for many years resisted putting its coveted brand name on a diet soft drink in the old days available sweeteners such as saccharin added an undesirable aftertaste implying a clear sacrifice in taste for the reduction in calories thus to avoid damaging the brand name coca cola coke instead named its diet cola tab only after nutrasweet was introduced was the brand extension allowed research shows that consumers are more receptive to brand extensions when  the company appears to have the expertise to make the product mcdonald’s was not thought as credible as a photofinishing service  the products are congruent compatible and  the brand extension is not seen as being exploitative of a high quality brand name eg one should not use a premium brand name like heineken to make a trivially easy product like popcorn in many markets brands of different strength compete against each other at the top level are national or international brands a large investment has usually been put into extensive brand building—including advertising distribution and if needed infrastructure support although some national brands are better regarded than others—eg dell has a better reputation than emachines—the national brands usually sell at higher prices than to regional and store brands regional brands as the name suggests are typically sold only in one area in some cases regional distribution is all that firms can initially accomplish with the investment capital and other resources that they have this means that advertising is usually done at the regional level this limits the advertising opportunities and thus the effect of advertising in some cases regional brands may eventually grow into national ones for example snapple® was a regional beverage while a regional beverage it became so successful that it was able to attract investments to allow a national launch in a similar manner some brands often start in a narrow niche—either nationally or regionally—and may eventually work their way up to a more inclusive national brand for example mars was originally a small brand that focused on liquor filled chocolate candy eventually the firm was able to expand store or private label brands are as the name suggests brands that are owned by retail store chains or consortia thereof for example vons and safeway have the same corporate parent and both carry the “select” brand typically store brands sell at lower prices than do national brands however because the chains do not have the external brand building costs the margins on the store brands are often higher retailers have a great deal of power because they control the placement of products within the store many place the store brand right next to the national brand and place a sign highlighting the cost savings on the store brand cobranding involves firms using two or more brands together to maximize appeal to consumers some ice cream makers for example use their own brand name in addition to naming the brands of ingredients contained sometimes this strategy may help one brand at the expense of the other it is widely believed for example that the “intel inside” messages which intel paid computer makers to put on their products and packaging reduced the value of the computer makers’ brand names because the emphasis was now put on the intel component certain “peripheral” characteristics of products may “signal” quality or other value to consumers for some products packaging accounts for a large part of the total product manufacturing cost long warranties often signal to consumers that the product is of good quality since the manufacturer is willing to take responsibility for its functioning the productservice continuum there is no clear distinction between a “pure” tangible product and a service most products contain some of both a computer for example is a tangible product but it often comes with a warranty and software
