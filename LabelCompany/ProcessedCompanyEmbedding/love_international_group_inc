new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost some of our potential competitors such as priceline google alibaba and amazon have access to significantly greater and more diversified resources than we do and they may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses eg search or mobile device businesses to enable them to compete more effectively with us potential competitors also include traditional travel agencies travel management companies wholesalers and tour operators many of which combine physical locations telephone services and online services in addition travel service providers including airlines hotel chains and tourism operators with which we conduct business compete with us in online channels to drive consumers to their own websites in lieu of thirdparty distributors such as us travel service providers may charge lower prices and in some instances offer advantages such as loyalty points or special discounts to members of closed user groups such as loyalty program participants or customers with registered accounts any of which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than our services further consolidation among travel service providers could result in lower rates of commission paid to online travel companies increased discounting and greater incentives for consumers to join closed user groups as such travel service providers expand their offerings        table of contents   intellectual property   at the present moment the company does not own any intellectual property   seasonality   we anticipate seasonal

company” as defined in section a of the securities act as modified by the jumpstart our business startups act of  the “jobs act” as such we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  the “sarbanesoxley act” reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we intend to take advantage of all of these exemptions   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards and delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period   we could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first common equity offering although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed  billion if we issue more than  billion in nonconvertible debt in any threeyear period or if we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule b under the exchange act   smaller reporting company   we also qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under rule b of the exchange act which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than  million to the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as are no longer an emerging growth company we will still have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements        table of contents   item a risk factors   certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form k and other reports we file with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to the securities exchange act of  as amended including our historical and financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material may also become important factors that adversely affect our business if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations liquidity cash flows and prospects could be materially and adversely affected as a result the price of our common stock could decline significantly and an investor could lose all or part of its investment in our common stock the risks discussed below include forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forwardlooking statements   risk related to our business and our industry   we will need additional capital to develop our ecommerce platform commence and sustain our operations and will likely need to seek further financing to accelerate our growth which we may not be able to obtain on acceptable terms or at all if we are unable to raise additional capital as needed the future growth of our business and operations would be severely limited   a factor limiting our growth including our ability to enter our proposed markets attract customers and deliver our ecommerce platform is is our limited capitalization overall and as compared to other companies in the industry   we will need additional capital to bring our operations to a sustainable level over the next twelve months we believe that we will require up to an additional  to satisfy our operating cash needs for the next  months however if we are unable to generate the projected amount of revenue and profits from our operations within the next  months we will need to seek additional financing   we may also seek additional financing to accelerate our growth if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities the percentage ownership of the company held by existing shareholders will be reduced and our shareholders may experience significant dilution in addition new securities may contain rights preferences or privileges that are senior to those of our common stock if we raise additional capital by incurring debt this will result in increased interest expense there can be no assurance that acceptable financing necessary to further implement our plan of operation can be obtained on suitable terms if at all our ability to develop our business could suffer if we are unable to raise additional funds on acceptable terms which would have the effect of limiting our ability to generate and increase our revenues develop our products attain profitable operations or even may result in our business filing for bankruptcy protection or otherwise ending our operations which could result in a significant or complete loss of your investment   we have incurred significant losses in prior periods and losses in the future could cause the trading price of our stock to decline or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition our ability to pay our debts as they become due and on our cash flows   we have incurred significant losses in prior periods our accumulated deficit at december   was  we incurred a net loss for the year ended december   and the eleven months ended december   of  and  respectively if we are not able to attain profitability in the near future and longterm future the trading price of our stock could decline and our financial condition could deteriorate as we could among other things deplete our cash incur additional indebtedness and issue additional equity that could cause significant dilution all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects and result in a significant or complete loss of your investment        table of contents   we have a limited operating history which may make it difficult for investors to predict future performance based on current operations   we have limited operating history upon which investors may base an evaluation of our potential future performance as a result there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop consistent revenue sources or that our operations will be profitable our prospects must be considered in light of the risks expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in early stage of development   any forecasts we make about our operations including without limitation sales and plans for raising capital may prove to be inaccurate we must among other things determine appropriate risks rewards and level of investment in each project respond to economic and market variables outside of our control respond to competitive developments and continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees there can be no assurance that we will be successful in meeting these challenges and addressing such risks and the failure to do so could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as a result the value of your investment could be significantly reduced or completely lost   our independent registered auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern   due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating and capital expenses in their reports on our audited annual financial statements as of december   and  and for the year ended december   and the eleven months ended december   our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern working capital deficiency and recurring losses from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern we plan to raise additional funds through equity financing in the future to meet our daily cash demands if required however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining further financing also the presence of the going concern explanatory paragraph may have an adverse impact on the relationships we are developing and plan to develop with third parties as we continue the commercialization of our products and could make it challenging and difficult for us to raise additional financing all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects and result in a significant or complete loss of your investment   our management have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting if we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses or other material weaknesses or other control deficiencies are identified we may not be able to report our financial results accurately in addition because of our status as an emerging growth company you will not be able to depend on any attestation from our independent registered public accountants as to our internal control over financial reporting for the foreseeable future   our internal control over financial reporting is not effective our management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which are indicative of many small companies with small staff  lack of a functioning audit committee  lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures  inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives  management dominated by two individuals without adequate compensating controls  lack of appropriate policies and procedures in place to evaluate the proper accounting and disclosures of key documents and agreements and  insufficient skilled accounting personnel with an appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states commensurate with our financial reporting requirements   in order to cure the foregoing material weakness we have taken or are taking the following remediation measures     · we intend to establish an audit committee of the board of directors as soon as practicable we envision that the audit committee will be primarily responsible for reviewing the services performed by our independent auditors evaluating our accounting policies and our system of internal controls   · we are committed to establishing the internal audit functions but due to limited qualified resources in the region we were not able to hire sufficient internal audit resources by december   and   · we plan to provide additional training to our accounting personnel on us gaap sec reporting and other regulatory requirements regarding the preparation of financial statements      table of contents   we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully remediate the material weaknesses or that other material weaknesses and control deficiencies will not be discovered in the future if our efforts are not successful or other material weaknesses or control deficiencies occur in the future we may be unable to report our financial results accurately on a timely basis which could cause our reported financial results to be materially misstated and result in the loss of investor confidence or delisting and cause the market price of our common stock to decline   our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest formally to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section  of the sarbanesoxley act until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the sec or the date we are no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jobs act accordingly you will not be able to depend on any attestation concerning our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accountants for the foreseeable future   our actual operating results may differ significantly from any guidance or estimates we may provide   from time to time we may release guidance estimates in our quarterly and annual earnings releases quarterly and annual earnings conference calls or otherwise regarding our future performance that represents our management’s estimates as of the date of release although we believe that any such guidance or estimates would provide investors and analysts with a better understanding of management’s expectations for the future and could be useful to our stockholders and potential stockholders such guidance or estimates would consist of forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements guidance and estimates are necessarily speculative in nature and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance or estimates may not materialize or may vary significantly from actual results our actual results may not always be in line with or exceed any guidance or estimates we may provide especially in times of economic uncertainty if our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or estimates or the expectations of investors or research analysts or if we reduce our guidance or estimates for future periods the market price of our common stock may decline in light of the foregoing investors are urged not to unduly rely upon any guidance or estimates in making an investment decision regarding our common stock   establishment and maintenance of the trusted status of our ecommerce platform and diy system will be critical to our success and any failure to do so could severely damage our reputation and brand which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   our establishment and maintenance of a strong brand name and reputation for our ecommerce platform and diy system in the markets we are operating in is critical any loss of trust in our platform and the diy system could harm the value of our brand and result in buyers and sellers ceasing to transact business on our marketplaces as well as participants reducing the level of their commercial activity in our ecommerce platform and the diy system which could materially reduce our revenue and profitability   our ability to maintain our position as a trusted platform for online and mobile commerce and diy system is based in large part upon     · the reliability and security of our platform and diy system   · the functionality of the services and functions we make available to participants on our platform and the diy system   · the rules governing our marketplaces   · the quality and breadth of services offered by sellers through our marketplaces   · the strength of our consumer protection measures and   · our ability to provide reliable and trusted payment and escrow services through our arrangements with online payment services      table of contents   we may not be able to establish maintain andor improve the network effects of our ecommerce platform and diy system which could negatively affect our business and prospects   our ability to maintain a healthy and vibrant ecommerce platform and diy system that create strong network effects between buyers sellers and other participants is critical to our success the extent to which we are able to maintain and strengthen these network effects depends on our ability to     · offer a secure and open platform and diy system for all participants   · provide tools and services that meet the evolving needs of buyers and sellers   · provide a wide range of highquality service offerings to buyers   · provide sellers with a high level of traffic flow with strong commercial intent and effective online marketing services   · enhance the attractiveness of our mobile platform   · arrange secure and trusted payment settlement and escrow services   · coordinate fulfillment and delivery services with thirdparty logistics and delivery companies   · attract and retain third party service providers who are able to provide quality services on commercially reasonable terms to our sellers   · maintain the quality of our customer service and   · continue adapting to the changing demands of the market   in addition changes we may make to enhance and improve our ecommerce platform and diy system and balance the needs and interests of the various participants on our ecosystem may be viewed positively from one participant group’s perspective such as buyers but may have negative effects from another group’s perspective such as sellers if we fail to balance the interests of all participants on our ecommerce platform and diy system buyers sellers and other participants may stop visiting our marketplaces conduct fewer transactions or use alternative platforms any of which could result in a material decrease in our revenue and net income   user behavior on mobile devices is rapidly evolving and if we fail to successfully adapt to these changes our competitiveness and market position may suffer   buyers sellers and other participants are increasingly using mobile devices in the markets we plan to operate for a wide range of purposes including for ecommerce while a significant and growing portion of participants are anticipated to access our ecommerce platform and diy system through mobile devices this area is relatively new and developing rapidly and we may not be able to continue to increase the level of mobile access to and engagement on our marketplace and system the variety of technical and other configurations across different mobile devices and platforms increases the challenges associated with this environment our ability to successfully expand the use of mobile devices to access our platform and diy system is affected by the following factors     · our ability to provide a compelling commerce platform and diy system and tools in a multidevice environment   · the quality of our mobile offerings or mobilebased payment services   · our ability to successfully deploy apps on popular mobile operating systems that we do not control such as ios and android   · our ability to adapt to the device standards used by thirdparty manufacturers and distributors and   · the attractiveness of alternative platforms   if we are unable to attract significant numbers of new mobile buyers and increase levels of mobile engagement our ability to maintain or grow our business would be materially and adversely affected   we may not be able to successfully monetize traffic on our mobile platform and diy system which could have a material adverse effect on our business   we anticipate a large percentage of our users will access our marketplace through mobile devices our ability to monetize our mobile user traffic will be critical to our business and our growth we face a number of challenges to successfully monetizing our mobile user traffic including     · providing marketing services in a compelling and effective manner on mobile devices   · developing alternative sources of revenue generated from mobile access to our marketplaces   · offering a comprehensive user experience on our mobile apps and   · ensuring that the mobile services we provide are secure and trusted        table of contents   if as we experience increased use of mobile devices for mobile commerce we are unable to monetize that increased use our business may not grow or could decline and our revenues and net income would be materially reduced going forward we believe our financial results will become increasingly dependent on our ability to monetize the use of mobile devices to access our marketplaces we expect this trend will have a greater effect on our business to the extent that shopping on mobile devices displaces transactions that could have occurred on personal computers   if we are unable to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected   we face intense competition from chinese and global internet companies as well as from offline travel service providers and tourist operators particularly those establishing online marketplaces we compete to attract engage and retain buyers based on the variety and value of airline tickets and hotels listed on our marketplace and tourist activities on our diy system overall user experience and convenience and availability of payment settlement and logistics services we compete to attract and retain sellers based on our size and the engagement of buyers and the effectiveness and value of the marketing services we offer we also compete based on the usefulness of the services we provide including the availability of supporting services including payment settlement and logistics services and the quality of our customer service we also compete for motivated and effective talent and personnel including engineers that serve critical functions in the development of our ecosystem   our ability to compete depends on a number of other factors as well some of which may be out of our control including     · the timely introduction and market acceptance of the services we offer compared to those of our competitors   · our ability to innovate and develop new technologies   · our ability to maintain and enhance our leading position in mobile commerce initially in china and hong kong   · our ability to benefit from new business initiatives and   · alliances acquisitions or consolidations within the internet industry that may result in stronger competitors   if we are not able to compete effectively the gross services volume transacted on our marketplaces and the user activity level on our platform may decrease significantly which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our brand   if we are not able to continue to innovate or if we fail to adapt to changes in our industry our business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected   the internet industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new service and product introductions and changing customer demands furthermore our competitors are constantly developing innovations in internet search online marketing communications social networking and other services to enhance users’ online experience we anticipate investing significant resources in our infrastructure research and development and other areas in order to enhance our platform technology and diy system and our anticipated services as well as to introduce new high quality services that will attract more participants to our ecommerce platform and diy system the changes and developments taking place in our industry may also require us to reevaluate our business model and adopt significant changes to our longterm strategies and business plan our failure to innovate and adapt to these changes would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   our business generates and processes a large amount of data and the improper use or disclosure of such data could harm our reputation as well as have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects   our marketplace and ecommerce platform and diy system will generate and process a large quantity of personal transaction demographic and behavioral data we face risks inherent in handling large volumes of data and in protecting the security of such data in particular we face a number of challenges relating to data from transactions and other activities on our platform including     · protecting the data in and hosted on our system including against attacks on our system by outside parties or fraudulent behavior by our employees   · addressing concerns related to privacy and sharing safety security and other factors and   · complying with applicable laws rules and regulations relating to the collection use disclosure or security of personal information including any requests from regulatory and government authorities relating to such data        table of contents   any system failure or security breach or lapse that results in the release of user data could harm our reputation and brand and consequently our business in addition to exposing us to potential legal liability   as we expand our operations we may be subject to additional laws in other jurisdictions where our sellers buyers and other participants are located the laws rules and regulations of other jurisdictions may impose more stringent or conflicting requirements and penalties than those in china compliance with which could require significant resources and costs our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection use and disclosure of user data are posted on our websites any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or privacy protectionrelated laws rules and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others these proceedings or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity require us to change our business practices increase our costs and severely disrupt our business   we may not be able to achieve maintain or grow revenue from our operations   we anticipate primarily deriving our revenue from commissions based on transaction value derived from sales on our ecommerce platform diy system and from online marketing services we anticipate our marketing customers will be the travel service providers and tourist activity operators who are sellers on our ecommerce platform andor our diy system marketing customers do not have longterm marketing commitments with us the price a merchant is willing to pay for online marketing services generally depends on its expected gross service volume profit margins and lifetime value of customers derived from such marketing investment if those services do not generate the rate of return expected by the seller or rates that are competitive to alternatives the seller may reduce its spending on the marketing services we offer in addition if we display fewer marketing impressions on our mobile applications as compared to our personal computerbased applications our revenue growth rate may be affected by the rising usage of mobile devices   in addition our revenue growth may be slow or our revenues may decline for other reasons including decreasing consumer spending increasing competition slowing growth of the online and offline providers of cheap airline tickets hotels and tourist activities and changes in government policies or general economic conditions in addition our revenue growth rate will likely decline as our revenue grows to higher levels   failure to maintain or improve our technology infrastructure could harm our business and prospects   we anticipate constantly upgrading our ecommerce platform and diy system to provide increased scale improved performance for both online and mobile use of our platform and diy system upgrading our ecommerce platform require significant investments of time and resources including adding new hardware updating software and recruiting and training new engineering personnel maintaining and improving our technology infrastructure require significant levels of investment adverse consequences could include unanticipated system disruptions slower response times impaired quality of buyers’ and sellers’ experiences and delays in reporting accurate operating and financial information   the successful operation of our business significantly depends upon the performance and reliability of the internet infrastructure in china   our business significantly depends on the performance and reliability of the internet infrastructure in china for example in china almost all access to the internet is maintained through stateowned telecommunication operators under the administrative control and regulatory supervision of the ministry of industry and information technology of china in addition the national networks in china are connected to the internet through stateowned international gateways which are the only channels through which a domestic user can connect to the internet outside of china we may not have access to alternative networks in the event of disruptions failures or other problems with china’s internet infrastructure in addition the internet infrastructure in china may not support the demands associated with continued growth in internet usage        table of contents   the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide us with the requisite bandwidth could also interfere with the speed and availability of our websites we have no control over the costs of the services provided by the national telecommunications operators if the prices that we pay for telecommunications and internet services rise significantly our gross margins could be adversely affected in addition if internet access fees or other charges to internet users increase our user traffic may decrease which in turn may significantly decrease our revenues   our ecosystem could be disrupted by network interruptions   our ecosystem depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems substantially all of our computer hardware is being developing in hong kong although we will be prepared for contingencies through redundancy measures and disaster recovery plans such preparation may not be sufficient and we do not carry business interruption insurance despite any precautions we may take the occurrence of a natural disaster such as an earthquake flood or fire or other unanticipated problems at our facilities in china including power outages telecommunications delays or failures breakins to our systems or computer viruses could result in delays or interruptions to our marketplaces and platforms loss of our and customers’ data and business interruption for us and our customers any of these events could damage our reputation significantly disrupt our operations and the operations of the sellers and other participants in our ecosystem and subject us to liability which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   if thirdparty service providers on our ecosystem fail to provide reliable or satisfactory services our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected   in addition to the services provided to our ecosystem by payment processing and logistics providers a number of thirdparty participants including marketing affiliates retail operational partners independent software vendors or isvs and various professional service providers also provide services to sellers we do not have any agreements that require these thirdparty participants to provide services to sellers to the extent these thirdparty service providers are unable to provide satisfactory services to sellers on commercially acceptable terms or at all or if we fail to retain existing or attract new quality service providers to our marketplaces our ability to retain or attract sellers and buyers may be severely limited which may have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   failure to deal effectively with any fraud perpetrated and fictitious transactions conducted on our ecommerce platform and other sources of customer dissatisfaction would harm our business   we face risks with respect to fraudulent activities on our ecommerce platform and may periodically receive complaints from buyers who may not have received the services that they had purchased as well as complaints from sellers who have not received payment for the services that a buyer had contracted to purchase although we will implement various measures to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent activities on our ecommerce platform there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in combating fraudulent transactions or improving overall satisfaction among our sellers buyers and other participants additional measures that we take to address fraud could also negatively affect the attractiveness of our ecommerce platform to buyers or sellers   in addition to fraudulent transactions with legitimate buyers sellers may also engage in fictitious or “phantom” transactions with themselves or collaborators in order to artificially inflate their own ratings on our ecommerce platform reputation and search results rankings this activity may harm other sellers by enabling the perpetrating seller to be favored over legitimate sellers and may harm buyers by deceiving them into believing that a seller is more reliable or trusted than the seller actually is   negative publicity and user sentiment generated as a result of actual or alleged fraudulent or deceptive conduct on our platform could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use of our services reduce our ability to attract new or retain current sellers buyers and other participants damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brand names and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations        table of contents   we are subject to regulation and future regulations may impose additional requirements and other obligations on our business or otherwise that could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   the industries in which we operate in the prc including online and mobile commerce and payments are highly regulated the prc government authorities are likely to continue to issue new laws rules and regulations governing these industries enhance enforcement of existing laws rules and regulations and require new and additional licenses permits and approvals from us and our users these laws rules and regulations and their application to us could take a direction that is adverse to our business at any time in addition there is no assurance that any required licenses permits and approvals could be obtained in a timely or costeffective manner and failure to obtain them could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations changes in regulatory enforcement as well as tax policy in the prc could also result in additional compliance obligations and increased costs or place restrictions upon our current or future operations any such legislation or regulation could also severely disrupt and constrain our business and the payment services used on our ecommerce platform in addition we will also face the challenge of complying concurrently with the compliance rules and regulations of multiple jurisdictions and such rules or regulations could conflict or interact with each other in complex ways   we may be subject to prc and other foreign government inquiries and investigations including those relating to website content and alleged thirdparty intellectual property infringement we also face scrutiny and may be subject to inquiries and investigations from foreign governmental bodies that focus on crossborder trade intellectual property protection human rights and user privacy matters as we establish our operations and continue to grow in scale and significance we expect to face increased scrutiny which will at a minimum result in our having to increase our investment in compliance and related capabilities and systems the increasing sophistication and development of our user base will also increase the need for higher standards of user protection privacy protection and dispute management any increased involvement in inquiries or investigations could result in significantly higher legal and other costs diversion of management and other resources as well as negative publicity which could harm our business and reputation and materially reduce our revenue and net income   we may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties and content restrictions of relevant laws   third parties may claim that the technology used in the operation of our platforms andor diy system infringes upon their intellectual property rights although we have not in the past faced material litigation involving direct claims of infringement by us the possibility of intellectual property claims against us increases as we continue to grow particularly internationally such claims whether or not having merit may result in our expenditure of significant financial and management resources injunctions against us or payment of damages we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all these risks have been amplified by the increase in the number of third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims   china has enacted laws and regulations governing internet access and the distribution of products services news information audiovideo programs and other content through the internet the prc government has prohibited the distribution of information through the internet that it deems to be in violation of prc laws and regulations if any of the information disseminated through our ecommerce platform diy system and websites were deemed by the prc government to violate any content restrictions we would not be able to continue to display such content and could become subject to penalties including confiscation of income fines suspension of business and revocation of required licenses which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   the outcome of any claims investigations and proceedings is inherently uncertain and in any event defending against these claims could be both costly and timeconsuming and could significantly divert the efforts and resources of our management and other personnel an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings could cause us to pay damages as well as legal and other costs limit our ability to conduct business or require us to change the manner in which we operate   we may face challenges in expanding our crossborder operations   as we plan to continue expanding our strategy on crossborder operations into other markets we will face risks associated with expanding into markets in which we have limited or no experience and in which our company may be less wellknown we may be unable to attract a sufficient number of customers and other participants fail to anticipate competitive conditions or face difficulties in operating effectively in these new markets the expansion of our crossborder business will also expose us to risks relating to staffing and managing crossborder operations increased costs to protect intellectual property tariffs and other trade barriers differing and potentially adverse tax consequences increased and conflicting regulatory compliance requirements lack of acceptance of our service offerings challenges caused by distance language and cultural differences exchange rate risk and political instability accordingly any efforts we make to expand our crossborder operations may not be successful which could limit our ability to grow our revenue net income and profitability        table of contents   our brand name and our business may be harmed by aggressive marketing and communications strategies of our competitors   due to intense competition in our industry we may be the target of incomplete inaccurate and false statements about our company and our services that could damage our and our management’s reputation and our brand and materially deter consumers from making purchases on our ecommerce platform and diy system our ability to respond to our competitors’ misleading marketing efforts may be limited by legal prohibitions on permissible public communications by us during our initial public offering process or during future periods   our revenue and net income may be materially and adversely affected by any economic slowdown in asia as well as globally   the success of our business ultimately depends on consumer spending upon the commencement of operations we anticipate deriving a significant amount of our revenue from asia as a result our revenue and net income are impacted to a significant extent by economic conditions in asia and globally as well as economic conditions specific to online and mobile commerce the global economy markets and levels of consumer spending are influenced by many factors beyond our control including consumer perception of current and future economic conditions political uncertainty levels of employment inflation or deflation real disposable income interest rates taxation and currency exchange rates   the prc government has in recent years implemented a number of measures to control the rate of economic growth including by raising interest rates and adjusting deposit reserve ratios for commercial banks as well as by implementing other measures designed to tighten credit and liquidity these measures have contributed to a slowdown of the prc economy any continuing or worsening slowdown could significantly reduce domestic commerce in china including through the internet generally and within our ecosystem an economic downturn whether actual or perceived a further decrease in economic growth rates or an otherwise uncertain economic outlook in china or any other market in which we may operate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights   we will rely on a combination of trademark fair trade practice patent copyright and trade secret protection laws in china and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights we will also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and any third parties who may access our proprietary information and we will rigorously control access to our proprietary technology and information   intellectual property protection may not be sufficient in china or other countries in which we operate confidentiality agreements may be breached by counterparties and there may not be adequate remedies available to us for any such breach accordingly we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights or to enforce our contractual rights in china or elsewhere in addition policing any unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult timeconsuming and costly and the steps we have taken may be inadequate to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property in the event that we resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managerial and financial resources we can provide no assurance that we will prevail in such litigation in addition our trade secrets may be leaked or otherwise become available to or be independently discovered by our competitors any failure in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations        table of contents   we may be subject to claims under consumer protection laws including health and safety claims if property or people are harmed by the services sold on our ecommerce platform   due to several highprofile incidents involving food safety and consumer complaints that have occurred in china in recent years the prc government media outlets and public advocacy groups are increasingly focused on consumer protection operators of ecommerce platforms are subject to certain provisions of consumer protection laws even where such operator is not the seller of the product or service purchased by the consumer for example under applicable consumer protection laws in china ecommerce platform operators may be held liable for consumer claims relating to damage if they are unable to provide consumers with the true name address and contact details of service providers in addition if we do not take appropriate remedial action against service providers for actions they engage in that we know or should have known would infringe upon the rights and interests of consumers we may be held jointly liable with the service provider for such infringement moreover applicable consumer protection laws in china hold that trading platforms will be held liable for failing to meet any undertakings such platforms make to consumers with regard to services listed on their websites furthermore we are required to report to the state administration for industry  commerce “saic” in china or its local branches any violation of applicable laws regulations or saic rules by service providers such as sales of services without proper license or authorization and to take appropriate remedial measures including ceasing to provide services to such service providers if claims are brought against us under any of these laws we could be subject to damages and reputational damage as well as action by regulators which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we do not maintain product liability insurance for services transacted on our ecommerce platform and our rights of indemnity from the service providers on our ecommerce platform may not adequately cover us for any liability we may incur even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds and management time and resources and could materially reduce our net income and profitability   tightening of tax compliance efforts with respect to the revenue or profit generated by our sellers could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   ecommerce in china is still developing and the people’s republic of china “prc” government may require operators of ecommerce platform such as our company to assist in the collection of taxes with respect to the revenue or profit generated by sellers from transactions conducted on their platforms a significant number of small businesses and sole proprietors operating businesses through storefronts on the ecommerce platform may not have completed the required tax registration prc tax authorities may enforce registration requirements that target small businesses or sole proprietors on the ecommerce platform and may request our assistance in these efforts as a result these sellers may be subject to more stringent tax compliance requirements and liabilities and their business on our ecommerce platform and diy system could suffer or they could decide to remove their storefronts from our marketplace rather than comply which could in turn negatively affect us we may also be requested by tax authorities to supply information on our sellers such as transaction records and bank account information and assist in the enforcement of tax regulations including the payment and withholding obligations against our sellers in which case potential sellers might not be willing to open storefronts on our ecommerce platform   heightened enforcement against participants in ecommerce transactions including imposition of withholding obligations on us with respect to business or valueadded tax could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   we may be subject to material litigation   we may in the future be involved in litigation relating principally to thirdparty intellectual property infringement claims contract disputes employment related cases and other matters in the ordinary course of our business as our ecosystem expands and as litigation becomes more common in china we may face an increasing number of such claims including those involving higher amounts of damages   the outcome of any claims investigations and proceedings is inherently uncertain and in any event defending against these claims could be both costly and timeconsuming and could significantly divert the efforts and resources of our management and other personnel an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings could cause us to pay damages as well as legal and other costs limit our ability to conduct business or require us to change the manner in which we operate   we may be subject to liability for content on our websites and mobile interfaces that is alleged to be socially destabilizing obscene defamatory libelous or otherwise unlawful   under prc law we are required to monitor our websites and the websites hosted on our servers and mobile interfaces for items or content deemed to be socially destabilizing obscene superstitious or defamatory as well as items content or services that are illegal to sell online or otherwise in other jurisdictions in which we operate our ecommerce platform and promptly take appropriate action with respect to such items content or services we may also be subject to potential liability for any unlawful actions of our customers or users of our websites or mobile interfaces or for content we distribute that is deemed inappropriate it may be difficult to determine the type of content that may result in liability to us and if we are found to be liable we may be subject to fines have our relevant business operation licenses revoked or be prevented from operating our websites or mobile interfaces in china        table of contents   in addition claims may be brought against us for defamation libel negligence copyright patent or trademark infringement tort including personal injury other unlawful activity or other theories and claims based on the nature and content of information posted on our ecommerce platform including product reviews and message boards by our buyers sellers and other marketplace participants   regardless of the outcome of such a dispute or lawsuit we may suffer from negative publicity and reputational damage as a result of these actions   we depend on our senior management team and the loss of one or more key employees the failure of new executive officers to integrate with our management team or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could have a negative impact on our business   our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of the key members of our senior management team including yong qiang yang who serves as the companys president and a director and wei min jin who serves as the company’s chief financial officer secretary and a director because each member of our senior management team has a different area of specialization the departure of any one of these individuals could create a deficiency in one of the core aspects of our business any failure of our management team to successfully integrate could also have a negative impact on our business we are also dependent on the efforts of our team of technology professionals and on our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled and often specialized personnel particularly in light of the rapid pace of technological advances the level of competition in the technology industry for individuals with this level of experience or these skills is intense significant losses of key personnel particularly to competitors could make it difficult for us to compete successfully in addition we may be unable to attract and retain qualified management and personnel in the future including in relation to any diversification of our product and service offerings into new asset classes andor new geographic locations   our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities which could materially and adversely affect us and cause our stock price to decline significantly   we are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct misconduct by employees could include the misappropriation of funds intellectual property or our customers’ proprietary information employee misconduct is not always possible to deter or prevent and any precautions we may take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases we may incur negative publicity and reputational harm as a result of any improper activities by our employees in addition any employee fraud or misconduct may give rise to litigation which could be timeconsuming to our management team costly and could have a material adverse effect on us and cause our stock price to decline significantly

shares   our common stock is currently traded on the over the counter otc market on the otcqb exchange and there is currently only a limited public trading market for our common stock we cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in the company and our common stock will lead to the development or continuance of an active trading market or how liquid that trading market for our common stock might become if an active trading market for our common stock does not develop or is not sustained it may be difficult for investors to sell shares particularly large quantities of our common stock at a price that is attractive or at all as a result an investment in our common stock may be illiquid and investors may not be able to liquidate their investment readily or at all when they desire to sell        table of contents   regulation of penny stocks   the u s securities and exchange commission sec has adopted a number of rules to regulate penny stocks because the securities

platform will be priced competitively if not lower than the marketplace as the company plans on partnering with some of the airlines and big airline ticket wholesalers as for the diy system the company anticipates gaining market share based on the originality and specialty of the travel activities to be offered on the companys online platform through local travel companies andor travel specialists that the company is going to partner with   the company does not yet have any operations and the development of its business is speculative the company will require additional financing

tourist activities are intensely competitive a trend we expect to continue and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost some of our potential competitors such as priceline google alibaba and amazon have access to significantly greater and more diversified resources than we do and they may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses eg search or mobile device businesses to enable them to compete more effectively with us potential competitors also include traditional travel agencies travel management companies wholesalers and tour operators many of which combine physical locations telephone services and online services in addition travel service providers including airlines hotel chains and tourism operators with which we conduct business compete with us in online channels to drive consumers to their own websites in lieu of thirdparty distributors such as us travel service providers may charge lower prices and in some instances offer advantages such as loyalty points or special discounts to members of closed user groups such as loyalty program participants or customers with registered accounts any of which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than our services further consolidation among travel service providers could result in lower rates of commission paid to online travel companies increased discounting and greater incentives for consumers to join closed user groups as such travel service providers expand their offerings   intellectual property   at the present moment the company does not own any intellectual property   seasonality   we anticipate seasonal fluctuations in our net revenues and net income from our services once we commence operations we anticipate

disclosure        table of contents   managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules af and df under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives with the participation of our president and chief financial officer our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control – integrated framework  based upon such evaluation our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on the coso framework criteria as more fully described below this was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses   the matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the public company accounting oversight board were  lack of a functioning audit committee  lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures  inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives  management dominated by two individuals without adequate compensating controls  lack of appropriate policies and procedures in place to evaluate the proper accounting and disclosures of key documents and agreements and  insufficient skilled accounting personnel with an appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states commensurate with our financial reporting requirements the aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our president and chief financial officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of december     in order to cure the foregoing material weakness we have taken or are taking the following remediation measures     · we intend to establish an audit committee of the board of directors as soon as practicable we envision that the audit committee will be primarily responsible for reviewing the services performed by our independent auditors evaluating our accounting policies and our system of internal controls   · we are committed to establishing the internal audit functions but due to limited qualified resources in the region we were not able to hire sufficient internal audit resources by december     · we plan to provide additional training to our accounting personnel on us gaap sec reporting and other regulatory requirements regarding the preparation of financial statements   despite the material weakness and deficiencies reported above our management believes that our financial statements included in this annual report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented and that this annual report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the

daily cash demands if required however there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining further financing on terms acceptable to the company until and unless it is able to

change in these financial statements including the notes thereto the company reported its financial results for the year ended december   with corresponding results for the fiscal period ended

affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material effect on the companys reported financial position and results of operations   foreign currency transactions   the reporting currency of

to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date this topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value certain current assets and current liabilities are financial instruments management believes their carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and if applicable their current interest rates are equivalent to interest rates currently available the three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows     · level  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets         · level  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instruments         · level  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement   the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities such as cash and cash equivalents

undiscounted future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset   stockbased compensation   the company adopted asc  compensation – stockbased compensation  to account for its stock options and similar equity instruments issued accordingly compensation costs attributable to stock options or similar equity instruments granted are measured at the fair value at the grant date and expensed over the expected vesting period asc  requires excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow

than not that the assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the period that
