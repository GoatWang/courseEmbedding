arrangements for financing in addition to the financing contemplated by this prospectus we may not be able to obtain financing when required obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors including the market prices for uranium and the costs of exploring for or commercial production of this material the mineral exploration industry in general is intensely competitive and even if commercial quantities of reserves are discovered a ready market may not exist for the sale of the reserves most companies operating in this industry are more established and have greater resources to engage in the production of mineral claims we were incorporated on november   and our operations are not wellestablished our resources at the present time are limited we may exhaust all of our resources and be unable to complete full exploration of our mineral claim there is also significant competition to retain qualified personnel to assist in conducting mineral exploration activities if a commercially viable deposit is found to exist and we are unable to retai additional qualified personnel we may be unable to enter into production and achieve profitable operations these factors set forth above could inhibit our ability to compete with other companies in the industry and enter into production of the mineral claim if a commercial viable deposit is found to exist numerous factors beyond our control may affect the marketability of any substances discovered these factors include market fluctuations the proximity and capacity of natural resource markets and processing equipment government regulations including regulations relating to prices taxes royalties land tenure land use importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection the exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted but the combination of these factors may result in our not receiving an adequate return on invested capital company description we are an

planned exploration budget requires the expenditure of  in the early summer of  plus the expenditure of an additional  in the early summer of  if recommended by our consulting geologist further exploration activities beyond our currently planned exploration programs will be dependent upon a number of factors including our consulting geologist’s recommendations based upon the exploration program results and our available funds in order to prove or disprove the economic viability of our mineral claim our mineral exploration costs plus our operating costs could amount to many millions

arrangements for financing in addition to the financing contemplated by this prospectus we may not be able to obtain financing when required obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors including the market prices for uranium and the costs of exploring for or commercial production of this material the mineral exploration industry in general is intensely competitive and even if commercial quantities of reserves are discovered a ready market may not exist for the sale of the reserves most companies operating in this industry are more established and have greater resources to engage in the production of mineral claims we were incorporated on november   and our operations are not wellestablished our resources at the present time are limited we may exhaust all of our resources and be unable to complete full exploration of our mineral claim there is also significant competition to retain qualified personnel to assist in conducting mineral exploration activities if a commercially viable deposit is found to exist and we are unable to retai additional qualified personnel we may be unable to enter into production and achieve profitable operations these factors set forth above could inhibit our ability to compete with other companies in the industry and enter into production of the mineral claim if a commercial viable deposit is found to exist numerous factors beyond our control may affect the marketability of any substances discovered these factors include market fluctuations the proximity and capacity of natural resource markets and processing equipment government regulations including regulations relating to prices taxes royalties land tenure land use importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection the exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted but the combination of these factors may result in our not receiving an adequate return on invested capital company description we are an

planned exploration budget requires the expenditure of  in the early summer of  plus the expenditure of an additional  in the early summer of  if recommended by our consulting geologist further exploration activities beyond our currently planned exploration programs will be dependent upon a number of factors including our consulting geologist’s recommendations based upon the exploration
