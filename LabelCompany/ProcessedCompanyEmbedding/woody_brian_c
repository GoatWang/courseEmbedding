contacted me to provide notary and courier services to the secretary of state for his business u t equity group llc and symbolic capital partners  to add credibility to the telephone conversation and

state filing fee on his behalf which was never repaid im absolutely amazed that one friend would besmirch the good name of another and that brian cannot afford to pay the  fee advanced on his behalf had i looked closer i would have noticed that brian c woody hides behind legal zoom as the agent for service of process and fails to provide an accurate business address for service for small claims court filings  he must have a lot to hide or has gotten very good at ducking out on his financial obligations i am more amazed at the lack of conscience and moral fiber  how does one ignore daily email requests for payment  i hope brian learns the words honesty integrity ethics values and standards and incorporates them into his business model you should contact your good buddy jj and figure

thank you for verifying that payments have not cleared your financial institution  typically payments are issued by the business entity however to obtain a business checking account the entity must be in good standing with the secretary of state have current statement of officers on file and have money on deposit  under certain circumstances a business entity such as brian c wood managing partner u t equity group llc and symbolic capital partners do not qualify and must rely on cashiers or personal checks  in this instance funds were advanced on behalf of brian c wood managing partner u t equity group llc and symbolic capital partners who failed to repay the debt upon receipt of proof of payment or overpayment a refund and a welldeserved public apology will be issued  until such time you may seek financial redress through the county of sacramento small claims division where the alleged extortion would have occurred  please be certain to attach copies of the negotiated cashiers checks to the court filing to receive a refund of the purported overpayment forward copies of the negotiated instruments as proof of payments and the correct mailing address to mail the refund  until such time im looking forward to further communication with the undisclosed local authorities california secretary of state attorney general and the fraud investigations unit at wells fargo  extort  definition of extort to obtain from a person by ingenuity or compelling argument paying a business debt is a compelling argument dont you agree rule of the board do not sign your name or include any email

merely copied and reposted a link to your current rip off report looks like you must really have something to hide seeing as how you refuse to use your name in any and all of your posts to prevent people from finding the real truth about you and your criminal ways your small minded attempts to use this posting format to extort more money are failing miserably i have sent you you your payment of  three separate times now and have the receipts to prove i also have a letter from our bank wells fargo showing that three separate chashiers checks have been cashed at a bank of america surprisingly with in miles of you home address your continued attempts to threaten and extort me or my company have failed so give up you poor pathetic thief and go find another victim like the realtor guy you screwed over in your own home town also your bullshit about notaries submitting to background checks only pertains to the initial application after which you can pretty much committ as much fraud as possible until enough evidence mounts and then the investigations began sounds like your getting close to that point so good luck with that and i have in fact reported you to the local authorities california secetary of state attorney general and the fraud investigations unit at wells fargo respond to this report whats this are you an owner employee or exemployee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual or can you provide insider information on this company  author of original report brian c wood says johnnie wet my pants author notary  united states of america submitted monday february   posted monday february   scurrilous libelous accusations dont obviate the responsibility to pay a miniscule legitimate business debt unfortunately buffooneries and coarsely presented libelous jocular comments represent u t equity group llc and symbolic capital partners and forebode the careless business practices one might expect from a company that engages in such dialoguebrian c wood managing partner u t equity group llc and symbolic capital partners failed to pay for contracted courier services  to intimate identity theft is the equivalent of johnnie wet my pants notaries submit to a department of justice and fbi background investigations prior to receiving a commission  if brian c wood managing partner u t equity group llc and symbolic capital partners believes there is a violation of the public trust the correct venue to report said infraction is the state of california secretary of state debra bowen at wwwsoscagov please find a copy of your last communication committing to repay the fees advanced on your behalfkatrina thank you again for taking the time to speak with me today i look forward to making this

t equity group llc and symbolic capital partners to add credibility to the telephone conversation and request brian invoked the name of business associate known to have perfect integritybased on the integrity of the business associate i performed all requested services and advanced the secretary of state filing fee on his behalf which was never repaidim absolutely amazed that one friend would besmirch the good name of another and that brian cannot afford to pay the  fee advanced on his behalfhad i looked closer i would have noticed that brian c woody hides behind legal zoom as the agent for service of process and fails to provide an accurate business address for service for small claims court filings he must have a lot to hide or has gotten very good at ducking out on his financial obligationsi am more amazed at the lack of conscience and moral fiber how does one ignore daily email requests for payment i hope brian learns the words honesty integrity ethics values and standards and incorporates them into his business modelyou should contact your good buddy jj and figure out how to pay the measly  fee i advanced to you you big corporate giant you mark as useful post reply
