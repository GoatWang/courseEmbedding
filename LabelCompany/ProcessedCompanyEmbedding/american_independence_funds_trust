investments involve risk including the loss of principal investing in a singlesector mutual fund involves greater risk and potential reward than investing in a more diversified fund by concentrating on a small number of holdings the fund carries greater risk because each investment has a greater effect on the fund’s overall performance the return of principal in bond funds is not guaranteed bond funds have the same interest rate inflation and credit risks that are associated with the underlying bonds owned by the fund generally the value of a bond fund rises when interest rates fall and falls when interest rates risegeneral etf risk the cost to a shareholder of investing in the fund may be higher than the cost of investing directly in etf shares and may be higher than other mutual funds that invest directly in equities you will indirectly bear fees and expenses charged by the etfs in addition to the fund’s direct fees and expensesforeign securities risk international investing involves risks including risks related to foreign currency limited liquidity less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political economic or other developments these risks often are heightened for investments in emergingdeveloping markets or smaller capital marketsquantitative investment strategies risk manifold partners may rely on quantitative models both proprietary models developed by manifold partners and those supplied by third parties and information and data supplied by third parties “models and data” in managing the fund models and data are used to assist in determining investments and to provide risk management insightsmodels and data may prove to be incorrect or incomplete in such cases any decisions made in reliance thereon can expose the fund to potential risks some of the models used by manifold partners are predictive in nature predictive models generally depend on the assumption that the future performance of a specific investment can be predicted based on the correlation of the past performance of the investment with the past performance of other investments or economic or financial data the use of predictive models presents inherent risks because predictive models are usually constructed based on historical data supplied by third parties the success of relying on such models may depend heavily on the accuracy and reliability of the supplied historical data additionally market dynamics change over time and correlations that existed in the past may diminish or end a model may fail to provide correct predictions and a model that has been successful in the past may be less successful or ineffective in the future most statistical formulae cannot fully match the complexity of the financial markets and a model may be flawed or may not work as anticipated during unforeseen or low probability scenarios models may produce unexpected results which may result in losses for the fundequity securities risk in general prices of equity securities are more volatile than those of fixed income securities the prices of equity securities fluctuate and sometimes widely fluctuate in response to activities specific to the issuer of the security as well as factors unrelated to the fundamental condition of the issuer including general market economic and political conditionsfor a complete list

information found on this site is directed to us investors all investments involve risk including the loss of principal investing in a singlesector mutual fund involves greater risk and potential reward than investing in a more diversified fund by concentrating on a small number of holdings the fund carries greater risk because each investment has a greater effect on the fund’s overall performance the return of principal in bond funds is not guaranteed bond funds have the same interest rate inflation and credit risks that are associated with the underlying bonds owned by the fund generally the value of a bond fund rises when interest rates fall and falls when interest rates rise an investor should consider the investment objectives risks and charges and expenses of a fund carefully before investing the prospectus contains this and other information about the fund the prospectus should be read carefully before investing portfolio diversification and active risk management do not assure a profit or protect against losses in a declining market investing in the funds involves risk equity securities are more volatile and carry more risk than other forms of investments the funds may invest in small and midcap securities which are more volatile than large cap stocks valuebased investments are subject to the risk that the broad market may not recognize their intrinsic value investments in fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risks the principal value of a bond falls when interest rates rise and rises when interest rates fall during periods of rising interest rates the value of a bond investment is at greater risk than during periods of stable or falling rates general etf risk the cost to a shareholder of investing in the fund may be higher than the cost of investing directly in etf shares and may be higher than other mutual funds that invest directly in equities you will indirectly bear fees and expenses charged by the etfs in addition to the fund’s direct fees and expenses foreign securities risk international investing involves risks including risks related to foreign currency limited liquidity less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political economic or other developments these risks often are heightened for investments in emergingdeveloping markets or smaller capital markets quantitative investment strategies risk manifold partners may rely on quantitative models both proprietary models developed by manifold partners and those supplied by third parties and information and data supplied by third parties “models and data” in managing the fund models and data are used to assist in determining investments and to provide risk management insights models and data may prove to be incorrect or incomplete in such cases any decisions made in reliance thereon can expose the fund to potential risks some of the models used by manifold partners are predictive in nature predictive models generally depend on the assumption that the future performance of a specific investment can be predicted based on the correlation of the past performance of the investment with the past performance of other investments or economic or financial data the use of predictive models presents inherent risks because predictive models are usually constructed based on historical data supplied by third parties the success of relying on such models may depend heavily on the accuracy and reliability of the supplied historical data additionally market dynamics change over time and correlations that existed in the past may diminish or end a model may fail to provide correct predictions and a model that has been successful in the past may be less successful or ineffective in the future most statistical formulae cannot fully match the complexity of the financial markets and a model may be flawed or may not work as anticipated during unforeseen or low probability scenarios models may produce unexpected results which may result in losses for the fund tracking error risk etfs typically trade on securities exchanges and their shares may at times trade at a premium or discount to their net asset values in addition an etf may not replicate exactly the performance of the benchmark index it seeks to track for a number of reasons including transaction costs incurred by the etf the temporary unavailability of certain index securities in the secondary market or discrepancies between the etf and the index with respect to the weighting of securities or the number of securities held emerging markets risk the fund may invest in foreign securities that may include securities of companies located in developing or emerging markets which entail additional risks including less social political and economic stability smaller securities markets and lower trading volume which may result in less liquidity and greater price volatility national policies that may restrict securities investment opportunities including restrictions on investments in issuers or industries or expropriation or confiscation of assets or property and less developed legal structures governing private or foreign investment commodities risk investments in commodities such as gold or in commoditylinked instruments will subject the global tactical allocation funds portfolio to volatility that may also deviate from price movements in equity and fixed income securities equity securities risk in general prices of equity securities are more volatile than those of fixed income securities the prices of equity securities fluctuate and sometimes widely fluctuate in response to activities specific to the issuer of the security as well as factors unrelated to the fundamental condition of the issuer including general market economic and political conditions for a complete list of fund risks please see the prospectuses for more complete information on the

common law the domain name that respondent registered nesteggadvisorsnet is intentionally identical and confusingly similar to complainants’ senior usptoregistered marks  in the use of the identical compound word nestegg or nestegg which joins the two separate words “nest” and “egg” without intervening space  because the identical word directly precedes a generic term used in financial services industries namely “advisors” and  thereby falsely associating the name with those so identified with the financial services trade channels of first complainant who is headquartered in the same regional market and of both complainants who are in the same web market as respondent  respondent has also adopted the identical mark as a trade name and is using that trade name in the website associated with the domain name               respondent’s domain name is so readily identifiable and competitive with the family of ten marks of both complainants as to create immediate likelihood of confusion with and falsely attributable origin and misidentification of respondent’s services as those of complainants or as associated with complainants  when marks are so close likelihood of confusion may result even if the goods or services are not competitive or intrinsically related as they are here  in re shell oil company  fd   fed cir                b        respondent has no legitimate interest in the service marks   respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the use of nestegg in the domain name  its usage is a recent encroachment on the rights that complainants’ wellestablished financial companies have preserved and defended over two decades  seven of complainants’ ten uspto marks have been in continuous use in commerce since   all but one were in use and registered prior to respondent’s claimed first use in  and its domain name registration in  apparently before respondent’s claimed use in commerce  respondent has neither common law nor statutory rights in the nestegg mark  for a decade and half prior to that domain name registration complainants’ marks were listed active and widely known for investment funds and advisory services in the financial industry   from inception to february   the total investment of participants enrolled in plans administered by complainant b and its affiliates under the nestegg marks reached in excess of  million in the states of new york connecticut and new jersey alone  during that same period complainant b and its affiliates enrolled participants in nesteggbranded mutual funds for an investment of greater than  million in those states alone  since the assignment of the nestegg marks in  the total tangible assets in the four nestegg funds    and  alone exceeded  million                although other marks using or incorporating the words “nest” and “egg” are registered in numerous international classes a search of the uspto registry for the compound form at issue here “nestegg” in ic  produces seventeen  records ten  usptoclassified as live  eight  of these live marks are registered to the first complainant two  are registered to the second complainant                the nature of complainants’ businesses financial services to the public under the nestegg marks requires the highest degree of trust by the investing public  for this reason complainants strive to maintain the highest reputation for their services under their marks and to supervise and control the reliability and consistency of the use of those marks  any derogation from complainants’ standards under identical nestegg usage by another purveyor of financial services could threaten and even destroy the carefully guarded reputation of and trust in complainants’ family of marks developed since their original use in commerce in the s               c       respondent registered and continues using the domain name in bad faith   respondent registered the domain name using complainants’ nestegg mark in  before respondent’s claimed first use in commerce  this domain name registration without use in commerce at that time raises the question of whether its motivation was cybersquatting  the domain name is now used by respondent in bad faith  respondent knowingly adopted and has knowingly continued using the domain name and complainants’ nestegg mark to misleadingly divert consumers to its website  on april   claiming first use in  respondent filed an application to register the word mark “nestegg advisors” with the uspto in ic  for financial services  this class includes the services that complainants’ marks define namely financial planning and financial planning for retirement                on august   the uspto examining attorney for this application issued an office action to respondent denying registration of the mark based on “likelihood of confusion” with several existing federal registrations and previouslyfiled applications attaching all eight registrations of complainant a  see ex  at  serial no  complainants incorporate herein by reference all case law cited in support of the refusal to register respondent’s proposed mark  see also kiki undies corp v promenade hosier mills inc  fd   d cir  continued use of mark after receipt of uspto office action finding likelihood of confusion is tantamount to conclusive bad faith use  respondent did not contest the uspto office action by the required response date and the uspto entered an abandonment date of february   for respondent’s application for the mark               notwithstanding respondent’s actual knowledge of complainants’ superior rights in the nestegg marks and likelihood of confusion with respondent’s use of the nestegg advisors name respondent continued to use the mark and domain name  respondent’s usage of this domain name and mark is undeniably knowing deliberate bad faith usage of complainants’ marks in the same international class in violation without limitation of udrp policy the trademark act and cybersquatting laws at usc  § d               in accordance with its rigorous practice in defense of its nestegg marks first complainant served a ceaseanddesist letter on respondent on december    in its reply respondent failed to disclose its awareness of the existence and registration of complainants’ marks and refused to discontinue its usage of the domain name and marks  complainants anticipate that respondent will asset that the nestegg mark is weak and in support of this position allege that third parties are using the nestegg mark for other financial services  such assertions are contrary to fact  as demonstrated above complainants’ marks are extremely strong given their two decades of continued use and many millions of dollars of sales and exposure of their marks  furthermore complainant a has sent its standard notice and demand to desist to third parties using the nestegg mark including third parties previously cited by respondent to complainants  those third parties have already ceased their infringement or are in process of changing the infringing names and marks   with knowledge of complainants’ ownership of all “live” uspto registrations of nestegg marks in ic  for closely related services and the uspto decision on those specific marks respondent has  registered trafficked in and used as a domain name in web advertising and elsewhere a valuable trademark already decidedly distinctive at the time of respondent’s registration of that domain name in flagrant violation of the udrp policy and applicable federal and state law  refused to withdraw its usage upon awareness of complainants’ rights               respondent’s unlawful use of the domain name and trade name is entirely for commercial gain and for the purpose of attracting unwary customers  it rests on complainants’ sound and reputable financial organizations thereby diluting the value of complainants’ marks  respondent is in business as a solo financial advisor  the likelihood is high that interested consumers would confuse the domain name and the trade name use of respondent on the website associated with the domain name through direct entry of the domain name or location of the site associated with the domain name through internet search engines  continued confusion will unfortunately occur so long as respondent continues to use the confusingly similar domain name and trade name in offering similarsounding financial services     b respondent   preliminary statement respondent received a written notice of complaint and commencement of administrative proceeding on july    the notification stated that complainant had submitted a complaint for decision in accordance with the uniform domain name dispute resolution policy adopted by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann on august   and approved by icann on october   “udrp” or “policy” and the rules for uniform domain name dispute resolution policy “rules” effective march   and the national arbitration forum “forum” supplemental rules “supp rules” effective march   complainants who are an investment company and corporation seek to take away a domain name used by a small proprietor to run his legitimate business  complainants hope to circumvent the significant difficulties and expenses of a trademark infringement lawsuit against respondent with respect to its use of “nestegg advisors inc” as a trade name and domain name by launching this substantially lowercost udrp proceeding  in doing so complainants mistake the policy for a process to adjudicate trademark infringement claims under united states federal law citing case after case interpreting federal law but not one case interpreting the policy  see tea party patriots inc v ultimedia llc fa  udrp not designed to resolve trademark disputes enhance mortgage corporation and templeton mortgage corp v joseph hayes fa  legal arguments under state and federal law disregarded because proceeding is governed by udrp  aside from this failure to apply proper caselaw under the policy complainants have similarly failed to present evidence sufficient to sustain a claim under the policy for complainants cannot escape their fatal decision in selecting a trademark that is inherently weak and therefore entitled to a limited scope of protection  moreover respondent registered and used the nesteggadvisorsnet domain name the “domain name” before it had any knowledge of complainants or their business thereby quashing any attempt by complainants to show that respondent lacks any legitimate rights or interests in the domain name or registered or used it in bad faith  as such it is impossible for complainants to establish the three elements necessary to prevail in a udrp proceeding  accordingly the panel should deny complainants’ request for transfer of the domain name response to factual and legal allegations made in complaint pursuant to paragraph a of the policy complainants must prove each of the following elements in order to prevail in this proceeding  the domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which complainants have rights  respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name and  the domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith  as is more fully set forth below complainants cannot establish all of those elements respondent has legitimate rights or interests in the domain name complainants cannot demonstrate that respondent lacks legitimate rights or interests in the domain name  respondent has done business under the trade name “nestegg advisors inc” since november   based on long island new york respondent provides financial planning estate planning and related services to individual consumers located in that geographic area  respondent registered the domain name on july    in december  respondent launched the website for its business under the domain name  respondent took all of the foregoing actions without any knowledge of complainants’ business or their nestegg marks given the foregoing it is impossible for complainants to satisfy paragraph aii of the policy  paragraph c of the policy states that any of the following circumstances if found by the panel shall demonstrate respondent’s rights or legitimate interests in the domain name for purposes of paragraph aii  before any notice to respondent of the dispute respondent used or made demonstrable preparations to use the domain name or a name corresponding to the domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services or  respondent as an individual business or other organization has been commonly known by the domain name even if respondent has acquired no trademark or service mark rights in the name  each of the foregoing is true with respect to respondent respondent did not become aware of complainants’ business or their asserted rights in the nestegg marks until december   when complainants first sent respondent a cease and desist letter  nevertheless complainants argue that respondent had at least constructive if not actual notice of their asserted trademark rights on august    complainants base that claim on the office action that the united states patent and trademark office uspto issued to respondent on that date concerning its application to register nestegg advisors noting that the office action cited some of complainants’ registrations as possible obstacles to registration  even if the panel were to assume that respondent did have actual notice of complainants’ asserted trademark rights as of august   it would still remain true that before any notice to respondent of this dispute respondent used or made demonstrable preparations to use the domain name or a name corresponding to the domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services  as stated above respondent registered the domain name on july   and launched the website for its business under the domain name on december  – all well before the earliest date on which complainants assert that respondent became aware of their trademark rights and well before respondents became aware of any dispute between the parties  moreover since it began using the “nestegg advisors inc” trade name in november  respondent has been commonly known by the domain name  these facts show that respondent has legitimate rights or interests in the domain name pursuant to paragraph c of the policy  see crs technology corp v condenet inc fa  transfer denied where respondent made use of conciergecom in connection with travel services after trademark availability search conducted by respondent disclosed existence of complainant’s trademark registration for concierge but before respondent received cease and desist letter from complainant respondent has not registered or used the domain name in bad faith given that respondent has legitimate rights or interests in the domain name it follows that respondent has not registered or used the domain name in bad faith and the panel’s consideration of this element is unnecessary  see mbo partners inc v mybizhomepage inc fa  “once the determination is made that respondent has rights to or legitimate interests in the disputed domain name mybizhomepagecom the issue of bad faith is moot and need not be addressed by the panel” lockheed martin corp v skunkworx custom cycle wipo d “in light of the panel’s finding that the respondent has rights and legitimate interests in the disputed domain name all issues of bad faith use and registration under paragraph aiii of the policy are now moot” vanguard group inc v investors fast track fa  leap real estate systems llc v byteplay limited wipo case no d  nevertheless respondent asserts that it did not register or use the domain name in bad faith respondent did not register the domain name primarily for the purpose of selling it to complainants or one of their competitors  respondent has not engaged in a pattern of registering complainants’ or any other party’s trademarks as domain names in order to prevent such parties from reflecting their marks in corresponding domain names  respondent has not registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of disrupting the business of complainants who in any event are not competitors of respondent complainants offer mutual fund investment services to institutions intermediaries and others whereas respondent offers financial planning estate planning and related services to individual consumers located in the geographic area of long island new york  respondent did not register the domain name to free ride on the goodwill associated with complainants’ marks  in short respondent has not engaged in any of the examples of bad faith set forth in paragraph b of the policy as discussed above respondent was not aware of complainants’ trademark rights before it registered and began using the domain name in connection with its bona fide offering of goods and services  but even if respondent had registered and began use of the domain name with knowledge of complainants’ trademarks the fact remains that complainants’ marks are inherently weak and any distinctive quality they may have is highly diluted by the existence of innumerable thirdparty uses of “nest egg” as a designation in connection with financial goods or services  moreover there are several thirdparty registrations in the united states patent and trademark office for marks that contain the term “nest egg” and cover financial goods or services build and protect your nest egg reg no  secure nest egg reg no  nest egg news reg no  the nest egg fund reg no    there are also several thirdparty registrations and uses of domain names that incorporate “nest egg” in connection with websites for financial goods or services including but not limited to the following nesteggfinancialplannerscom nesteggbuilderscom nesteggfinancialcom nestegginvestorcom nesteggsolutionscom nestegggameplancom nestegginfocom nesteggsoftwarecom nestegginvestingcom   the abundance of such thirdparty uses and registrations no doubt results from the generic quality of “nest egg” as used in connection with financial goods and services and they demonstrate that complainants hold no monopoly on the use of “nest egg” as a part of a service mark or trade name for financial goods and services  the term in everyday use refers to money set aside for a future purpose such as retirement  see definitions at httpdictionaryreferencecombrowsenestegg  respondent chose its trade name “nestegg advisors inc” and the domain name to refer to that basic dictionary definition of the term “nest egg” not to exploit any likelihood of confusion with complainants’ marks  by choosing an inherently weak mark the dominant element of which is a generic term complainants must accept the right of others to make legitimate use of the term in its generic sense  see lockheed martin corporation v the skunkworx custom cycle wipo case no d warning complainant of coming dangerously close to engaging in reverse domain name hijacking and denying transfer because “merely owning a trademark whether registered or not does not suffice in and of itself as a vehicle to halt all unauthorized thirdparty inclusion of that mark within a domain name” crs technology corp v condenet inc fa  denying transfer because the “term ‘concierge’ is inherently weak due to its widespread descriptive use and therefore is entitled only to a narrow ambit of protection” pwc business trust v ultimate search wipo case no d finding multiple thirdparty uses of the acronym “pwc” and that “this inherent lack of distinctiveness is what undermines the complainant’s attempts to have the panel regard mere registration of pwccom by the respondent as self evident bad faith” mbo partners inc v mybizhomepage inc fa  the vanguard group inc v investors fasttrack fa   therefore respondent has not registered or used the domain name in bad faith the domain name is not identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which complainants have rights the domain name is not identical or confusingly similar to any of complainants’ trademarks  complainants own no trademark registration for nestegg advisors and all of their trademark registrations consist of composite marks featuring the combination of multiple words andor a design  none of the registrations contain the term “nest egg” by itself nor do any of them contain the term “advisors”  as such the domain name is not identical to any of complainants’ trademarks furthermore the domain name is not confusingly similar to complainants’ trademarks  the parties have used their respective marks in the marketplace for nearly four years yet there has been no evidence whatsoever of any actual confusion  such an extensive period of time of concurrent use without actual confusion confirms that no confusing similarity exists as discussed above complainants’ marks are inherently weak and highly diluted by countless thirdparty uses of and registrations for marks that incorporate “nest egg”  where numerous similar marks coexist the scope of protection to which each mark is entitled should be narrowly construed  see the knot inc v julia bitton the nest wipo case no d complainant’s right to exclude others is considerably limited in scope where its mark is descriptive of the goods and services it offers  given that the only component of the domain name that bears any identity or similarity to complainants’ trademark is the generic term “nest egg” the domain name is not confusingly similar to any of complainants’ trademarks     c additional submissions complainants submitted the following additional information               a        this submission confirms that respondent’s domain name is confusingly       similar to complainants’ family of valuable and famous service marks    respondent’s contentions to the contrary lack credibility               the single source of inescapable confusion in this proceeding is respondent’s usage of the nongeneric part of complainants’ distinctive suggestive mark “nestegg” in respondent’s domain name and as later adopted in its unregistered trade name for financial services and investments offered on its web site accessed through that domain name  thus nestegg is a source of web inquiries and financial gain for respondent from the use of complainants’ strong family of marks the response nevertheless purports to deem the mark weak because of a relatively small group of distinguishable descriptive nest egg uses   the distinctive suggestive feature of the mark at issue however is its combination of two words into one name a combination that complainants designed and that no lexicographer has included in a dictionary in that form  respondent disregards this difference not only in the reference to a dictionary entry for “nest egg” but also in four uspto registrations in the two separated words and for uses that do not challenge complainants’ rights the marks build and protect your nest egg and secure nest egg are clearly not in the form of the domain namemark at issue  nest egg news is a class  registration for children’s newsletters  the fourth mark cited the nest egg fund is incontestable   significantly its owner is john hancock advisers llc with whom complainants have long had a concurrent use agreement and expressly distinguishing between the usages of “nestegg” and “nest egg” forms to avoid confusion    complainants are familiar with respondent’s examples of domain name usage by others  complainants must and do serve ceaseanddesist letters and defend their marks as circumstances require to maintain their value and strength  users of several competing marks have withdrawn their usage within the past year  in certain instances complainants seek remedies appropriate to the perceived harm  nest egg financial planners has to date evaded complainant a’s ceaseanddesist letters by frequent changes of office address  some unwitting infringers welcome the incentive to introduce a replacement name to the public and the consequent publicity enabled with funds saved by avoiding legal contest  some such infringers respect complainants’ rights as prior owners express regret for inadvertent infringement and make the necessary changes in good faith as promptly as possible   tellingly respondent provides no evidence of having made a bona fide mark search before adopting the domain name or the service mark for its business  failure to conduct a proper trademark search is “willful blindness to the existence of the rights of others” compact disc world v artistic inc fa nat arb forum  aug                 the response states that “complainants are not competitors of respondent” and that “complainants offer mutual fund investment services to institutions intermediaries and others whereas respondent offers financial planning estate planning and related services to individual consumers”  but at the bottom of its initial “nestegg” web page respondent announces investment offers               “securities offered through american portfolios financial services inc”   this exhibit from which the nestegg heading appears to have been removed also counsels in a “note” in small print that “email should not be used to enter trades”               respondent’s webpage belies its claim that its business is not competitive with complainants’  contrary to respondent’s assertion both complainants use business names american independence financial services and intrust bank that make clear as their complaint states they render broad financial planning services  similarly most of first complainant’s nest egg marks includes “services” as uses of the mark  the parties to this dispute are all engaged in financial advisory services and investment offerings under the distinctive nestegg mark  second complainant specifically provides investment education and counsel under its nestegg u and nestegg consulting marks  through the use of the internet the parties’ market is far beyond the location of any office  respondent’s location on long island has little or no bearing on its customer base  a reasonable user of the internet would believe that respondent’s site and offerings were related to complainants regardless of the physical location of the respective offices  see american online inc  v tencent communications corp fa mar  “ubiquitous nature of the internet”     complainants’ marks have been widely used in commerce since  and have acquired secondary meaning  their investment services have resulted not only in their solid growth see certifications attached to complaint but in the concept of the name to suggest their services  a “nestegg” conceptualizes and suggests an investment  complainants’ services and offerings under the distinctive nestegg marks through the years and the expenditure of substantial sums have strengthened their association with dependable performance and integrity  see regional hospitality worldwide inc v regent plaza hotel fa nat arb forum june    complainant invested substantial sums in developing and marketing and developed substantial good will and customer loyalty               adding further to the strength of complainants’ marks on july   the wall street journal published ratings by prominent investment research firm morningstar of the six leading “target date” funds  these funds are designed for investors who hope to retire by a certain target date  the article featured six such funds that outperformed a peer index for the past three years  complainants’ “nestegg series” of funds ranked fourth behind wells fargo’s dow jones series american century’s livestrong series and vanguard’s retirement series equaled mfs livetime series and outranked jp morgan’s smart retirement series               this recognition is both testimony to and extension of the consistently growing fame of complainants’ nestegg marks since their first use in commerce in   the appearance of the nestegg series in the wall street journal article emphasizes the extreme danger that potential investors may confront  searching the internet for the distinctive and famous “nestegg” mark to access the nestegg funds series and obtain related advisory services they may well be misled by respondent’s confusingly similar domain name website mark and design into fund transactions and advice on the assumption that there is a responsible relationship which does not exist between complainants and respondent   respondent’s “web page” exhibit is further misleading in the absence of the mark that appears at the top on the screen at that site just seconds after it is accessed at wwwnesteggadvisorsnet  a photograph of the top threefourths of the initial web page screen on july   shows the “nestegg” mark prominently heading the page  this screen contains the mark in the identical script type setup as in first complainant’s design mark “nestegg funds life simplified” on its uspto registration record                b        the response and this additional submission confirm that respondent           has no legitimate interest in the domain name or service mark                   respondent was never authorized to use the nestegg mark  the mark is identical to complainants’ registered service marks in image and formation usage purposes and market  even if respondent offers investment funds and advisory services through a third party it can and surely does make financial gain by redirecting inquiries about nestegg funds to american portfolio financial services inc a name not too different from that of first complainant american independence financial services inc  respondent also offers financial advice through american portfolio advisors inc   see wwwnesteggadvisorsnet at  bottom of pages               for the nestegg family of marks in use since  complainants filed and obtained uspto servicemarks for those marks beginning on august    these marks included both the joined words and the nest and egg design for nestegg funds life simplified registered on july    it should be noted that respondent registered the domain name on july    sixteen months later in december  respondent adopted the same joined words nestegg the identical lettering style and a rotated nest and egg design  this seems hardly coincidental since no other nestegg mark of complainants has this exact form and respondent claims no use of the mark until long after  the year when complainants’ marks were first in recorded use               respondent has refused to cease the use of the nestegg mark as a domain name and as an unregistered service mark  complainants have therefore invoked the udrp proceeding as the efficient process established for the express purpose of determining the respective rights in disputes between domain name and trademark owners in the shortest time  this process is not in lieu of a trademark infringement suit  it is the shortest route to cut off the current harm where likelihood of confusion prejudicially exists               respondent has objected to complainants’ citation of federal cases two in number on likelihood of confusion  rule a of the rules for uniform domain name dispute resolution policy instructs the panel “to decide a complaint on the basis of statements and documents submitted in accordance with the policy the rules and any rules and principles of law that it deems applicable”  surely federal and state trademark law is deemed applicable  since trademark law offers respondent no support it cites only naf and wipo decisions but its citations are inapposite  in the following decisions as cited by respondent the businesses products services andor markets of the opposing parties were found to differ  crs technology corp v condenet inc fa  mbo partners inc v mybizhomepage inc fa

known of complainants’ registered marks and could have ascertained the status of such marks but failed to do so  respondent with no predating rights had either actual andor constructive knowledge of complainants’ developed goodwill and customer loyalty               use of a protected name that constitutes clear trademark infringement does not result in any rights or legitimate business interest in the domain name  legal rights and interests cannot accrue to respondent by way of trademark infringement  harcourt inc v r d glassblowing fa naf july    american online inc v xianfeng fu d wipo dec   apparent disregard see also underground service inc v css group llc fa nat arb forum apr  l “apparent failure to conduct a trademark search to discover complainant owned a federal registration … in association with services highly related to respondents”  as for respondent’s production of the results of a current web search of the mark these printouts do not illustrate the use of the mark at the time respondent registered the domain name or activated a website using complainants’ mark  putative infringements by others on complainants’ protected marks do not serve as a valid defense to respondent’s acts nor do they affect respondent’s rights in this matter in any way               c        the response and this additional submission confirm that respondent has    registered and continues using the domain name in bad faith               it is highly unlikely that respondent who operates in the same financial area has an office in new york and wider access through the internet was unaware of the wellknown nestegg offerings and other operations of complainants until                after registering the nestegg domain name respondent waited sixteen months to use the name  see treeforms inc v cayne indus sales corp fa dec   at c registration and use in bad faith “given the respondent’s inactivity toward the contested domain name for a month period and its total lack … of undertaking any demonstrable preparations during that time to utilize the name in an operational web site the panel believes that the respondent registered the contested domain name in bad faith…”  then without a search respondent adopted the domain name minus net as a service mark in which it had acquired no prior rights  that usage is a bad faith infringement for failure to make a bona fide search for its availability  it is also bad faith infringement for failure to cease its usage after the uspto denial of respondent’s application for a service mark for likelihood of confusion issued with a full list of complainants’ live marks  respondent failed to heed complainants’ ceaseanddesist letters with the necessary information to verify complainants’ senior rights               respondent had constructive if not actual knowledge of complainants’ marks at the time of its registration of the domain name and certainly actual knowledge after its adoption of nestegg as a service mark on its website  respondent had the obligation to perform a diligent search to determine whether the name might infringe on another’s intellectual property  see  digi int’l v ddi sys fa nat arb forum oct                 as in compact disc world v artistic visions inc fa nat arb forum aug   through the domain name and the infringing web site mark “respondent attempted to attract for commercial gain internet users to respondent’s web site … by creating confusion with complainant’s mark as to the source sponsorship affiliation or endorsement of respondent’s web site or service or investment offerings”  id  respondent either made no effort to determine if its use of the disputed name might infringe on existing rights or it knew of complainants’ registered rights and deliberately flouted them               respondent’s initial selection and continued use of the nestegg mark after a uspto finding of likelihood of confusion is conclusively bad faith use of the domain name to attract to its web site for advisory services and investment offers that is for its commercial gain unwary consumers that may be or may already have been mistaken for complainants’ services or offerings  complainants as the far senior and registered users have the obligation to prevent the likelihood of confusion and possible injurious loss to the public  as they have served several ceaseanddesist letters upon respondent they have pursued and are pursuing a similar course to defend the mark from infringement as it arises  in most instances its efforts are successful since the goal of sound professional investors is to build a unique name with a dedicated reputation and following               it is also to be questioned why respondent chose to adopt a domain name it purports to deem “inherently weak”  response at   yet respondent filed a uspto servicemark application in  with a claimed first usage of november    respondent did not use the mark in commerce for sixteen months thereafter according to that application furthermore respondent chose to submit that application in a form it deems weak for uspto registration through counsel on april    it is unusual for counsel to submit an application for a mark without conducting a search for confusingly similar marks  in  such a search would have revealed the family of complainants’ marks as later supplied by the uspto examiner in denying respondent’s application as confusingly similar     respondent further submitted   preliminary statement pursuant to paragraph c of the supplemental rules respondent files this additional submission in response to complainants’ additional submission filed on august    as a preliminary matter respondent submits that complainants’ additional submission was not timely filed in accordance with paragraph a of the supplemental rules which requires the filing of such additional submission “within five  calendar days after the date the response was received by the forum …”  the forum received the response on july   making complainants’ additional submission due august    however the forum did not receive complainants’ additional submission until august   and complainant offered no explanation for the late filing  respondent requested that the forum strike complainants’ additional submission or in the alternative give respondent the same benefit of extra time taken by complainants but the forum deferred issues concerning complainants’ late submission to the panel and compelled respondent to file this additional submission in less time than that taken by complainants  as such respondent requests that the panel strike complainants’ additional submission so that they are not permitted to benefit from their dilatory tactics  see commonwealth communications group inc v david lahoti dba esecure fa  “because complainant failed to provide any justification for its untimely submission the panel agrees that the submission should be disregarded” even if the panel were to consider complainants’ additional submission the panel should give it little or no weight  complainants rehash the failed arguments stated in their complaint and fail again to grasp the difference between a federal trademark infringement lawsuit and the limited scope of a udrp proceeding  they misapply udrp precedents and offer nothing more than speculation while ignoring the following facts  respondent was not aware of complainants or their purported trademark rights prior to its registration of the domain name and use of it in connection with a legitimate business  complainants’ inherently weak and highly diluted mark is entitled to little protection and  the foregoing facts preclude the possibility of bad faith registration or use of the domain name by respondent and a finding that the domain name is identical or confusingly similar to complainants’ mark  therefore complainants cannot prove the three elements necessary to prevail under the udrp complainants cannot satisfy elements required by the udrp respondent has legitimate rights or interests in the domain name respondent began conducting a legitimate business under the “nestegg advisors inc” trade name in november  over three years before respondent became aware of the dispute that is the subject of this proceeding  see american installation company inc dba nationlink wireless v missouriwide cellular fa  respondent had legitimate rights or interests in nationlinkwirelesscom domain name notwithstanding complainant’s federal registrations for nationlink because respondent

respondent’s sciglasscom domain name was identical to complainant’s distinctive sciglass mark and complainant owned a trademark registration for sciglass not sciglass followed by a number of descriptive or generic terms  similarly in underground services inc v css group llc fa  respondent’s safedigcom domain name was identical to complainant’s distinctive safedig mark and complainant owned a registration for safedig on its own without any other terms in this proceeding complainants do not own a distinctive let alone famous mark and the marks registered by complainants are not identical to the domain name  respondent registered nesteggadvisorsnet as its domain name not for example nesteggfundslifesimplifiedcom nesteggcapitalpreservationfundcom or nesteggfundcom  complainants in short claim to own a monopoly on the term “nest egg” for goods and services in the financial industry such that no other provider of financial goods or services could legitimately use it as a dominant feature in its domain name  but the udrp simply does not support complainants’ excessively expansive view  see eg state fair of texas v bigtex sports fa  “its argument essentially is that because the complainant has registered ‘big tex’ as a mark nobody can use it in any circumstance and therefore the respondent could not possibly have a legitimate interest in any name containing the words ‘big tex’  but i am not persuaded that the law is as simple as that”  in any event a udrp proceeding is not the right forum to adjudicate which party has superior rights to a mark  see american installation company inc dba nationlink wireless v missouriwide cellular fa  “the evidence is not sufficient to determine who has the better rights to the nationlink mark  this will require a full evidentiary hearing including taking testimony and crossexamination and is not suited to the summary proceedings used in the udrp”  neither udrp precedent nor the facts support the conclusion that respondent lacks legitimate rights or interests in the domain name respondent has not registered or used the domain name in bad faith even if complainants could demonstrate that respondent lacks legitimate rights or interests in the domain name complainants would still be unable to prevail in this proceeding because they cannot demonstrate that respondent has registered or used the domain name in bad faith  in seeking to prove this element complainants’ additional submission introduces a different standard of knowledge from that required by paragraph aiii of the udrp arguing that respondent knew or should have known of complainants’ mark before registering the domain name and that respondent acted in bad faith by failing to conduct a trademark search before registering the domain name  prior panels and the april   final report of the wipo internet domain name process the “wipo report” make clear that a domain name registrant has no duty to conduct a trademark search before registering a domain name  see formlinc information dba grouplink v credit suisse group fa  “although respondent acknowledges it was unaware of complainant’s trademark at the time it registered its domain name it could easily have learned of the trademark and thereby have avoided this dispute  nevertheless csg’s failure to verify the existence of complainant’s trademark is not alone evidence of bad faith” albertoculver co v pritpal singh channa wipo case no d “i reject the idea that some sort of ‘constructive notice’ is generated upon a trademark registration and that this is sufficient to establish bad faith  to accept this idea is to accept that a trademark registration—without anything further—is enough to establish bad faith under the policy  this is a ludicrous suggestion and runs contrary to the clear intention of paragraph aiii which was intended to protect the interests of domain name holders who registered without bad faith” state fair of texas v bigtex sports fa  declining to hold that respondent’s failure to conduct trademark search constitutes bad faith see also wipo report at paras  performance of trademark search not prerequisite for domain name registration relying on treeforms inc v cayne industrial sales corp fa  complainants then assert that respondent’s delay in launching a website under the domain name after registration suggests that respondent registered the domain name in bad faith  but treeforms is wholly distinguishable from the facts here  the respondent in treeforms registered the domain name and held on to it for over  months without using it or making demonstrable preparations to use it for a legitimate purpose  in fact the respondent still did not have a functioning website at that domain name when the complainant initiated the udrp proceeding  worse yet the respondent attempted to sell the domain name to the complainant  here respondent launched a website under the domain name in december  – several years before learning about complainants has used it ever since in connection with its legitimate business and has not offered to sell the domain name to complainants lacking support in udrp precedent complainants turn next to delusional theories concerning the intent of respondent to knock off their weak and diluted mark latching on belatedly to a perceived similarity between the graphical representation of respondent’s trade name on its website and complainants’ registration no  in the united states patent and trademark office for nestegg funds life simplified  design  it seems complainants reach that conclusion based in large part on the similarity of the fonts  but that fact is entirely unremarkable given that the graphical representation of respondent’s trade name is depicted in a lucida font – one of the most popular fonts available  complainants attempt to rehabilitate the inherent weakness of their mark as shown by the many thirdparty uses and registrations for marks and domain names that feature “nest egg” by asserting that they will mount enforcement efforts against those parties as well just as they allegedly have against others  they allege that numerous third parties have relented in their use of “nest egg” after being confronted by complainants  that may be evidence of complainants’ successful efforts at bullying others into submission with a superior war chest but it is not evidence of complainants’ superior rights with regard to john hancock’s registration no  for the nest egg fund in the united states patent and trademark office complainants advise that the three parties have executed a coexistence agreement concerning their various “nest egg” marks  in doing so complainants appear to miss the very essence of a coexistence agreement which is an acknowledgement amongst the parties that no likelihood of confusion exists  if the nest egg fund for mutual fund investment services can peacefully coexist with complainants’ nestegg mark for identical services then respondents’ nesteggadvisorsnet domain name for financial advisory services can peacefully coexist with complainants’ mark as well  with regard to other thirdparty uses and registrations disclosed in the response complainants argue that what distinguishes their mark from those of others is their elimination of the space between “nest” and “egg”  respondent submits that the mere elimination of a space is not novel nor does it render an otherwise generic term distinctive  furthermore it would be impossible for respondent or anyone else to use a space in a domain name  in any event many of the thirdparty uses disclosed in the response feature “nestegg” ie “nest” and “egg” combined as a compound word including nestegg builders nestegg financial nestegg investing and nestegg solutions  given the inherent weakness and diluted nature of complainants’ mark it cannot be concluded that respondent exhibited bad faith in its registration and use of the nesteggadvisorsnet domain name the domain name is not identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which complainants have rights because complainants’ mark is not distinctive and is in fact highly diluted it is entitled to a very limited scope of protection  as stated earlier this is not a case in which respondent has registered domain names that are identical to complainants’ registered marks such as nesteggfundslifesimplifiedcom nesteggcapitalpreservationfundcom or nesteggfundcom  instead respondent has registered a domain name comprising the generic terms “nest egg” and “advisors” in a goodfaith effort to communicate to the public that its website provides information related to its business of providing advice on saving for retirement  accordingly the domain name is not identical or confusingly similar to complainants’ mark  see eg american airlines inc v megawebcom inc fa  americanairwayscom found not identical or confusingly similar to complainant’s famous american airlines mark findings complainants have failed to satisfy their burden of proof on all three required elements for udrp proceedings   discussion paragraph a of the rules for uniform domain name dispute resolution policy the “rules” instructs this panel to “decide a complaint on the basis of the statements and documents submitted in accordance with the policy these rules and any rules and principles of law that it deems applicable”   paragraph a of the policy requires that the complainant must prove each of the following three elements to obtain an order that a domain name should be cancelled or transferred                  the domain name registered by the respondent is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights                the respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name and                the domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith   identical andor confusingly similar   the disputed domain name is not identical to complainant’s mark  complainant does not own a mark for “nestegg advisors” and all of complainant’s marks consist of composite marks featuring a combination of words andor designs  further none of complainant’s registered marks contain the term “nestegg” alone and none of the marks contain the term “advisors”  this panel finds respondent’s disputed domain name is not confusingly similar to complainant’s mark under policy ¶ai  see bank of am corp v fluxxx inc fa  nat arb forum feb   “in light of
