the walmart of banking which would cater to lower and middleclass consumers that other banks deemed too risky complex mortgages and credit cards had terms that made it easy for the least creditworthy borrowers to get financing a strategy the bank extended in big cities including chicago new york and los angeles wamu pressed sales agents to approve loans while placing less emphasis on borrowers’ incomes and assets wamu set up a system that enabled real estate agents to collect fees of more than  for bringing in borrowers variablerate loans — option adjustable rate mortgages option arms in particular — were especially attractive because they carried higher fees than other loans and allowed wamu to book profits on interest payments that borrowers deferred as wamu was selling many of its

september  and had briefly traded as high as  in the previous year while wamu publicly insisted it could stay independent earlier in the month it had quietly hired goldman sachs to identify potential bidders however several deadlines passed without anyone submitting a bid at the same time wamu suffered a massive run mostly via electronic banking over the internet and wire transfercitation needed customers pulled out  billion in deposits in a tenday span this led the federal reserve and the treasury department to step up pressure for wamu to find a buyer as a takeover by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic could have been a severe drain on the fdic insurance fund which had already been hard hit by the failure of indymac that year the fdic ultimately held a secret auction of washington mutual bank finally on the morning of thursday september  which happened to be the th anniversary of wamus establishment regulators informed jpmorgan chase that they were the winners on thursday night shortly after the close of business on the west coast the office of thrift supervision seized washington mutual bank and placed it into the receivership of the fdic in a statement the ots said that the massive run meant that wamu was no longer sound the fdic as receiver sold most of washington mutual banks assets including the branch network to jpmorgan chase for  billion jpmorgan agreed to assume the banks secured debts and liabilities to depositors the transaction did not require any fdic insurance funds normally bank seizures take place after the close of business on fridays however due to the banks deteriorating condition and leaks that a seizure was imminent regulators felt compelled to act a day early because jpmorgan chase bought washington mutuals assets for a low price wamus stockholders were nearly wiped out its stock price dropped to  a share far from  a share in  in its chapter  filing wamu listed assets of  billion and debt of  billion ref appendix a the filing also indicates that enough funds are available for distribution to unsecured creditors within days of the seizure a hedge fund adviser and investment strategist mike stathis of ava investment analytics issued a formal complaint to the securities and exchange commission demonstrating evidence of insider trading the complaint also alleged that washington mutual was not insolvent and several wall street firms and hedge funds had conspired to short the stock he also stated that he spoke with a reporter from the associated press who told him that he was contacted by a washington mutual executive hours before the seizure telling the reporter that it would happen for “political reasons” in later criticisms stathis discussed that neither the fdic nor ots ever disclosed any evidence of washington mutuals insolvency stathis stated that within a few weeks of submitting his complaint he was visited by federal agents who held him in an interrogation room for questioning as a result of this stathis stated that he felt bullied and did not release the sec complaint into the public domain until a year later shareholders fought what they considered the illegal seizure of washington mutual through such websites as wamucoupcom dead link and others claiming that the ots acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and seized the bank for political reasons or for the benefit of jpmorgan chase which acquired a large network of branches at what they claim to be an unfairly low price shareholders claimed that as of the date of the takeover the bank had enough liquidity to meet all its obligations and was in compliance with the business plan negotiated with the ots  weeks earlier and that the holding companys board and management was kept completely in the dark about the governments negotiations with chase hampering the banks ability to sell itself on its own chief executive alan h fishman was flying from new york to seattle on the day the bank was closed and eventually received a  million signon bonus and cash severance of  million which he declined after being ceo for  days senator maria cantwell demanded an explanation from the government and threatened to open an investigation and washington mutuals former shareholders have threatened a lawsuit demanding compensation for the lost value of their shares the seizure of wamu bank resulted in the largest

district of delaware pursuant to section a of the bankruptcy code appointed a committee of equity security holders to represent all shareholders of both preferred and common stock all of the motions to disband the committee of equity security holders were denied on january   by us bankruptcy judge mary f walrath district of delaware on july   bankruptcy judge mary walrath approved a motion of the ec for an examiner to investigate potential legal claims and assets of wmi handing a victory to shareholders the judge directed the examiner to investigate not just the legal settlement with the fdic and jpmorgan chase at the heart of wamus reorganization but also all potential claims and assets that are part of the settlement or that will be retained by the company on july   us trustee roberta a

hochberg is a partner in mckenna long  aldridges washington office whose practice focuses on individual and corporate white collar defense internal investigations and compliance on august   the bankruptcy judge rejected washington mutual incs effort to obtain personal financial information from shareholders demanding that the company schedule an annual meeting attorneys for the ec said that wmi was simply trying to delay scheduling a shareholder meeting by seeking personal information the judge agreed that wmi was not entitled to the information on november   examiner joshua r hochberg from mckenna long  aldridge llp presented his longawaited report but it did not meet the expectations of the court since the report was based on unsworn interviews and confidential attorneyclient work on december  the court decided to exclude the examiners report during the plan confirmation hearings saying it cant be considered expert testimony or submitted as evidence unless it is subject to questioning to determine the basis of its conclusions on january   the bankruptcy court rejected the th proposed plan of reorganization which was proposed by the debtors and their lawyers from weil gotshal  manges llp judge mary walrath focused many of her criticisms on the companys releases of liability granted to directors officers and others including some hedge funds who she said did not contribute anything to the settlement she noted for example that shareholders who will likely get nothing should not have to release the companys board from the threat of being sued by them however many wamu shareholders believe there will be a significant recovery when washington mutual emerges from bankruptcy on september   the court also rejected the modified th proposed plan of reorganization judge mary f walrath wrote that four hedge funds that had played a role in washington mutual’s restructuring might have received confidential information that could have been used to trade improperly in the bank’s debt the four hedge funds are appaloosa management aurelius capital management centerbridge partners and owl creek asset management a seventh plan of reorganization was

would cater to lower and middleclass consumers that other banks deemed too risky complex mortgages and credit cards had terms that made it easy for the least creditworthy borrowers to get financing a strategy the bank extended in big cities including chicago new york and los angeles wamu pressed sales agents to approve loans while placing less emphasis on borrowers’ incomes and assets wamu set up a system that enabled real estate agents to collect fees of more than  for bringing in borrowers variablerate loans — option adjustable rate mortgages option arms in particular — were especially

deadlines passed without anyone submitting a bid at the same time wamu suffered a massive run mostly via electronic banking over the internet and wire transfercitation needed customers pulled out  billion in deposits in a tenday span this led the federal reserve and the treasury department to step up pressure for wamu to find a buyer as a takeover by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic could have been a severe drain on the fdic insurance fund which had already been hard hit by the failure of indymac that year the fdic ultimately held a secret auction of washington mutual bank finally on the morning of thursday september  which happened to be the th anniversary of wamus establishment regulators informed jpmorgan chase that they were the winners on thursday night shortly after the close of business on the west coast the office of thrift supervision seized washington mutual bank and placed it into the receivership of the fdic in a statement the ots said that the massive run meant that wamu was no longer sound the fdic as receiver sold most of washington mutual banks assets including the branch network to jpmorgan chase for  billion jpmorgan agreed to assume the banks secured debts and liabilities to depositors the transaction did not require any fdic insurance funds normally bank seizures take place after the close of business on fridays however due to the banks deteriorating condition and leaks that a seizure was imminent regulators felt compelled to act a day early because jpmorgan chase bought washington mutuals assets for a low price wamus stockholders were nearly wiped out its stock price dropped to  a share far from  a share in  in its chapter  filing wamu listed assets of  billion and debt of  billion ref appendix a the filing also indicates that enough funds are available for distribution to unsecured creditors within days of the seizure a hedge fund adviser and investment strategist mike stathis of ava investment analytics issued a formal complaint to the securities and exchange commission demonstrating evidence of insider trading the complaint also alleged that washington mutual was not insolvent and several wall street firms and hedge funds had conspired to short the stock he also stated that he spoke with a reporter from the associated press who told him that he was contacted by a washington mutual executive hours before the seizure telling the reporter that it would happen for “political reasons” in later criticisms stathis discussed that neither the fdic nor ots ever disclosed any evidence of washington mutuals insolvency stathis stated that within a few weeks of submitting his complaint he was visited by federal agents who held him in an interrogation room for questioning as a result of this stathis stated that he felt bullied and did not release the sec complaint into the public domain until a year later shareholders fought what they considered the illegal seizure of washington mutual through such websites as wamucoupcom dead link and others claiming that the ots acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and seized the bank for political reasons or for the benefit of jpmorgan chase which acquired a large network of branches at what they claim to be an unfairly low price shareholders claimed that as of the date of the takeover the bank had enough liquidity to meet all its obligations and was in compliance with the business plan negotiated with the ots  weeks earlier and that the holding companys board and management was kept completely in the dark about the governments negotiations with chase hampering the banks ability to sell itself on its own chief executive alan h fishman was flying from new york to seattle on the day the bank was closed and eventually received a  million signon bonus and cash severance of  million which he declined after being ceo for  days senator maria cantwell demanded an explanation from the government and threatened to open an investigation and washington mutuals former shareholders have threatened a lawsuit demanding compensation for the lost value of their shares the seizure of wamu bank resulted in the largest bank

examiner to investigate potential legal claims and assets of wmi handing a victory to shareholders the judge directed the examiner to investigate not just the legal settlement with the fdic and

hochberg is a partner in mckenna long  aldridges washington office whose practice focuses on individual and corporate white collar defense internal investigations and compliance on august   the bankruptcy judge rejected washington mutual incs effort to obtain personal financial information from shareholders demanding that the company schedule an annual meeting attorneys for the ec said that wmi was simply trying to delay scheduling a shareholder meeting by seeking personal information the judge agreed that wmi was not entitled to the information on november   examiner joshua r hochberg from mckenna long  aldridge llp presented his longawaited report but it did not meet the expectations of the court since the report was based on unsworn interviews and confidential attorneyclient work on december  the court decided to exclude the examiners report during the plan confirmation hearings saying it cant be considered expert testimony or submitted as evidence unless it is subject to questioning to determine the basis of its conclusions on january   the bankruptcy court rejected the th proposed plan of reorganization which was proposed by the debtors and their lawyers from weil gotshal  manges llp judge mary walrath focused many of her criticisms on the companys releases of liability granted to directors officers and others including some hedge funds who she said did not contribute anything to the settlement she noted for example that shareholders who will likely get nothing should not have to release the companys board from the threat of being sued by them however many wamu shareholders believe there will be a significant recovery when washington mutual emerges from bankruptcy on september   the court also rejected the modified th proposed plan of reorganization judge mary f walrath wrote that four hedge funds that had played a role in washington mutual’s restructuring might have received confidential information that could have been used to trade improperly in the bank’s debt the four hedge funds are appaloosa management aurelius capital management centerbridge partners and owl creek asset management a seventh plan of reorganization was

lowes home depot did to their industry and i think if we’ve done our job five years from now you’re not going to call us a bank killingers goal was to build wamu into the walmart of banking which would cater to lower and middleclass consumers that other banks deemed too risky complex mortgages and credit cards had terms that made it easy for the least creditworthy borrowers to get financing a strategy the bank extended in big cities including chicago new york and los angeles wamu pressed sales agents to approve loans while placing less emphasis on borrowers’ incomes and assets wamu set up a system that enabled real estate agents to collect fees of more than  for bringing in borrowers variablerate loans — option adjustable rate mortgages option arms in particular — were especially attractive because they carried higher fees than other loans and allowed wamu to book profits on interest payments that borrowers deferred as wamu was selling many of its loans to investors it worried

investors the washington mutual holding companys board of directors dismissed killinger as the ceo alan h fishman chairman of mortgage broker meridian capital group and a former chief operating officer of sovereign bank was named the new ceo for  days seizure by ots and fdicedit by midseptember  wamus share price had closed as low as  it had been worth over  in september  and had briefly traded as high as  in the previous year while wamu publicly insisted it could stay independent earlier in the month it had quietly hired goldman sachs to identify potential bidders however several deadlines passed without anyone submitting a bid at the same time wamu suffered a massive run mostly via electronic banking over the internet and wire transfercitation needed customers pulled out  billion in deposits in a tenday span this led the federal reserve and the treasury department to step up pressure for wamu to find a buyer as a takeover by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic could have been a severe drain on the fdic insurance fund which had already been hard hit by the failure of indymac that year the fdic ultimately held a secret auction of washington mutual bank finally on the morning of thursday september  which happened to be the th anniversary of wamus establishment regulators informed jpmorgan chase that they were the winners on thursday night shortly after the close of business on the west coast the office of thrift supervision seized washington mutual bank and placed it into the receivership of the fdic in a statement the ots said that the massive run meant that wamu was no longer sound the fdic as receiver sold most of washington mutual banks assets including the branch network to jpmorgan chase for  billion jpmorgan agreed to assume the banks secured debts and liabilities to depositors the transaction did not require any fdic insurance funds normally bank seizures take place after the close of business on fridays however due to the banks deteriorating condition and leaks that a seizure was imminent regulators felt compelled to act a day early because jpmorgan chase bought washington mutuals assets for a low price wamus stockholders were nearly wiped out its stock price dropped to  a share far from  a share in  in its chapter  filing wamu listed assets of  billion and debt of  billion ref appendix a the filing also indicates that enough funds are available for distribution to unsecured creditors within days of the seizure a hedge fund adviser and investment strategist mike stathis of ava investment analytics issued a formal complaint to the securities and exchange commission demonstrating evidence of insider trading the complaint also alleged that washington mutual was not insolvent and several wall street firms and hedge funds had conspired to short the stock he also stated that he spoke with a reporter from the associated press who told him that he was contacted by a washington mutual executive hours before the seizure telling the reporter that it would happen for “political reasons” in later criticisms stathis discussed that neither the fdic nor ots ever disclosed any evidence of washington mutuals insolvency stathis stated that within a few weeks of submitting his complaint he was visited by federal agents who held him in an interrogation room for questioning as a result of this stathis stated that he felt bullied and did not release the sec complaint into the public domain until a year later shareholders fought what they considered the illegal seizure of washington mutual through such websites as wamucoupcom dead link and others claiming that the ots acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and seized the bank for political reasons or for the benefit of jpmorgan chase which acquired a large network of branches at what they claim to be an unfairly low price shareholders claimed that as of the date of the takeover the bank had enough liquidity to meet all its obligations and was in compliance with the business plan negotiated with the ots  weeks earlier and that the holding companys board and management was kept completely in the dark about the governments negotiations with chase hampering the banks ability to sell itself on its own chief executive alan h fishman was flying from new york to seattle on the day the bank was closed and eventually received a  million signon bonus and cash severance of  million which he declined after being ceo for  days senator maria cantwell demanded an explanation from the government and threatened to open an investigation and washington mutuals former shareholders have threatened a lawsuit demanding compensation for the lost value of their shares the seizure of wamu bank resulted in the largest bank failure in american financial history far exceeding the failure of continental illinois in  bankruptcyedit on september   washington mutual inc and its remaining subsidiary wmi investment corp filed for chapter  bankruptcy washington mutual inc was promptly delisted from trading on the new york stock exchange and commenced trading via pink sheets the bankruptcy was the second major filing in as many weeks after the lehman brothers filing eleven days earlier both bankruptcies far outpaced worldcoms  filing which had held the record with just under  billion in assets washington mutuals alone which was approximately half that of lehman brothers was three times as much as worldcoms all assets but only some liabilities including deposits covered bonds and other secured debt of washington mutual bank were assumed by jpmorgan chase under the deal jpmorgan chase acquired all the banking operations of wamu including  billion in assets and  billion in deposits for a price of  billion plus debt assumptions unsecured senior debt obligations of the bank were not assumed by the fdic leaving holders of those obligations with little meaningful source of recovery on friday sep   washington mutual bank customers were informed that deposits held by washington mutual became now liabilities of jpmorgan chase the irs claimed  billion in back taxes from washington mutual inc the company filed court papers on january   alleging losses were  billion and the company requested that it pay nothing of the tax debt stating that the irs could owe washington mutual inc a tax refund in a settlement between wash mutual inc in receivership the fdic and jpmorgan chase that wash mutual inc recently made public a tax refund of about us billion will be shared between wash mutual inc jpmorgan chase and fdic washington mutual inc sued the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic for us billion after the sale of its banking operations to jpmorgan chase wmi attorneys claim the bank did not get fair value for the bank and multiple subsidiaries belonging to the parent company were taken on january   the united states department of justice office of the united states trustee district of delaware pursuant to section a of the bankruptcy code appointed a committee of equity security holders to represent all shareholders of both preferred and common stock all of the motions to disband the committee of equity security holders were denied on january   by us bankruptcy judge mary f walrath district of delaware on july   bankruptcy judge mary walrath approved a motion of the ec for an examiner to investigate potential legal claims and assets of wmi handing a victory to shareholders the judge directed the examiner to investigate not just the legal settlement with the fdic and jpmorgan chase at the heart of wamus reorganization but also all potential claims and assets that are part of the settlement or that will be retained by the company on july   us trustee roberta a deangelis appointed veteran bankruptcy examiner and mckenna long  aldridge llp partner joshua r hochberg to conduct a probe into the proposed settlement between wmi jpmorgan chase and the fdic hochberg is a partner in mckenna long  aldridges washington office whose practice focuses on individual and corporate white collar defense internal investigations and compliance on august   the bankruptcy judge rejected washington mutual incs effort to obtain personal financial information from shareholders demanding that the company schedule an annual meeting attorneys for the ec said that wmi was simply trying to delay scheduling a shareholder meeting by seeking personal information the judge agreed that wmi was not entitled to the information on november   examiner joshua r hochberg from mckenna long  aldridge llp presented his longawaited report but it did not meet the expectations of the court since the report was based on unsworn interviews and confidential attorneyclient work on december  the court decided to exclude the examiners report during the plan confirmation hearings saying it cant be considered expert testimony or submitted as evidence unless it is subject to questioning to determine the basis of its conclusions on january   the bankruptcy court rejected the th proposed plan of reorganization which was proposed by the debtors and their lawyers from weil gotshal  manges llp judge mary walrath focused many of her criticisms on the companys releases of liability granted to directors officers and others including some hedge funds who she said did not contribute anything to the settlement she noted for example that shareholders who will likely get nothing should not have to release the companys board from the threat of being sued by them however many wamu shareholders believe there will be a significant recovery when washington mutual emerges from bankruptcy on september   the court also rejected the modified th proposed plan of reorganization judge mary f walrath wrote that four hedge funds that had played a role in washington mutual’s restructuring might have received confidential information that could have been used to trade improperly in the bank’s debt the four hedge funds are appaloosa management aurelius capital management centerbridge partners and owl creek asset management a seventh plan of reorganization was announced in february  and the company finally emerged from chapter  bankruptcy the following month as wmi holdings corporation by  wmi holdings was able to raise  million and was looking for new

rise and falledit walmart of bankingedit chairman and ceo kerry killinger had pledged in  we hope to do to this industry what walmart did to theirs starbucks did to theirs costco did to theirs and lowes home depot did to their industry and i think if we’ve done our job five years from now you’re not going to call us a bank killingers goal was to build wamu into the walmart of banking which would cater to lower and middleclass consumers that other banks deemed too risky complex mortgages and credit cards had terms that made it easy for the least creditworthy borrowers to get financing a strategy the bank extended in big cities including chicago new york and los angeles wamu pressed sales agents to approve loans while placing less emphasis on borrowers’ incomes and assets wamu set up a system that enabled real estate agents to collect fees of more than  for bringing in borrowers variablerate loans — option adjustable rate mortgages option arms in particular — were especially attractive because they carried higher fees than other loans and allowed wamu to book profits on interest payments that borrowers deferred as wamu was selling many of its loans to investors it worried less about defaults subprime lossesedit the washington mutual tower center right in downtown seattle was washington mutuals corporate headquarters from  until  when the company moved into the new wamu center center left these buildings have since been renamed washington mutual tower is now known as  third avenue and wamu center is now known as russell investments center in december  the subsidiary washington mutual bank reorganized its homeloan division closing  of its  homeloan offices and removing  positions in its homeloan staff a  reduction in march  on the same weekend that jpmorgan chase chairman and ceo jamie dimon negotiated the takeover of bear stearns he secretly dispatched members of his team to seattle to meet with wamu executives urging them to consider a quick deal however wamu chairman and ceo kerry killinger rejected jpmorgan chases offer that valued wamu at  a share mostly in stock in april  the holding company responding to losses and difficulties sustained as a result of the – subprime mortgage crisis announced that  people companywide would lose their jobs and the company stated its intent to close its approximately  remaining standalone homeloan offices including  in washington and a loanprocessing center in bellevue washington it stopped buying loans from outside mortgage brokers — known in the trade as wholesale lending wamu also announced a  billion infusion of new capital by new outside investors led by tpg capital tpg agreed to pump  billion into the washington mutual holding company other investors including some of wamus current institutional holders agreed to buy an additional  billion in newly issued stock this angered many investors as tpgs investment would dilute the holdings of existing shareholders and as wamu executives excluded mortgage losses from computing bonuses in june  kerry killinger stepped down as the chairman though remaining the chief executive officer on september   under pressure from investors the washington mutual holding companys board of directors dismissed killinger as the ceo alan h fishman chairman of mortgage broker meridian capital group and a former chief operating officer of sovereign bank was named the new ceo for  days seizure by ots and fdicedit by midseptember  wamus share price had closed as low as  it had been worth over  in september  and had briefly traded as high as  in the previous year while wamu publicly insisted it could stay independent earlier in the month it had quietly hired goldman sachs to identify potential bidders however several deadlines passed without anyone submitting a bid at the same time wamu suffered a massive run mostly via electronic banking over the internet and wire transfercitation needed customers pulled out  billion in deposits in a tenday span this led the federal reserve and the treasury department to step up pressure for wamu to find a buyer as a takeover by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic could have been a severe drain on the fdic insurance fund which had already been hard hit by the failure of indymac that year the fdic ultimately held a secret auction of washington mutual bank finally on the morning of thursday september  which happened to be the th anniversary of wamus establishment regulators informed jpmorgan chase that they were the winners on thursday night shortly after the close of business on the west coast the office of thrift supervision seized washington mutual bank and placed it into the receivership of the fdic in a statement the ots said that the massive run meant that wamu was no longer sound the fdic as receiver sold most of washington mutual banks assets including the branch network to jpmorgan chase for  billion jpmorgan agreed to assume the banks secured debts and liabilities to depositors the transaction did not require any fdic insurance funds normally bank seizures take place after the close of business on fridays however due to the banks deteriorating condition and leaks that a seizure was imminent regulators felt compelled to act a day early because jpmorgan chase bought washington mutuals assets for a low price wamus stockholders were nearly wiped out its stock price dropped to  a share far from  a share in  in its chapter  filing wamu listed assets of  billion and debt of  billion ref appendix a the filing also indicates that enough funds are available for distribution to unsecured creditors within days of the seizure a hedge fund adviser and investment strategist mike stathis of ava investment analytics issued a formal complaint to the securities and exchange commission demonstrating evidence of insider trading the complaint also alleged that washington mutual was not insolvent and several wall street firms and hedge funds had conspired to short the stock he also stated that he spoke with a reporter from the associated press who told him that he was contacted by a washington mutual executive hours before the seizure telling the reporter that it would happen for “political reasons” in later criticisms stathis discussed that neither the fdic nor ots ever disclosed any evidence of washington mutuals insolvency stathis stated that within a few weeks of submitting his complaint he was visited by federal agents who held him in an interrogation room for questioning as a result of this stathis stated that he felt bullied and did not release the sec complaint into the public domain until a year later shareholders fought what they considered the illegal seizure of washington mutual through such websites as wamucoupcom dead link and others claiming that the ots acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and seized the bank for political reasons or for the benefit of jpmorgan chase which acquired a large network of branches at what they claim to be an unfairly low price shareholders claimed that as of the date of the takeover the bank had enough liquidity to meet all its obligations and was in compliance with the business plan negotiated with the ots  weeks earlier and that the holding companys board and management was kept completely in the dark about the governments negotiations with chase hampering the banks ability to sell itself on its own chief executive alan h fishman was flying from new york to seattle on the day the bank was closed and eventually received a  million signon bonus and cash severance of  million which he declined after being ceo for  days senator maria cantwell demanded an explanation from the government and threatened to open an investigation and washington mutuals former shareholders have threatened a lawsuit demanding compensation for the lost value of their shares the seizure of wamu bank resulted in the largest bank failure in american financial history far exceeding the failure of continental illinois in  bankruptcyedit on september   washington mutual inc and its remaining subsidiary wmi investment corp filed for chapter  bankruptcy washington mutual inc was promptly delisted from trading on the new york stock exchange and commenced trading via pink sheets the bankruptcy was the second major filing in as many weeks after the lehman brothers filing eleven days earlier both bankruptcies far outpaced worldcoms  filing which had held the record with just under  billion in assets washington mutuals alone which was approximately half that of lehman brothers was three times as much as worldcoms all assets but only some liabilities including deposits covered bonds and other secured debt of washington mutual bank were assumed by jpmorgan chase under the deal jpmorgan chase acquired all the banking operations of wamu including  billion in assets and  billion in deposits for a price of  billion plus debt assumptions unsecured senior debt obligations of the bank were not assumed by the fdic leaving holders of those obligations with little meaningful source of recovery on friday sep   washington mutual bank customers were informed that deposits held by washington mutual became now liabilities of jpmorgan chase the irs claimed  billion in back taxes from washington mutual inc the company filed court papers on january   alleging losses were  billion and the company requested that it pay nothing of the tax debt stating that the irs could owe washington mutual inc a tax refund in a settlement between wash mutual inc in receivership the fdic and jpmorgan chase that wash mutual inc recently made public a tax refund of about us billion will be shared between wash mutual inc jpmorgan chase and fdic washington mutual inc sued the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic for us billion after the sale of its banking operations to jpmorgan chase wmi attorneys claim the bank did not get fair value for the bank and multiple subsidiaries belonging to the parent company were taken on january   the united states department of justice office of the united states trustee district of delaware pursuant to section a of the bankruptcy code appointed a committee of equity security holders to represent all shareholders of both preferred and common stock all of the motions to disband the committee of equity security holders were denied on january   by us bankruptcy judge mary f walrath district of delaware on july   bankruptcy judge mary walrath approved a motion of the ec for an examiner to investigate potential legal claims and assets of wmi handing a victory to shareholders the judge directed the examiner to investigate not just the legal settlement with the fdic and jpmorgan chase at the heart of wamus reorganization but also all potential claims and assets that are part of the settlement or that will be retained by the company on july   us trustee roberta a deangelis appointed veteran bankruptcy examiner and mckenna long  aldridge llp partner joshua r hochberg to conduct a probe into the proposed settlement between wmi jpmorgan chase and the fdic hochberg is a partner in mckenna long  aldridges washington office whose practice focuses on individual and corporate white collar defense internal investigations and compliance on august   the bankruptcy judge rejected washington mutual incs effort to obtain personal financial information from shareholders demanding that the company schedule an annual meeting attorneys for the ec said that wmi was simply trying to delay scheduling a shareholder meeting by seeking personal information the judge agreed that wmi was not entitled to the information on november   examiner joshua r hochberg from mckenna long  aldridge llp presented his longawaited report but it did not meet the expectations of the court since the report was based on unsworn interviews and confidential attorneyclient work on december  the court decided to exclude the examiners report during the plan confirmation hearings saying it cant be considered expert testimony or submitted as evidence unless it is subject to questioning to determine the basis of its conclusions on january   the bankruptcy court rejected the th proposed plan of reorganization which was proposed by the debtors and their lawyers from weil gotshal  manges llp judge mary walrath focused many of her criticisms on the companys releases of liability granted to directors officers and others including some hedge funds who she said did not contribute anything to the settlement she noted for example that shareholders who will likely get nothing should not have to release the companys board from the threat of being sued by them however many wamu shareholders believe there will be a significant recovery when washington mutual emerges from bankruptcy on september   the court also rejected the modified th proposed plan of reorganization judge mary f walrath wrote that four hedge funds that had played a role in washington mutual’s restructuring might have received confidential information that could have been used to trade improperly in the bank’s debt the four hedge funds are appaloosa management aurelius capital management centerbridge partners and owl creek asset management a seventh plan of reorganization was announced in february  and the company finally emerged from chapter  bankruptcy the following month as wmi holdings corporation by  wmi holdings was able to raise  million and was looking for new

presentation to investors at csfb private label investor conference washington mutual mortgage securities corp michael aaknes first vice president structured finance forwardlooking statements this presentation contains forwardlooking statements which are not historical facts and pertain to future operating results these forwardlooking statements are within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to statements about our plans objectives expectations and intentions and other statements contained in this document that are not historical facts when used in this presentation the words expects anticipates intends plans believesseeks estimates or words of similar meaning or future or conditional verbs such as will wouldshould could or may are generally intended to identify forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond our control in addition these forwardlooking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in these forwardlooking statements for the reasons among others discussed under the heading businessfactors that may affect future results in washington mutual´s  annual report on form k and under the heading cautionary statements in washington mutual´s quarterly report on form q for the period ended september   which include changes in general business and economic conditions may significantly affect our earnings the risk that our inability to effectively manage the volatility of our mortgage banking business could adversely affect our earnings the risk that the impact of rising interest rates may result in an increase in our cost of interestbearing liabilities which could outpace the increase in the yield on interestearning assets and lead to a reduction in the net interest margin along with the potential decreases in mortgage loan volumes and a corresponding reduction in gain from mortgage loans the impact of falling interest rates may accelerate mortgage prepayment rates which would increase the impairment on mortgage servicing rights msr and may result in balance sheet shrinkage causing a potential reduction in net interest income the risk that our inability to effectively integrate the operations and personnel of companies we have acquired could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition the concentration of operations in california could adversely affect our operating results if the california economy or real estate market declines competition from other financial services companies in our markets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our financial goals changes in the regulation of financial services
