the head and neck resulting in abnormal twisting postures of the head that is frequently associated with pain the treatment of choice for cervical dystonia is botulinum toxin injections unfortunately the drawback of this therapy as currently available is that patients must typically be retreated at approximately  month intervals in order to maintain benefit” said trial investigator cynthia comella md professor of neurological sciences rush university medical center “the data from the rt study indicate that this new formulation of botulinum toxin serotype a may significantly improve symptoms of cervical dystonia and have an impressive duration of benefit of  weeks which is twice as long as the toxins currently available overall i believe rt holds tremendous promise to provide cervical dystonia patients a significant and longerlasting improvement of their symptoms” additional data at st international congress of parkinson’s disease and movement disorders in addition to the

cohort of  subjects received a single dose of up to  units of rt injectable the second cohort of  subjects received between  and  units and the third cohort of  subjects received from  to  units the primary efficacy endpoint of the phase  study was an improvement in dystonia symptoms as measured by change reduction from baseline in toronto western spasmodic torticollis rating scale twstrstotal score at four weeks twstrs is a validated composite scale that covers different features of the cervical dystonia condition the first part of the scale evaluates severity of the condition based on the physical findings of dystonia the second part rates the patient’s perceived level of disability and the third part rates pain associated with the condition the study protocol also feature a number of secondary efficacy endpoints all subjects were followed for up to a total of  weeks after treatment or until return of symptoms that warrant treatment at which time subjects could complete the study due to the long duration of effect seen in the first cohort subjects in the second and third cohorts were given the option to continue several patients elected to remain in the study and will be followed for up to  weeks about cervical dystonia according to the dystonia medical research foundation whose mission is to advance research promote awareness and education and support the needs of

family history or may be brought about by secondary causes such as physical trauma it can result in considerable pain and discomfort treatments for cervical dystonia include oral medications botulinum toxin injections surgery and complementary therapies botulinum toxin can help block the communication between the nerve and the muscle and may alleviate abnormal movements and postures current
