the competition for a landscape master plan that would transform a acre site beside the rhine river from a paved industrial landscape crisscrossed with train tracks into a modern—and largely

gradually demolished and replaced with works by architects and artists of international stature frank gehry rafael moneo and from sanaa kazuyo sejima and ryue nishizawa were among the architects and jenny holzer and richard serra among the artists marked diversity of forms now dominates the campus novel features and technologies were introduced by gehry to conform to the building standards of the

novartis v union of india  others novartis fought a sevenyear controversial battle to patent gleevec in india and took the case all the way to the indian supreme court where the patent application was finally rejected the patent application at the center of the case was filed by novartis in india in  after india had agreed to enter the world trade organization and to abide by worldwide intellectual property standards under the trips agreement as part of this agreement india made changes to its patent law the biggest of which was that prior to these changes patents on products were not allowed while afterwards they were albeit with restrictions these changes came into effect in  so novartis patent application waited in a mailbox with others until then under procedures that india instituted to manage the transition india also passed certain amendments to its patent law in  just before the laws came into effect which played a key role in the rejection of the patent application the patent application claimed the final form of gleevec the beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate in  during the time india did not allow patents on products novartis had patented imatinib with salts vaguely specified in many countries but could not patent it in india the key differences between the two patent applications were that  patent application specified the counterion gleevec is a specific salt  imatinib mesylate while the  patent application did not claim any specific salts nor did it mention mesylate and the  patent application specified the solid form of gleevec  the way the individual molecules are packed together into a solid when the drug itself is manufactured this is separate from processes by which the drug itself is formulated into pills or capsules  while the  patent application did not the solid form of imatinib mesylate in gleevec is beta crystalline as provided under the trips agreement novartis applied for exclusive marketing rights emr for gleevec from the indian patent office and the emr was granted in november  novartis made use of the emr to obtain orders against some generic manufacturers who had already launched gleevec in india novartis set the price of gleevec at usd  per patient per month generic companies were selling their versions at usd  to  per patient per month novartis also initiated a program to assist patients who could not afford its version of the drug concurrent with its product launch when examination of novartis patent application began in  it came under immediate attack from oppositions initiated by generic companies that were already selling gleevec in india and by advocacy groups the application was rejected by the patent office and by an appeal board the key basis for the rejection was the part of indian patent law that was created by amendment in  describing the patentability of new uses for known drugs and modifications of known drugs that section paragraph d specified that such inventions are patentable only if they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy at one point novartis went to court to try to invalidate paragraph d it argued that the provision was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated trips novartis lost that case and did not appeal novartis did appeal the rejection by the patent office to indias supreme court which took the case the supreme court case hinged on the interpretation of paragraph d the supreme court decided that the substance that novartis sought to patent was indeed a modification of a known drug the raw form of imatinib which was publicly disclosed in the  patent application and in scientific articles that novartis did not present evidence of a difference in therapeutic efficacy between the final form of gleevec and the raw form of imatinib and that therefore the patent application was properly rejected by the patent office and lower courts although the court ruled narrowly and took care to note that the subject application was filed during a time of transition in indian patent law the decision generated widespread global news coverage and reignited debates on balancing public good with monopolistic pricing innovation with affordability etc had novartis won and gotten its patent issued it could not have prevented generics companies in india from continuing to sell generic gleevec but it could have obligated them to pay a reasonable royalty under a grandfather clause included in indias patent law in reaction to the decision ranjit shahani vicechairman and managing director of novartis india ltd was quoted as saying this ruling is a setback for patients that will hinder medical progress for diseases without effective treatment options he also said that companies like novartis would invest less money in research in india as a result of the ruling novartis also emphasized that it continues to be committed to access to its drugs according to novartis by   of patients in india—roughly  people—receive glivec free of charge and it has provided more than  billion worth of glivec to indian patients in its support program since it was started sexual discrimination suitedit on  may  a jury in the united states district court for the southern district of new york awarded  in compensatory damages against novartis finding that the company had committed sexual discrimination against twelve female sales representatives and entrylevel managers since  in matters of pay promotion and treatment after learning that the employees were pregnant two months later the company settled with the remaining plaintiffs for  million plus attorney fees marketing violationsedit in september  the us food and drug administration fda sent a notice to novartis pharmaceuticals regarding its advertising of focalin xr an adhd drug in which the company overstated its efficacy while marketing to the public and medical professionals in  federal prosecutors opened an investigation into novartis marketing of several drugs trileptal an antiseizure drug three drugs for heart conditions  diovan the company’s topselling product exforge and tekturna sandostatin a drug to treat a growth hormone disorder and zelnorm a drug for irritable bowel syndrome in september  novartis agreed to pay us million in criminal and civil claims and to enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the us office of the inspector general according to the new york times federal prosecutors accused novartis of paying illegal kickbacks to health care professionals through speaker programs advisory boards entertainment travel and meals but aside from pleading guilty to one misdemeanor charge of mislabeling in an agreement that novartis announced in february the company denied wrongdoing in the same new york times article frank lichtenberg a columbia professor who receives pharmaceutical financing for research on innovation in the industry said offlabel prescribing was encouraged by the american medical association and paid for by insurers but offlabel marketing was clearly illegal so it’s not surprising that they would settle because they don’t have a legal leg to stand on in april  federal prosecutors filed two lawsuits against novartis under the false claims act for offlabel marketing and kickbacks in both suits prosecutors are seeking treble damages the first suit accused novartis of inducing pharmacies to switch thousands of kidney transplant patients to its immunosuppressant drug myfortic in exchange for kickbacks disguised as rebates and discounts in the second the justice department joined a qui tam or whistleblower lawsuit brought by a former sales rep over offlabel marketing of three drugs lotrel and valturna both hypertension drugs and the diabetes drug starlix twentyseven states the district of columbia and chicago and new york also joined fighting offlabel prescribingedit outside the us novartis markets the drug ranibizumab trade name lucentis which is a monoclonal antibody fragment derived from the same parent mouse antibody as bevacizumab avastin both avastin and lucentis were created by genentech which is owned by roche roche markets avastin worldwide and also markets lucentis in the us lucentis has been approved worldwide as a treatment for wet macular degeneration and other retinal disorders avastin is used to treat certain cancers because the price of lucentis is much higher than avastin many ophthalmologists began having compounding pharmacies formulate avastin for administration to the eye and began treating their patients with avastin in  four trusts of the national health service in the uk issued policies approving use and payment for administering avastin for macular degeneration in order to save money even though avastin had not been approved for that indication in april  after failing to persuade the trusts that it was uncertain whether avastin was as safe and effective as lucentis and in order to retain the market for lucentis novartis announced it would sue the trusts however in july novartis offered significant discounts kept confidential to the trusts and the trusts agreed to change their policy and in november novartis dropped the litigation valsartan data scandaledit in the summer of  two japanese universities retracted several publications of clinical trials that purported to show that valsartan branded as diovan had cardiovascular benefits when it was found that statistical analysis had been manipulated and that a novartis employee had participated in the statistical analysis but had not disclosed his relationship with novartis but only his affiliation with osaka city university where he was a lecturer  as a result several japanese hospitals stopped using the drug and media outlets ran reports on the scandal in japan in january  japans health ministry filed a criminal complaint with the tokyo public prosecutors office against novartis and an unspecified number of employees for allegedly misleading consumers through advertisements that used the research to support the benefits of diovan on  july  the prosecutors office announced it was formally charging the

controversies and criticismedit challenge to indias patent lawsedit main article novartis v union of india  others novartis fought a sevenyear controversial battle to patent gleevec in india and took the case all the way to the indian supreme court where the patent application was finally rejected the patent application at the center of the case was filed by novartis in india in  after india had agreed to enter the world trade organization and to abide by worldwide intellectual property standards under the trips agreement as part of this agreement india made changes to its patent law the biggest of which was that prior to these changes patents on products were not allowed while afterwards they were albeit with restrictions these changes came into effect in  so novartis patent application waited in a mailbox with others until then under procedures that india instituted to manage the transition india also passed certain amendments to its patent law in  just before the laws came into effect which played a key role in the rejection of the patent application the patent application claimed the final form of gleevec the beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate in  during the time india did not allow patents on products novartis had patented imatinib with salts vaguely specified in many countries but could not patent it in india the key differences between the two patent applications were that  patent application specified the counterion gleevec is a specific salt  imatinib mesylate while the  patent application did not claim any specific salts nor did it mention mesylate and the  patent application specified the solid form of gleevec  the way the individual molecules are packed together into a solid when the drug itself is manufactured this is separate from processes by which the drug itself is formulated into pills or capsules  while the  patent application did not the solid form of imatinib mesylate in gleevec is beta crystalline as provided under the trips agreement novartis applied for exclusive marketing rights emr for gleevec from the indian patent office and the emr was granted in november  novartis made use of the emr to obtain orders against some generic manufacturers who had already launched gleevec in india novartis set the price of gleevec at usd  per patient per month generic companies were selling their versions at usd  to  per patient per month novartis also initiated a program to assist patients who could not afford its version of the drug concurrent with its product launch when examination of novartis patent application began in  it came under immediate attack from oppositions initiated by generic companies that were already selling gleevec in india and by advocacy groups the application was rejected by the patent office and by an appeal board the key basis for the rejection was the part of indian patent law that was created by amendment in  describing the patentability of new uses for known drugs and modifications of known drugs that section paragraph d specified that such inventions are patentable only if they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy at one point novartis went to court to try to invalidate paragraph d it argued that the provision was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated trips novartis lost that case and did not appeal novartis did appeal the rejection by the patent office to indias supreme court which took the case the supreme court case hinged on the interpretation of paragraph d the supreme court decided that the substance that novartis sought to patent was indeed a modification of a known drug the raw form of imatinib which was publicly disclosed in the  patent application and in scientific articles that novartis did not present evidence of a difference in therapeutic efficacy between the final form of gleevec and the raw form of imatinib and that therefore the patent application was properly rejected by the patent office and lower courts although the court ruled narrowly and took care to note that the subject application was filed during a time of transition in indian patent law the decision generated widespread global news coverage and reignited debates on balancing public good with monopolistic pricing innovation with affordability etc had novartis won and gotten its patent issued it could not have prevented generics companies in india from continuing to sell generic gleevec but it could have obligated them to pay a reasonable royalty under a grandfather clause included in indias patent law in reaction to the decision ranjit shahani vicechairman and managing director of novartis india ltd was quoted as saying this ruling is a setback for patients that will hinder medical progress for diseases without effective treatment options he also said that companies like novartis would invest less money in research in india as a result of the ruling novartis also emphasized that it continues to be committed to access to its drugs according to novartis by   of patients in india—roughly  people—receive glivec free of charge and it has provided more than  billion worth of glivec to indian patients in its support program since it was started sexual discrimination suitedit on  may  a jury in the united states district court for the southern district of new york awarded  in compensatory damages against novartis finding that the company had committed sexual discrimination against twelve female sales representatives and entrylevel managers since  in matters of pay promotion and treatment after learning that the employees were pregnant two months later the company settled with the remaining plaintiffs for  million plus attorney fees marketing violationsedit in september  the us food and drug administration fda sent a notice to novartis pharmaceuticals regarding its advertising of focalin xr an adhd drug in which the company overstated its efficacy while marketing to the public and medical professionals in  federal prosecutors opened an investigation into novartis marketing of several drugs trileptal an antiseizure drug three drugs for heart conditions  diovan the company’s topselling product exforge and tekturna sandostatin a drug to treat a growth hormone disorder and zelnorm a drug for irritable bowel syndrome in september  novartis agreed to pay us million in criminal and civil claims and to enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the us office of the inspector general according to the new york times federal prosecutors accused novartis of paying illegal kickbacks to health care professionals through speaker programs advisory boards entertainment travel and meals but aside from pleading guilty to one misdemeanor charge of mislabeling in an agreement that novartis announced in february the company denied wrongdoing in the same new york times article frank lichtenberg a columbia professor who receives pharmaceutical financing for research on innovation in the industry said offlabel prescribing was encouraged by the american medical association and paid for by insurers but offlabel marketing was clearly illegal so it’s not surprising that they would settle because they don’t have a legal leg to stand on in april  federal prosecutors filed two lawsuits against novartis under the false claims act for offlabel marketing and kickbacks in both suits prosecutors are seeking treble damages the first suit accused novartis of inducing pharmacies to switch thousands of kidney transplant patients to its immunosuppressant drug myfortic in exchange for kickbacks disguised as rebates and discounts in the second the justice department joined a qui tam or whistleblower lawsuit brought by a former sales rep over offlabel marketing of three drugs lotrel and valturna both hypertension drugs and the diabetes drug starlix twentyseven states the district of columbia and chicago and new york also joined fighting offlabel prescribingedit outside the us novartis markets the drug ranibizumab trade name lucentis which is a monoclonal antibody fragment derived from the same parent mouse antibody as bevacizumab avastin both avastin and lucentis were created by genentech which is owned by roche roche markets avastin worldwide and also markets lucentis in the us lucentis has been approved worldwide as a treatment for wet macular degeneration and other retinal disorders avastin is used to treat certain cancers because the price of lucentis is much higher than avastin many ophthalmologists began having compounding pharmacies formulate avastin for administration to the eye and began treating their patients with avastin in  four trusts of the national health service in the uk issued policies approving use and payment for administering avastin for macular degeneration in order to save money even though avastin had not been approved for that indication in april  after failing to persuade the trusts that it was uncertain whether avastin was as safe and effective as lucentis and in order to retain the market for lucentis novartis announced it would sue the trusts however in july novartis offered significant discounts kept confidential to the trusts and the trusts agreed to change their policy and in november novartis dropped the litigation valsartan data scandaledit in the summer of  two japanese universities retracted several publications of clinical trials that purported to show that valsartan branded as diovan had cardiovascular benefits when it was found that statistical analysis had been manipulated and that a novartis employee had participated in the statistical analysis but had not disclosed his relationship with novartis but only his affiliation with osaka city university where he was a lecturer  as a result several japanese hospitals stopped using the drug and media outlets ran reports on the scandal in japan in january  japans health ministry filed a criminal complaint with the tokyo public prosecutors office against novartis and an unspecified number of employees for allegedly misleading consumers through advertisements that used the research to support the benefits of diovan on  july  the prosecutors office announced it was formally charging the company and one of its employees see alsoedit list of pharmaceutical companies pharmaceutical industry in

gradually demolished and replaced with works by architects and artists of international stature frank gehry rafael moneo and from sanaa kazuyo sejima and ryue nishizawa were among the architects and jenny holzer and richard serra among the artists marked diversity of forms now dominates the campus novel features and technologies were introduced by gehry to conform to the building standards of the swiss government that prohibit airconditioning while still selecting a contemporary style of massive use of glass exteriors one adaptation by the architect includes the integration of a building vent

novartis v union of india  others novartis fought a sevenyear controversial battle to patent gleevec in india and took the case all the way to the indian supreme court where the patent application was finally rejected the patent application at the center of the case was filed by novartis in india in  after india had agreed to enter the world trade organization and to abide by worldwide intellectual property standards under the trips agreement as part of this agreement india made changes to its patent law the biggest of which was that prior to these changes patents on products were not allowed while afterwards they were albeit with restrictions these changes came into effect in  so novartis patent application waited in a mailbox with others until then under procedures that india instituted to manage the transition india also passed certain amendments to its patent law in  just before the laws came into effect which played a key role in the rejection of the patent application the patent application claimed the final form of gleevec the beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate in  during the time india did not allow patents on products novartis had patented imatinib with salts vaguely specified in many countries but could not patent it in india the key differences between the two patent applications were that  patent application specified the counterion gleevec is a specific salt  imatinib mesylate while the  patent application did not claim any specific salts nor did it mention mesylate and the  patent application specified the solid form of gleevec  the way the individual molecules are packed together into a solid when the drug itself is manufactured this is separate from processes by which the drug itself is formulated into pills or capsules  while the  patent application did not the solid form of imatinib mesylate in gleevec is beta crystalline as provided under the trips agreement novartis applied for exclusive marketing rights emr for gleevec from the indian patent office and the emr was granted in november  novartis made use of the emr to obtain orders against some generic manufacturers who had already launched gleevec in india novartis set the price of gleevec at usd  per patient per month generic companies were selling their versions at usd  to  per patient per month novartis also initiated a program to assist patients who could not afford its version of the drug concurrent with its product launch when examination of novartis patent application began in  it came under immediate attack from oppositions initiated by generic companies that were already selling gleevec in india and by advocacy groups the application was rejected by the patent office and by an appeal board the key basis for the rejection was the part of indian patent law that was created by amendment in  describing the patentability of new uses for known drugs and modifications of known drugs that section paragraph d specified that such inventions are patentable only if they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy at one point novartis went to court to try to invalidate paragraph d it argued that the provision was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated trips novartis lost that case and did not appeal novartis did appeal the rejection by the patent office to indias supreme court which took the case the supreme court case hinged on the interpretation of paragraph d the supreme court decided that the substance that novartis sought to patent was indeed a modification of a known drug the raw form of imatinib which was publicly disclosed in the  patent application and in scientific articles that novartis did not present evidence of a difference in therapeutic efficacy between the final form of gleevec and the raw form of imatinib and that therefore the patent application was properly rejected by the patent office and lower courts although the court ruled narrowly and took care to note that the subject application was filed during a time of transition in indian patent law the decision generated widespread global news coverage and reignited debates on balancing public good with monopolistic pricing innovation with affordability etc had novartis won and gotten its patent issued it could not have prevented generics companies in india from continuing to sell generic gleevec but it could have obligated them to pay a reasonable royalty under a grandfather clause included in indias patent law in reaction to the decision ranjit shahani vicechairman and managing director of novartis india ltd was quoted as saying this ruling is a setback for patients that will hinder medical progress for diseases without effective treatment options he also said that companies like novartis would invest less money in research in india as a result of the ruling novartis also emphasized that it continues to be committed to access to its drugs according to novartis by   of patients in india—roughly  people—receive glivec free of charge and it has provided more than  billion worth of glivec to indian patients in its support program since it was started sexual discrimination suitedit on  may  a jury in the united states district court for the southern district of new york awarded  in compensatory damages against novartis finding that the company had committed sexual discrimination against twelve female sales representatives and entrylevel managers since  in matters of pay promotion and treatment after learning that the employees were pregnant two months later the company settled with the remaining plaintiffs for  million plus attorney fees marketing violationsedit in september  the us food and drug administration fda sent a notice to novartis pharmaceuticals regarding its advertising of focalin xr an adhd drug in which the company overstated its efficacy while marketing to the public and medical professionals in  federal prosecutors opened an investigation into novartis marketing of several drugs trileptal an antiseizure drug three drugs for heart conditions  diovan the company’s topselling product exforge and tekturna sandostatin a drug to treat a growth hormone disorder and zelnorm a drug for irritable bowel syndrome in september  novartis agreed to pay us million in criminal and civil claims and to enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the us office of the inspector general according to the new york times federal prosecutors accused novartis of paying illegal kickbacks to health care professionals through speaker programs advisory boards entertainment travel and meals but aside from pleading guilty to one misdemeanor charge of mislabeling in an agreement that novartis announced in february the company denied wrongdoing in the same new york times article frank lichtenberg a columbia professor who receives pharmaceutical financing for research on innovation in the industry said offlabel prescribing was encouraged by the american medical association and paid for by insurers but offlabel marketing was clearly illegal so it’s not surprising that they would settle because they don’t have a legal leg to stand on in april  federal prosecutors filed two lawsuits against novartis under the false claims act for offlabel marketing and kickbacks in both suits prosecutors are seeking treble damages the first suit accused novartis of inducing pharmacies to switch thousands of kidney transplant patients to its immunosuppressant drug myfortic in exchange for kickbacks disguised as rebates and discounts in the second the justice department joined a qui tam or whistleblower lawsuit brought by a former sales rep over offlabel marketing of three drugs lotrel and valturna both hypertension drugs and the diabetes drug starlix twentyseven states the district of columbia and chicago and new york also joined fighting offlabel prescribingedit outside the us novartis markets the drug ranibizumab trade name lucentis which is a monoclonal antibody fragment derived from the same parent mouse antibody as bevacizumab avastin both avastin and lucentis were created by genentech which is owned by roche roche markets avastin worldwide and also markets lucentis in the us lucentis has been approved worldwide as a treatment for wet macular degeneration and other retinal disorders avastin is used to treat certain cancers because the price of lucentis is much higher than avastin many ophthalmologists began having compounding pharmacies formulate avastin for administration to the eye and began treating their patients with avastin in  four trusts of the national health service in the uk issued policies approving use and payment for administering avastin for macular degeneration in order to save money even though avastin had not been approved for that indication in april  after failing to persuade the trusts that it was uncertain whether avastin was as safe and effective as lucentis and in order to retain the market for lucentis novartis announced it would sue the trusts however in july novartis offered significant discounts kept confidential to the trusts and the trusts agreed to change their policy and in november novartis dropped the litigation valsartan data scandaledit in the summer of  two japanese universities retracted several publications of clinical trials that purported to show that valsartan branded as diovan had cardiovascular benefits when it was found that statistical analysis had been manipulated and that a novartis employee had participated in the statistical analysis but had not disclosed his relationship with novartis but only his affiliation with osaka city university where he was a lecturer  as a result several japanese hospitals stopped using the drug and media outlets ran reports on the scandal in japan in january  japans health ministry filed a criminal complaint with the tokyo public prosecutors office against novartis and an unspecified number of employees for allegedly misleading consumers through advertisements that used the research to support the benefits of diovan on  july  the prosecutors office announced it was formally charging the

nishizawa were among the architects and jenny holzer and richard serra among the artists marked diversity of forms now dominates the campus novel features and technologies were introduced by gehry to conform to the building standards of the swiss government that prohibit airconditioning while still selecting a contemporary style of massive use of glass exteriors one adaptation by the architect

controversies and criticismedit challenge to indias patent lawsedit main article novartis v union of india  others novartis fought a sevenyear controversial battle to patent gleevec in india and took the case all the way to the indian supreme court where the patent application was finally rejected the patent application at the center of the case was filed by novartis in india in  after india had agreed to enter the world trade organization and to abide by worldwide intellectual property standards under the trips agreement as part of this agreement india made changes to its patent law the biggest of which was that prior to these changes patents on products were not allowed while afterwards they were albeit with restrictions these changes came into effect in  so novartis patent application waited in a mailbox with others until then under procedures that india instituted to manage the transition india also passed certain amendments to its patent law in  just before the laws came into effect which played a key role in the rejection of the patent application the patent application claimed the final form of gleevec the beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate in  during the time india did not allow patents on products novartis had patented imatinib with salts vaguely specified in many countries but could not patent it in india the key differences between the two patent applications were that  patent application specified the counterion gleevec is a specific salt  imatinib mesylate while the  patent application did not claim any specific salts nor did it mention mesylate and the  patent application specified the solid form of gleevec  the way the individual molecules are packed together into a solid when the drug itself is manufactured this is separate from processes by which the drug itself is formulated into pills or capsules  while the  patent application did not the solid form of imatinib mesylate in gleevec is beta crystalline as provided under the trips agreement novartis applied for exclusive marketing rights emr for gleevec from the indian patent office and the emr was granted in november  novartis made use of the emr to obtain orders against some generic manufacturers who had already launched gleevec in india novartis set the price of gleevec at usd  per patient per month generic companies were selling their versions at usd  to  per patient per month novartis also initiated a program to assist patients who could not afford its version of the drug concurrent with its product launch when examination of novartis patent application began in  it came under immediate attack from oppositions initiated by generic companies that were already selling gleevec in india and by advocacy groups the application was rejected by the patent office and by an appeal board the key basis for the rejection was the part of indian patent law that was created by amendment in  describing the patentability of new uses for known drugs and modifications of known drugs that section paragraph d specified that such inventions are patentable only if they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy at one point novartis went to court to try to invalidate paragraph d it argued that the provision was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated trips novartis lost that case and did not appeal novartis did appeal the rejection by the patent office to indias supreme court which took the case the supreme court case hinged on the interpretation of paragraph d the supreme court decided that the substance that novartis sought to patent was indeed a modification of a known drug the raw form of imatinib which was publicly disclosed in the  patent application and in scientific articles that novartis did not present evidence of a difference in therapeutic efficacy between the final form of gleevec and the raw form of imatinib and that therefore the patent application was properly rejected by the patent office and lower courts although the court ruled narrowly and took care to note that the subject application was filed during a time of transition in indian patent law the decision generated widespread global news coverage and reignited debates on balancing public good with monopolistic pricing innovation with affordability etc had novartis won and gotten its patent issued it could not have prevented generics companies in india from continuing to sell generic gleevec but it could have obligated them to pay a reasonable royalty under a grandfather clause included in indias patent law in reaction to the decision ranjit shahani vicechairman and managing director of novartis india ltd was quoted as saying this ruling is a setback for patients that will hinder medical progress for diseases without effective treatment options he also said that companies like novartis would invest less money in research in india as a result of the ruling novartis also emphasized that it continues to be committed to access to its drugs according to novartis by   of patients in india—roughly  people—receive glivec free of charge and it has provided more than  billion worth of glivec to indian patients in its support program since it was started sexual discrimination suitedit on  may  a jury in the united states district court for the southern district of new york awarded  in compensatory damages against novartis finding that the company had committed sexual discrimination against twelve female sales representatives and entrylevel managers since  in matters of pay promotion and treatment after learning that the employees were pregnant two months later the company settled with the remaining plaintiffs for  million plus attorney fees marketing violationsedit in september  the us food and drug administration fda sent a notice to novartis pharmaceuticals regarding its advertising of focalin xr an adhd drug in which the company overstated its efficacy while marketing to the public and medical professionals in  federal prosecutors opened an investigation into novartis marketing of several drugs trileptal an antiseizure drug three drugs for heart conditions  diovan the company’s topselling product exforge and tekturna sandostatin a drug to treat a growth hormone disorder and zelnorm a drug for irritable bowel syndrome in september  novartis agreed to pay us million in criminal and civil claims and to enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the us office of the inspector general according to the new york times federal prosecutors accused novartis of paying illegal kickbacks to health care professionals through speaker programs advisory boards entertainment travel and meals but aside from pleading guilty to one misdemeanor charge of mislabeling in an agreement that novartis announced in february the company denied wrongdoing in the same new york times article frank lichtenberg a columbia professor who receives pharmaceutical financing for research on innovation in the industry said offlabel prescribing was encouraged by the american medical association and paid for by insurers but offlabel marketing was clearly illegal so it’s not surprising that they would settle because they don’t have a legal leg to stand on in april  federal prosecutors filed two lawsuits against novartis under the false claims act for offlabel marketing and kickbacks in both suits prosecutors are seeking treble damages the first suit accused novartis of inducing pharmacies to switch thousands of kidney transplant patients to its immunosuppressant drug myfortic in exchange for kickbacks disguised as rebates and discounts in the second the justice department joined a qui tam or whistleblower lawsuit brought by a former sales rep over offlabel marketing of three drugs lotrel and valturna both hypertension drugs and the diabetes drug starlix twentyseven states the district of columbia and chicago and new york also joined fighting offlabel prescribingedit outside the us novartis markets the drug ranibizumab trade name lucentis which is a monoclonal antibody fragment derived from the same parent mouse antibody as bevacizumab avastin both avastin and lucentis were created by genentech which is owned by roche roche markets avastin worldwide and also markets lucentis in the us lucentis has been approved worldwide as a treatment for wet macular degeneration and other retinal disorders avastin is used to treat certain cancers because the price of lucentis is much higher than avastin many ophthalmologists began having compounding pharmacies formulate avastin for administration to the eye and began treating their patients with avastin in  four trusts of the national health service in the uk issued policies approving use and payment for administering avastin for macular degeneration in order to save money even though avastin had not been approved for that indication in april  after failing to persuade the trusts that it was uncertain whether avastin was as safe and effective as lucentis and in order to retain the market for lucentis novartis announced it would sue the trusts however in july novartis offered significant discounts kept confidential to the trusts and the trusts agreed to change their policy and in november novartis dropped the litigation valsartan data scandaledit in the summer of  two japanese universities retracted several publications of clinical trials that purported to show that valsartan branded as diovan had cardiovascular benefits when it was found that statistical analysis had been manipulated and that a novartis employee had participated in the statistical analysis but had not disclosed his relationship with novartis but only his affiliation with osaka city university where he was a lecturer  as a result several japanese hospitals stopped using the drug and media outlets ran reports on the scandal in japan in january  japans health ministry filed a criminal complaint with the tokyo public prosecutors office against novartis and an unspecified number of employees for allegedly misleading consumers through advertisements that used the research to support the benefits of diovan on  july  the prosecutors office announced it was formally charging the company and one of its employees see alsoedit list of pharmaceutical companies pharmaceutical industry in

the competition for a landscape master plan that would transform a acre site beside the rhine river from a paved industrial landscape crisscrossed with train tracks into a modern—and largely pedestrian—research and administrative campus filled with outdoor art trees greens and parks the plan also dealt with an extensive network of existing underground infrastructure the buildings were gradually demolished and replaced with works by architects and artists of international stature frank gehry rafael moneo and from sanaa kazuyo sejima and ryue nishizawa were among the architects and jenny holzer and richard serra among the artists marked diversity of forms now dominates the campus novel features and technologies were introduced by gehry to conform to the building standards of the swiss government that prohibit airconditioning while still selecting a contemporary style of massive use of glass exteriors one adaptation by the architect includes the integration of a building vent

novartis v union of india  others novartis fought a sevenyear controversial battle to patent gleevec in india and took the case all the way to the indian supreme court where the patent application was finally rejected the patent application at the center of the case was filed by novartis in india in  after india had agreed to enter the world trade organization and to abide by worldwide intellectual property standards under the trips agreement as part of this agreement india made changes to its patent law the biggest of which was that prior to these changes patents on products were not allowed while afterwards they were albeit with restrictions these changes came into effect in  so novartis patent application waited in a mailbox with others until then under procedures that india instituted to manage the transition india also passed certain amendments to its patent law in  just before the laws came into effect which played a key role in the rejection of the patent application the patent application claimed the final form of gleevec the beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate in  during the time india did not allow patents on products novartis had patented imatinib with salts vaguely specified in many countries but could not patent it in india the key differences between the two patent applications were that  patent application specified the counterion gleevec is a specific salt  imatinib mesylate while the  patent application did not claim any specific salts nor did it mention mesylate and the  patent application specified the solid form of gleevec  the way the individual molecules are packed together into a solid when the drug itself is manufactured this is separate from processes by which the drug itself is formulated into pills or capsules  while the  patent application did not the solid form of imatinib mesylate in gleevec is beta crystalline as provided under the trips agreement novartis applied for exclusive marketing rights emr for gleevec from the indian patent office and the emr was granted in november  novartis made use of the emr to obtain orders against some generic manufacturers who had already launched gleevec in india novartis set the price of gleevec at usd  per patient per month generic companies were selling their versions at usd  to  per patient per month novartis also initiated a program to assist patients who could not afford its version of the drug concurrent with its product launch when examination of novartis patent application began in  it came under immediate attack from oppositions initiated by generic companies that were already selling gleevec in india and by advocacy groups the application was rejected by the patent office and by an appeal board the key basis for the rejection was the part of indian patent law that was created by amendment in  describing the patentability of new uses for known drugs and modifications of known drugs that section paragraph d specified that such inventions are patentable only if they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy at one point novartis went to court to try to invalidate paragraph d it argued that the provision was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated trips novartis lost that case and did not appeal novartis did appeal the rejection by the patent office to indias supreme court which took the case the supreme court case hinged on the interpretation of paragraph d the supreme court decided that the substance that novartis sought to patent was indeed a modification of a known drug the raw form of imatinib which was publicly disclosed in the  patent application and in scientific articles that novartis did not present evidence of a difference in therapeutic efficacy between the final form of gleevec and the raw form of imatinib and that therefore the patent application was properly rejected by the patent office and lower courts although the court ruled narrowly and took care to note that the subject application was filed during a time of transition in indian patent law the decision generated widespread global news coverage and reignited debates on balancing public good with monopolistic pricing innovation with affordability etc had novartis won and gotten its patent issued it could not have prevented generics companies in india from continuing to sell generic gleevec but it could have obligated them to pay a reasonable royalty under a grandfather clause included in indias patent law in reaction to the decision ranjit shahani vicechairman and managing director of novartis india ltd was quoted as saying this ruling is a setback for patients that will hinder medical progress for diseases without effective treatment options he also said that companies like novartis would invest less money in research in india as a result of the ruling novartis also emphasized that it continues to be committed to access to its drugs according to novartis by   of patients in india—roughly  people—receive glivec free of charge and it has provided more than  billion worth of glivec to indian patients in its support program since it was started sexual discrimination suitedit on  may  a jury in the united states district court for the southern district of new york awarded  in compensatory damages against novartis finding that the company had committed sexual discrimination against twelve female sales representatives and entrylevel managers since  in matters of pay promotion and treatment after learning that the employees were pregnant two months later the company settled with the remaining plaintiffs for  million plus attorney fees marketing violationsedit in september  the us food and drug administration fda sent a notice to novartis pharmaceuticals regarding its advertising of focalin xr an adhd drug in which the company overstated its efficacy while marketing to the public and medical professionals in  federal prosecutors opened an investigation into novartis marketing of several drugs trileptal an antiseizure drug three drugs for heart conditions  diovan the company’s topselling product exforge and tekturna sandostatin a drug to treat a growth hormone disorder and zelnorm a drug for irritable bowel syndrome in september  novartis agreed to pay us million in criminal and civil claims and to enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the us office of the inspector general according to the new york times federal prosecutors accused novartis of paying illegal kickbacks to health care professionals through speaker programs advisory boards entertainment travel and meals but aside from pleading guilty to one misdemeanor charge of mislabeling in an agreement that novartis announced in february the company denied wrongdoing in the same new york times article frank lichtenberg a columbia professor who receives pharmaceutical financing for research on innovation in the industry said offlabel prescribing was encouraged by the american medical association and paid for by insurers but offlabel marketing was clearly illegal so it’s not surprising that they would settle because they don’t have a legal leg to stand on in april  federal prosecutors filed two lawsuits against novartis under the false claims act for offlabel marketing and kickbacks in both suits prosecutors are seeking treble damages the first suit accused novartis of inducing pharmacies to switch thousands of kidney transplant patients to its immunosuppressant drug myfortic in exchange for kickbacks disguised as rebates and discounts in the second the justice department joined a qui tam or whistleblower lawsuit brought by a former sales rep over offlabel marketing of three drugs lotrel and valturna both hypertension drugs and the diabetes drug starlix twentyseven states the district of columbia and chicago and new york also joined fighting offlabel prescribingedit outside the us novartis markets the drug ranibizumab trade name lucentis which is a monoclonal antibody fragment derived from the same parent mouse antibody as bevacizumab avastin both avastin and lucentis were created by genentech which is owned by roche roche markets avastin worldwide and also markets lucentis in the us lucentis has been approved worldwide as a treatment for wet macular degeneration and other retinal disorders avastin is used to treat certain cancers because the price of lucentis is much higher than avastin many ophthalmologists began having compounding pharmacies formulate avastin for administration to the eye and began treating their patients with avastin in  four trusts of the national health service in the uk issued policies approving use and payment for administering avastin for macular degeneration in order to save money even though avastin had not been approved for that indication in april  after failing to persuade the trusts that it was uncertain whether avastin was as safe and effective as lucentis and in order to retain the market for lucentis novartis announced it would sue the trusts however in july novartis offered significant discounts kept confidential to the trusts and the trusts agreed to change their policy and in november novartis dropped the litigation valsartan data scandaledit in the summer of  two japanese universities retracted several publications of clinical trials that purported to show that valsartan branded as diovan had cardiovascular benefits when it was found that statistical analysis had been manipulated and that a novartis employee had participated in the statistical analysis but had not disclosed his relationship with novartis but only his affiliation with osaka city university where he was a lecturer  as a result several japanese hospitals stopped using the drug and media outlets ran reports on the scandal in japan in january  japans health ministry filed a criminal complaint with the tokyo public prosecutors office against novartis and an unspecified number of employees for allegedly misleading consumers through advertisements that used the research to support the benefits of diovan on  july  the prosecutors office announced it was formally charging the company and one of its employees see alsoedit list of pharmaceutical companies pharmaceutical industry in switzerland notes and referencesedit  a b c d e f pdf novartis ag annual results

conform to the building standards of the swiss government that prohibit airconditioning while still selecting a contemporary style of massive use of glass exteriors one adaptation by the architect

controversies and criticismedit challenge to indias patent lawsedit main article novartis v union of india  others novartis fought a sevenyear controversial battle to patent gleevec in india and took the case all the way to the indian supreme court where the patent application was finally rejected the patent application at the center of the case was filed by novartis in india in  after india had agreed to enter the world trade organization and to abide by worldwide intellectual property standards under the trips agreement as part of this agreement india made changes to its patent law the biggest of which was that prior to these changes patents on products were not allowed while afterwards they were albeit with restrictions these changes came into effect in  so novartis patent application waited in a mailbox with others until then under procedures that india instituted to manage the transition india also passed certain amendments to its patent law in  just before the laws came into effect which played a key role in the rejection of the patent application the patent application claimed the final form of gleevec the beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate in  during the time india did not allow patents on products novartis had patented imatinib with salts vaguely specified in many countries but could not patent it in india the key differences between the two patent applications were that  patent application specified the counterion gleevec is a specific salt  imatinib mesylate while the  patent application did not claim any specific salts nor did it mention mesylate and the  patent application specified the solid form of gleevec  the way the individual molecules are packed together into a solid when the drug itself is manufactured this is separate from processes by which the drug itself is formulated into pills or capsules  while the  patent application did not the solid form of imatinib mesylate in gleevec is beta crystalline as provided under the trips agreement novartis applied for exclusive marketing rights emr for gleevec from the indian patent office and the emr was granted in november  novartis made use of the emr to obtain orders against some generic manufacturers who had already launched gleevec in india novartis set the price of gleevec at usd  per patient per month generic companies were selling their versions at usd  to  per patient per month novartis also initiated a program to assist patients who could not afford its version of the drug concurrent with its product launch when examination of novartis patent application began in  it came under immediate attack from oppositions initiated by generic companies that were already selling gleevec in india and by advocacy groups the application was rejected by the patent office and by an appeal board the key basis for the rejection was the part of indian patent law that was created by amendment in  describing the patentability of new uses for known drugs and modifications of known drugs that section paragraph d specified that such inventions are patentable only if they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy at one point novartis went to court to try to invalidate paragraph d it argued that the provision was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated trips novartis lost that case and did not appeal novartis did appeal the rejection by the patent office to indias supreme court which took the case the supreme court case hinged on the interpretation of paragraph d the supreme court decided that the substance that novartis sought to patent was indeed a modification of a known drug the raw form of imatinib which was publicly disclosed in the  patent application and in scientific articles that novartis did not present evidence of a difference in therapeutic efficacy between the final form of gleevec and the raw form of imatinib and that therefore the patent application was properly rejected by the patent office and lower courts although the court ruled narrowly and took care to note that the subject application was filed during a time of transition in indian patent law the decision generated widespread global news coverage and reignited debates on balancing public good with monopolistic pricing innovation with affordability etc had novartis won and gotten its patent issued it could not have prevented generics companies in india from continuing to sell generic gleevec but it could have obligated them to pay a reasonable royalty under a grandfather clause included in indias patent law in reaction to the decision ranjit shahani vicechairman and managing director of novartis india ltd was quoted as saying this ruling is a setback for patients that will hinder medical progress for diseases without effective treatment options he also said that companies like novartis would invest less money in research in india as a result of the ruling novartis also emphasized that it continues to be committed to access to its drugs according to novartis by   of patients in india—roughly  people—receive glivec free of charge and it has provided more than  billion worth of glivec to indian patients in its support program since it was started sexual discrimination suitedit on  may  a jury in the united states district court for the southern district of new york awarded  in compensatory damages against novartis finding that the company had committed sexual discrimination against twelve female sales representatives and entrylevel managers since  in matters of pay promotion and treatment after learning that the employees were pregnant two months later the company settled with the remaining plaintiffs for  million plus attorney fees marketing violationsedit in september  the us food and drug administration fda sent a notice to novartis pharmaceuticals regarding its advertising of focalin xr an adhd drug in which the company overstated its efficacy while marketing to the public and medical professionals in  federal prosecutors opened an investigation into novartis marketing of several drugs trileptal an antiseizure drug three drugs for heart conditions  diovan the company’s topselling product exforge and tekturna sandostatin a drug to treat a growth hormone disorder and zelnorm a drug for irritable bowel syndrome in september  novartis agreed to pay us million in criminal and civil claims and to enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the us office of the inspector general according to the new york times federal prosecutors accused novartis of paying illegal kickbacks to health care professionals through speaker programs advisory boards entertainment travel and meals but aside from pleading guilty to one misdemeanor charge of mislabeling in an agreement that novartis announced in february the company denied wrongdoing in the same new york times article frank lichtenberg a columbia professor who receives pharmaceutical financing for research on innovation in the industry said offlabel prescribing was encouraged by the american medical association and paid for by insurers but offlabel marketing was clearly illegal so it’s not surprising that they would settle because they don’t have a legal leg to stand on in april  federal prosecutors filed two lawsuits against novartis under the false claims act for offlabel marketing and kickbacks in both suits prosecutors are seeking treble damages the first suit accused novartis of inducing pharmacies to switch thousands of kidney transplant patients to its immunosuppressant drug myfortic in exchange for kickbacks disguised as rebates and discounts in the second the justice department joined a qui tam or whistleblower lawsuit brought by a former sales rep over offlabel marketing of three drugs lotrel and valturna both hypertension drugs and the diabetes drug starlix twentyseven states the district of columbia and chicago and new york also joined fighting offlabel prescribingedit outside the us novartis markets the drug ranibizumab trade name lucentis which is a monoclonal antibody fragment derived from the same parent mouse antibody as bevacizumab avastin both avastin and lucentis were created by genentech which is owned by roche roche markets avastin worldwide and also markets lucentis in the us lucentis has been approved worldwide as a treatment for wet macular degeneration and other retinal disorders avastin is used to treat certain cancers because the price of lucentis is much higher than avastin many ophthalmologists began having compounding pharmacies formulate avastin for administration to the eye and began treating their patients with avastin in  four trusts of the national health service in the uk issued policies approving use and payment for administering avastin for macular degeneration in order to save money even though avastin had not been approved for that indication in april  after failing to persuade the trusts that it was uncertain whether avastin was as safe and effective as lucentis and in order to retain the market for lucentis novartis announced it would sue the trusts however in july novartis offered significant discounts kept confidential to the trusts and the trusts agreed to change their policy and in november novartis dropped the litigation valsartan data scandaledit in the summer of  two japanese universities retracted several publications of clinical trials that purported to show that valsartan branded as diovan had cardiovascular benefits when it was found that statistical analysis had been manipulated and that a novartis employee had participated in the statistical analysis but had not disclosed his relationship with novartis but only his affiliation with osaka city university where he was a lecturer  as a result several japanese hospitals stopped using the drug and media outlets ran reports on the scandal in japan in january  japans health ministry filed a criminal complaint with the tokyo public prosecutors office against novartis and an unspecified number of employees for allegedly misleading consumers through advertisements that used the research to support the benefits of diovan on  july  the prosecutors office announced it was formally charging the company and one of its employees see alsoedit list of pharmaceutical companies pharmaceutical industry in

lambdacyhalothrin virusnip potassium monopersulfate controversies and criticismedit challenge to indias patent lawsedit main article novartis v union of india  others novartis fought a sevenyear controversial battle to patent gleevec in india and took the case all the way to the indian supreme court where the patent application was finally rejected the patent application at the center of the case was filed by novartis in india in  after india had agreed to enter the world trade organization and to abide by worldwide intellectual property standards under the trips agreement as part of this agreement india made changes to its patent law the biggest of which was that prior to these changes patents on products were not allowed while afterwards they were albeit with restrictions these changes came into effect in  so novartis patent application waited in a mailbox with others until then under procedures that india instituted to manage the transition india also passed certain amendments to its patent law in  just before the laws came into effect which played a key role in the rejection of the patent application the patent application claimed the final form of gleevec the beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate in  during the time india did not allow patents on products novartis had patented imatinib with salts vaguely specified in many countries but could not patent it in india the key differences between the two patent applications were that  patent application specified the counterion gleevec is a specific salt  imatinib mesylate while the  patent application did not claim any specific salts nor did it mention mesylate and the  patent application specified the solid form of gleevec  the way the individual molecules are packed together into a solid when the drug itself is manufactured this is separate from processes by which the drug itself is formulated into pills or capsules  while the  patent application did not the solid form of imatinib mesylate in gleevec is beta crystalline as provided under the trips agreement novartis applied for exclusive marketing rights emr for gleevec from the indian patent office and the emr was granted in november  novartis made use of the emr to obtain orders against some generic manufacturers who had already launched gleevec in india novartis set the price of gleevec at usd  per patient per month generic companies were selling their versions at usd  to  per patient per month novartis also initiated a program to assist patients who could not afford its version of the drug concurrent with its product launch when examination of novartis patent application began in  it came under immediate attack from oppositions initiated by generic companies that were already selling gleevec in india and by advocacy groups the application was rejected by the patent office and by an appeal board the key basis for the rejection was the part of indian patent law that was created by amendment in  describing the patentability of new uses for known drugs and modifications of known drugs that section paragraph d specified that such inventions are patentable only if they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy at one point novartis went to court to try to invalidate paragraph d it argued that the provision was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated trips novartis lost that case and did not appeal novartis did appeal the rejection by the patent office to indias supreme court which took the case the supreme court case hinged on the interpretation of paragraph d the supreme court decided that the substance that novartis sought to patent was indeed a modification of a known drug the raw form of imatinib which was publicly disclosed in the  patent application and in scientific articles that novartis did not present evidence of a difference in therapeutic efficacy between the final form of gleevec and the raw form of imatinib and that therefore the patent application was properly rejected by the patent office and lower courts although the court ruled narrowly and took care to note that the subject application was filed during a time of transition in indian patent law the decision generated widespread global news coverage and reignited debates on balancing public good with monopolistic pricing innovation with affordability etc had novartis won and gotten its patent issued it could not have prevented generics companies in india from continuing to sell generic gleevec but it could have obligated them to pay a reasonable royalty under a grandfather clause included in indias patent law in reaction to the decision ranjit shahani vicechairman and managing director of novartis india ltd was quoted as saying this ruling is a setback for patients that will hinder medical progress for diseases without effective treatment options he also said that companies like novartis would invest less money in research in india as a result of the ruling novartis also emphasized that it continues to be committed to access to its drugs according to novartis by   of patients in india—roughly  people—receive glivec free of charge and it has provided more than  billion worth of glivec to indian patients in its support program since it was started sexual discrimination suitedit on  may  a jury in the united states district court for the

marketing was clearly illegal so it’s not surprising that they would settle because they don’t have a legal leg to stand on in april  federal prosecutors filed two lawsuits against novartis under the false claims act for offlabel marketing and kickbacks in both suits prosecutors are seeking treble damages the first suit accused novartis of inducing pharmacies to switch thousands of kidney transplant patients to its immunosuppressant drug myfortic in exchange for kickbacks disguised as rebates and discounts in the second the justice department joined a qui tam or whistleblower lawsuit brought by a former sales rep over offlabel marketing of three drugs lotrel and valturna both hypertension drugs and the diabetes drug starlix twentyseven states the district of columbia and chicago and new york also joined fighting offlabel prescribingedit outside the us novartis markets the drug ranibizumab trade name lucentis which is a monoclonal antibody fragment derived from the same parent mouse antibody as bevacizumab avastin both avastin and lucentis were created by genentech which is owned by roche roche markets avastin worldwide and also markets lucentis in the us lucentis has been approved worldwide as a treatment for wet macular degeneration and other retinal disorders avastin is used to treat certain cancers because the price of lucentis is much higher than avastin many ophthalmologists began having compounding pharmacies formulate avastin for administration to the eye and began treating their patients with avastin in  four trusts of the national health service in the uk issued policies approving use and payment for administering avastin for macular degeneration in order to save money even though avastin had not been approved for that indication in april  after failing to persuade the trusts that it was uncertain whether avastin was as safe and effective as lucentis and in order to retain the market for lucentis novartis announced it would sue the trusts however in july novartis offered significant discounts kept confidential to the trusts and the trusts agreed to change their policy and in november novartis dropped the litigation valsartan data scandaledit in the summer of  two japanese universities retracted several publications of clinical trials that purported to show that valsartan branded as diovan had cardiovascular benefits when it was found that statistical analysis had been manipulated and that a novartis employee had participated in the statistical analysis but had not disclosed his relationship with novartis but only his affiliation with osaka city university where he was a lecturer  as a result several japanese hospitals stopped using the drug and media outlets ran reports on the scandal in japan in january  japans health ministry filed a criminal complaint with the tokyo public prosecutors office against novartis and an unspecified number of employees for allegedly misleading consumers through advertisements that used the research to support the benefits of diovan on  july  the prosecutors office announced it was formally charging the company and one of its employees see alsoedit list of pharmaceutical

in  pwp landscape architecture won the competition for a landscape master plan that would transform a acre site beside the rhine river from a paved industrial landscape crisscrossed with train tracks into a modern—and largely pedestrian—research and administrative campus filled with outdoor art trees greens and parks the plan also dealt with an extensive network of existing underground infrastructure the buildings were gradually demolished and replaced with works by architects and artists of international stature frank gehry rafael moneo and from sanaa kazuyo sejima and ryue nishizawa were among the architects and jenny holzer and richard serra among the artists marked diversity of forms now dominates the campus novel features and technologies were introduced by gehry to conform to the building standards of the swiss government that prohibit airconditioning while still selecting a contemporary style of massive use of glass exteriors one adaptation by the architect

controversies and criticismedit challenge to indias patent lawsedit main article novartis v union of india  others novartis fought a sevenyear controversial battle to patent gleevec in india and took the case all the way to the indian supreme court where the patent application was finally rejected the patent application at the center of the case was filed by novartis in india in  after india had agreed to enter the world trade organization and to abide by worldwide intellectual property standards under the trips agreement as part of this agreement india made changes to its patent law the biggest of which was that prior to these changes patents on products were not allowed while afterwards they were albeit with restrictions these changes came into effect in  so novartis patent application waited in a mailbox with others until then under procedures that india instituted to manage the transition india also passed certain amendments to its patent law in  just before the laws came into effect which played a key role in the rejection of the patent application the patent application claimed the final form of gleevec the beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate in  during the time india did not allow patents on products novartis had patented imatinib with salts vaguely specified in many countries but could not patent it in india the key differences between the two patent applications were that  patent application specified the counterion gleevec is a specific salt  imatinib mesylate while the  patent application did not claim any specific salts nor did it mention mesylate and the  patent application specified the solid form of gleevec  the way the individual molecules are packed together into a solid when the drug itself is manufactured this is separate from processes by which the drug itself is formulated into pills or capsules  while the  patent application did not the solid form of imatinib mesylate in gleevec is beta crystalline as provided under the trips agreement novartis applied for exclusive marketing rights emr for gleevec from the indian patent office and the emr was granted in november  novartis made use of the emr to obtain orders against some generic manufacturers who had already launched gleevec in india novartis set the price of gleevec at usd  per patient per month generic companies were selling their versions at usd  to  per patient per month novartis also initiated a program to assist patients who could not afford its version of the drug concurrent with its product launch when examination of novartis patent application began in  it came under immediate attack from oppositions initiated by generic companies that were already selling gleevec in india and by advocacy groups the application was rejected by the patent office and by an appeal board the key basis for the rejection was the part of indian patent law that was created by amendment in  describing the patentability of new uses for known drugs and modifications of known drugs that section paragraph d specified that such inventions are patentable only if they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy at one point novartis went to court to try to invalidate paragraph d it argued that the provision was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated trips novartis lost that case and did not appeal novartis did appeal the rejection by the patent office to indias supreme court which took the case the supreme court case hinged on the interpretation of paragraph d the supreme court decided that the substance that novartis sought to patent was indeed a modification of a known drug the raw form of imatinib which was publicly disclosed in the  patent application and in scientific articles that novartis did not present evidence of a difference in therapeutic efficacy between the final form of gleevec and the raw form of imatinib and that therefore the patent application was properly rejected by the patent office and lower courts although the court ruled narrowly and took care to note that the subject application was filed during a time of transition in indian patent law the decision generated widespread global news coverage and reignited debates on balancing public good with monopolistic pricing innovation with affordability etc had novartis won and gotten its patent issued it could not have prevented generics companies in india from continuing to sell generic gleevec but it could have obligated them to pay a reasonable royalty under a grandfather clause included in indias patent law in reaction to the decision ranjit shahani vicechairman and managing director of novartis india ltd was quoted as saying this ruling is a setback for patients that will hinder medical progress for diseases without effective treatment options he also said that companies like novartis would invest less money in research in india as a result of the ruling novartis also emphasized that it continues to be committed to access to its drugs according to novartis by   of patients in india—roughly  people—receive glivec free of charge and it has provided more than  billion worth of glivec to indian patients in its support program since it was started sexual discrimination suitedit on  may  a jury in the united states district court for the southern district of new york awarded  in compensatory damages against novartis finding that the company had committed sexual discrimination against twelve female sales representatives and entrylevel managers since  in matters of pay promotion and treatment after learning that the employees were pregnant two months later the company settled with the remaining plaintiffs for  million plus attorney fees marketing violationsedit in september  the us food and drug administration fda sent a notice to novartis pharmaceuticals regarding its advertising of focalin xr an adhd drug in which the company overstated its efficacy while marketing to the public and medical professionals in  federal prosecutors opened an investigation into novartis marketing of several drugs trileptal an antiseizure drug three drugs for heart conditions  diovan the company’s topselling product exforge and tekturna sandostatin a drug to treat a growth hormone disorder and zelnorm a drug for irritable bowel syndrome in september  novartis agreed to pay us million in criminal and civil claims and to enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the us office of the inspector general according to the new york times federal prosecutors accused novartis of paying illegal kickbacks to health care professionals through speaker programs advisory boards entertainment travel and meals but aside from pleading guilty to one misdemeanor charge of mislabeling in an agreement that novartis announced in february the company denied wrongdoing in the same new york times article frank lichtenberg a columbia professor who receives pharmaceutical financing for research on innovation in the industry said offlabel prescribing was encouraged by the american medical association and paid for by insurers but offlabel marketing was clearly illegal so it’s not surprising that they would settle because they don’t have a legal leg to stand on in april  federal prosecutors filed two lawsuits against novartis under the false claims act for offlabel marketing and kickbacks in both suits prosecutors are seeking treble damages the first suit accused novartis of inducing pharmacies to switch thousands of kidney transplant patients to its immunosuppressant drug myfortic in exchange for kickbacks disguised as rebates and discounts in the second the justice department joined a qui tam or whistleblower lawsuit brought by a former sales rep over offlabel marketing of three drugs lotrel and valturna both hypertension drugs and the diabetes drug starlix twentyseven states the district of columbia and chicago and new york also joined fighting offlabel prescribingedit outside the us novartis markets the drug ranibizumab trade name lucentis which is a monoclonal antibody fragment derived from the same parent mouse antibody as bevacizumab avastin both avastin and lucentis were created by genentech which is owned by roche roche markets avastin worldwide and also markets lucentis in the us lucentis has been approved worldwide as a treatment for wet macular degeneration and other retinal disorders avastin is used to treat certain cancers because the price of lucentis is much higher than avastin many ophthalmologists began having compounding pharmacies formulate avastin for administration to the eye and began treating their patients with avastin in  four trusts of the national health service in the uk issued policies approving use and payment for administering avastin for macular degeneration in order to save money even though avastin had not been approved for that indication in april  after failing to persuade the trusts that it was uncertain whether avastin was as safe and effective as lucentis and in order to retain the market for lucentis novartis announced it would sue the trusts however in july novartis offered significant discounts kept confidential to the trusts and the trusts agreed to change their policy and in november novartis dropped the litigation valsartan data scandaledit in the summer of  two japanese universities retracted several publications of clinical trials that purported to show that valsartan branded as diovan had cardiovascular benefits when it was found that statistical analysis had been manipulated and that a novartis employee had participated in the statistical analysis but had not disclosed his relationship with novartis but only his affiliation with osaka city university where he was a lecturer  as a result several japanese hospitals stopped using the drug and media outlets ran reports on the scandal in japan in january  japans health ministry filed a criminal complaint with the tokyo public prosecutors office against novartis and an unspecified number of employees for allegedly misleading consumers through advertisements that used the research to support the benefits of diovan on  july  the prosecutors office announced it was formally charging the company and one of its employees see alsoedit list of pharmaceutical companies pharmaceutical industry in

innovation knowledge and encounter the pharmaceutical giant decided to transform the existing sandoz office buildings and chemical factories of its headquarters in  in  pwp landscape architecture won the competition for a landscape master plan that would transform a acre site beside the rhine river from a paved industrial landscape crisscrossed with train tracks into a modern—and largely pedestrian—research and administrative campus filled with outdoor art trees greens and parks the plan also dealt with an extensive network of existing underground infrastructure the buildings were gradually demolished and replaced with works by architects and artists of international stature frank gehry rafael moneo and from sanaa kazuyo sejima and ryue nishizawa were among the architects and jenny holzer and richard serra among the artists marked diversity of forms now dominates the campus novel features and technologies were introduced by gehry to conform to the building standards of the swiss government that prohibit airconditioning while still selecting a contemporary style of massive use of glass exteriors one adaptation by the architect includes the integration of a building vent

novartis v union of india  others novartis fought a sevenyear controversial battle to patent gleevec in india and took the case all the way to the indian supreme court where the patent application was finally rejected the patent application at the center of the case was filed by novartis in india in  after india had agreed to enter the world trade organization and to abide by worldwide intellectual property standards under the trips agreement as part of this agreement india made changes to its patent law the biggest of which was that prior to these changes patents on products were not allowed while afterwards they were albeit with restrictions these changes came into effect in  so novartis patent application waited in a mailbox with others until then under procedures that india instituted to manage the transition india also passed certain amendments to its patent law in  just before the laws came into effect which played a key role in the rejection of the patent application the patent application claimed the final form of gleevec the beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate in  during the time india did not allow patents on products novartis had patented imatinib with salts vaguely specified in many countries but could not patent it in india the key differences between the two patent applications were that  patent application specified the counterion gleevec is a specific salt  imatinib mesylate while the  patent application did not claim any specific salts nor did it mention mesylate and the  patent application specified the solid form of gleevec  the way the individual molecules are packed together into a solid when the drug itself is manufactured this is separate from processes by which the drug itself is formulated into pills or capsules  while the  patent application did not the solid form of imatinib mesylate in gleevec is beta crystalline as provided under the trips agreement novartis applied for exclusive marketing rights emr for gleevec from the indian patent office and the emr was granted in november  novartis made use of the emr to obtain orders against some generic manufacturers who had already launched gleevec in india novartis set the price of gleevec at usd  per patient per month generic companies were selling their versions at usd  to  per patient per month novartis also initiated a program to assist patients who could not afford its version of the drug concurrent with its product launch when examination of novartis patent application began in  it came under immediate attack from oppositions initiated by generic companies that were already selling gleevec in india and by advocacy groups the application was rejected by the patent office and by an appeal board the key basis for the rejection was the part of indian patent law that was created by amendment in  describing the patentability of new uses for known drugs and modifications of known drugs that section paragraph d specified that such inventions are patentable only if they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy at one point novartis went to court to try to invalidate paragraph d it argued that the provision was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated trips novartis lost that case and did not appeal novartis did appeal the rejection by the patent office to indias supreme court which took the case the supreme court case hinged on the interpretation of paragraph d the supreme court decided that the substance that novartis sought to patent was indeed a modification of a known drug the raw form of imatinib which was publicly disclosed in the  patent application and in scientific articles that novartis did not present evidence of a difference in therapeutic efficacy between the final form of gleevec and the raw form of imatinib and that therefore the patent application was properly rejected by the patent office and lower courts although the court ruled narrowly and took care to note that the subject application was filed during a time of transition in indian patent law the decision generated widespread global news coverage and reignited debates on balancing public good with monopolistic pricing innovation with affordability etc had novartis won and gotten its patent issued it could not have prevented generics companies in india from continuing to sell generic gleevec but it could have obligated them to pay a reasonable royalty under a grandfather clause included in indias patent law in reaction to the decision ranjit shahani vicechairman and managing director of novartis india ltd was quoted as saying this ruling is a setback for patients that will hinder medical progress for diseases without effective treatment options he also said that companies like novartis would invest less money in research in india as a result of the ruling novartis also emphasized that it continues to be committed to access to its drugs according to novartis by   of patients in india—roughly  people—receive glivec free of charge and it has provided more than  billion worth of glivec to indian patients in its support program since it was started sexual discrimination suitedit on  may  a jury in the united states district court for the southern district of new york awarded  in compensatory damages against novartis finding that the company had committed sexual discrimination against twelve female sales representatives and entrylevel managers since  in matters of pay promotion and treatment after learning that the employees were pregnant two months later the company settled with the remaining plaintiffs for  million plus attorney fees marketing violationsedit in september  the us food and drug administration fda sent a notice to novartis pharmaceuticals regarding its advertising of focalin xr an adhd drug in which the company overstated its efficacy while marketing to the public and medical professionals in  federal prosecutors opened an investigation into novartis marketing of several drugs trileptal an antiseizure drug three drugs for heart conditions  diovan the company’s topselling product exforge and tekturna sandostatin a drug to treat a growth hormone disorder and zelnorm a drug for irritable bowel syndrome in september  novartis agreed to pay us million in criminal and civil claims and to enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the us office of the inspector general according to the new york times federal prosecutors accused novartis of paying illegal kickbacks to health care professionals through speaker programs advisory boards entertainment travel and meals but aside from pleading guilty to one misdemeanor charge of mislabeling in an agreement that novartis announced in february the company denied wrongdoing in the same new york times article frank lichtenberg a columbia professor who receives pharmaceutical financing for research on innovation in the industry said offlabel prescribing was encouraged by the american medical association and paid for by insurers but offlabel marketing was clearly illegal so it’s not surprising that they would settle because they don’t have a legal leg to stand on in april  federal prosecutors filed two lawsuits against novartis under the false claims act for offlabel marketing and kickbacks in both suits prosecutors are seeking treble damages the first suit accused novartis of inducing pharmacies to switch thousands of kidney transplant patients to its immunosuppressant drug myfortic in exchange for kickbacks disguised as rebates and discounts in the second the justice department joined a qui tam or whistleblower lawsuit brought by a former sales rep over offlabel marketing of three drugs lotrel and valturna both hypertension drugs and the diabetes drug starlix twentyseven states the district of columbia and chicago and new york also joined fighting offlabel prescribingedit outside the us novartis markets the drug ranibizumab trade name lucentis which is a monoclonal antibody fragment derived from the same parent mouse antibody as bevacizumab avastin both avastin and lucentis were created by genentech which is owned by roche roche markets avastin worldwide and also markets lucentis in the us lucentis has been approved worldwide as a treatment for wet macular degeneration and other retinal disorders avastin is used to treat certain cancers because the price of lucentis is much higher than avastin many ophthalmologists began having compounding pharmacies formulate avastin for administration to the eye and began treating their patients with avastin in  four trusts of the national health service in the uk issued policies approving use and payment for administering avastin for macular degeneration in order to save money even though avastin had not been approved for that indication in april  after failing to persuade the trusts that it was uncertain whether avastin was as safe and effective as lucentis and in order to retain the market for lucentis novartis announced it would sue the trusts however in july novartis offered significant discounts kept confidential to the trusts and the trusts agreed to change their policy and in november novartis dropped the litigation valsartan data scandaledit in the summer of  two japanese universities retracted several publications of clinical trials that purported to show that valsartan branded as diovan had cardiovascular benefits when it was found that statistical analysis had been manipulated and that a novartis employee had participated in the statistical analysis but had not disclosed his relationship with novartis but only his affiliation with osaka city university where he was a lecturer  as a result several japanese hospitals stopped using the drug and media outlets ran reports on the scandal in japan in january  japans health ministry filed a criminal complaint with the tokyo public prosecutors office against novartis and an unspecified number of employees for allegedly misleading consumers through advertisements that used the research to support the benefits of diovan on  july  the prosecutors office announced it was formally charging the company and one of its employees see alsoedit list of pharmaceutical companies pharmaceutical industry in switzerland notes and referencesedit  a b c d e f pdf novartis ag annual results

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds deletor subject mid predicate mid object midliteral languagecode csv
