kids classes that help develop core life skills all while having fun more than mudpies a blog by tinkergarten® may  may  ick ticks dont let these suckers force you indoors meg graham maclean i love the woods it is my happy place and i love bringing my kids to share it but i hate ticks they give me the heeby jeebies over time i have learned to live with these little pests as much as i would love to steer clear of them completely ticks are like any risk for my kids and me — i want to be educated and focus on how to manage the risk so we can still enjoy the great outdoorsfor those of you who feel similarly here’s the information that has helped me get the most out of nature during high tick seasonwhat ticks should you worry aboutnot all ticks present the same danger if you can identify ticks you can better identify the risks associated see the chart of the common ticks at different life stages ticks at the nymph and adult female stage are the most likely to transmit disease though they eat all year they usually feed in the spring and summer you can find more information about the life cycle for each tick type on the university of rhode island’s tickencounteraccording to the cdc of all of the tickborne diseases the most common is lyme with an estimated  cases in the us each year that is less than  of the population although incident rates are definitely geography dependent the highest rate reported in  was in vermont with around  cases per  people fortunately lyme can usually be treated with a round of antibiotics and in most cases has no lasting effects especially if caught earlyif geeking out on tick info makes you feel more prepared the cdc has some cool maps to show the geographic distribution of the most common ticks with links to their associated diseases it is helpful to know the symptoms of the most common tickborne diseases in your area but remember that the tickborne diseases are not very common how do you prevent tick bitesso now we get to the risk management part in short the best way to avoid tickborne disease is the prevention of a tick bite the good news is you do not need to stay indoors thanks to the following tested and trusted techniques tick bites can be minimizedboth the cdc and tickencounter have some great information on prevention techniques and i highly suggest taking a look at both sources for the latest and greatest information here is a quick list of my favorite prevention measures avoid optimal tick habitats such as areas that have high grass lots of brush or leaf litter  wear lightcolored clothing so you can spot a moving black dot and pull it off yourself or your little onestuck pants into socks and shirt into pants yes you feel a little silly and sometimes hot but you buy yourself much more time to spot the tick when you make them search for a spot to latch onuse a lint roller over clothes and skin to catch ticks you didn’t spot before you get in the car or house don’t have a lint roller do a visual check before leaving the woodstake off the clothing you wore outside and toss them in the dryer on high heat for at least  minutes most ticks won’t survive the heat cycle  take a shower within  hours of being in a likely tick zone ticks can be slow to nibble so a shower can wash off any ticks that haven’t yet bittendo daily tick checks generally the longer a tick is feeding the higher your chances of contracting a disease ticks can hitch a ride on backpacks blankets animals you name it — so best to be safe and keep the tick check a part of the daily routine at least in the prime tick months favorite places ticks like to go on your body include areas between the toes back of the knees groin armpits and neck the scalp and behind the earsuse tick repellant for me it’s been worth designating some of my family’s clothing as “field gear” and treating it with permethrin particularly shoes we also use both natural and nonnatural repellant sprays when necessary the epa has a neat tool to help you decide which if any repellant options are best for you and your familywhat do i do if i find a tickto start just breathe then remember that having a tick crawling on you or your kids is creepy but no cause for alarm if the tick has bitten one of you follow these steps from the cdc to remove the tick if you can identify the type of tick it was and make a note of the day when the tick was found along with any idea about where you might have picked it up this can help your doctor if youre one of the rare cases that get sick following a tick bitein my many years of traipsing around in the woods as a tree researcher i have not stuck to trails i’ve had a few tick bites but i have certainly tested these prevention steps and they really work for limiting bites the woods are still my happy place and i still hate ticks but i have learned to live with them as part of the nature i love so much meg graham maclean latest articlefollow us tudorinsidestyle ads can be placed here may  why
