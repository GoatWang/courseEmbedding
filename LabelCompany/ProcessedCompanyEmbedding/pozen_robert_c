prolific author financialindustry heavyweight–tackles more in a month than you manage in a year or something like that here the productivity guru–efficiently–shares what you really need to know about achieving peak career performance by drake baer minute read“no matter what your career aspirations are” writes robert pozen in extreme productivity “you should begin by thinking carefully about why you are engaging in any activity and what you can expect to get out of it”advertisementfor pozen marrying an understanding of the big picture how to form and place your goals to the small picture how to bring them to bear on your schedule is the essence of productivity robert pozengiven that he once simultaneously served as president of fidelity management  research company and a fulltime lecturer at harvard business school while dashing off articles for harvard business review on the side–read his enviable cv here if you dare it’s clear everyone could learn a thing or two from pozen about how to work well and not become overwhelmedthe “hubris” of career planningchatting in the fast company offices pozen describes how he “backed into” each step of his career–an instructive path to consider for anyone who’s been left tonguetied by the interview question “tell me where you want to be in five years”pozen went to harvard for undergrad then yale for law school and soon started teaching at georgetown and nyu he felt he couldn’t make an impact through academia so he moved to dc to become associate general counsel at the sec then needing to support his family he became partner at a dc law firm caplin  drysdale however he soon saw that the client side was more interesting and so moved to fidelity investments to become general counsel in  by the time he retired in  he had become president–something he couldn’t have predicted way back in his sec daysthe moves he made showcase what he calls “stepbystep optionality” a careerplanning philosophy that emphasizes developing skills that meet the marketplace instead of asking “where do i want to be in  years”–which he calls an “act of hubris” for its assumption of controlling a career pozen advocates a measured probabilistic approach establishing long medium and shortterm goals“priorities are the yearly goals that i’m most interested in achieving” he says “then they become operationalized through weekly goals” how to decide on those priorities–and how to implement them–requires further thoughtadvertisementsupply and demandthe wisdom of “find your passion” only gets at half of the equation pozen says while vitally important for personal happiness the questions of “what am i best at” and “what do i like most to do” only address the supply side he says consider for instance how many college guys want to become sportscasters equally important is the demand side considering what your organization and your world are looking for not a ton of sportscastersthe trick then is seeing what skills will be needed in your organization and your industry and developing them in yourself pozen says sometimes it’s clear if your company’s moving into latin america you might want to learn spanish he recommends getting on your boss’s wavelength by asking questions like “what are we trying to do in the next year” and “where do we see our expansions where do we see our contractions”–that way you’ll know what the influencers are looking forsimilarly as you navigate through the industry you need to be informed you do your reading you can go to conferences but most importantly you’ve got to talk “the most important thing is to talk to people that have jobs that you might like and to see what they say the job involves” pozen says if you don’t there’s a risk of having an unrealistic or romanticized view of the skills required to get a given gig you might need to be able to read a financial statement or code computer programs but you can’t know if you don’t ask he says when you know or have an idea of what skills will be in demand you can set upon getting themto level up your skills you want to always be looking for onthejob training whether structured or not “some companies offer formal courses” he says “but you can structure your work life so as to gain those skills” some skills like management are broadly transferable if you’re given a choice to manage take it as it will open up later options same with experience abroad–it avails international work “if you have that mindset then you’re always looking in your current job for ways to increase your options in the future by gaining new skills new experiences and new contacts”to make these goals happen you need to operationalize themminimize your routine maximize your timeeveryone–including president obama–is better off with a uniform of sorts pozen wears the same thing every day a dark suit and recommends that you do too “unless you work in fashion” he adds “you need to get through your routine as fast as possible” he says so that you can invest your energy in projects that further your yearly ambitions–whether you wear dark or light socks is probably of lesser consequence and making even the smallest of choices day after day drains your decisionmaking ability it’s the same reason he eats cheerios and bananas for breakfast and a sandwich and a diet soda for lunch each day–your decisionmaking energy needs to be wisely investedadvertisement clothed and fed the next step is email for which pozen has a pair of rules  and ohio the first has caught on in the startup scene–meaning that you get most of your value from  percent of your work “you have to take your email and discard  percent” he says “but that  percent is important to you deal with it right then because if you say i’ll get to it next week you’ll invariably spend an hour on it then” that’s where ohio–only handle it once–comes in if the task is important handle it immediatelyto calibrate daily activities to yearly goals pozen recommends a twosided schedule at the end of your day plot out your time spent in two columns list each activity on the left and describe its purpose on the right if the right side doesn’t pursue your priorities–cultivating transferable skills expanding your contacts the like–then you have a mismatch between what you want to do and who you want to be and what you’re actually doingyour daily schedule needs to be connected to your yearly objectives if not you’re just getting through the day “if you want an active schedule” he says “you have to husband your time so you can act on the things that are important”drake baer covers leadership for fast company follow him on twitterimage flickr user the south london lopadvertisementrelated storiesleadershipwhy telling john mccain to beat cancer
