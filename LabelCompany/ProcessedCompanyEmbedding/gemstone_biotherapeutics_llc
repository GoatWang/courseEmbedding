targeted for the management of a variety of chronic and acute wounds gemstone bio was founded in 0 by gamma  llc based on technology developed by dr sharon gerecht and licensed from john hopkins university and is dedicated to the field of regenerative medicine the company’s full patent portfolio includes core technologies that utilize cell engineering methods and biomaterials to promote vascularization a critical component in advanced tissue repair and regeneration gemstone bio’s initial therapeutic product is a biosynthetic scaffold for advanced wound healing applications in initial animal testing the scaffold demonstrated unprecedented results in its ability to heal fullthickness wounds with complete skin regeneration and minimal to no visible scarring after burn trauma “the potential to revolutionize the wound care industry is incredibly exciting for our investors our industry and most significantly for patients with chronic and acute wounds” said george davis ceo of gemstone biotherapeutics “this latest round of funding will enable us to more aggressively pursue major regulatory and clinical milestones these include securing the human and physical resources needed to achieve our commercialization objectives the results of recently completed gemstone biosponsored scientific studies of the scaffold technology provide additional confidence that our solution is on the right track” “it is very exciting and rewarding to see the inventions that were originally developed in our labs at johns hopkins university have such a clear path to commercial viability

bio utilizes exclusivelylicensed core technology that was developed at johns hopkins university the ip portfolio comprises a unique mix of innovative products and techniques our technology boasts a widerange of regenerative medicine applications including wound healing scaffolds and topical therapeutics scaffold technology polymerbased scaffolds are extensively used in regenerative medicine applications because they provide a threedimensional structure that simulates the native cell environment and extracellular matrix gemstones first generation product is a novel biosynthetic scaffold for wound healing gemstones scaffolds highly tunable meaning they can easily be tailored for specific wound healing applications the incorporation of active ingredients including therapeutics cells and growth factors allow for continuous scaffold evolution topical therapeutic researchers at johns hopkins have discovered that a wellknown category of medications have a profoundly positive impact on the healing of chronic wounds via several specific biological mechanisms this research is based on prior evidence that certain receptors are markedly increased in the wounds of older and diabetic patients increased levels of this proinflammatory receptor play a critical role in skin vulnerability poor wound healing and the development of chronic wounds our advanced wound care technologies are
