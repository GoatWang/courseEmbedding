first sip and that’s not just our pride talking blame it on the catholic school upbringing of brothers michael and david or their lust for hedonistically seductive wine our flagship old vine zinfandel hails from the enviable lodi appellation where zin reigns supreme here for six generations we’ve given our souls to growing the finest grapes so that saints and sinners alike can enjoy the  deadly zins wine specs vintage  varietal zinfandel appellation lodi acid gml ph  aging  months american oak bottling date may   alcohol   wine profile tasting notes a little pepper spice and plenty of candied red berry fruit opens up the nose of our   deadly zins full and rich with flavors of black cherry currants olive tapenade and exotic spices are rounded out with toasted oak notes on a lengthy finish food pairing notes this wine opens up beautifully when paired with food especially a juicy tritip sandwich product reviews rick frommer nov   at  am my favorite wine do i detect a hint of cinnamon cbfortier dec   at  pm we go out of our way to buy michael david wines bought a case of this and now regretting it after opening a bottle its flat with one dimensional finish there is also a slight bitterness i gave  bottles to some friends for christmas now im regretting it alexander pokryvailo dec   at  am i have been buying this wine for  years never regretted it rich full taste never came across a spoiled bottle worth its money lothar durktle jan   at  pm i usually hate zinfandel this was the best zinfandel ive ever had  vintage terry pearson mar   at  pm the other day i was browsing the wine shelves at my local walgreens and noticed a bottle of seven deadly zins vintage  i know surely it got overlooked at the back of the display it was with the s and marked  must be some mistake says i so i checked with a clerk no mistake she tells me  so i brought it home and we had it night before last with a london broil that i had marinated all day and grilled to medium rare ambrosia david apr   at  pm usually like this wine but this bottle i bought from costco is a  and its terrible wondering if all  is bad karen apr   at  am terrible bottle ive been drinking  deadly zins for years this  bottle is bad it burns like vinegar and gave me an upset stomach and heartburn andrew apr   at  pm i really liked this great value for the price i like their freak show cab and petit peti a lot so i went by their reputation tom apr   at  pm my wife and i have been big fans of  deadly zins for several years now it’s delicious our goto zin and is amazingly versatile — pairs seamlessly with any number of strongflavored dishes from steak au poivre to the hoisinbased pork barbecue we enjoyed tonight with a  vintage theyve sold us a lot of wine and i don’t see that changing anytime soon as long as they keep up such great work and in case you’re wondering the clever name drew us in initially but it’s the quality that keeps us coming back george pallas jun   at  pm great wine those who claim no flavor and just alcohol have just opened a wine that has bottleshock bottleshock can last up to  months and effects newly released wines the most as well as wines older than  years bottle shock can occur just from tipping wine from being on its side for awhile to upright to open that is why i let a bottle rest right side up for  weeks at least before opening michael jul   at  am this was my favorite for years  i recently bought a case and have had seven terrible bottles so far  there is a problem with the the   i have ordered this wine at restaurants with the same results so its not just my case  the last time i decided to order a taste from a new bottle the waitress told me they are getting a lot of complaints and its not same as it used to be  obviously there is a problem with the  i definitely do not recommend add a product review name email rating   excellent   pretty good   average   ok   poor review email me when someone reviews this product add your
