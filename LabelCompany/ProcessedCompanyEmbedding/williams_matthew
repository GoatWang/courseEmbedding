male quality  value  meets expectations  as i stated in a couple of my previous reviews of other items i am going to be in israel in a very short time for a day tour so far i have loved the deeper connections series dvdbased bible studies as they have parts that are filmed on location in israel to see the site locations that pertain to the miracles and where jesus walked helped dramatically to put scripture into perspective the teaching in the  different bible studies are solid on the last days of jesus and how we can apply the lessons we learn to our lives is excellent to say the least from a content perspective this is put together very well you wont go wrong with purchasing this excellent bible study kit dvd video isbn  as i mentioned previously in this review it is based all on the digital content and not the physical content so i received electronic video files from rose publishing to watch each of the sessions included in the dvd that comes with the kit the videos range from around  to  minutes in length the videos are very professionally done and each session has separate sections to them initially the lesson starts out with an amazing introduction with margaret feinberg that is filmed on location in israel which helps connect the scriptures on such a personal level she really did an excellent job i honestly love the approach of doing these videos onsite in israel for two reasons first because i will be taking a trip with my wife and her mother in a little over a week for a day trip to israel i enjoy seeing some of the sites ahead of time second and more importantly seeing some of the sites where these events took place many years ago really helps us to put scripture into perspective so we can understand it better and apply it more accurately to our lives after the introduction the video teachings start off with an audio reading of the pertinent scriptures from the niv audio bible and then the lesson from the teacher and finally a quick video graphic called connecting the bible to life where they direct you to the discussion section within the participants guide where we review how to apply what weve learned some of the videos are broken up during the teaching portion to have discussions throughout the teaching time leader guide digital copy included with the dvd the kit comes with a digital copy of the leader guide that you can print out it is  pages so it was not a huge burden on my printer my review is based on the digital copy that i received from rose publishing each of the six sessions has very helpful ideas for group leaders on how to prepare setup and conduct the bible study meetings tips for preparation for before the meeting how to open the session and so much more clear instructions are vital in my opinion and rose did a very nice job accomplishing just that the leaderfacilitator should have no issues running a bible study using these materials and this leader guide i received a copy of this digital material from rose publishing in exchange for my honest review was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate debbie from christfocus harrison ar age  gender female  stars out of  informative and interesting bible study january   debbie from christfocus harrison ar age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  the last days of jesus is a session dvd bible study for small groups or personal use each session is  minutes long it starts with  minutes of video on location in israel ceasarea philippi mount of olives garden tomb etc with margaret feinberg this is followed by audio of the study text from matthew using the niv audio bible then a new testament scholar provides  minutes of commentary on the passage and  minutes of application they walk you through the text while explaining first century context and cultural background information for example session  covers who do people say that i am and explained why people thought jesus might be those people and what they expected of the messiah dr williams also explained some phrases like keys of the kingdom of heaven and underlying word plays each session features a different speaker so session  on matthew  features dr matt williams session  on matthew  features dr mark strauss and session  on matthew  features dr gary burge the lessons are on jesus the messiah the transfiguration the triumphal entry the last supper the trial and death of jesus and jesus resurrection overall i thought that the three sessions i viewed were informative and interesting id recommend this series as a small group

the first collection of exploratory essays on edward lear places lears work into a wide range of contexts both among his contemporaries and in a longer perspective seek to explore and appreciate the playfulness embodied in the poems and to provide contexts in which it can be better understood and enjoyed edward lear and the play of poetry edited by james williams and matthew bevis description of all the victorian poets edward lear has a good claim to the widest audience admired and championed by critics and poets from john ruskin to john ashbery he has also been read heard and loved by generations of children as a central figure in the literature of nonsense lear has also shaped the evolution of modern literature and his work continues to influence and inspire writers and readers today this collection of essays the first ever devoted solely to lear builds on a recent resurgence of critical interest and asks how it is that the play of lears poetry continues to delight and to challenge our sense of what poetry can be these seventeen chapters written by established and emerging critics of poetry seek to explore and appreciate the playfulness embodied in the poems and to provide contexts in which it can be better understood and enjoyed they consider how lears poems play off various inheritances the literary fool romantic lyric his religious upbringing explore particular forms in which his playful genius took flight his letters his queer writings about love and trace lines of learical influence and inheritance by showing how other poets and thinkers across the nineteenth and twentieth centuries played off lear in their turn stein eliot auden smith ashbery and others show more edward lear and the play of poetry edited by james williams and matthew bevis

looks bright indeed its contributors show it to be possible to write successfully about his nonsense in diverse ways  arriving at a moment when lears critical fortunes appear to be on the rise it will be an essential point of reference martin dubois review of english studies an admirable new collectionrarely does a collection of essays published by an academic press carry such emotional nuance or tune it to the requirements of literary analysis so deftly and consistentlythis collection will swiftly become one of the first ports of call for lear scholars but some of its essays deserve to be
