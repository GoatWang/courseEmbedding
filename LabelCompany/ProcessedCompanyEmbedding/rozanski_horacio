story is published you’re all set sign up invalid email address got it got it january   i was born and raised in argentina we grew up under a military dictatorship it was somewhat turbulent in 9 the military relinquished power to the democratic government that created a huge backlash against authority we went from one extreme of authoritarianism to an anythinggoes type of society our education in some ways was shaped by that during the dictatorship the way you dressed was very regimented but when things changed we as a society stopped studying and we showed up when we felt like it    it was not conducive for learning it wasn’t a society that my wife and i felt particularly at ease in that was the impetus for applying to colleges in the united states so we wrote to a lot of schools and eventually landed at the university of wisconsin at eau claire everything was different i left buenos aires in january and it was  degrees in the middle of a heat wave i landed in minneapolis and it was minus i eventually went to business school at the university of chicago i became a summer intern at booz allen which led to a job in the cleveland office my wife and i moved there with an idea that i would be at booz allen for three years and move on to the next thing twentyone years later the rest is history back when i started if you would have told me i would have this role at the company i would’ve told you there was something wrong with your crystal ball i was a commercial consultant and loved client service i was excited about working for a client in a way that makes a real difference i thought that was going to be my career path my left turn came when i was asked to help rethink the people strategy for the commercial business i was not a human relations specialist if anything i was a strategist and marketing specialist but they chose me because i had a reputation for having a passion for people it fit my passions as an immigrant i wake up every morning realizing how blessed i am to be here make a life and work on a mission that enhances the country now as president i want to continue to build on the strengths of the firm — interview with vanessa small horacio
