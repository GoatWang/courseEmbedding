the league of nations in  the emperor condemned the use of chemical weapons by italy against his people during the second italo–ethiopian war his internationalist views led to ethiopia becoming a charter member of the league of nations and his political thought and experience in promoting multilateralism and collective security have proved seminal and enduring his suppression of rebellions among the landed aristocracy the mesafint which consistently opposed his reforms as well as what some critics perceived to be ethiopias failure to modernize rapidly enough earned him criticism among some contemporaries and historians his regime was also criticized by human rights groups such as human rights watch as autocratic and illiberal among the rastafari movement whose followers are estimated at between two and four million haile selassie is revered as the returned messiah of the bible god incarnate beginning in jamaica in the s the rastafari movement perceives haile selassie as

ተፈሪ መኮንን lij teferī mekōnnin lij is translated as child and serves to indicate that a youth is of noble blood his given name tafari means one who is respected or feared like most ethiopians his personal name tafari is followed by that of his father makonnen and rarely that of his grandfather woldemikael his geez name haile selassie was given to him at his infant baptism and adopted again as part of his regnal name in  as governor of harer he became known as ras teferi makonnen  listen help·info ras is translated as head and is a rank of nobility equivalent to duke though it is often rendered in translation as prince in  empress zewditu i appointed him to the position of balemulu siltan enderase regent plenipotentiary in  she granted him the throne of shoa elevating his title to negus or king on  november  after the death of empress zewditu ras tafari was crowned negusa nagast literally king of kings rendered in english as emperor upon his ascension he took as his regnal name haile selassie i haile means in geez power of and selassie means trinity—therefore haile selassie roughly translates to power of the trinity haile selassies full title in office was by the conquering lion of the tribe of judah his imperial majesty haile selassie i king of kings of ethiopia elect of godnb  this title reflects ethiopian dynastic traditions which hold that all monarchs must trace their lineage to menelik i who was the offspring of king solomon and the queen of sheba to ethiopians haile selassie has been known by many names including janhoy talaqu meri and abba tekel the rastafari movement employs many of these appellations also referring to him as jah jah jah jah rastafari and him the abbreviation of his imperial majesty biographyedit early lifeedit ras makonnen woldemikael and his son lij tafari makonnen haile selassies royal line through his fathers mother originated from the amhara people he was born on  july  in the village of ejersa goro in the harar province of ethiopia his mother was woizero lady yeshimebet ali abba jifar daughter of the renowned oromo ruler of wollo province dejazmach ali abba jifar his maternal grandmother was of gurage heritage tafaris father was ras makonnen woldemikael gudessa the governor of harar ras makonnen served as a general in the first italo–ethiopian war playing a key role at the battle of adwa he too was paternally oromo but maternally amhara haile selassie was thus able to ascend to the imperial throne through his paternal grandmother woizero tenagnework sahle selassie who was an aunt of emperor menelik ii and daughter of negus sahle selassie of shewa as such haile selassie claimed direct descent from makeda the queen of sheba and king solomon of ancient israel ras makonnen arranged for tafari as well as his first cousin imru haile selassie to receive instruction in harar from abba samuel wolde kahin an ethiopian capuchin monk and from dr vitalien a surgeon from guadeloupe tafari was named dejazmach literally commander of the gate roughly equivalent to count at the age of  on  november  shortly thereafter his father ras makonnen died at kulibi in  governorshipedit dejazmatch tafari as governor of harar tafari assumed the titular governorship of selale in  a realm of marginal importance but one that enabled him to continue his studies in  he was appointed governor over part of the province of sidamo it is alleged that during his late teens haile selassie was married to woizero altayech and that from this union his daughter princess romanework was born following the death of his brother yelma in  the governorate of harar was left vacant and its administration was left to meneliks loyal general dejazmach balcha safo balcha safos administration of harar was ineffective and so during the last illness of menelik ii and the brief reign of empress taitu bitul tafari was made governor of harar in  or  on  august he married menen asfaw of ambassel niece of heir to the throne lij iyasu regencyedit the extent to which tafari makonnen contributed to the movement that would come to depose iyasu v has been discussed extensively particularly in haile selassies own detailed account of the matter iyasu v or lij iyasu was the designated but uncrowned emperor of ethiopia from  to  iyasus reputation for scandalous behavior and a disrespectful attitude towards the nobles at the court of his grandfather menelik ii damaged his reputation iyasus flirtation with islam was considered treasonous among the ethiopian orthodox christian leadership of the empire on  september  iyasu was deposed contributing to the movement that deposed iyasu were conservatives such as fitawrari habte giyorgis menelik iis longtime minister of war the movement to depose iyasu preferred tafari as he attracted support from both progressive and conservative factions ultimately iyasu was deposed on the grounds of conversion to islam in his place the daughter of menelik ii the aunt of iyasu was named empress zewditu while tafari was elevated to the rank of ras and was made heir apparent and crown prince in the power arrangement that followed tafari accepted the role of regent plenipotentiary balemulu inderasenb  and became the de facto ruler of the ethiopian empire mangista ityoppya zewditu would govern while tafari would administer empress zewditu with one of her trusted priests while iyasu had been deposed on  september  on  october he managed to escape into the ogaden desert and his father negus mikael of wollo had time to come to his aid on  october negus mikael and his army met an army under fitawrari habte giyorgis loyal to zewditu and tafari during the battle of segale negus mikael was defeated and captured any chance that iyasu would regain the throne was ended and he went into hiding on  january  after avoiding capture for about five years iyasu was taken into custody by gugsa araya selassie on  february  the coronation for zewditu took place she pledged to rule justly through her regent tafari while tafari was the more visible of the two zewditu was far from an honorary ruler her position required that she arbitrate the claims of competing factions in other words she had the last word tafari carried the burden of daily administration but because his position was relatively weak this was often an exercise in futility for him initially his personal army was poorly equipped his finances were limited and he had little leverage to withstand the combined influence of the empress the minister of war or the provincial governors during his regency the new crown prince developed the policy of cautious modernization initiated by menelik ii also during this time he survived the  flu pandemic having come down with the illness he secured ethiopias admission to the league of nations in  by promising to eradicate slavery each emperor since tewodros ii had issued proclamations to halt slavery but without effect the internationally scorned practice persisted well into haile selassies reign with an estimated  million slaves in ethiopia in the early s travel abroadedit in  ras tafari toured europe and the middle east visiting jerusalem alexandria paris brussels amsterdam stockholm london geneva and athens with him on his tour was a group that included ras seyum mangasha of western tigray province ras hailu tekle haymanot of gojjam province ras mulugeta yeggazu of illubabor province ras makonnen endelkachew and blattengeta heruy welde sellase the primary goal of the trip to europe was for ethiopia to gain access to the sea in paris tafari was to find out from the french foreign ministry quai dorsay that this goal would not be realized however failing this he and his retinue inspected schools hospitals factories and churches although patterning many reforms after european models tafari remained wary of european pressure to guard against economic imperialism tafari required that all enterprises have at least partial local ownership of his modernization campaign he remarked we need european progress only because we are surrounded by it that is at once a benefit and a misfortune throughout ras tafaris travels in europe the levant and egypt he and his entourage were greeted with enthusiasm and fascination he was accompanied by seyum mangasha and hailu tekle haymanot who like tafari were sons of generals who contributed to the victorious war against italy a quarter century earlier at the battle of adwa another member of his entourage mulugeta yeggazu actually fought at adwa as a young man the oriental dignity of the ethiopians and their rich picturesque court dress were sensationalized in the media among his entourage he even included a pride of lions which he distributed as gifts to president alexandre millerand and prime minister raymond poincaré of france to king george v of the united kingdom and to the zoological garden jardin zoologique of paris as one historian noted rarely can a tour have inspired so many anecdotes in return for two lions the united kingdom presented ras tafari with the imperial crown of emperor tewodros ii for its safe return to empress zewditu the crown had been taken by robert napier during the  expedition to abyssinia in this period the crown prince visited the armenian monastery of jerusalem there he adopted  armenian orphans አርባ ልጆች arba lijoch forty children who had lost their parents in ottoman massacres ras tafari arranged for the musical education of the youths and they came to form the imperial brass band king and emperoredit see also modernisation of ethiopia under haile selassie i in  the authority of ras tafari makonnen was challenged when dejazmatch balcha safo went to addis ababa with a sizeable armed force when tafari consolidated his hold over the provinces many of meneliks appointees refused to abide by the new regulations balcha safo the governor shum of coffeerich sidamo province was particularly troublesome the revenues he remitted to the central government did not reflect the accrued profits and tafari recalled him to addis ababa the old man came in high dudgeon and insultingly with a large armynb  the dejazmatch paid homage to empress zewditu but snubbed ras tafari on  february while balcha safo and his personal bodyguardnb  were in addis ababa ras tafari had ras kassa haile darge buy off his army and arranged to have him displaced as the shum of sidamo province by birru wolde gabriel who himself was replaced by desta damtew cover of time magazine  november  even so the gesture of balcha safo empowered empress zewditu politically and she attempted to have tafari tried for treason he was tried for his benevolent dealings with italy including a year peace accord which was signed on  august in september a group of palace reactionaries including some courtiers of the empress made a final bid to get rid of tafari the attempted coup détat was tragic in its origins and comic in its end when confronted by tafari and a company of his troops the ringleaders of the coup took refuge on the palace grounds in meneliks mausoleum tafari and his men surrounded them only to be surrounded themselves by the personal guard of zewditu more of tafaris khaki clad soldiers arrived and with superiority of arms decided the outcome in his favor popular support as well as the support of the police remained with tafari ultimately the empress relented and on  october  she crowned tafari as negus amharic king the crowning of tafari as king was controversial he occupied the same territory as the empress rather than going off to a regional kingdom of the empire two monarchs even with one being the vassal and the other the emperor in this case empress had never occupied the same location as their seat in ethiopian history conservatives agitated to redress this perceived insult to the dignity of the crown leading to the rebellion of ras gugsa welle gugsa welle was the husband of the empress and the shum of begemder province in early  he raised an army and marched it from his governorate at gondar towards addis ababa on  march  gugsa welle was met by forces loyal to negus tafari and was defeated at the battle of anchem gugsa welle was killed in action news of gugsa welles defeat and death had hardly spread through addis ababa when the empress died suddenly on  april  although it was long rumored that the empress was poisoned upon the defeat of her husband or alternately that she died from shock upon hearing of the death of her estranged yet beloved husband it has since been documented that the empress succumbed to a flulike fever and complications from diabetes with the passing of zewditu tafari himself rose to emperor and was proclaimed neguse negest zeityoppya king of kings of ethiopia he was crowned on  november  at addis ababas cathedral of st george the coronation was by all accounts a most splendid affair and it was attended by royals and dignitaries from all over the world among those in attendance were george vs son the duke of gloucester marshal franchet desperey of france and the prince of udine representing the king of italy emissaries from the united states egypt turkey sweden belgium and japan were also present british author evelyn waugh was also present penning a contemporary report on the event and american travel lecturer burton holmes shot the only known film footage of the event one newspaper report suggested that the celebration may have incurred a cost in excess of  many of those in attendance received lavish gifts in one instance the christian emperor even sent a goldencased bible to an american bishop who had not attended the coronation but who had dedicated a prayer to the emperor on the day of the coronation haile selassie introduced ethiopias first written constitution on  july  providing for a bicameral legislature the constitution kept power in the hands of the nobility but it did establish democratic standards among the nobility envisaging a transition to democratic rule it would prevail until the people are in a position to elect themselves the constitution limited the succession to the throne to the descendants of haile selassie a point that met with the disapprobation of other dynastic princes including the princes of tigrai and even the emperors loyal cousin ras kassa haile darge in  the sultanate of jimma was formally absorbed into ethiopia following the death of sultan abba jifar ii of jimma conflict with italyedit see also abyssinia crisis and second italoabyssinian war ethiopia became the target of renewed italian imperialist designs in the s benito mussolinis fascist regime was keen to avenge the military defeats italy had suffered to ethiopia in the first italoabyssinian war and to efface the failed attempt by liberal italy to conquer the country as epitomised by the defeat at adwa a conquest of ethiopia could also empower the cause of fascism and embolden its rhetoric of empire ethiopia would also provide a bridge between italys eritrean and italian somaliland possessions ethiopias position in the league of nations did not dissuade the italians from invading in  the collective security envisaged by the league proved useless and a scandal erupted when the hoarelaval pact revealed that ethiopias league allies were scheming to appease italy mobilizationedit following the  december  italian invasion of ethiopia at walwal ogeden province haile selassie joined his northern armies and set up headquarters at desse in wollo province he issued his mobilization order on  october  if you withhold from your country ethiopia the death from cough or headcold of which you would otherwise die refusing to resist in your district in your patrimony and in your home our enemy who is coming from a distant country to attack us and if you persist in not shedding your blood you will be rebuked for it by your creator and will be cursed by your offspring hence without cooling your heart of accustomed valour there emerges your decision to fight fiercely mindful of your history that will last far into the future… if on your march you touch any property inside houses or cattle and crops outside not even grass straw and dung excluded it is like killing your brother who is dying with you… you countryman living at the various access routes set up a market for the army at the places where it is camping and on the day your districtgovernor will indicate to you lest the soldiers campaigning for ethiopias liberty should experience difficulty you will not be charged excise duty until the end of the campaign for anything you are marketing at the military camps i have granted you remission… after you have been ordered to go to war but are then idly missing from the campaign and when you are seized by the local chief or by an accuser you will have punishment inflicted upon your inherited land your property and your body to the accuser i shall grant a third of your property… on  october  haile selassie gave more precise orders for his army to his commanderinchief ras kassa when you set up tents it is to be in caves and by trees and in a wood if the place happens to be adjoining to these―and separated in the various platoons tents are to be set up at a distance of  cubits from each other when an aeroplane is sighted one should leave large open roads and wide meadows and march in valleys and trenches and by zigzag routes along places which have trees and woods when an aeroplane comes to drop bombs it will not suit it to do so unless it comes down to about  metres hence when it flies low for such action one should fire a volley with a good and very long gun and then quickly disperse when three or four bullets have hit it the aeroplane is bound to fall down but let only those fire who have been ordered to shoot with a weapon that has been selected for such firing for if everyone shoots who possesses a gun there is no advantage in this except to waste bullets and to disclose the mens whereabouts lest the aeroplane when rising again should detect the whereabouts of those who are dispersed it is well to remain cautiously scattered as long as it is still fairly close in time of war it suits the enemy to aim his guns at adorned shields ornaments silver and gold cloaks silk shirts and all similar things whether one possesses a jacket or not it is best to wear a narrowsleeved shirt with faded colours when we return with gods help you can wear your gold and silver decorations then now it is time to go and fight we offer you all these words of advice in the hope that no great harm should befall you through lack of caution at the same time we are glad to assure you that in time of war we are ready to shed our blood in your midst for the sake of ethiopias freedom… compared to the ethiopians the italians had an advanced modern military which included a large air force the italians would also come to employ chemical weapons extensively throughout the conflict even targeting red cross field hospitals in violation of the geneva conventions progress of the waredit starting in early october  the italians invaded ethiopia but by november the pace of invasion had slowed appreciably and haile selassies northern armies were able to launch what was known as the christmas offensive during this offensive the italians were forced back in places and put on the defensive in early  the first battle of tembien stopped the progress of the ethiopian offensive and the italians were ready to continue their offensive following the defeat and destruction of the northern ethiopian armies at the battle of amba aradam the second battle of tembien and the battle of shire haile selassie took the field with the last ethiopian army on the northern front on  march  he launched a counterattack against the italians himself at the battle of maychew in southern tigray the emperors army was defeated and retreated in disarray as haile selassies army withdrew the italians attacked from the air along with rebellious raya and azebo tribesmen on the ground who were armed and paid by the italians when the struggle to resist italy appeared doomed haile selassie traveled to the rockhewn churches of lalibela for fasting and prayer haile selassie made a solitary pilgrimage to the churches at lalibela at considerable risk of capture before returning to his capital after a stormy session of the council of state it was agreed that because addis ababa could not be defended the government would relocate to the southern town of gore and that in the interest of preserving the imperial house the emperors wife menen asfaw and the rest of the imperial family should immediately depart for french somaliland and from there continue on to jerusalem exile debateedit the emperor arrives in jerusalem may  after further debate as to whether haile selassie should go to gore or accompany his family into exile it was agreed that he should leave ethiopia with his family and present the case of ethiopia to the league of nations at geneva the decision was not unanimous and several participants including the nobleman blatta tekle wolde hawariat strenuously objected to the idea of an ethiopian monarch fleeing before an invading force haile selassie appointed his cousin ras imru haile selassie as prince regent in his absence departing with his family for french somaliland on  may  on  may marshal pietro badoglio led italian troops into addis ababa and mussolini declared ethiopia an italian province victor emanuel iii was proclaimed as the new emperor of ethiopia on the previous day the ethiopian exiles had left french somaliland aboard the british cruiser hms enterprise they were bound for jerusalem in the british mandate of palestine where the ethiopian royal family maintained a residence the imperial family disembarked at haifa and then went on to jerusalem once there haile selassie and his retinue prepared to make their case at geneva the choice of jerusalem was highly symbolic since the solomonic dynasty claimed descent from the house of david leaving the holy land haile selassie and his entourage sailed aboard the british cruiser hms capetown for gibraltar where he stayed at the rock hotel from gibraltar the exiles were transferred to an ordinary liner by doing this the government of the united kingdom was spared the expense of a state reception collective security and the league of nations edit mussolini upon invading ethiopia had promptly declared his own italian empire because the league of nations afforded haile selassie the opportunity to address the assembly italy even withdrew its league delegation on  may  it was in this context that haile selassie walked into the hall of the league of nations introduced by the president of the assembly as his imperial majesty the emperor of ethiopia sa majesté imperiale lempereur dethiopie the introduction caused a great many italian journalists in the galleries to erupt into jeering heckling and whistling as it turned out they had earlier been issued whistles by mussolinis soninlaw count galeazzo ciano the romanian delegate nicolae titulescu famously jumped to his feet in response and cried show the savages the door and they were cleared out haile selassie waited calmly for the hall to be cleared and responded majestically with a speech sometimes consideredby whom among the most stirring of the th century although fluent in french the working language of the league haile selassie chose to deliver his historic speech in his native amharic he asserted that because his confidence in the league was absolute his people were now being slaughtered he pointed out that the same european states that found in ethiopias favor at the league of nations were refusing ethiopia credit and matériel while aiding italy which was employing chemical weapons on military and civilian targets alike it was at the time when the operations for the encircling of makale were taking place that the italian command fearing a rout followed the procedure which it is now my duty to denounce to the world special sprayers were installed on board aircraft so that they could vaporize over vast areas of territory a fine deathdealing rain groups of nine fifteen eighteen aircraft followed one another so that the fog issuing from them formed a continuous sheet it was thus that as from the end of january  soldiers women children cattle rivers lakes and pastures were drenched continually with this deadly rain in order to kill off systematically all living creatures in order to more surely poison waters and pastures the italian command made its aircraft pass over and over again that was its chief method of warfare noting that his own small people of  million inhabitants without arms without resources could never withstand an attack by a large power such as italy with its  million people and unlimited quantities of the most deathdealing weapons he contended that all small states were threatened by the aggression and that all small states were in effect reduced to vassal states in the absence of collective action he admonished the league that god and history will remember your judgment it is collective security it is the very existence of the league of nations it is the confidence that each state is to place in international treaties… in a word it is international morality that is at stake have the signatures appended to a treaty value only in so far as the signatory powers have a personal direct and immediate interest involved the speech made the emperor an icon for antifascists around the world and time named him man of the year he failed however to get what he most needed the league agreed to only partial and ineffective sanctions on italy only six nations in  did not recognize italys occupation they were china new zealand the soviet union the republic of spain mexico and the united states exileedit haile selassie in  haile selassie spent his exile years – in bath england in fairfield house which he bought the emperor and kassa haile darge took morning walks together behind the high walls of the room georgian house haile selassies favorite reading was diplomatic history but most of his serious hours were occupied with the word story of his life that he was laboriously writing in amharic prior to fairfield house he briefly stayed at warnes hotel in worthing and in parkside wimbledon a bust of haile selassie is in nearby cannizaro park to commemorate this time and is a popular place of pilgrimage for londons rastafari community haile selassie stayed at the abbey hotel in malvern in the s

activity in this period was focused on countering italian propaganda as to the state of ethiopian resistance and the legality of the occupation he spoke out against the desecration of houses of worship and historical artifacts including the theft of a yearold imperial obelisk and condemned the atrocities suffered by the ethiopian civilian population he continued to plead for league intervention and to voice his certainty that gods judgment will eventually visit the weak and the mighty alike though his attempts to gain support for the struggle against italy were largely unsuccessful until italy entered world war ii on the german side in june  the emperors pleas for international support did take root in the united states particularly among africanamerican organizations sympathetic to the ethiopian cause in  haile selassie was to give a christmas day radio address to the american people to thank his supporters when his taxi was involved in a traffic accident leaving him with a fractured knee rather than canceling the radio appearance he proceeded in much pain to complete the address in which he linked christianity and goodwill with the covenant of the league of nations and asserted that war is not the only means to stop war with the birth of the son of god an unprecedented an unrepeatable and a longanticipated phenomenon occurred he was born in a stable instead of a palace in a manger instead of a crib the hearts of the wise men were struck by fear and wonder due to his majestic humbleness the kings prostrated themselves before him and worshipped him peace be to those who have good will this became the first message although the toils of wise people may earn them respect it is a fact of life that the spirit of the wicked continues to cast its shadow on this world the arrogant are seen visibly leading their people into crime and destruction the laws of the league of nations are constantly violated and wars and acts of aggression repeatedly take place… so that the spirit of the cursed will not gain predominance over the human race whom christ redeemed with his blood all peaceloving people should cooperate to stand firm in

but in the spirit of christ do not return evil for evil do not indulge in the atrocities which the enemy has been practicing in his usual way even to the last take care not to spoil the good name of

defense and foreign policy despite his centralization policies that had been made before world war ii haile selassie still found himself unable to push for all the programs he wanted in  he attempted to institute a progressive tax scheme but this failed due to opposition from the nobility and only a flat tax was passed in  he agreed to reduce this as well ethiopia was still semifeudal and the emperors attempts to alter its social and economic form by reforming its modes of taxation met with resistance from the nobility and clergy which were eager to resume their privileges in the postwar era where haile selassie actually did succeed in effecting new land taxes the burdens were often passed by the landowners to the peasants despite his wishes the tax burden remained primarily on the peasants between  and  haile selassie worked to establish the autocephaly of the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church the ethiopian orthodox church had been headed by the abuna a bishop who answered to the pope of the coptic orthodox church of alexandria in  and  haile selassie applied to the holy synod of the coptic orthodox church to establish the independence of ethiopian bishops and when his appeals were denied he threatened to sever relations with the coptic church of alexandria finally in  pope kyrillos vi elevated the abuna to patriarchcatholicos the ethiopian church remained affiliated with the alexandrian church in addition to these efforts haile selassie changed the ethiopian churchstate relationship by introducing taxation of church lands and by restricting the legal privileges of the clergy who had formerly been tried in their own courts for civil offenses in keeping with the principle of collective security for which he was an outspoken proponent he sent a contingent under general mulugueta bulli known as the kagnew battalion to take part in the korean war by supporting the united nations command it was attached to the american th infantry division and fought in a number of engagements including the battle of pork chop hill in a  speech the emperor spoke of ethiopian participation in the korean war as a redemption of the principles of collective security nearly two decades ago i personally assumed before history the responsibility of placing the fate of my beloved people on the issue of collective security for surely at that time and for the first time in world history that issue was posed in all its clarity my searching of conscience convinced me of the rightness of my course and if after untold sufferings and indeed unaided resistance at the time of aggression we now see the final vindication of that principle in our joint action in korea i can only be thankful that god gave me strength to persist in our faith until the moment of its recent glorious vindication haile selassie emperor of ethiopia photographed during a radio broadcast during the celebrations of his silver jubilee in november  haile selassie introduced a revised constitution whereby he retained effective power while extending political participation to the people by allowing the lower house of parliament to become an elected body party politics were not provided for modern educational methods were more widely spread throughout the empire and the country embarked on a development scheme and plans for modernization tempered by ethiopian traditions and within the framework of the ancient monarchical structure of the state haile selassie compromised when practical with the traditionalists in the nobility and church he also tried to improve relations between the state and ethnic groups and granted autonomy to afar lands that were difficult to control still his reforms to end feudalism were slow and weakened by the compromises he made with the entrenched aristocracy the revised constitution of  has been criticized for reasserting the indisputable power of the monarch and maintaining the relative powerlessness of the peasants charitable gestureedit he sent aid to the british government in  when britain was affected by heavy flooding his letter to lord meork national distress fund london said even though we are busy of helping our people who didnt recover from the crises of the war we heard that your fertile and beautiful country is devastated by the unusually heavy rain and your request for aid therefore we are sending small

per united nations security council resolution  on  december  while haile selassie was on a state visit to brazil his imperial guard forces staged an unsuccessful coup briefly proclaiming haile selassies eldest son asfa wossen as emperor the coup détat was crushed by the regular army and police forces the coup attempt lacked broad popular support was denounced by the ethiopian orthodox church and was unpopular with the army air force and police nonetheless the effort to depose the emperor had support among students and the educated classes the coup attempt has been characterized as a pivotal moment in ethiopian history the point at which ethiopians for the first time questioned the power of the king to rule without the peoples consent student populations began to empathize with the peasantry and poor and to advocate on their behalf the coup spurred haile selassie to accelerate reform which was manifested in the form of land grants to military and police officials the emperor continued to be a staunch ally of the west while pursuing a firm policy of decolonization in africa which was still largely under european colonial rule the united nations conducted a lengthy inquiry regarding the status of eritrea with the superpowers each vying for a stake in the states future britain the administrator at the time suggested the partition of eritrea between sudan and ethiopia separating christians and muslims the idea was instantly rejected by eritrean political parties as well as the un a un plebiscite voted  to  to have eritrea be federated with ethiopia which was later stipulated on  december  in resolution  v eritrea would have its own parliament and administration and would be represented in what had been the ethiopian parliament and would become the federal

even with alterations this law led to a revolt in gojjam which was repressed although enforcement of the tax was abandoned the revolt having achieved its design in undermining the tax encouraged other landowners to defy haile selassie haile selassie on a state visit to washington  while he had fully approved of and assured ethiopias participation in unapproved collective security operations including korea and congo haile selassie drew a distinction with the nonun approved foreign intervention in indochina and consistently deplored it as needless suffering calling for the vietnam war to end on several occasions at the same time he remained open toward the united states and commended it for making progress with african americans civil rights legislation in the s and s while visiting the us several times during these years in  he visited montreal canada to open the ethiopian pavilion at the expo  worlds fair where he received great acclaim amongst other world leaders there for the occasion student unrest became a regular feature of ethiopian life in the s and s marxism took root in large segments of the ethiopian intelligentsia particularly among those who had studied abroad and had thus been exposed to radical and leftwing sentiments that were becoming popular in other parts of the globe resistance by conservative elements at the imperial court and parliament and by the ethiopian orthodox church made haile selassies land reform proposals difficult to implement and also damaged the standing of the government costing haile selassie much of the goodwill he had once enjoyed this bred resentment among the peasant population efforts to weaken unions also hurt his image as these issues began to pile up haile selassie left much of domestic governance to his prime minister aklilu habte wold and concentrated more on foreign affairs sedit haile selassie i in toledo spain in april  picture by eduardo butragueño outside of ethiopia haile selassie continued to enjoy

civil liberties and political rights in the last years of selassies rule common human right abuses included imprisonment and torture of political prisoners and very poor prison conditions the ethiopian army also carried out a number of these atrocities while fighting the eritrean separatists this was due to a policy of destroying eritrean villages that supported the rebels there were a number of mass killings of hundreds of civilians during the war in the late s and early s wollo famineedit famine—mostly in wollo northeastern ethiopia as well as in some parts of tigray—is estimated to have killed  to  ethiopians between  and  a bbc news report has cited a  estimate that  deaths occurred based on a contemporaneous estimate from the ethiopian nutrition institute while this figure is still repeated in some texts and media sources it was an estimate that was later found to be overpessimistic although the region is infamous for recurrent crop failures and continuous food shortage and starvation risk this episode was remarkably severe a  production of the itv programme the unknown famine by jonathan dimbleby relied on the unverified estimate of  dead stimulating a massive influx of aid while at the same time destabilizing haile selassies regime against that background a group of dissident army officers instigated a creeping coup against the emperors faltering regime to guard against a public backlash in favour of haile selassie who was still widely revered they contrived to obtain a copy of the unknown famine which they intercut with images of africas grand old man presiding at a wedding feast in the grounds of his palace retitled the hidden hunger it was shown round the clock on ethiopian television to coincide with the day that they finally summoned the nerve to seize the emperor himself the  oil crisis the severity of which is demonstrated by this graph hit ethiopia amidst a devastating famine compounding its effect and undermining support for the emperor some reports suggest that the emperor was unaware of the extent of the famine while others assert that he was well aware of it in addition to the exposure of attempts by corrupt local officials to cover up the famine from the imperial government the kremlins depiction of haile selassies ethiopia as backwards and inept relative to the purported utopia of marxismleninism contributed to the popular uprising that led to its downfall and the rise of mengistu haile mariam the famine and its image in the media undermined popular support of the government and haile selassies once unassailable personal popularity fell the crisis was exacerbated by military mutinies and high oil prices the latter a result of the  oil crisis the international economic crisis triggered by the oil crisis caused the costs of imported goods gasoline and food to skyrocket while unemployment spiked revolutionedit in february  four days of serious riots in addis ababa against a sudden economic inflation left five dead the emperor responded by announcing on national television a reduction in petrol prices and a freeze on the cost of basic commodities this calmed the public but the promised  military wage hike was not substantial enough to pacify the army which then mutinied beginning in asmara and spreading throughout the empire this mutiny led to the resignation of prime minister aklilu habtewold on

book of revelation in the new testament king of kings lord of lords conquering lion of the tribe of judah and root of david rastafari faith in the incarnate divinity of haile selassie began after news reports of his coronation reached jamaica particularly via the two time magazine articles on the coronation the week before and the week after the event haile selassies own perspectives permeate the philosophy of the movement in  the jamaican government sent a delegation composed of both rastafari and nonrastafari leaders to ethiopia to discuss the matter of repatriation among other issues with the emperor he reportedly told the rastafari delegation which included mortimer planno tell the brethren to be not dismayed i personally will give my assistance in the matter of repatriation haile selassie visited jamaica on  april  and approximately one hundred thousand rastafari from all over jamaica descended on palisadoes airport in kingston having heard that the man whom they considered to be their messiah was coming to visit them spliffs and chalices were openly smoked causing a haze of ganja smoke to drift through the air haile selassie arrived at the airport but was unable to come down the mobile steps of the airplane as the crowd rushed the tarmac he then returned into the plane disappearing for several more minutes finally jamaican authorities were obliged to request ras mortimer planno a wellknown rasta leader to climb the steps enter the plane and negotiate the emperors descent planno reemerged and announced to the crowd the emperor has instructed me to tell you to be calm step back and let the emperor land this day is widely held by scholars to be a major turning point for the movement and it is still commemorated by rastafari as grounation day the anniversary of which is celebrated as the second holiest holiday after  november the emperors coronation day from then on as a result of plannos actions the jamaican authorities were asked to ensure that rastafari representatives were present at all state functions attended by the emperor and rastafari elders also ensured that they obtained a private audience with the emperor where he reportedly told them that they should not emigrate to ethiopia until they had first liberated the people of jamaica this dictum came to be known as liberation before repatriation haile selassie defied expectations of the jamaican authorities and never rebuked the rastafari for their belief in him as the returned jesus instead he presented the movements faithful elders with gold medallions – the only recipients of such an honor on this visit during pnp leader later jamaican prime minister michael manleys visit to ethiopia in october  the emperor allegedly still recalled his  reception with amazement and stated that he felt that he had to be respectful of their beliefs this was the visit when manley received the rod of correction or rod of joshua as a present from the emperor which is thought to have helped him to win the  election in jamaica rita marley bob marleys wife converted to the rastafari faith after seeing haile selassie on his jamaican trip she claimed in interviews and in her book no woman no cry that she saw a stigmata print on the palm of haile selassies hand as he waved to the crowd which resembled the markings on christs hands from being nailed to the cross—a claim that was not supported by other sources but was used as evidence for her and other rastafari to suggest that haile selassie i was indeed their messiah she was also influential in the conversion of bob marley who then became internationally recognized as a result rastafari became much better known throughout much of the world bob marleys posthumously released song iron lion zion refers to haile selassie

story of jamaican music kevin chang and wayne chen note its often said though no definite date is ever cited that haile selassie himself denied his divinity former senator and gleaner editor hector

and his political thought and experience in promoting multilateralism and collective security have proved seminal and enduring his suppression of rebellions among the landed aristocracy the mesafint which consistently opposed his reforms as well as what some critics perceived to be ethiopias failure to modernize rapidly enough earned him criticism among some contemporaries and historians his

selassie means trinity—therefore haile selassie roughly translates to power of the trinity haile selassies full title in office was by the conquering lion of the tribe of judah his imperial majesty haile selassie i king of kings of ethiopia elect of godnb  this title reflects ethiopian dynastic traditions which hold that all monarchs must trace their lineage to menelik i who was the offspring of king solomon and the queen of sheba to ethiopians haile selassie has been known by many names including janhoy talaqu meri and abba tekel the rastafari movement employs many of these appellations also referring to him as jah jah jah jah rastafari and him the abbreviation of his imperial majesty biographyedit early lifeedit ras makonnen woldemikael and his son lij tafari makonnen haile selassies royal line through his fathers mother originated from the amhara people he was born on  july  in the village of ejersa goro in the harar province of ethiopia his mother was woizero lady yeshimebet ali abba jifar daughter of the renowned oromo ruler of wollo province dejazmach ali abba jifar his maternal grandmother was of gurage heritage tafaris father was ras makonnen woldemikael gudessa the governor of harar ras makonnen served as a general in the first italo–ethiopian war playing a key role at the battle of adwa he too was paternally oromo but maternally amhara haile selassie was thus able to ascend to the imperial throne through his paternal grandmother woizero tenagnework sahle selassie who was an aunt of emperor menelik ii and daughter of negus sahle selassie of shewa as such haile selassie claimed direct descent from makeda the queen of sheba and king solomon of ancient israel ras makonnen arranged for tafari as well as his first cousin imru haile selassie to receive instruction in harar from abba samuel wolde kahin an ethiopian capuchin monk and from dr vitalien a surgeon from guadeloupe tafari was named dejazmach literally commander of the gate roughly equivalent to count at the age of  on  november  shortly thereafter his father ras makonnen died at kulibi in  governorshipedit dejazmatch tafari as governor of harar tafari assumed the titular governorship of selale in  a realm of marginal importance but one that enabled him to continue his studies in  he was appointed governor over part of the province of sidamo it is alleged that during his late teens haile selassie was married to woizero altayech and that from this union his daughter princess romanework was born following the death of his brother yelma in  the governorate of harar was left vacant and its administration was left to meneliks loyal general dejazmach balcha safo balcha safos administration of harar was ineffective and so during the last illness of menelik ii and the brief reign of empress taitu bitul tafari was made governor of harar in  or  on  august he married menen asfaw of ambassel niece of heir to the throne lij iyasu regencyedit the extent to which tafari makonnen contributed to the movement that would come to depose iyasu v has been discussed extensively particularly in haile selassies own detailed account of the matter iyasu v or lij iyasu was the designated but uncrowned emperor of ethiopia from  to  iyasus reputation for scandalous behavior and a disrespectful attitude towards the nobles at the court of his grandfather menelik ii damaged his reputation iyasus flirtation with islam was considered treasonous among the ethiopian orthodox christian leadership of the empire on  september  iyasu was deposed contributing to the movement that deposed iyasu were conservatives such as fitawrari habte giyorgis menelik iis longtime minister of war the movement to depose iyasu preferred tafari as he attracted support from both progressive and conservative factions ultimately iyasu was deposed on the grounds of conversion to islam in his place the daughter of menelik ii the aunt of iyasu was named empress zewditu while tafari was elevated to the rank of ras and was made heir apparent and crown prince in the power arrangement that followed tafari accepted the role of regent plenipotentiary balemulu inderasenb  and became the de facto ruler of the ethiopian empire mangista ityoppya zewditu would govern while tafari would administer empress zewditu with one of her trusted priests while iyasu had been deposed on  september  on  october he managed to escape into the ogaden desert and his father negus mikael of wollo had time to come to his aid on  october negus mikael and his army met an army under fitawrari habte giyorgis loyal to zewditu and tafari during the battle of segale negus mikael was defeated and captured any chance that iyasu would regain the throne was ended and he went into hiding on  january  after avoiding capture for about five years iyasu was taken into custody by gugsa araya selassie on  february  the coronation for zewditu took place she pledged to rule justly through her regent tafari while tafari was the more visible of the two zewditu was far from an honorary ruler her position required that she arbitrate the claims of competing factions in other words she had the last word tafari carried the burden of daily administration but because his position was relatively weak this was often an exercise in futility for him initially his personal army was poorly equipped his finances were limited and he had little leverage to withstand the combined influence of the empress the minister of war or the provincial governors during his regency the new crown prince developed the policy of cautious modernization initiated by menelik ii also during this time he survived the  flu pandemic having come down with the illness he secured ethiopias admission to the league of nations in  by promising to eradicate slavery each emperor since tewodros ii had issued proclamations to halt slavery but without effect the internationally scorned practice persisted well into haile selassies reign with an estimated  million slaves in ethiopia in the early s travel abroadedit in  ras tafari toured europe and the middle east visiting jerusalem alexandria paris brussels amsterdam stockholm london geneva and athens with him on his tour was a group that included ras seyum mangasha of western tigray province ras hailu tekle haymanot of gojjam province ras mulugeta yeggazu of illubabor province ras makonnen endelkachew and blattengeta heruy welde sellase the primary goal of the trip to europe was for ethiopia to gain access to the sea in paris tafari was to find out from the french foreign ministry quai dorsay that this goal would not be realized however failing this he and his retinue inspected schools hospitals factories and churches although patterning many reforms after european models tafari remained wary of european pressure to guard against economic imperialism tafari required that all enterprises have at least partial local ownership of his modernization campaign he remarked we need european progress only because we are surrounded by it that is at once a benefit and a misfortune throughout ras tafaris travels in europe the levant and egypt he and his entourage were greeted with enthusiasm and fascination he was accompanied by seyum mangasha and hailu tekle haymanot who like tafari were sons of generals who contributed to the victorious war against italy a quarter century earlier at the battle of adwa another member of his entourage mulugeta yeggazu actually fought at adwa as a young man the oriental dignity of the ethiopians and their rich picturesque court dress were sensationalized in the media among his entourage he even included a pride of lions which he distributed as gifts to president alexandre millerand and prime minister raymond poincaré of france to king george v of the united kingdom and to the zoological garden jardin zoologique of paris as one historian noted rarely can a tour have inspired so many anecdotes in return for two lions the united kingdom presented ras tafari with the imperial crown of emperor tewodros ii for its safe return to empress zewditu the crown had been taken by robert napier during the  expedition to abyssinia in this period the crown prince visited the armenian monastery of jerusalem there he adopted  armenian orphans አርባ ልጆች arba lijoch forty children who had lost their parents in ottoman massacres ras tafari arranged for the musical education of the youths and they came to form the imperial brass band king and emperoredit see also modernisation of ethiopia under haile selassie i in  the authority of ras tafari makonnen was challenged when dejazmatch balcha safo went to addis ababa with a sizeable armed force when tafari consolidated his hold over the provinces many of meneliks appointees refused to abide by the new regulations balcha safo the governor shum of coffeerich sidamo province was particularly troublesome the revenues he remitted to the central government did not reflect the accrued profits and tafari recalled him to addis ababa the old man came in high dudgeon and insultingly with a large armynb  the dejazmatch paid homage to empress zewditu but snubbed ras tafari on  february while balcha safo and his personal bodyguardnb  were in addis ababa ras tafari had ras kassa haile darge buy off his army and arranged to have him displaced as the shum of sidamo province by birru wolde gabriel who himself was replaced by desta damtew cover of time magazine  november  even so the gesture of balcha safo empowered empress zewditu politically and she attempted to have tafari tried for treason he was tried for his benevolent dealings with italy including a year peace accord which was signed on  august in september a group of palace reactionaries including some courtiers of the empress made a final bid to get rid of tafari the attempted coup détat was tragic in its origins and comic in its end when confronted by tafari and a company of his troops the ringleaders of the coup took refuge on the palace grounds in meneliks mausoleum tafari and his men surrounded them only to be surrounded themselves by the personal guard of zewditu more of tafaris khaki clad soldiers arrived and with superiority of arms decided the outcome in his favor popular support as well as the support of the police remained with tafari ultimately the empress relented and on  october  she crowned tafari as negus amharic king the crowning of tafari as king was controversial he occupied the same territory as the empress rather than going off to a regional kingdom of the empire two monarchs even with one being the vassal and the other the emperor in this case empress had never occupied the same location as their seat in ethiopian history conservatives agitated to redress this perceived insult to the dignity of the crown leading to the rebellion of ras gugsa welle gugsa welle was the husband of the empress and the shum of begemder province in early  he raised an army and marched it from his governorate at gondar towards addis ababa on  march  gugsa welle was met by forces loyal to negus tafari and was defeated at the battle of anchem gugsa welle was killed in action news of gugsa welles defeat and death had hardly spread through addis ababa when the empress died suddenly on  april  although it was long rumored that the empress was poisoned upon the defeat of her husband or alternately that she died from shock upon hearing of the death of her estranged yet beloved husband it has since been documented that the empress succumbed to a flulike fever and complications from diabetes with the passing of zewditu tafari himself rose to emperor and was proclaimed neguse negest zeityoppya king of kings of ethiopia he was crowned on  november  at addis ababas cathedral of st george the coronation was by all accounts a most splendid affair and it was attended by royals and dignitaries from all over the world among those in attendance were george vs son the duke of gloucester marshal franchet desperey of france and the prince of udine representing the king of italy emissaries from the united states egypt turkey sweden belgium and japan were also present british author evelyn waugh was also present penning a contemporary report on the event and american travel lecturer burton holmes shot the only known film footage of the event one newspaper report suggested that the celebration may have incurred a cost in excess of  many of those in attendance received lavish gifts in one instance the christian emperor even sent a goldencased bible to an american bishop who had not attended the coronation but who had dedicated a prayer to the emperor on the day of the coronation haile selassie introduced ethiopias first written constitution on  july  providing for a bicameral legislature the constitution kept power in the hands of the nobility but it did establish democratic standards among the nobility envisaging a transition to democratic rule it would prevail until the people are in a position to elect themselves the constitution limited the succession to the throne to the descendants of haile selassie a point that met with the disapprobation of other dynastic princes including the princes of tigrai and even the emperors loyal cousin ras kassa haile darge in  the sultanate of jimma was formally absorbed into ethiopia following the death of sultan abba jifar ii of jimma conflict with italyedit see also abyssinia crisis and second italoabyssinian war ethiopia became the target of renewed italian imperialist designs in the s benito mussolinis fascist regime was keen to avenge the military defeats italy had suffered to ethiopia in the first italoabyssinian war and to efface the failed attempt by liberal italy to conquer the country as epitomised by the defeat at adwa a conquest of ethiopia could also empower the cause of fascism and embolden its rhetoric of empire ethiopia would also provide a bridge between italys eritrean and italian somaliland possessions ethiopias position in the league of nations did not dissuade the italians from invading in  the collective security envisaged by the league proved useless and a scandal erupted when the hoarelaval pact revealed that ethiopias league allies were scheming to appease italy mobilizationedit following the  december  italian invasion of ethiopia at walwal ogeden province haile selassie joined his northern armies and set up headquarters at desse in wollo province he issued his mobilization order on  october  if you withhold from your country ethiopia the death from cough or headcold of which you would otherwise die refusing to resist in your district in your patrimony and in your home our enemy who is coming from a distant country to attack us and if you persist in not shedding your blood you will be rebuked for it by your creator and will be cursed by your offspring hence without cooling your heart of accustomed valour there emerges your decision to fight fiercely mindful of your history that will last far into the future… if on your march you touch any property inside houses or cattle and crops outside not even grass straw and dung excluded it is like killing your brother who is dying with you… you countryman living at the various access routes set up a market for the army at the places where it is camping and on the day your districtgovernor will indicate to you lest the soldiers campaigning for ethiopias liberty should experience difficulty you will not be charged excise duty until the end of the campaign for anything you are marketing at the military camps i have granted you remission… after you have been ordered to go to war but are then idly missing from the campaign and when you are seized by the local chief or by an accuser you will have punishment inflicted upon your inherited land your property and your body to the accuser i shall grant a third of your property… on  october  haile selassie gave more precise orders for his army to his commanderinchief ras kassa when you set up tents it is to be in caves and by trees and in a wood if the place happens to be adjoining to these―and separated in the various platoons tents are to be set up at a distance of  cubits from each other when an aeroplane is sighted one should leave large open roads and wide meadows and march in valleys and trenches and by zigzag routes along places which have trees and woods when an aeroplane comes to drop bombs it will not suit it to do so unless it comes down to about  metres hence when it flies low for such action one should fire a volley with a good and very long gun and then quickly disperse when three or four bullets have hit it the aeroplane is bound to fall down but let only those fire who have been ordered to shoot with a weapon that has been selected for such firing for if everyone shoots who possesses a gun there is no advantage in this except to waste bullets and to disclose the mens whereabouts lest the aeroplane when rising again should detect the whereabouts of those who are dispersed it is well to remain cautiously scattered as long as it is still fairly close in time of war it suits the enemy to aim his guns at adorned shields ornaments silver and gold cloaks silk shirts and all similar things whether one possesses a jacket or not it is best to wear a narrowsleeved shirt with faded colours when we return with gods help you can wear your gold and silver decorations then now it is time to go and fight we offer you all these words of advice in the hope that no great harm should befall you through lack of caution at the same time we are glad to assure you that in time of war we are ready to shed our blood in your midst for the sake of ethiopias freedom… compared to the ethiopians the italians had an advanced modern military which included a large air force the italians would also come to employ chemical weapons extensively throughout the conflict even targeting red cross field hospitals in violation of the geneva conventions progress of the waredit starting in early october  the italians invaded ethiopia but by november the pace of invasion had slowed appreciably and haile selassies northern armies were able to launch what was known as the christmas offensive during this offensive the italians were forced back in places and put on the defensive in early  the first battle of tembien stopped the progress of the ethiopian offensive and the italians were ready to continue their offensive following the defeat and destruction of the northern ethiopian armies at the battle of amba aradam the second battle of tembien and the battle of shire haile selassie took the field with the last ethiopian army on the northern front on  march  he launched a counterattack against the italians himself at the battle of maychew in southern tigray the emperors army was defeated and retreated in disarray as haile selassies army withdrew the italians attacked from the air along with rebellious raya and azebo tribesmen on the ground who were armed and paid by the italians when the struggle to resist italy appeared doomed haile selassie traveled to the rockhewn churches of lalibela for fasting and prayer haile selassie made a solitary pilgrimage to the churches at lalibela at considerable risk of capture before returning to his capital after a stormy session of the council of state it was agreed that because addis ababa could not be defended the government would relocate to the southern town of gore and that in the interest of preserving the imperial house the emperors wife menen asfaw and the rest of the imperial family should immediately depart for french somaliland and from there continue on to jerusalem exile debateedit the emperor arrives in jerusalem may  after further debate as to whether haile selassie should go to gore or accompany his family into exile it was agreed that he should leave ethiopia with his family and present the case of ethiopia to the league of nations at geneva the decision was not unanimous and several participants including the nobleman blatta tekle wolde hawariat strenuously objected to the idea of an ethiopian monarch fleeing before an invading force haile selassie appointed his cousin ras imru haile selassie as prince regent in his absence departing with his family for french somaliland on  may  on  may marshal pietro badoglio led italian troops into addis ababa and mussolini declared ethiopia an italian province victor emanuel iii was proclaimed as the new emperor of ethiopia on the previous day the ethiopian exiles had left french somaliland aboard the british cruiser hms enterprise they were bound for jerusalem in the british mandate of palestine where the ethiopian royal family maintained a residence the imperial family disembarked at haifa and then went on to jerusalem once there haile selassie and his retinue prepared to make their case at geneva the choice of jerusalem was highly symbolic since the solomonic dynasty claimed descent from the house of david leaving the holy land haile selassie and his entourage sailed aboard the british cruiser hms capetown for gibraltar where he stayed at the rock hotel from gibraltar the exiles were transferred to an ordinary liner by doing this the government of the united kingdom was spared the expense of a state reception collective security and the league of nations edit mussolini upon invading ethiopia had promptly declared his own italian empire because the league of nations afforded haile selassie the opportunity to address the assembly italy even withdrew its league delegation on  may  it was in this context that haile selassie walked into the hall of the league of nations introduced by the president of the assembly as his imperial majesty the emperor of ethiopia sa majesté imperiale lempereur dethiopie the introduction caused a great many italian journalists in the galleries to erupt into jeering heckling and whistling as it turned out they had earlier been issued whistles by mussolinis soninlaw count galeazzo ciano the romanian delegate nicolae titulescu famously jumped to his feet in response and cried show the savages the door and they were cleared out haile selassie waited calmly for the hall to be cleared and responded majestically with a speech sometimes consideredby whom among the most stirring of the th century although fluent in french the working language of the league haile selassie chose to deliver his historic speech in his native amharic he asserted that because his confidence in the league was absolute his people were now being slaughtered he pointed out that the same european states that found in ethiopias favor at the league of nations were refusing ethiopia credit and matériel while aiding italy which was employing chemical weapons on military and civilian targets alike it was at the time when the operations for the encircling of makale were taking place that the italian command fearing a rout followed the procedure which it is now my duty to denounce to the world special sprayers were installed on board aircraft so that they could vaporize over vast areas of territory a fine deathdealing rain groups of nine fifteen eighteen aircraft followed one another so that the fog issuing from them formed a continuous sheet it was thus that as from the end of january  soldiers women children cattle rivers lakes and pastures were drenched continually with this deadly rain in order to kill off systematically all living creatures in order to more surely poison waters and pastures the italian command made its aircraft pass over and over again that was its chief method of warfare noting that his own small people of  million inhabitants without arms without resources could never withstand an attack by a large power such as italy with its  million people and unlimited quantities of the most deathdealing weapons he contended that all small states were threatened by the aggression and that all small states were in effect reduced to vassal states in the absence of collective action he admonished the league that god and history will remember your judgment it is collective security it is the very existence of the league of nations it is the confidence that each state is to place in international treaties… in a word it is international morality that is at stake have the signatures appended to a treaty value only in so far as the signatory powers have a personal direct and immediate interest involved the speech made the emperor an icon for antifascists around the world and time named him man of the year he failed however to get what he most needed the league agreed to only partial and ineffective sanctions on italy only six nations in  did not recognize italys occupation they were china new zealand the soviet union the republic of spain mexico and the united states exileedit haile selassie in  haile selassie spent his exile years – in bath england in fairfield house which he bought the emperor and kassa haile darge took morning walks together behind the high walls of the room georgian house haile selassies favorite reading was diplomatic history but most of his serious hours were occupied with the word story of his life that he was laboriously writing in amharic prior to fairfield house he briefly stayed at warnes hotel in worthing and in parkside wimbledon a bust of haile selassie is in nearby cannizaro park to commemorate this time and is a popular place of pilgrimage for londons rastafari community haile selassie stayed at the abbey hotel in malvern in the s and his granddaughters and daughters of court officials were educated at clarendon school in north malvern during his time in malvern he attended services at holy trinity church in link top a blue plaque commemorating his stay in malvern was unveiled on saturday  june  as part of the ceremony a delegation from the rastafari movement gave a short address and a drum recital haile selassies activity in this period was focused on countering italian propaganda as to the state of ethiopian resistance and the legality of the occupation he spoke out against the desecration of houses of worship and historical artifacts including the theft of a yearold imperial obelisk and condemned the atrocities suffered by the ethiopian civilian population he continued to plead for league intervention and to voice his certainty that gods judgment will eventually visit the weak and the mighty alike though his attempts to gain support for the struggle against italy were largely unsuccessful until italy entered world war ii on the german side in june  the emperors pleas for international support did take root in the united states particularly among africanamerican organizations sympathetic to the ethiopian cause in  haile selassie was to give a christmas day radio address to the american people to thank his supporters when his taxi was involved in a traffic accident leaving him with a fractured knee rather than canceling the radio appearance he proceeded in much pain to complete the address in which he linked christianity and goodwill with the covenant of the league of nations and asserted that war is not the only means to stop war with the birth of the son of god an unprecedented an unrepeatable and a longanticipated phenomenon occurred he was born in a stable instead of a palace in a manger instead of a crib the hearts of the wise men were struck by fear and wonder due to his majestic humbleness the kings prostrated themselves before him and worshipped him peace be to those who have good will this became the first message although the toils of wise people may earn them respect it is a fact of life that the spirit of the wicked continues to cast its shadow on this world the arrogant are seen visibly leading their people into crime and destruction the laws of the league of nations are constantly violated and wars and acts of aggression repeatedly take place… so that the spirit of the cursed will not gain predominance over the human

our enemy therefore when we say let us rejoice with our hearts let not our rejoicing be in any other way but in the spirit of christ do not return evil for evil do not indulge in the atrocities which the enemy has been practicing in his usual way even to the last take care not to spoil the good name of ethiopia by acts which are worthy of the enemy we shall see that our enemies are disarmed and

provide for ethnic linguistic and cultural balance while ethiopia was to manage its finances defense and foreign policy despite his centralization policies that had been made before world war ii haile selassie still found himself unable to push for all the programs he wanted in  he attempted to institute a progressive tax scheme but this failed due to opposition from the nobility and only a flat tax was passed in  he agreed to reduce this as well ethiopia was still semifeudal and the emperors attempts to alter its social and economic form by reforming its modes of taxation met with resistance from the nobility and clergy which were eager to resume their privileges in the postwar era where haile selassie actually did succeed in effecting new land taxes the burdens were often passed by the landowners to the peasants despite his wishes the tax burden remained primarily on the peasants between  and  haile selassie worked to establish the autocephaly of the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church the ethiopian orthodox church had been headed by the abuna a bishop who answered to the pope of the coptic orthodox church of alexandria in  and  haile selassie applied to the holy synod of the coptic orthodox church to establish the independence of ethiopian bishops and when his appeals were denied he threatened to sever relations with the coptic church of alexandria finally in  pope kyrillos vi elevated the abuna to patriarchcatholicos the ethiopian church remained affiliated with the alexandrian church in addition to these efforts haile selassie changed the ethiopian churchstate relationship by introducing taxation of church lands and by restricting the legal privileges of the clergy who had formerly been tried in their own courts for civil offenses in keeping with the principle of collective security for which he was an outspoken proponent he sent a contingent under general mulugueta bulli known as the kagnew battalion to take part in the korean war by supporting the united nations command it was attached to the american th infantry division and fought in a number of engagements including the battle of pork chop hill in a  speech the emperor spoke of ethiopian participation in the korean war as a redemption of the principles of collective security nearly two decades ago i personally assumed before history the responsibility of placing the fate of my beloved people on the issue of collective security for surely at that time and for the first time in world history that issue was posed in all its clarity my searching of conscience convinced me of the rightness of my course and if after untold sufferings and indeed unaided resistance at the time of aggression we now see the final vindication of that principle in our joint action in korea i can only be thankful that god gave me strength to persist in our faith until the moment of its recent glorious vindication haile selassie emperor of ethiopia photographed during a radio broadcast during the celebrations of his silver jubilee in november  haile selassie introduced a revised constitution whereby he retained effective power while extending political participation to the people by allowing the lower house of parliament to become an elected body party politics were not provided for modern educational methods were more widely spread throughout the empire and the country embarked on a development scheme and plans for modernization tempered by ethiopian traditions and within the framework of the ancient monarchical structure of the state haile selassie compromised when practical with the traditionalists in the nobility and church he also tried to improve relations between the state and ethnic groups and granted autonomy to afar lands that were difficult to control still his reforms to end feudalism were slow and weakened by the compromises he made with the entrenched aristocracy the revised constitution of  has been criticized for reasserting the indisputable power of the monarch and maintaining the relative powerlessness of the peasants charitable gestureedit he sent aid to the british government in  when britain was affected by heavy flooding his letter to lord meork national distress fund london said even though we are busy of helping our people who didnt recover from the crises of the war we heard that your fertile and beautiful country is devastated by

imperial guard forces staged an unsuccessful coup briefly proclaiming haile selassies eldest son asfa wossen as emperor the coup détat was crushed by the regular army and police forces the coup attempt lacked broad popular support was denounced by the ethiopian orthodox church and was unpopular with the army air force and police nonetheless the effort to depose the emperor had support among students and the educated classes the coup attempt has been characterized as a pivotal moment in ethiopian history the point at which ethiopians for the first time questioned the power of the king to rule without the peoples consent student populations began to empathize with the peasantry and poor and to advocate on their behalf the coup spurred haile selassie to accelerate reform which was manifested in the form of land grants to military and police officials the emperor continued to be a staunch ally of the west while pursuing a firm policy of decolonization in africa which was still largely under european colonial rule the united nations conducted a lengthy inquiry regarding the status of eritrea with the superpowers each vying for a stake in the states future britain the administrator at the time suggested the partition of eritrea between sudan and ethiopia separating christians and muslims the idea was instantly rejected by eritrean political parties as well as the un a un plebiscite voted  to  to have eritrea be federated with ethiopia which was later stipulated on  december  in resolution  v eritrea would have its own parliament and administration and would be represented in what had been the ethiopian parliament and would become the federal parliament haile selassie would have none of european attempts to draft a separate constitution under which eritrea would be governed and wanted his own  constitution protecting families to apply in both ethiopia and eritrea in  the year eritrean struggle for independence began followed by haile selassies

twentyseven years ago as emperor of ethiopia i mounted the rostrum in geneva switzerland to address the league of nations and to appeal for relief from the destruction which had been unleashed against my defenceless nation by the fascist invader i spoke then both to and for the conscience of the world my words went unheeded but history testifies to the accuracy of the warning that i gave in  today

needed that included registration of land which would significantly weaken the nobility even with alterations this law led to a revolt in gojjam which was repressed although enforcement of the tax was abandoned the revolt having achieved its design in undermining the tax encouraged other landowners to defy haile selassie haile selassie on a state visit to washington  while he had fully approved of and assured ethiopias participation in unapproved collective security operations including korea and congo haile selassie drew a distinction with the nonun approved foreign intervention in indochina and consistently deplored it as needless suffering calling for the vietnam war to end on several occasions at the same time he remained open toward the united states and commended it for making progress with african americans civil rights legislation in the s and s while visiting the us several times during these years in  he visited montreal canada to open the ethiopian pavilion at the expo  worlds fair where he received great acclaim amongst other world leaders there for the occasion student unrest became a regular feature of ethiopian life in the s and s marxism took root in large segments of the ethiopian intelligentsia particularly among those who had studied abroad and had thus been exposed to radical and leftwing sentiments that were becoming popular in other parts of the globe resistance by conservative elements at the imperial court and parliament and by the ethiopian orthodox church made haile selassies land reform proposals difficult to implement and also damaged the standing of the government costing haile selassie much of the goodwill he had once enjoyed this bred resentment among the peasant population efforts to weaken unions also hurt his image as these issues began to pile up haile selassie left much of domestic governance to his prime minister aklilu habte wold and concentrated more on foreign affairs sedit haile selassie i in toledo spain in april  picture by eduardo butragueño outside of ethiopia haile selassie continued to enjoy enormous prestige and respect as the longestserving head of state in power he was often given precedence over other leaders at state events such as the state funerals of john f kennedy and charles de gaulle the summits of the nonaligned movement and the  celebration of the  years of the persian empire in  he visited italy as a guest of president giuseppe saragat and in milan he met giordano dellamore president of italian savings banks association he visited china in october  and was the first foreign head of state to meet mao zedong following the death of maos designated successor lin biao in a plane crash in mongolia human rights in ethiopia under selassies regime were poor civil liberties and political rights were low with freedom house giving ethiopia a not free score for both civil liberties and political rights in the last years of selassies rule common human right abuses included imprisonment and torture of political prisoners and very poor prison conditions the ethiopian army also carried out a number of these atrocities while fighting the eritrean separatists this was due to a policy of destroying eritrean villages that supported the rebels there were a number of mass killings of hundreds of civilians during the war in the late s and early s wollo famineedit famine—mostly in wollo northeastern ethiopia as well as in some parts of tigray—is estimated to have killed  to  ethiopians between  and  a bbc news report has cited a  estimate that  deaths occurred based on a contemporaneous estimate from the ethiopian nutrition institute while this figure is still repeated in some texts and media sources it was an estimate that was later found to be overpessimistic although the region is infamous for recurrent crop failures and continuous food shortage and starvation risk this episode was remarkably severe a  production of the itv programme the unknown famine by jonathan dimbleby relied on the unverified estimate of  dead stimulating a massive influx of aid while at the same time destabilizing haile selassies regime against that background a group of dissident army officers instigated a creeping coup against the emperors faltering regime to guard against a public backlash in favour of haile selassie who was still widely revered they contrived to obtain a copy of the unknown famine which they intercut with images of africas grand old man presiding at a wedding feast in the grounds of his palace retitled the hidden hunger it was shown round the clock on ethiopian television to coincide with the day that they finally summoned the nerve to seize the emperor himself the  oil crisis the severity of which is demonstrated by this graph hit ethiopia amidst a devastating famine compounding its effect and undermining support for the emperor some reports suggest that the emperor was unaware of the extent of the famine while others assert that he was well aware of it in addition to the exposure of attempts by corrupt local officials to cover up the famine from the imperial government the kremlins depiction of haile selassies ethiopia as backwards and inept relative to the purported utopia of marxismleninism contributed to the popular uprising that led to its downfall and the rise of mengistu haile mariam the famine and its image in the media undermined popular support of the government and haile selassies once unassailable personal popularity fell the crisis was exacerbated by military mutinies and high oil prices the latter a result of the  oil crisis the international economic crisis triggered by the oil crisis caused the costs of imported goods gasoline and food to skyrocket while unemployment spiked revolutionedit in february  four days of serious riots in addis ababa against a sudden economic inflation left five dead the emperor responded by announcing on national television a reduction in petrol prices and a freeze on the cost of basic commodities this calmed the public but the promised  military wage hike was not substantial enough to pacify the army which then mutinied beginning in asmara and spreading throughout the empire this mutiny led to the resignation of prime minister aklilu habtewold on  february  haile selassie again went on television to agree to the armys demands for still greater pay

complications had occurred and rejected the government version of his deathcitation needed some imperial loyalists believed that the emperor had in fact been assassinated and this belief remains widely held to this day one western correspondent in ethiopia at the time commented while it is not known what actually happened there are strong indications that no efforts were made to save him it is unlikely that he was actually killed such rumors were bound to arise no matter what happened given the atmosphere of suspicion and distrust prevailing in addis ababa at the time the sovietbacked

diaspora to freedom his official titles are conquering lion of the tribe of judah and king of kings of ethiopia and elect of god and his traditional lineage is thought to be from solomon and sheba these notions are perceived by rastafari as confirmation of the return of the messiah in the prophetic book of revelation in the new testament king of kings lord of lords conquering lion of the tribe of judah and root of david rastafari faith in the incarnate divinity of haile selassie began after news reports of his coronation reached jamaica particularly via the two time magazine articles on the coronation the week before and the week after the event haile selassies own perspectives permeate the philosophy of the movement in  the jamaican government sent a delegation composed of both rastafari and nonrastafari leaders to ethiopia to discuss the matter of repatriation among other issues with the emperor he reportedly told the rastafari delegation which included mortimer planno tell the brethren to be not dismayed i personally will give my assistance in the matter of repatriation haile selassie visited jamaica on  april  and approximately one hundred thousand rastafari from all over jamaica descended on palisadoes airport in kingston having heard that the man whom they considered to be their messiah was coming to visit them spliffs and chalices were openly smoked causing a haze of ganja smoke to drift through the air haile selassie arrived at the airport but was unable to come down the mobile steps of the airplane as the crowd rushed the tarmac he then returned into the plane disappearing for several more minutes finally jamaican authorities were obliged to request ras mortimer planno a wellknown rasta leader to climb the steps enter the plane and negotiate the emperors descent planno reemerged and announced to the crowd the emperor has instructed me to tell you to be calm step back and let the emperor land this day is widely held by scholars to be a major turning point for the movement and it is still commemorated by rastafari as grounation day the anniversary of which is celebrated as the second holiest holiday after  november the emperors coronation day from then on as a result of plannos actions the jamaican authorities were asked to ensure that rastafari representatives were present at all state functions attended by the emperor and rastafari elders also ensured that they obtained a private audience with the emperor where he reportedly told them that they should not emigrate to ethiopia until they had first liberated the people of jamaica this dictum came to be known as liberation before repatriation haile selassie defied expectations of the jamaican authorities and never rebuked the rastafari for their belief in him as the returned jesus instead he presented the movements faithful elders with gold medallions – the only recipients of such an honor on this visit during pnp leader later jamaican prime minister michael manleys visit to ethiopia in october  the emperor allegedly still recalled his  reception with amazement and stated that he felt that he had to be respectful of their beliefs this was the visit when manley received the rod of correction or rod of joshua as a present from the emperor which is thought to have helped him to win the  election in jamaica rita marley bob marleys wife converted to the rastafari faith after seeing haile selassie on his jamaican trip she claimed in interviews and in her book no woman no cry that she saw a stigmata print on the palm of haile selassies hand as he waved to the crowd which resembled the markings on christs hands from being nailed to the cross—a claim that was not supported by other sources but was used as evidence for her and other rastafari to suggest that haile selassie i was indeed their messiah she was also influential in the conversion of bob marley who then became internationally recognized as a result rastafari became much better known throughout much of the world bob marleys posthumously released song iron lion zion refers to haile selassie question of his divinityedit in a  recorded interview haile selassie appeared to deny his alleged divinity

never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity for many rastafari the cbc interview is not interpreted as a denial of his divinity and according to robert earl hood haile selassie neither denied nor affirmed his divinity either way in reggae routes the story of jamaican music kevin chang and wayne chen note its often said though no definite date is ever cited that haile selassie himself denied his divinity former senator and gleaner editor hector wynter tells of asking him during his visit to jamaica in  when he was going to tell rastafari he was not

and his political thought and experience in promoting multilateralism and collective security have proved seminal and enduring his suppression of rebellions among the landed aristocracy the mesafint which consistently opposed his reforms as well as what some critics perceived to be ethiopias failure to modernize rapidly enough earned him criticism among some contemporaries and historians his

selassie means trinity—therefore haile selassie roughly translates to power of the trinity haile selassies full title in office was by the conquering lion of the tribe of judah his imperial majesty haile selassie i king of kings of ethiopia elect of godnb  this title reflects ethiopian dynastic traditions which hold that all monarchs must trace their lineage to menelik i who was the offspring of king solomon and the queen of sheba to ethiopians haile selassie has been known by many names including janhoy talaqu meri and abba tekel the rastafari movement employs many of these appellations also referring to him as jah jah jah jah rastafari and him the abbreviation of his imperial majesty biographyedit early lifeedit ras makonnen woldemikael and his son lij tafari makonnen haile selassies royal line through his fathers mother originated from the amhara people he was born on  july  in the village of ejersa goro in the harar province of ethiopia his mother was woizero lady yeshimebet ali abba jifar daughter of the renowned oromo ruler of wollo province dejazmach ali abba jifar his maternal grandmother was of gurage heritage tafaris father was ras makonnen woldemikael gudessa the governor of harar ras makonnen served as a general in the first italo–ethiopian war playing a key role at the battle of adwa he too was paternally oromo but maternally amhara haile selassie was thus able to ascend to the imperial throne through his paternal grandmother woizero tenagnework sahle selassie who was an aunt of emperor menelik ii and daughter of negus sahle selassie of shewa as such haile selassie claimed direct descent from makeda the queen of sheba and king solomon of ancient israel ras makonnen arranged for tafari as well as his first cousin imru haile selassie to receive instruction in harar from abba samuel wolde kahin an ethiopian capuchin monk and from dr vitalien a surgeon from guadeloupe tafari was named dejazmach literally commander of the gate roughly equivalent to count at the age of  on  november  shortly thereafter his father ras makonnen died at kulibi in  governorshipedit dejazmatch tafari as governor of harar tafari assumed the titular governorship of selale in  a realm of marginal importance but one that enabled him to continue his studies in  he was appointed governor over part of the province of sidamo it is alleged that during his late teens haile selassie was married to woizero altayech and that from this union his daughter princess romanework was born following the death of his brother yelma in  the governorate of harar was left vacant and its administration was left to meneliks loyal general dejazmach balcha safo balcha safos administration of harar was ineffective and so during the last illness of menelik ii and the brief reign of empress taitu bitul tafari was made governor of harar in  or  on  august he married menen asfaw of ambassel niece of heir to the throne lij iyasu regencyedit the extent to which tafari makonnen contributed to the movement that would come to depose iyasu v has been discussed extensively particularly in haile selassies own detailed account of the matter iyasu v or lij iyasu was the designated but uncrowned emperor of ethiopia from  to  iyasus reputation for scandalous behavior and a disrespectful attitude towards the nobles at the court of his grandfather menelik ii damaged his reputation iyasus flirtation with islam was considered treasonous among the ethiopian orthodox christian leadership of the empire on  september  iyasu was deposed contributing to the movement that deposed iyasu were conservatives such as fitawrari habte giyorgis menelik iis longtime minister of war the movement to depose iyasu preferred tafari as he attracted support from both progressive and conservative factions ultimately iyasu was deposed on the grounds of conversion to islam in his place the daughter of menelik ii the aunt of iyasu was named empress zewditu while tafari was elevated to the rank of ras and was made heir apparent and crown prince in the power arrangement that followed tafari accepted the role of regent plenipotentiary balemulu inderasenb  and became the de facto ruler of the ethiopian empire mangista ityoppya zewditu would govern while tafari would administer empress zewditu with one of her trusted priests while iyasu had been deposed on  september  on  october he managed to escape into the ogaden desert and his father negus mikael of wollo had time to come to his aid on  october negus mikael and his army met an army under fitawrari habte giyorgis loyal to zewditu and tafari during the battle of segale negus mikael was defeated and captured any chance that iyasu would regain the throne was ended and he went into hiding on  january  after avoiding capture for about five years iyasu was taken into custody by gugsa araya selassie on  february  the coronation for zewditu took place she pledged to rule justly through her regent tafari while tafari was the more visible of the two zewditu was far from an honorary ruler her position required that she arbitrate the claims of competing factions in other words she had the last word tafari carried the burden of daily administration but because his position was relatively weak this was often an exercise in futility for him initially his personal army was poorly equipped his finances were limited and he had little leverage to withstand the combined influence of the empress the minister of war or the provincial governors during his regency the new crown prince developed the policy of cautious modernization initiated by menelik ii also during this time he survived the  flu pandemic having come down with the illness he secured ethiopias admission to the league of nations in  by promising to eradicate slavery each emperor since tewodros ii had issued proclamations to halt slavery but without effect the internationally scorned practice persisted well into haile selassies reign with an estimated  million slaves in ethiopia in the early s travel abroadedit in  ras tafari toured europe and the middle east visiting jerusalem alexandria paris brussels amsterdam stockholm london geneva and athens with him on his tour was a group that included ras seyum mangasha of western tigray province ras hailu tekle haymanot of gojjam province ras mulugeta yeggazu of illubabor province ras makonnen endelkachew and blattengeta heruy welde sellase the primary goal of the trip to europe was for ethiopia to gain access to the sea in paris tafari was to find out from the french foreign ministry quai dorsay that this goal would not be realized however failing this he and his retinue inspected schools hospitals factories and churches although patterning many reforms after european models tafari remained wary of european pressure to guard against economic imperialism tafari required that all enterprises have at least partial local ownership of his modernization campaign he remarked we need european progress only because we are surrounded by it that is at once a benefit and a misfortune throughout ras tafaris travels in europe the levant and egypt he and his entourage were greeted with enthusiasm and fascination he was accompanied by seyum mangasha and hailu tekle haymanot who like tafari were sons of generals who contributed to the victorious war against italy a quarter century earlier at the battle of adwa another member of his entourage mulugeta yeggazu actually fought at adwa as a young man the oriental dignity of the ethiopians and their rich picturesque court dress were sensationalized in the media among his entourage he even included a pride of lions which he distributed as gifts to president alexandre millerand and prime minister raymond poincaré of france to king george v of the united kingdom and to the zoological garden jardin zoologique of paris as one historian noted rarely can a tour have inspired so many anecdotes in return for two lions the united kingdom presented ras tafari with the imperial crown of emperor tewodros ii for its safe return to empress zewditu the crown had been taken by robert napier during the  expedition to abyssinia in this period the crown prince visited the armenian monastery of jerusalem there he adopted  armenian orphans አርባ ልጆች arba lijoch forty children who had lost their parents in ottoman massacres ras tafari arranged for the musical education of the youths and they came to form the imperial brass band king and emperoredit see also modernisation of ethiopia under haile selassie i in  the authority of ras tafari makonnen was challenged when dejazmatch balcha safo went to addis ababa with a sizeable armed force when tafari consolidated his hold over the provinces many of meneliks appointees refused to abide by the new regulations balcha safo the governor shum of coffeerich sidamo province was particularly troublesome the revenues he remitted to the central government did not reflect the accrued profits and tafari recalled him to addis ababa the old man came in high dudgeon and insultingly with a large armynb  the dejazmatch paid homage to empress zewditu but snubbed ras tafari on  february while balcha safo and his personal bodyguardnb  were in addis ababa ras tafari had ras kassa haile darge buy off his army and arranged to have him displaced as the shum of sidamo province by birru wolde gabriel who himself was replaced by desta damtew cover of time magazine  november  even so the gesture of balcha safo empowered empress zewditu politically and she attempted to have tafari tried for treason he was tried for his benevolent dealings with italy including a year peace accord which was signed on  august in september a group of palace reactionaries including some courtiers of the empress made a final bid to get rid of tafari the attempted coup détat was tragic in its origins and comic in its end when confronted by tafari and a company of his troops the ringleaders of the coup took refuge on the palace grounds in meneliks mausoleum tafari and his men surrounded them only to be surrounded themselves by the personal guard of zewditu more of tafaris khaki clad soldiers arrived and with superiority of arms decided the outcome in his favor popular support as well as the support of the police remained with tafari ultimately the empress relented and on  october  she crowned tafari as negus amharic king the crowning of tafari as king was controversial he occupied the same territory as the empress rather than going off to a regional kingdom of the empire two monarchs even with one being the vassal and the other the emperor in this case empress had never occupied the same location as their seat in ethiopian history conservatives agitated to redress this perceived insult to the dignity of the crown leading to the rebellion of ras gugsa welle gugsa welle was the husband of the empress and the shum of begemder province in early  he raised an army and marched it from his governorate at gondar towards addis ababa on  march  gugsa welle was met by forces loyal to negus tafari and was defeated at the battle of anchem gugsa welle was killed in action news of gugsa welles defeat and death had hardly spread through addis ababa when the empress died suddenly on  april  although it was long rumored that the empress was poisoned upon the defeat of her husband or alternately that she died from shock upon hearing of the death of her estranged yet beloved husband it has since been documented that the empress succumbed to a flulike fever and complications from diabetes with the passing of zewditu tafari himself rose to emperor and was proclaimed neguse negest zeityoppya king of kings of ethiopia he was crowned on  november  at addis ababas cathedral of st george the coronation was by all accounts a most splendid affair and it was attended by royals and dignitaries from all over the world among those in attendance were george vs son the duke of gloucester marshal franchet desperey of france and the prince of udine representing the king of italy emissaries from the united states egypt turkey sweden belgium and japan were also present british author evelyn waugh was also present penning a contemporary report on the event and american travel lecturer burton holmes shot the only known film footage of the event one newspaper report suggested that the celebration may have incurred a cost in excess of  many of those in attendance received lavish gifts in one instance the christian emperor even sent a goldencased bible to an american bishop who had not attended the coronation but who had dedicated a prayer to the emperor on the day of the coronation haile selassie introduced ethiopias first written constitution on  july  providing for a bicameral legislature the constitution kept power in the hands of the nobility but it did establish democratic standards among the nobility envisaging a transition to democratic rule it would prevail until the people are in a position to elect themselves the constitution limited the succession to the throne to the descendants of haile selassie a point that met with the disapprobation of other dynastic princes including the princes of tigrai and even the emperors loyal cousin ras kassa haile darge in  the sultanate of jimma was formally absorbed into ethiopia following the death of sultan abba jifar ii of jimma conflict with italyedit see also abyssinia crisis and second italoabyssinian war ethiopia became the target of renewed italian imperialist designs in the s benito mussolinis fascist regime was keen to avenge the military defeats italy had suffered to ethiopia in the first italoabyssinian war and to efface the failed attempt by liberal italy to conquer the country as epitomised by the defeat at adwa a conquest of ethiopia could also empower the cause of fascism and embolden its rhetoric of empire ethiopia would also provide a bridge between italys eritrean and italian somaliland possessions ethiopias position in the league of nations did not dissuade the italians from invading in  the collective security envisaged by the league proved useless and a scandal erupted when the hoarelaval pact revealed that ethiopias league allies were scheming to appease italy mobilizationedit following the  december  italian invasion of ethiopia at walwal ogeden province haile selassie joined his northern armies and set up headquarters at desse in wollo province he issued his mobilization order on  october  if you withhold from your country ethiopia the death from cough or headcold of which you would otherwise die refusing to resist in your district in your patrimony and in your home our enemy who is coming from a distant country to attack us and if you persist in not shedding your blood you will be rebuked for it by your creator and will be cursed by your offspring hence without cooling your heart of accustomed valour there emerges your decision to fight fiercely mindful of your history that will last far into the future… if on your march you touch any property inside houses or cattle and crops outside not even grass straw and dung excluded it is like killing your brother who is dying with you… you countryman living at the various access routes set up a market for the army at the places where it is camping and on the day your districtgovernor will indicate to you lest the soldiers campaigning for ethiopias liberty should experience difficulty you will not be charged excise duty until the end of the campaign for anything you are marketing at the military camps i have granted you remission… after you have been ordered to go to war but are then idly missing from the campaign and when you are seized by the local chief or by an accuser you will have punishment inflicted upon your inherited land your property and your body to the accuser i shall grant a third of your property… on  october  haile selassie gave more precise orders for his army to his commanderinchief ras kassa when you set up tents it is to be in caves and by trees and in a wood if the place happens to be adjoining to these―and separated in the various platoons tents are to be set up at a distance of  cubits from each other when an aeroplane is sighted one should leave large open roads and wide meadows and march in valleys and trenches and by zigzag routes along places which have trees and woods when an aeroplane comes to drop bombs it will not suit it to do so unless it comes down to about  metres hence when it flies low for such action one should fire a volley with a good and very long gun and then quickly disperse when three or four bullets have hit it the aeroplane is bound to fall down but let only those fire who have been ordered to shoot with a weapon that has been selected for such firing for if everyone shoots who possesses a gun there is no advantage in this except to waste bullets and to disclose the mens whereabouts lest the aeroplane when rising again should detect the whereabouts of those who are dispersed it is well to remain cautiously scattered as long as it is still fairly close in time of war it suits the enemy to aim his guns at adorned shields ornaments silver and gold cloaks silk shirts and all similar things whether one possesses a jacket or not it is best to wear a narrowsleeved shirt with faded colours when we return with gods help you can wear your gold and silver decorations then now it is time to go and fight we offer you all these words of advice in the hope that no great harm should befall you through lack of caution at the same time we are glad to assure you that in time of war we are ready to shed our blood in your midst for the sake of ethiopias freedom… compared to the ethiopians the italians had an advanced modern military which included a large air force the italians would also come to employ chemical weapons extensively throughout the conflict even targeting red cross field hospitals in violation of the geneva conventions progress of the waredit starting in early october  the italians invaded ethiopia but by november the pace of invasion had slowed appreciably and haile selassies northern armies were able to launch what was known as the christmas offensive during this offensive the italians were forced back in places and put on the defensive in early  the first battle of tembien stopped the progress of the ethiopian offensive and the italians were ready to continue their offensive following the defeat and destruction of the northern ethiopian armies at the battle of amba aradam the second battle of tembien and the battle of shire haile selassie took the field with the last ethiopian army on the northern front on  march  he launched a counterattack against the italians himself at the battle of maychew in southern tigray the emperors army was defeated and retreated in disarray as haile selassies army withdrew the italians attacked from the air along with rebellious raya and azebo tribesmen on the ground who were armed and paid by the italians when the struggle to resist italy appeared doomed haile selassie traveled to the rockhewn churches of lalibela for fasting and prayer haile selassie made a solitary pilgrimage to the churches at lalibela at considerable risk of capture before returning to his capital after a stormy session of the council of state it was agreed that because addis ababa could not be defended the government would relocate to the southern town of gore and that in the interest of preserving the imperial house the emperors wife menen asfaw and the rest of the imperial family should immediately depart for french somaliland and from there continue on to jerusalem exile debateedit the emperor arrives in jerusalem may  after further debate as to whether haile selassie should go to gore or accompany his family into exile it was agreed that he should leave ethiopia with his family and present the case of ethiopia to the league of nations at geneva the decision was not unanimous and several participants including the nobleman blatta tekle wolde hawariat strenuously objected to the idea of an ethiopian monarch fleeing before an invading force haile selassie appointed his cousin ras imru haile selassie as prince regent in his absence departing with his family for french somaliland on  may  on  may marshal pietro badoglio led italian troops into addis ababa and mussolini declared ethiopia an italian province victor emanuel iii was proclaimed as the new emperor of ethiopia on the previous day the ethiopian exiles had left french somaliland aboard the british cruiser hms enterprise they were bound for jerusalem in the british mandate of palestine where the ethiopian royal family maintained a residence the imperial family disembarked at haifa and then went on to jerusalem once there haile selassie and his retinue prepared to make their case at geneva the choice of jerusalem was highly symbolic since the solomonic dynasty claimed descent from the house of david leaving the holy land haile selassie and his entourage sailed aboard the british cruiser hms capetown for gibraltar where he stayed at the rock hotel from gibraltar the exiles were transferred to an ordinary liner by doing this the government of the united kingdom was spared the expense of a state reception collective security and the league of nations edit mussolini upon invading ethiopia had promptly declared his own italian empire because the league of nations afforded haile selassie the opportunity to address the assembly italy even withdrew its league delegation on  may  it was in this context that haile selassie walked into the hall of the league of nations introduced by the president of the assembly as his imperial majesty the emperor of ethiopia sa majesté imperiale lempereur dethiopie the introduction caused a great many italian journalists in the galleries to erupt into jeering heckling and whistling as it turned out they had earlier been issued whistles by mussolinis soninlaw count galeazzo ciano the romanian delegate nicolae titulescu famously jumped to his feet in response and cried show the savages the door and they were cleared out haile selassie waited calmly for the hall to be cleared and responded majestically with a speech sometimes consideredby whom among the most stirring of the th century although fluent in french the working language of the league haile selassie chose to deliver his historic speech in his native amharic he asserted that because his confidence in the league was absolute his people were now being slaughtered he pointed out that the same european states that found in ethiopias favor at the league of nations were refusing ethiopia credit and matériel while aiding italy which was employing chemical weapons on military and civilian targets alike it was at the time when the operations for the encircling of makale were taking place that the italian command fearing a rout followed the procedure which it is now my duty to denounce to the world special sprayers were installed on board aircraft so that they could vaporize over vast areas of territory a fine deathdealing rain groups of nine fifteen eighteen aircraft followed one another so that the fog issuing from them formed a continuous sheet it was thus that as from the end of january  soldiers women children cattle rivers lakes and pastures were drenched continually with this deadly rain in order to kill off systematically all living creatures in order to more surely poison waters and pastures the italian command made its aircraft pass over and over again that was its chief method of warfare noting that his own small people of  million inhabitants without arms without resources could never withstand an attack by a large power such as italy with its  million people and unlimited quantities of the most deathdealing weapons he contended that all small states were threatened by the aggression and that all small states were in effect reduced to vassal states in the absence of collective action he admonished the league that god and history will remember your judgment it is collective security it is the very existence of the league of nations it is the confidence that each state is to place in international treaties… in a word it is international morality that is at stake have the signatures appended to a treaty value only in so far as the signatory powers have a personal direct and immediate interest involved the speech made the emperor an icon for antifascists around the world and time named him man of the year he failed however to get what he most needed the league agreed to only partial and ineffective sanctions on italy only six nations in  did not recognize italys occupation they were china new zealand the soviet union the republic of spain mexico and the united states exileedit haile selassie in  haile selassie spent his exile years – in bath england in fairfield house which he bought the emperor and kassa haile darge took morning walks together behind the high walls of the room georgian house haile selassies favorite reading was diplomatic history but most of his serious hours were occupied with the word story of his life that he was laboriously writing in amharic prior to fairfield house he briefly stayed at warnes hotel in worthing and in parkside wimbledon a bust of haile selassie is in nearby cannizaro park to commemorate this time and is a popular place of pilgrimage for londons rastafari community haile selassie stayed at the abbey hotel in malvern in the s and his granddaughters and daughters of court officials were educated at clarendon school in north malvern during his time in malvern he attended services at holy trinity church in link top a blue plaque commemorating his stay in malvern was unveiled on saturday  june  as part of the ceremony a delegation from the rastafari movement gave a short address and a drum recital haile selassies activity in this period was focused on countering italian propaganda as to the state of ethiopian resistance and the legality of the occupation he spoke out against the desecration of houses of worship and historical artifacts including the theft of a yearold imperial obelisk and condemned the atrocities suffered by the ethiopian civilian population he continued to plead for league intervention and to voice his certainty that gods judgment will eventually visit the weak and the mighty alike though his attempts to gain support for the struggle against italy were largely unsuccessful until italy entered world war ii on the german side in june  the emperors pleas for international support did take root in the united states particularly among africanamerican organizations sympathetic to the ethiopian cause in  haile selassie was to give a christmas day radio address to the american people to thank his supporters when his taxi was involved in a traffic accident leaving him with a fractured knee rather than canceling the radio appearance he proceeded in much pain to complete the address in which he linked christianity and goodwill with the covenant of the league of nations and asserted that war is not the only means to stop war with the birth of the son of god an unprecedented an unrepeatable and a longanticipated phenomenon occurred he was born in a stable instead of a palace in a manger instead of a crib the hearts of the wise men were struck by fear and wonder due to his majestic humbleness the kings prostrated themselves before him and worshipped him peace be to those who have good will this became the first message although the toils of wise people may earn them respect it is a fact of life that the spirit of the wicked continues to cast its shadow on this world the arrogant are seen visibly leading their people into crime and destruction the laws of the league of nations are constantly violated and wars and acts of aggression repeatedly take place… so that the spirit of the cursed will not gain predominance over the human race whom christ redeemed with his blood all peaceloving people should cooperate to stand firm in order to preserve and promote lawfulness and peace during this period haile selassie suffered several personal tragedies his two sonsinlaw ras desta damtew and dejazmach beyene merid were both executed by the italians the emperors daughter princess romanework wife of dejazmach beyene merid was herself taken into captivity with her children and she died in italy in  his daughter tsehai died during childbirth shortly after the restoration in  after his return to ethiopia he donated fairfield house to

 during the east african campaign haile selassie crossed the border between sudan and ethiopia near the village of um iddla the standard of the lion of judah was raised again two days later he and a force of ethiopian patriots joined gideon force which was already in ethiopia and preparing the way italy was defeated by a force of the united kingdom the commonwealth of nations free france free

our enemy therefore when we say let us rejoice with our hearts let not our rejoicing be in any other way but in the spirit of christ do not return evil for evil do not indulge in the atrocities which the enemy has been practicing in his usual way even to the last take care not to spoil the good name of ethiopia by acts which are worthy of the enemy we shall see that our enemies are disarmed and sent out the same way they came as saint george who killed the dragon is the patron saint of our army as well as of our allies let us unite with our allies in everlasting friendship and amity in order to be able to stand against the godless and cruel dragon which has newly risen and which is oppressing mankind on  august  haile selassie abolished the legal basis of slavery throughout the empire and

ethiopia on  december  the un general assembly adopted resolution  v establishing the federation of eritrea the former italian colony into ethiopia eritrea was to have its own constitution which would provide for ethnic linguistic and cultural balance while ethiopia was to manage its finances defense and foreign policy despite his centralization policies that had been made before world war ii haile selassie still found himself unable to push for all the programs he wanted in  he attempted to institute a progressive tax scheme but this failed due to opposition from the nobility and only a flat tax was passed in  he agreed to reduce this as well ethiopia was still semifeudal and the emperors attempts to alter its social and economic form by reforming its modes of taxation met with resistance from the nobility and clergy which were eager to resume their privileges in the postwar era where haile selassie actually did succeed in effecting new land taxes the burdens were often passed by the landowners to the peasants despite his wishes the tax burden remained primarily on the peasants between  and  haile selassie worked to establish the autocephaly of the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church the ethiopian orthodox church had been headed by the abuna a bishop who answered to the pope of the coptic orthodox church of alexandria in  and  haile selassie applied to the holy synod of the coptic orthodox church to establish the independence of ethiopian bishops and when his appeals were denied he threatened to sever relations with the coptic church of alexandria finally in  pope kyrillos vi elevated the abuna to patriarchcatholicos the ethiopian church remained affiliated with the alexandrian church in addition to these efforts haile selassie changed the ethiopian churchstate relationship by introducing taxation of church lands and by restricting the legal privileges of the clergy who had formerly been tried in their own courts for civil offenses in keeping with the principle of collective security for which he was an outspoken proponent he sent a contingent under general mulugueta bulli known as the kagnew battalion to take part in the korean war by supporting the united nations command it was attached to the american th infantry division and fought in a number of engagements including the battle of pork chop hill in a  speech the emperor spoke of ethiopian participation in the korean war as a redemption of the principles of collective security nearly two decades ago i personally assumed before history the responsibility of placing the fate of my beloved people on the issue of collective security for surely at that time and for the first time in world history that issue was posed in all its clarity my searching of conscience convinced me of the rightness of my course and if after untold sufferings and indeed unaided resistance at the time of aggression we now see the final vindication of that principle in our joint action in korea i can only be thankful that god gave me strength to persist in our faith until the moment of its recent glorious vindication haile selassie emperor of ethiopia photographed during a radio broadcast during the celebrations of his silver jubilee in november  haile selassie introduced a revised constitution whereby he retained effective power while extending political participation to the people by allowing the lower house of parliament to become an elected body party politics were not provided for modern educational methods were more widely spread throughout the empire and the country embarked on a development scheme and plans for modernization tempered by ethiopian traditions and within the framework of the ancient monarchical structure of the state haile selassie compromised when practical with the traditionalists in the nobility and church he also tried to improve relations between the state and ethnic groups and granted autonomy to afar lands that were difficult to control still his reforms to end feudalism were slow and weakened by the compromises he made with the entrenched aristocracy the revised constitution of  has been criticized for reasserting the indisputable power of the monarch and maintaining the relative powerlessness of the peasants charitable gestureedit he sent aid to the british government in  when britain was affected by heavy flooding his letter to lord meork national distress fund london said even though we are busy of helping our people who didnt recover from the crises of the war we heard that your fertile and beautiful country is devastated by the unusually heavy rain and your request for aid therefore we are sending small amount of money about one thousand pounds through our embassy to show our sympathy and cooperation he also left his

congo peacekeeping force during the  congo crisis to preserve congolese integrity per united nations security council resolution  on  december  while haile selassie was on a state visit to brazil his imperial guard forces staged an unsuccessful coup briefly proclaiming haile selassies eldest son asfa wossen as emperor the coup détat was crushed by the regular army and police forces the coup attempt lacked broad popular support was denounced by the ethiopian orthodox church and was unpopular with the army air force and police nonetheless the effort to depose the emperor had support among students and the educated classes the coup attempt has been characterized as a pivotal moment in ethiopian history the point at which ethiopians for the first time questioned the power of the king to rule without the peoples consent student populations began to empathize with the peasantry and poor and to advocate on their behalf the coup spurred haile selassie to accelerate reform which was manifested in the form of land grants to military and police officials the emperor continued to be a staunch ally of the west while pursuing a firm policy of decolonization in africa which was still largely under european colonial rule the united nations conducted a lengthy inquiry regarding the status of eritrea with the superpowers each vying for a stake in the states future britain the administrator at the time suggested the partition of eritrea between sudan and ethiopia separating christians and muslims the idea was instantly rejected by eritrean political parties as well as the un a un plebiscite voted  to  to have eritrea be federated with ethiopia which was later stipulated on  december  in resolution  v eritrea would have its own parliament and administration and would be represented in what had been the ethiopian parliament and would become the federal parliament haile selassie would have none of european attempts to draft a separate constitution under which eritrea would be governed and wanted his own  constitution protecting families to apply in both ethiopia and eritrea in  the year eritrean struggle for independence began followed by haile selassies dissolution of the federation and shutting down of eritreas parliament in september  haile selassie attended the conference of heads of state of government of nonaligned countries in belgrade fpr

proposition later taken up by muammar gaddafi on  october  haile selassie addressed the general assembly of the united nations referring in his address to his earlier speech to the league of nations twentyseven years ago as emperor of ethiopia i mounted the rostrum in geneva switzerland to address the league of nations and to appeal for relief from the destruction which had been unleashed against my defenceless nation by the fascist invader i spoke then both to and for the conscience of the world my words went unheeded but history testifies to the accuracy of the warning that i gave in  today i stand before the world organization which has succeeded to the mantle discarded by its discredited predecessor in this body is enshrined the principle of collective security which i unsuccessfully invoked at geneva here in this assembly reposes the best – perhaps the last – hope for the peaceful survival of mankind on  november  the emperor was among other heads of state including frances president charles de gaulle who traveled to washington dc and attended the funeral of assassinated president john f kennedy in  haile selassie attempted to create a modern progressive taxcitation needed that included registration of land which would significantly weaken the nobility even with alterations this law led to a revolt in gojjam which was repressed although enforcement of the tax was abandoned the revolt having achieved its design in undermining the tax encouraged other landowners to defy haile selassie haile selassie on a state visit to washington  while he had fully approved of and assured ethiopias participation in unapproved collective security operations including korea and congo haile selassie drew a distinction with the nonun approved foreign intervention in indochina and consistently deplored it as needless suffering calling for the vietnam war to end on several occasions at the same time he remained open toward the united states and commended it for making progress with african americans civil rights legislation in the s and s while visiting the us several times during these years in  he visited montreal canada to open the ethiopian pavilion at the expo  worlds fair where he received great acclaim amongst other world leaders there for the occasion student unrest became a regular feature of ethiopian life in the s and s marxism took root in large segments of the ethiopian intelligentsia particularly among those who had studied abroad and had thus been exposed to radical and leftwing sentiments that were becoming popular in other parts of the globe resistance by conservative elements at the imperial court and parliament and by the ethiopian orthodox church made haile selassies land reform proposals difficult to implement and also damaged the standing of the government costing haile selassie much of the goodwill he had once enjoyed this bred resentment among the peasant population efforts to weaken unions also hurt his image as these issues began to pile up haile selassie left much of domestic governance to his prime minister aklilu habte wold and concentrated more on foreign affairs sedit haile selassie i in toledo spain in april  picture by eduardo butragueño outside of ethiopia haile selassie continued to enjoy enormous prestige and respect as the longestserving head of state in power he was often given precedence over other leaders at state events such as the state funerals of john f kennedy and charles de gaulle the summits of the nonaligned movement and the  celebration of the  years of the persian empire in  he visited italy as a guest of president giuseppe saragat and in milan he met giordano dellamore president of italian savings banks association he visited china in october  and was the first foreign head of state to meet mao zedong following the death of maos designated successor lin biao in a plane crash in mongolia human rights in ethiopia under selassies regime were poor civil liberties and political rights were low with freedom house giving ethiopia a not free score for both civil liberties and political rights in the last years of selassies rule common human right abuses included imprisonment and torture of political prisoners and very poor prison conditions the ethiopian army also carried out a number of these atrocities while fighting the eritrean separatists this was due to a policy of destroying eritrean villages that supported the rebels there were a number of mass killings of hundreds of civilians during the war in the late s and early s wollo famineedit famine—mostly in wollo northeastern ethiopia as well as in some parts of tigray—is estimated to have killed  to  ethiopians between  and  a bbc news report has cited a  estimate that  deaths occurred based on a contemporaneous estimate from the ethiopian nutrition institute while this figure is still repeated in some texts and media sources it was an estimate that was later found to be overpessimistic although the region is infamous for recurrent crop failures and continuous food shortage and starvation risk this episode was remarkably severe a  production of the itv programme the unknown famine by jonathan dimbleby relied on the unverified estimate of  dead stimulating a massive influx of aid while at the same time destabilizing haile selassies regime against that background a group of dissident army officers instigated a creeping coup against the emperors faltering regime to guard against a public backlash in favour of haile selassie who was still widely revered they contrived to obtain a copy of the unknown famine which they intercut with images of africas grand old man presiding at a wedding feast in the grounds of his palace retitled the hidden hunger it was shown round the clock on ethiopian television to coincide with the day that they finally summoned the nerve to seize the emperor himself the  oil crisis the severity of which is demonstrated by this graph hit ethiopia amidst a devastating famine compounding its effect and undermining support for the emperor some reports suggest that the emperor was unaware of the extent of the famine while others assert that he was well aware of it in addition to the exposure of attempts by corrupt local officials to cover up the famine from the imperial government the kremlins depiction of haile selassies ethiopia as backwards and inept relative to the purported utopia of marxismleninism contributed to the popular uprising that led to its downfall and the rise of mengistu haile mariam the famine and its image in the media undermined popular support of the government and haile selassies once unassailable personal popularity fell the crisis was exacerbated by military mutinies and high oil prices the latter a result of the  oil crisis the international economic crisis triggered by the oil crisis caused the costs of imported goods gasoline and food to skyrocket while unemployment spiked revolutionedit in february  four days of serious riots in addis ababa against a sudden economic inflation left five dead the emperor responded by announcing on national television a reduction in petrol prices and a freeze on the cost of basic commodities this calmed the public but the promised  military wage hike was not substantial enough to pacify the army which then mutinied beginning in asmara and spreading throughout the empire this mutiny led to the resignation of prime minister aklilu habtewold on  february  haile selassie again went on television to agree to the armys demands for still greater pay and named endelkachew makonnen as his new prime minister despite endalkatchews many concessions discontent continued in march with a fourday general strike that paralyzed the nation imprisonmentedit

haile selassie was placed under house arrest briefly at the th army division in addis ababa while most of his family was detained at the late duke of harars residence in the north of the capital the last months of the emperors life were spent in imprisonment in the grand palace reportedly his mental condition was such that he believed he was still emperor of ethiopia later most of the imperial family was imprisoned in the addis ababa prison kerchele also known as alem bekagne or ive had enough of this world on  november  sixty former high officials of the imperial government were executed without trial the executed included haile selassies grandson and two former prime ministers these killings known to ethiopians as bloody saturday were condemned by crown prince asfa wossen the derg

exmonarch haile selassie had died on  august of respiratory failure following complications from a prostate examination followed up by a prostate operation his doctor asrat woldeyes denied that complications had occurred and rejected the government version of his deathcitation needed some imperial loyalists believed that the emperor had in fact been assassinated and this belief remains widely held to this day one western correspondent in ethiopia at the time commented while it is not known what actually happened there are strong indications that no efforts were made to save him it is unlikely that he was actually killed such rumors were bound to arise no matter what happened given the atmosphere of suspicion and distrust prevailing in addis ababa at the time the sovietbacked derg fell in  in  the emperors bones were found under a concrete slab on the palace grounds some reports suggest that his remains were discovered beneath a latrine for almost a decade thereafter as ethiopian courts attempted to sort out the circumstances of his death his coffin rested in bhata church near his greatuncle menelik iis resting place on  november  haile selassie was given an imperialstyle funeral by the ethiopian orthodox church the postcommunist government refused calls to declare the ceremony an official imperial funeral although such prominent rastafari figures as rita

diaspora to freedom his official titles are conquering lion of the tribe of judah and king of kings of ethiopia and elect of god and his traditional lineage is thought to be from solomon and sheba these notions are perceived by rastafari as confirmation of the return of the messiah in the prophetic book of revelation in the new testament king of kings lord of lords conquering lion of the tribe of judah and root of david rastafari faith in the incarnate divinity of haile selassie began after news reports of his coronation reached jamaica particularly via the two time magazine articles on the coronation the week before and the week after the event haile selassies own perspectives permeate the philosophy of the movement in  the jamaican government sent a delegation composed of both rastafari and nonrastafari leaders to ethiopia to discuss the matter of repatriation among other issues with the emperor he reportedly told the rastafari delegation which included mortimer planno tell the brethren to be not dismayed i personally will give my assistance in the matter of repatriation haile selassie visited jamaica on  april  and approximately one hundred thousand rastafari from all over jamaica descended on palisadoes airport in kingston having heard that the man whom they considered to be their messiah was coming to visit them spliffs and chalices were openly smoked causing a haze of ganja smoke to drift through the air haile selassie arrived at the airport but was unable to come down the mobile steps of the airplane as the crowd rushed the tarmac he then returned into the plane disappearing for several more minutes finally jamaican authorities were obliged to request ras mortimer planno a wellknown rasta leader to climb the steps enter the plane and negotiate the emperors descent planno reemerged and announced to the crowd the emperor has instructed me to tell you to be calm step back and let the emperor land this day is widely held by scholars to be a major turning point for the movement and it is still commemorated by rastafari as grounation day the anniversary of which is celebrated as the second holiest holiday after  november the emperors coronation day from then on as a result of plannos actions the jamaican authorities were asked to ensure that rastafari representatives were present at all state functions attended by the emperor and rastafari elders also ensured that they obtained a private audience with the emperor where he reportedly told them that they should not emigrate to ethiopia until they had first liberated the people of jamaica this dictum came to be known as liberation before repatriation haile selassie defied expectations of the jamaican authorities and never rebuked the rastafari for their belief in him as the returned jesus instead he presented the movements faithful elders with gold medallions – the only recipients of such an honor on this visit during pnp leader later jamaican prime minister michael manleys visit to ethiopia in october  the emperor allegedly still recalled his  reception with amazement and stated that he felt that he had to be respectful of their beliefs this was the visit when manley received the rod of correction or rod of joshua as a present from the emperor which is thought to have helped him to win the  election in jamaica rita marley bob marleys wife converted to the rastafari faith after seeing haile selassie on his jamaican trip she claimed in interviews and in her book no woman no cry that she saw a stigmata print on the palm of haile selassies hand as he waved to the crowd which resembled the markings on christs hands from being nailed to the cross—a claim that was not supported by other sources but was used as evidence for her and other rastafari to suggest that haile selassie i was indeed their messiah she was also influential in the conversion of bob marley who then became internationally recognized as a result rastafari became much better known throughout much of the world bob marleys posthumously released song iron lion zion refers to haile selassie question of his divinityedit in a  recorded interview haile selassie appeared to deny his alleged divinity in the interview bill mcneil says there are millions of christians throughout the world your imperial majesty who regard you as the reincarnation of jesus christ selassie replied in his native language i have heard of that idea i also met certain rastafarians i told them clearly that i am a man that i am mortal and that i will be replaced by the oncoming generation and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity for many rastafari the cbc interview is not interpreted as a denial of his divinity and according to robert earl hood haile selassie neither denied nor affirmed his divinity either way in reggae routes the story of jamaican music kevin chang and wayne chen note its often said though no definite date is ever cited that haile selassie himself denied his divinity former senator and gleaner editor hector wynter tells of asking him during his visit to jamaica in  when he was going to tell rastafari he was not god who am i to disturb their belief replied the emperor after his return to ethiopia he dispatched archbishop abuna yesehaq mandefro to the caribbean to help draw rastafari and other west indians to the ethiopian church and according to some sources denied his divinity in  haile selassie donated a piece of land at shashamane  km south of addis ababa for the use of people of african descent from

and his political thought and experience in promoting multilateralism and collective security have proved seminal and enduring his suppression of rebellions among the landed aristocracy the mesafint which consistently opposed his reforms as well as what some critics perceived to be ethiopias failure to modernize rapidly enough earned him criticism among some contemporaries and historians his

haile selassie i king of kings of ethiopia elect of godnb  this title reflects ethiopian dynastic traditions which hold that all monarchs must trace their lineage to menelik i who was the offspring of king solomon and the queen of sheba to ethiopians haile selassie has been known by many names including janhoy talaqu meri and abba tekel the rastafari movement employs many of these appellations also referring to him as jah jah jah jah rastafari and him the abbreviation of his imperial majesty biographyedit early lifeedit ras makonnen woldemikael and his son lij tafari makonnen haile selassies royal line through his fathers mother originated from the amhara people he was born on  july  in the village of ejersa goro in the harar province of ethiopia his mother was woizero lady yeshimebet ali abba jifar daughter of the renowned oromo ruler of wollo province dejazmach ali abba jifar his maternal grandmother was of gurage heritage tafaris father was ras makonnen woldemikael gudessa the governor of harar ras makonnen served as a general in the first italo–ethiopian war playing a key role at the battle of adwa he too was paternally oromo but maternally amhara haile selassie was thus able to ascend to the imperial throne through his paternal grandmother woizero tenagnework sahle selassie who was an aunt of emperor menelik ii and daughter of negus sahle selassie of shewa as such haile selassie claimed direct descent from makeda the queen of sheba and king solomon of ancient israel ras makonnen arranged for tafari as well as his first cousin imru haile selassie to receive instruction in harar from abba samuel wolde kahin an ethiopian capuchin monk and from dr vitalien a surgeon from guadeloupe tafari was named dejazmach literally commander of the gate roughly equivalent to count at the age of  on  november  shortly thereafter his father ras makonnen died at kulibi in  governorshipedit dejazmatch tafari as governor of harar tafari assumed the titular governorship of selale in  a realm of marginal importance but one that enabled him to continue his studies in  he was appointed governor over part of the province of sidamo it is alleged that during his late teens haile selassie was married to woizero altayech and that from this union his daughter princess romanework was born following the death of his brother yelma in  the governorate of harar was left vacant and its administration was left to meneliks loyal general dejazmach balcha safo balcha safos administration of harar was ineffective and so during the last illness of menelik ii and the brief reign of empress taitu bitul tafari was made governor of harar in  or  on  august he married menen asfaw of ambassel niece of heir to the throne lij iyasu regencyedit the extent to which tafari makonnen contributed to the movement that would come to depose iyasu v has been discussed extensively particularly in haile selassies own detailed account of the matter iyasu v or lij iyasu was the designated but uncrowned emperor of ethiopia from  to  iyasus reputation for scandalous behavior and a disrespectful attitude towards the nobles at the court of his grandfather menelik ii damaged his reputation iyasus flirtation with islam was considered treasonous among the ethiopian orthodox christian leadership of the empire on  september  iyasu was deposed contributing to the movement that deposed iyasu were conservatives such as fitawrari habte giyorgis menelik iis longtime minister of war the movement to depose iyasu preferred tafari as he attracted support from both progressive and conservative factions ultimately iyasu was deposed on the grounds of conversion to islam in his place the daughter of menelik ii the aunt of iyasu was named empress zewditu while tafari was elevated to the rank of ras and was made heir apparent and crown prince in the power arrangement that followed tafari accepted the role of regent plenipotentiary balemulu inderasenb  and became the de facto ruler of the ethiopian empire mangista ityoppya zewditu would govern while tafari would administer empress zewditu with one of her trusted priests while iyasu had been deposed on  september  on  october he managed to escape into the ogaden desert and his father negus mikael of wollo had time to come to his aid on  october negus mikael and his army met an army under fitawrari habte giyorgis loyal to zewditu and tafari during the battle of segale negus mikael was defeated and captured any chance that iyasu would regain the throne was ended and he went into hiding on  january  after avoiding capture for about five years iyasu was taken into custody by gugsa araya selassie on  february  the coronation for zewditu took place she pledged to rule justly through her regent tafari while tafari was the more visible of the two zewditu was far from an honorary ruler her position required that she arbitrate the claims of competing factions in other words she had the last word tafari carried the burden of daily administration but because his position was relatively weak this was often an exercise in futility for him initially his personal army was poorly equipped his finances were limited and he had little leverage to withstand the combined influence of the empress the minister of war or the provincial governors during his regency the new crown prince developed the policy of cautious modernization initiated by menelik ii also during this time he survived the  flu pandemic having come down with the illness he secured ethiopias admission to the league of nations in  by promising to eradicate slavery each emperor since tewodros ii had issued proclamations to halt slavery but without effect the internationally scorned practice persisted well into haile selassies reign with an estimated  million slaves in ethiopia in the early s travel abroadedit in  ras tafari toured europe and the middle east visiting jerusalem alexandria paris brussels amsterdam stockholm london geneva and athens with him on his tour was a group that included ras seyum mangasha of western tigray province ras hailu tekle haymanot of gojjam province ras mulugeta yeggazu of illubabor province ras makonnen endelkachew and blattengeta heruy welde sellase the primary goal of the trip to europe was for ethiopia to gain access to the sea in paris tafari was to find out from the french foreign ministry quai dorsay that this goal would not be realized however failing this he and his retinue inspected schools hospitals factories and churches although patterning many reforms after european models tafari remained wary of european pressure to guard against economic imperialism tafari required that all enterprises have at least partial local ownership of his modernization campaign he remarked we need european progress only because we are surrounded by it that is at once a benefit and a misfortune throughout ras tafaris travels in europe the levant and egypt he and his entourage were greeted with enthusiasm and fascination he was accompanied by seyum mangasha and hailu tekle haymanot who like tafari were sons of generals who contributed to the victorious war against italy a quarter century earlier at the battle of adwa another member of his entourage mulugeta yeggazu actually fought at adwa as a young man the oriental dignity of the ethiopians and their rich picturesque court dress were sensationalized in the media among his entourage he even included a pride of lions which he distributed as gifts to president alexandre millerand and prime minister raymond poincaré of france to king george v of the united kingdom and to the zoological garden jardin zoologique of paris as one historian noted rarely can a tour have inspired so many anecdotes in return for two lions the united kingdom presented ras tafari with the imperial crown of emperor tewodros ii for its safe return to empress zewditu the crown had been taken by robert napier during the  expedition to abyssinia in this period the crown prince visited the armenian monastery of jerusalem there he adopted  armenian orphans አርባ ልጆች arba lijoch forty children who had lost their parents in ottoman massacres ras tafari arranged for the musical education of the youths and they came to form the imperial brass band king and emperoredit see also modernisation of ethiopia under haile selassie i in  the authority of ras tafari makonnen was challenged when dejazmatch balcha safo went to addis ababa with a sizeable armed force when tafari consolidated his hold over the provinces many of meneliks appointees refused to abide by the new regulations balcha safo the governor shum of coffeerich sidamo province was particularly troublesome the revenues he remitted to the central government did not reflect the accrued profits and tafari recalled him to addis ababa the old man came in high dudgeon and insultingly with a large armynb  the dejazmatch paid homage to empress zewditu but snubbed ras tafari on  february while balcha safo and his personal bodyguardnb  were in addis ababa ras tafari had ras kassa haile darge buy off his army and arranged to have him displaced as the shum of sidamo province by birru wolde gabriel who himself was replaced by desta damtew cover of time magazine  november  even so the gesture of balcha safo empowered empress zewditu politically and she attempted to have tafari tried for treason he was tried for his benevolent dealings with italy including a year peace accord which was signed on  august in september a group of palace reactionaries including some courtiers of the empress made a final bid to get rid of tafari the attempted coup détat was tragic in its origins and comic in its end when confronted by tafari and a company of his troops the ringleaders of the coup took refuge on the palace grounds in meneliks mausoleum tafari and his men surrounded them only to be surrounded themselves by the personal guard of zewditu more of tafaris khaki clad soldiers arrived and with superiority of arms decided the outcome in his favor popular support as well as the support of the police remained with tafari ultimately the empress relented and on  october  she crowned tafari as negus amharic king the crowning of tafari as king was controversial he occupied the same territory as the empress rather than going off to a regional kingdom of the empire two monarchs even with one being the vassal and the other the emperor in this case empress had never occupied the same location as their seat in ethiopian history conservatives agitated to redress this perceived insult to the dignity of the crown leading to the rebellion of ras gugsa welle gugsa welle was the husband of the empress and the shum of begemder province in early  he raised an army and marched it from his governorate at gondar towards addis ababa on  march  gugsa welle was met by forces loyal to negus tafari and was defeated at the battle of anchem gugsa welle was killed in action news of gugsa welles defeat and death had hardly spread through addis ababa when the empress died suddenly on  april  although it was long rumored that the empress was poisoned upon the defeat of her husband or alternately that she died from shock upon hearing of the death of her estranged yet beloved husband it has since been documented that the empress succumbed to a flulike fever and complications from diabetes with the passing of zewditu tafari himself rose to emperor and was proclaimed neguse negest zeityoppya king of kings of ethiopia he was crowned on  november  at addis ababas cathedral of st george the coronation was by all accounts a most splendid affair and it was attended by royals and dignitaries from all over the world among those in attendance were george vs son the duke of gloucester marshal franchet desperey of france and the prince of udine representing the king of italy emissaries from the united states egypt turkey sweden belgium and japan were also present british author evelyn waugh was also present penning a contemporary report on the event and american travel lecturer burton holmes shot the only known film footage of the event one newspaper report suggested that the celebration may have incurred a cost in excess of  many of those in attendance received lavish gifts in one instance the christian emperor even sent a goldencased bible to an american bishop who had not attended the coronation but who had dedicated a prayer to the emperor on the day of the coronation haile selassie introduced ethiopias first written constitution on  july  providing for a bicameral legislature the constitution kept power in the hands of the nobility but it did establish democratic standards among the nobility envisaging a transition to democratic rule it would prevail until the people are in a position to elect themselves the constitution limited the succession to the throne to the descendants of haile selassie a point that met with the disapprobation of other dynastic princes including the princes of tigrai and even the emperors loyal cousin ras kassa haile darge in  the sultanate of jimma was formally absorbed into ethiopia following the death of sultan abba jifar ii of jimma conflict with italyedit see also abyssinia crisis and second italoabyssinian war ethiopia became the target of renewed italian imperialist designs in the s benito mussolinis fascist regime was keen to avenge the military defeats italy had suffered to ethiopia in the first italoabyssinian war and to efface the failed attempt by liberal italy to conquer the country as epitomised by the defeat at adwa a conquest of ethiopia could also empower the cause of fascism and embolden its rhetoric of empire ethiopia would also provide a bridge between italys eritrean and italian somaliland possessions ethiopias position in the league of nations did not dissuade the italians from invading in  the collective security envisaged by the league proved useless and a scandal erupted when the hoarelaval pact revealed that ethiopias league allies were scheming to appease italy mobilizationedit following the  december  italian invasion of ethiopia at walwal ogeden province haile selassie joined his northern armies and set up headquarters at desse in wollo province he issued his mobilization order on  october  if you withhold from your country ethiopia the death from cough or headcold of which you would otherwise die refusing to resist in your district in your patrimony and in your home our enemy who is coming from a distant country to attack us and if you persist in not shedding your blood you will be rebuked for it by your creator and will be cursed by your offspring hence without cooling your heart of accustomed valour there emerges your decision to fight fiercely mindful of your history that will last far into the future… if on your march you touch any property inside houses or cattle and crops outside not even grass straw and dung excluded it is like killing your brother who is dying with you… you countryman living at the various access routes set up a market for the army at the places where it is camping and on the day your districtgovernor will indicate to you lest the soldiers campaigning for ethiopias liberty should experience difficulty you will not be charged excise duty until the end of the campaign for anything you are marketing at the military camps i have granted you remission… after you have been ordered to go to war but are then idly missing from the campaign and when you are seized by the local chief or by an accuser you will have punishment inflicted upon your inherited land your property and your body to the accuser i shall grant a third of your property… on  october  haile selassie gave more precise orders for his army to his commanderinchief ras kassa when you set up tents it is to be in caves and by trees and in a wood if the place happens to be adjoining to these―and separated in the various platoons tents are to be set up at a distance of  cubits from each other when an aeroplane is sighted one should leave large open roads and wide meadows and march in valleys and trenches and by zigzag routes along places which have trees and woods when an aeroplane comes to drop bombs it will not suit it to do so unless it comes down to about  metres hence when it flies low for such action one should fire a volley with a good and very long gun and then quickly disperse when three or four bullets have hit it the aeroplane is bound to fall down but let only those fire who have been ordered to shoot with a weapon that has been selected for such firing for if everyone shoots who possesses a gun there is no advantage in this except to waste bullets and to disclose the mens whereabouts lest the aeroplane when rising again should detect the whereabouts of those who are dispersed it is well to remain cautiously scattered as long as it is still fairly close in time of war it suits the enemy to aim his guns at adorned shields ornaments silver and gold cloaks silk shirts and all similar things whether one possesses a jacket or not it is best to wear a narrowsleeved shirt with faded colours when we return with gods help you can wear your gold and silver decorations then now it is time to go and fight we offer you all these words of advice in the hope that no great harm should befall you through lack of caution at the same time we are glad to assure you that in time of war we are ready to shed our blood in your midst for the sake of ethiopias freedom… compared to the ethiopians the italians had an advanced modern military which included a large air force the italians would also come to employ chemical weapons extensively throughout the conflict even targeting red cross field hospitals in violation of the geneva conventions progress of the waredit starting in early october  the italians invaded ethiopia but by november the pace of invasion had slowed appreciably and haile selassies northern armies were able to launch what was known as the christmas offensive during this offensive the italians were forced back in places and put on the defensive in early  the first battle of tembien stopped the progress of the ethiopian offensive and the italians were ready to continue their offensive following the defeat and destruction of the northern ethiopian armies at the battle of amba aradam the second battle of tembien and the battle of shire haile selassie took the field with the last ethiopian army on the northern front on  march  he launched a counterattack against the italians himself at the battle of maychew in southern tigray the emperors army was defeated and retreated in disarray as haile selassies army withdrew the italians attacked from the air along with rebellious raya and azebo tribesmen on the ground who were armed and paid by the italians when the struggle to resist italy appeared doomed haile selassie traveled to the rockhewn churches of lalibela for fasting and prayer haile selassie made a solitary pilgrimage to the churches at lalibela at considerable risk of capture before returning to his capital after a stormy session of the council of state it was agreed that because addis ababa could not be defended the government would relocate to the southern town of gore and that in the interest of preserving the imperial house the emperors wife menen asfaw and the rest of the imperial family should immediately depart for french somaliland and from there continue on to jerusalem exile debateedit the emperor arrives in jerusalem may  after further debate as to whether haile selassie should go to gore or accompany his family into exile it was agreed that he should leave ethiopia with his family and present the case of ethiopia to the league of nations at geneva the decision was not unanimous and several participants including the nobleman blatta tekle wolde hawariat strenuously objected to the idea of an ethiopian monarch fleeing before an invading force haile selassie appointed his cousin ras imru haile selassie as prince regent in his absence departing with his family for french somaliland on  may  on  may marshal pietro badoglio led italian troops into addis ababa and mussolini declared ethiopia an italian province victor emanuel iii was proclaimed as the new emperor of ethiopia on the previous day the ethiopian exiles had left french somaliland aboard the british cruiser hms enterprise they were bound for jerusalem in the british mandate of palestine where the ethiopian royal family maintained a residence the imperial family disembarked at haifa and then went on to jerusalem once there haile selassie and his retinue prepared to make their case at geneva the choice of jerusalem was highly symbolic since the solomonic dynasty claimed descent from the house of david leaving the holy land haile selassie and his entourage sailed aboard the british cruiser hms capetown for gibraltar where he stayed at the rock hotel from gibraltar the exiles were transferred to an ordinary liner by doing this the government of the united kingdom was spared the expense of a state reception collective security and the league of nations edit mussolini upon invading ethiopia had promptly declared his own italian empire because the league of nations afforded haile selassie the opportunity to address the assembly italy even withdrew its league delegation on  may  it was in this context that haile selassie walked into the hall of the league of nations introduced by the president of the assembly as his imperial majesty the emperor of ethiopia sa majesté imperiale lempereur dethiopie the introduction caused a great many italian journalists in the galleries to erupt into jeering heckling and whistling as it turned out they had earlier been issued whistles by mussolinis soninlaw count galeazzo ciano the romanian delegate nicolae titulescu famously jumped to his feet in response and cried show the savages the door and they were cleared out haile selassie waited calmly for the hall to be cleared and responded majestically with a speech sometimes consideredby whom among the most stirring of the th century although fluent in french the working language of the league haile selassie chose to deliver his historic speech in his native amharic he asserted that because his confidence in the league was absolute his people were now being slaughtered he pointed out that the same european states that found in ethiopias favor at the league of nations were refusing ethiopia credit and matériel while aiding italy which was employing chemical weapons on military and civilian targets alike it was at the time when the operations for the encircling of makale were taking place that the italian command fearing a rout followed the procedure which it is now my duty to denounce to the world special sprayers were installed on board aircraft so that they could vaporize over vast areas of territory a fine deathdealing rain groups of nine fifteen eighteen aircraft followed one another so that the fog issuing from them formed a continuous sheet it was thus that as from the end of january  soldiers women children cattle rivers lakes and pastures were drenched continually with this deadly rain in order to kill off systematically all living creatures in order to more surely poison waters and pastures the italian command made its aircraft pass over and over again that was its chief method of warfare noting that his own small people of  million inhabitants without arms without resources could never withstand an attack by a large power such as italy with its  million people and unlimited quantities of the most deathdealing weapons he contended that all small states were threatened by the aggression and that all small states were in effect reduced to vassal states in the absence of collective action he admonished the league that god and history will remember your judgment it is collective security it is the very existence of the league of nations it is the confidence that each state is to place in international treaties… in a word it is international morality that is at stake have the signatures appended to a treaty value only in so far as the signatory powers have a personal direct and immediate interest involved the speech made the emperor an icon for antifascists around the world and time named him man of the year he failed however to get what he most needed the league agreed to only partial and ineffective sanctions on italy only six nations in  did not recognize italys occupation they were china new zealand the soviet union the republic of spain mexico and the united states exileedit haile selassie in  haile selassie spent his exile years – in bath england in fairfield house which he bought the emperor and kassa haile darge took morning walks together behind the high walls of the room georgian house haile selassies favorite reading was diplomatic history but most of his serious hours were occupied with the word story of his life that he was laboriously writing in amharic prior to fairfield house he briefly stayed at warnes hotel in worthing and in parkside wimbledon a bust of haile selassie is in nearby cannizaro park to commemorate this time and is a popular place of pilgrimage for londons rastafari community haile selassie stayed at the abbey hotel in malvern in the s and his granddaughters and daughters of court officials were educated at clarendon school in north malvern during his time in malvern he attended services at holy trinity church in link top a blue plaque commemorating his stay in malvern was unveiled on saturday  june  as part of the ceremony a delegation from the rastafari movement gave a short address and a drum recital haile selassies activity in this period was focused on countering italian propaganda as to the state of ethiopian resistance and the legality of the occupation he spoke out against the desecration of houses of worship and historical artifacts including the theft of a yearold imperial obelisk and condemned the atrocities suffered by the ethiopian civilian population he continued to plead for league intervention and to voice his certainty that gods judgment will eventually visit the weak and the mighty alike though his attempts to gain support for the struggle against italy were largely unsuccessful until italy entered world war ii on the german side in june  the emperors pleas for international support did take root in the united states particularly among africanamerican organizations sympathetic to the ethiopian cause in  haile selassie was to give a christmas day radio address to the american people to thank his supporters when his taxi was involved in a traffic accident leaving him with a fractured knee rather than canceling the radio appearance he proceeded in much pain to complete the address in which he linked christianity and goodwill with the covenant of the league of nations and asserted that war is not the only means to stop war with the birth of the son of god an unprecedented an unrepeatable and a longanticipated phenomenon occurred he was born in a stable instead of a palace in a manger instead of a crib the hearts of the wise men were struck by fear and wonder due to his majestic humbleness the kings prostrated themselves before him and worshipped him peace be to those who have good will this became the first message although the toils of wise people may earn them respect it is a fact of life that the spirit of the wicked continues to cast its shadow on this world the arrogant are seen visibly leading their people into crime and destruction the laws of the league of nations are constantly violated and wars and acts of aggression repeatedly take place… so that the spirit of the cursed will not gain predominance over the human race whom christ redeemed with his blood all peaceloving people should cooperate to stand firm in order to preserve and promote lawfulness and peace during this period haile selassie suffered several personal tragedies his two sonsinlaw ras desta damtew and dejazmach beyene merid were both executed by the italians the emperors daughter princess romanework wife of dejazmach beyene merid was herself taken into captivity with her children and she died in italy in  his daughter tsehai died during childbirth shortly after the restoration in  after his return to ethiopia he donated fairfield house to the city of bath as a residence for the aged until modified in the s where it is now used as a day care centre advanced negotiations are progressing for a community group to run the house to preserve and develop the house s and sedit newspaper illustration drawn by charles h alston for the us office of war information domestic operations branch news bureau  meeting with crown prince akihito in

colonial troops under the gideon force of colonel orde wingate coordinated the military effort to liberate ethiopia the emperor himself issued several imperial proclamations in this period demonstrating that while authority was not divided up in any formal way british military might and the emperors populist appeal could be joined in the concerted effort to liberate ethiopia on  january  during the east african campaign haile selassie crossed the border between sudan and ethiopia near the village of um iddla the standard of the lion of judah was raised again two days later he and a force of ethiopian patriots joined gideon force which was already in ethiopia and preparing the way italy was defeated by a force of the united kingdom the commonwealth of nations free france free belgium and ethiopian patriots on  may  haile selassie entered addis ababa and personally addressed the ethiopian people five years to the day since his  exile today is the day on which we defeated our enemy therefore when we say let us rejoice with our hearts let not our rejoicing be in any other way but in the spirit of christ do not return evil for evil do not indulge in the atrocities which the enemy has been practicing in his usual way even to the last take care not to spoil the good name of ethiopia by acts which are worthy of the enemy we shall see that our enemies are disarmed and sent out the same way they came as saint george who killed the dragon is the patron saint of our army as well as of our allies let us unite with our allies in everlasting friendship and amity in order

provide for ethnic linguistic and cultural balance while ethiopia was to manage its finances defense and foreign policy despite his centralization policies that had been made before world war ii haile selassie still found himself unable to push for all the programs he wanted in  he attempted to institute a progressive tax scheme but this failed due to opposition from the nobility and only a flat tax was passed in  he agreed to reduce this as well ethiopia was still semifeudal and the emperors attempts to alter its social and economic form by reforming its modes of taxation met with resistance from the nobility and clergy which were eager to resume their privileges in the postwar era where haile selassie actually did succeed in effecting new land taxes the burdens were often passed by the landowners to the peasants despite his wishes the tax burden remained primarily on the peasants between  and  haile selassie worked to establish the autocephaly of the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church the ethiopian orthodox church had been headed by the abuna a bishop who answered to the pope of the coptic orthodox church of alexandria in  and  haile selassie applied to the holy synod of the coptic orthodox church to establish the independence of ethiopian bishops and when his appeals were denied he threatened to sever relations with the coptic church of alexandria finally in  pope kyrillos vi elevated the abuna to patriarchcatholicos the ethiopian church remained affiliated with the alexandrian church in addition to these efforts haile selassie changed the ethiopian churchstate relationship by introducing taxation of church lands and by restricting the legal privileges of the clergy who had formerly been tried in their own courts for civil offenses in keeping with the principle of collective security for which he was an outspoken proponent he sent a contingent under general mulugueta bulli known as the kagnew battalion to take part in the korean war by supporting the united nations command it was attached to the american th infantry division and fought in a number of engagements including the battle of pork chop hill in a  speech the emperor spoke of ethiopian participation in the korean war as a redemption of the principles of collective security nearly two decades ago i personally assumed before history the responsibility of placing the fate of my beloved people on the issue of collective security for surely at that time and for the first time in world history that issue was posed in all its clarity my searching of conscience convinced me of the rightness of my course and if after untold sufferings and indeed unaided resistance at the time of aggression we now see the final vindication of that principle in our joint action in korea i can only be thankful that god gave me strength to persist in our faith until the moment of its recent glorious vindication haile selassie emperor of ethiopia photographed during a radio broadcast during the celebrations of his silver jubilee in november  haile selassie introduced a revised constitution whereby he retained effective power while extending political participation to the people by allowing the lower house of parliament to become an elected body party politics were not provided for modern educational methods were more widely spread throughout the empire and the country embarked on a development scheme and plans for modernization tempered by ethiopian traditions and within the framework of the ancient monarchical structure of the state haile selassie compromised when practical with the traditionalists in the nobility and church he also tried to improve relations between the state and ethnic groups and granted autonomy to afar lands that were difficult to control still his reforms to end feudalism were slow and weakened by the compromises he made with the entrenched aristocracy the revised constitution of  has been criticized for reasserting the indisputable power of the monarch and maintaining the relative powerlessness of the peasants charitable gestureedit he sent aid to the british government in  when britain was affected by heavy flooding his letter to lord meork national distress fund london said even though we are busy of helping our people who didnt recover from the crises of the war we heard that your fertile and beautiful country is devastated by

congo peacekeeping force during the  congo crisis to preserve congolese integrity per united nations security council resolution  on  december  while haile selassie was on a state visit to brazil his imperial guard forces staged an unsuccessful coup briefly proclaiming haile selassies eldest son asfa wossen as emperor the coup détat was crushed by the regular army and police forces the coup attempt lacked broad popular support was denounced by the ethiopian orthodox church and was unpopular with the army air force and police nonetheless the effort to depose the emperor had support among students and the educated classes the coup attempt has been characterized as a pivotal moment in ethiopian history the point at which ethiopians for the first time questioned the power of the king to rule without the peoples consent student populations began to empathize with the peasantry and poor and to advocate on their behalf the coup spurred haile selassie to accelerate reform which was manifested in the form of land grants to military and police officials the emperor continued to be a staunch ally of the west while pursuing a firm policy of decolonization in africa which was still largely under european colonial rule the united nations conducted a lengthy inquiry regarding the status of eritrea with the superpowers each vying for a stake in the states future britain the administrator at the time suggested the partition of eritrea between sudan and ethiopia separating christians and muslims the idea was instantly rejected by eritrean political parties as well as the un a un plebiscite voted  to  to have eritrea be federated with ethiopia which was later stipulated on  december  in resolution  v eritrea would have its own parliament and administration and would be represented in what had been the ethiopian parliament and would become the federal parliament haile selassie would have none of european attempts to draft a separate constitution under which eritrea would be governed and wanted his own  constitution protecting families to apply in both ethiopia and eritrea in  the year eritrean struggle for independence began followed by haile selassies

proposition later taken up by muammar gaddafi on  october  haile selassie addressed the general assembly of the united nations referring in his address to his earlier speech to the league of nations twentyseven years ago as emperor of ethiopia i mounted the rostrum in geneva switzerland to address the league of nations and to appeal for relief from the destruction which had been unleashed against my defenceless nation by the fascist invader i spoke then both to and for the conscience of the world my words went unheeded but history testifies to the accuracy of the warning that i gave in  today i stand before the world organization which has succeeded to the mantle discarded by its discredited predecessor in this body is enshrined the principle of collective security which i unsuccessfully invoked at geneva here in this assembly reposes the best – perhaps the last – hope for the peaceful survival of mankind on  november  the emperor was among other heads of state including frances president charles de gaulle who traveled to washington dc and attended the funeral of assassinated president john f kennedy in  haile selassie attempted to create a modern progressive taxcitation needed that included registration of land which would significantly weaken the nobility even with alterations this law led to a revolt in gojjam which was repressed although enforcement of the tax was abandoned the revolt having achieved its design in undermining the tax encouraged other landowners to defy haile selassie haile selassie on a state visit to washington  while he had fully approved of and assured ethiopias participation in unapproved collective security operations including korea and congo haile selassie drew a distinction with the nonun approved foreign intervention in indochina and consistently deplored it as needless suffering calling for the vietnam war to end on several occasions at the same time he remained open toward the united states and commended it for making progress with african americans civil rights legislation in the s and s while visiting the us several times during these years in  he visited montreal canada to open the ethiopian pavilion at the expo  worlds fair where he received great acclaim amongst other world leaders there for the occasion student unrest became a regular feature of ethiopian life in the s and s marxism took root in large segments of the ethiopian intelligentsia particularly among those who had studied abroad and had thus been exposed to radical and leftwing sentiments that were becoming popular in other parts of the globe resistance by conservative elements at the imperial court and parliament and by the ethiopian orthodox church made haile selassies land reform proposals difficult to implement and also damaged the standing of the government costing haile selassie much of the goodwill he had once enjoyed this bred resentment among the peasant population efforts to weaken unions also hurt his image as these issues began to pile up haile selassie left much of domestic governance to his prime minister aklilu habte wold and concentrated more on foreign affairs sedit haile selassie i in toledo spain in april  picture by eduardo butragueño outside of ethiopia haile selassie continued to enjoy enormous prestige and respect as the longestserving head of state in power he was often given precedence over other leaders at state events such as the state funerals of john f kennedy and charles de gaulle the summits of the nonaligned movement and the  celebration of the  years of the persian empire in  he visited italy as a guest of president giuseppe saragat and in milan he met giordano dellamore president of italian savings banks association he visited china in october  and was the first foreign head of state to meet mao zedong following the death of maos designated successor lin biao in a plane crash in mongolia human rights in ethiopia under selassies regime were poor civil liberties and political rights were low with freedom house giving ethiopia a not free score for both civil liberties and political rights in the last years of selassies rule common human right abuses included imprisonment and torture of political prisoners and very poor prison conditions the ethiopian army also carried out a number of these atrocities while fighting the eritrean separatists this was due to a policy of destroying eritrean villages that supported the rebels there were a number of mass killings of hundreds of civilians during the war in the late s and early s wollo famineedit famine—mostly in wollo northeastern ethiopia as well as in some parts of tigray—is estimated to have killed  to  ethiopians between  and  a bbc news report has cited a  estimate that  deaths occurred based on a contemporaneous estimate from the ethiopian nutrition institute while this figure is still repeated in some texts and media sources it was an estimate that was later found to be overpessimistic although the region is infamous for recurrent crop failures and continuous food shortage and starvation risk this episode was remarkably severe a  production of the itv programme the unknown famine by jonathan dimbleby relied on the unverified estimate of  dead stimulating a massive influx of aid while at the same time destabilizing haile selassies regime against that background a group of dissident army officers instigated a creeping coup against the emperors faltering regime to guard against a public backlash in favour of haile selassie who was still widely revered they contrived to obtain a copy of the unknown famine which they intercut with images of africas grand old man presiding at a wedding feast in the grounds of his palace retitled the hidden hunger it was shown round the clock on ethiopian television to coincide with the day that they finally summoned the nerve to seize the emperor himself the  oil crisis the severity of which is demonstrated by this graph hit ethiopia amidst a devastating famine compounding its effect and undermining support for the emperor some reports suggest that the emperor was unaware of the extent of the famine while others assert that he was well aware of it in addition to the exposure of attempts by corrupt local officials to cover up the famine from the imperial government the kremlins depiction of haile selassies ethiopia as backwards and inept relative to the purported utopia of marxismleninism contributed to the popular uprising that led to its downfall and the rise of mengistu haile mariam the famine and its image in the media undermined popular support of the government and haile selassies once unassailable personal popularity fell the crisis was exacerbated by military mutinies and high oil prices the latter a result of the  oil crisis the international economic crisis triggered by the oil crisis caused the costs of imported goods gasoline and food to skyrocket while unemployment spiked revolutionedit in february  four days of serious riots in addis ababa against a sudden economic inflation left five dead the emperor responded by announcing on national television a reduction in petrol prices and a freeze on the cost of basic commodities this calmed the public but the promised  military wage hike was not substantial enough to pacify the army which then mutinied beginning in asmara and spreading throughout the empire this mutiny led to the resignation of prime minister aklilu habtewold on  february  haile selassie again went on television to agree to the armys demands for still greater pay and named endelkachew makonnen as his new prime minister despite endalkatchews many concessions discontent continued in march with a fourday general strike that paralyzed the nation imprisonmentedit

general aman mikael andom a protestant of eritrean origin served briefly as provisional head of state pending the return of crown prince asfa wossen who was then receiving medical treatment abroad haile selassie was placed under house arrest briefly at the th army division in addis ababa while most of his family was detained at the late duke of harars residence in the north of the capital the last months of the emperors life were spent in imprisonment in the grand palace reportedly his mental condition was such that he believed he was still emperor of ethiopia later most of the imperial family was imprisoned in the addis ababa prison kerchele also known as alem bekagne or ive had enough of this world on  november  sixty former high officials of the imperial government were executed without trial the executed included haile selassies grandson and two former prime ministers these killings known to ethiopians as bloody saturday were condemned by crown prince asfa wossen the derg

exmonarch haile selassie had died on  august of respiratory failure following complications from a prostate examination followed up by a prostate operation his doctor asrat woldeyes denied that complications had occurred and rejected the government version of his deathcitation needed some imperial loyalists believed that the emperor had in fact been assassinated and this belief remains widely held to this day one western correspondent in ethiopia at the time commented while it is not known what actually happened there are strong indications that no efforts were made to save him it is unlikely that he was actually killed such rumors were bound to arise no matter what happened given the atmosphere of suspicion and distrust prevailing in addis ababa at the time the sovietbacked derg fell in  in  the emperors bones were found under a concrete slab on the palace grounds some reports suggest that his remains were discovered beneath a latrine for almost a decade thereafter as ethiopian courts attempted to sort out the circumstances of his death his coffin rested in bhata church near his greatuncle menelik iis resting place on  november  haile selassie was given an imperialstyle funeral by the ethiopian orthodox church the postcommunist government refused calls to declare the ceremony an official imperial funeral although such prominent rastafari figures as rita

diaspora to freedom his official titles are conquering lion of the tribe of judah and king of kings of ethiopia and elect of god and his traditional lineage is thought to be from solomon and sheba these notions are perceived by rastafari as confirmation of the return of the messiah in the prophetic book of revelation in the new testament king of kings lord of lords conquering lion of the tribe of judah and root of david rastafari faith in the incarnate divinity of haile selassie began after news reports of his coronation reached jamaica particularly via the two time magazine articles on the coronation the week before and the week after the event haile selassies own perspectives permeate the philosophy of the movement in  the jamaican government sent a delegation composed of both rastafari and nonrastafari leaders to ethiopia to discuss the matter of repatriation among other issues with the emperor he reportedly told the rastafari delegation which included mortimer planno tell the brethren to be not dismayed i personally will give my assistance in the matter of repatriation haile selassie visited jamaica on  april  and approximately one hundred thousand rastafari from all over jamaica descended on palisadoes airport in kingston having heard that the man whom they considered to be their messiah was coming to visit them spliffs and chalices were openly smoked causing a haze of ganja smoke to drift through the air haile selassie arrived at the airport but was unable to come down the mobile steps of the airplane as the crowd rushed the tarmac he then returned into the plane disappearing for several more minutes finally jamaican authorities were obliged to request ras mortimer planno a wellknown rasta leader to climb the steps enter the plane and negotiate the emperors descent planno reemerged and announced to the crowd the emperor has instructed me to tell you to be calm step back and let the emperor land this day is widely held by scholars to be a major turning point for the movement and it is still commemorated by rastafari as grounation day the anniversary of which is celebrated as the second holiest holiday after  november the emperors coronation day from then on as a result of plannos actions the jamaican authorities were asked to ensure that rastafari representatives were present at all state functions attended by the emperor and rastafari elders also ensured that they obtained a private audience with the emperor where he reportedly told them that they should not emigrate to ethiopia until they had first liberated the people of jamaica this dictum came to be known as liberation before repatriation haile selassie defied expectations of the jamaican authorities and never rebuked the rastafari for their belief in him as the returned jesus instead he presented the movements faithful elders with gold medallions – the only recipients of such an honor on this visit during pnp leader later jamaican prime minister michael manleys visit to ethiopia in october  the emperor allegedly still recalled his  reception with amazement and stated that he felt that he had to be respectful of their beliefs this was the visit when manley received the rod of correction or rod of joshua as a present from the emperor which is thought to have helped him to win the  election in jamaica rita marley bob marleys wife converted to the rastafari faith after seeing haile selassie on his jamaican trip she claimed in interviews and in her book no woman no cry that she saw a stigmata print on the palm of haile selassies hand as he waved to the crowd which resembled the markings on christs hands from being nailed to the cross—a claim that was not supported by other sources but was used as evidence for her and other rastafari to suggest that haile selassie i was indeed their messiah she was also influential in the conversion of bob marley who then became internationally recognized as a result rastafari became much better known throughout much of the world bob marleys posthumously released song iron lion zion refers to haile selassie question of his divinityedit in a  recorded interview haile selassie appeared to deny his alleged divinity in the interview bill mcneil says there are millions of christians throughout the world your imperial majesty who regard you as the reincarnation of jesus christ selassie replied in his native language i have heard of that idea i also met certain rastafarians i told them clearly that i am a man that i am mortal and that i will be replaced by the oncoming generation and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity for many rastafari the cbc interview is not interpreted as a denial of his divinity and according to robert earl hood haile selassie neither denied nor affirmed his divinity either way in reggae routes the story of jamaican music kevin chang and wayne chen note its often said though no definite date is ever cited that haile selassie himself denied his divinity former senator and gleaner editor hector wynter tells of asking him during his visit to jamaica in  when he was going to tell rastafari he was not god who am i to disturb their belief replied the emperor after his return to ethiopia he dispatched archbishop abuna yesehaq mandefro to the caribbean to help draw rastafari and other west indians to the ethiopian church and according to some sources denied his divinity in  haile selassie donated a piece of land at shashamane  km south of addis ababa for the use of people of african descent from

referring to him as jah jah jah jah rastafari and him the abbreviation of his imperial majesty biographyedit early lifeedit ras makonnen woldemikael and his son lij tafari makonnen haile selassies royal line through his fathers mother originated from the amhara people he was born on  july  in the village of ejersa goro in the harar province of ethiopia his mother was woizero lady yeshimebet ali abba jifar daughter of the renowned oromo ruler of wollo province dejazmach ali abba jifar his maternal grandmother was of gurage heritage tafaris father was ras makonnen woldemikael gudessa the governor of harar ras makonnen served as a general in the first italo–ethiopian war playing a key role at the battle of adwa he too was paternally oromo but maternally amhara haile selassie was thus able to ascend to the imperial throne through his paternal grandmother woizero tenagnework sahle selassie who was an aunt of emperor menelik ii and daughter of negus sahle selassie of shewa as such haile selassie claimed direct descent from makeda the queen of sheba and king solomon of ancient israel ras makonnen arranged for tafari as well as his first cousin imru haile selassie to receive instruction in harar from abba samuel wolde kahin an ethiopian capuchin monk and from dr vitalien a surgeon from guadeloupe tafari was named dejazmach literally commander of the gate roughly equivalent to count at the age of  on  november  shortly thereafter his father ras makonnen died at kulibi in  governorshipedit dejazmatch tafari as governor of harar tafari assumed the titular governorship of selale in  a realm of marginal importance but one that enabled him to continue his studies in  he was appointed governor over part of the province of sidamo it is alleged that during his late teens haile selassie was married to woizero altayech and that from this union his daughter princess romanework was born following the death of his brother yelma in  the governorate of harar was left vacant and its administration was left to meneliks loyal general dejazmach balcha safo balcha safos administration of harar was ineffective and so during the last illness of menelik ii and the brief reign of empress taitu bitul tafari was made governor of harar in  or  on  august he married menen asfaw of ambassel niece of heir to the throne lij iyasu regencyedit the extent to which tafari makonnen contributed to the movement that would come to depose iyasu v has been discussed extensively particularly in haile selassies own detailed account of the matter iyasu v or lij iyasu was the designated but uncrowned emperor of ethiopia from  to  iyasus reputation for scandalous behavior and a disrespectful attitude towards the nobles at the court of his grandfather menelik ii damaged his reputation iyasus flirtation with islam was considered treasonous among the ethiopian orthodox christian leadership of the empire on  september  iyasu was deposed contributing to the movement that deposed iyasu were conservatives such as fitawrari habte giyorgis menelik iis longtime minister of war the movement to depose iyasu preferred tafari as he attracted support from both progressive and conservative factions ultimately iyasu was deposed on the grounds of conversion to islam in his place the daughter of menelik ii the aunt of iyasu was named empress zewditu while tafari was elevated to the rank of ras and was made heir apparent and crown prince in the power arrangement that followed tafari accepted the role of regent plenipotentiary balemulu inderasenb  and became the de facto ruler of the ethiopian empire mangista ityoppya zewditu would govern while tafari would administer empress zewditu with one of her trusted priests while iyasu had been deposed on  september  on  october he managed to escape into the ogaden desert and his father negus mikael of wollo had time to come to his aid on  october negus mikael and his army met an army under fitawrari habte giyorgis loyal to zewditu and tafari during the battle of segale negus mikael was defeated and captured any chance that iyasu would regain the throne was ended and he went into hiding on  january  after avoiding capture for about five years iyasu was taken into custody by gugsa araya selassie on  february  the coronation for zewditu took place she pledged to rule justly through her regent tafari while tafari was the more visible of the two zewditu was far from an honorary ruler her position required that she arbitrate the claims of competing factions in other words she had the last word tafari carried the burden of daily administration but because his position was relatively weak this was often an exercise in futility for him initially his personal army was poorly equipped his finances were limited and he had little leverage to withstand the combined influence of the empress the minister of war or the provincial governors during his regency the new crown prince developed the policy of cautious modernization initiated by menelik ii also during this time he survived the  flu pandemic having come down with the illness he secured ethiopias admission to the league of nations in  by promising to eradicate slavery each emperor since tewodros ii had issued proclamations to halt slavery but without effect the internationally scorned practice persisted well into haile selassies reign with an estimated  million slaves in ethiopia in the early s travel abroadedit in  ras tafari toured europe and the middle east visiting jerusalem alexandria paris brussels amsterdam stockholm london geneva and athens with him on his tour was a group that included ras seyum mangasha of western tigray province ras hailu tekle haymanot of gojjam province ras mulugeta yeggazu of illubabor province ras makonnen endelkachew and blattengeta heruy welde sellase the primary goal of the trip to europe was for ethiopia to gain access to the sea in paris tafari was to find out from the french foreign ministry quai dorsay that this goal would not be realized however failing this he and his retinue inspected schools hospitals factories and churches although patterning many reforms after european models tafari remained wary of european pressure to guard against economic imperialism tafari required that all enterprises have at least partial local ownership of his modernization campaign he remarked we need european progress only because we are surrounded by it that is at once a benefit and a misfortune throughout ras tafaris travels in europe the levant and egypt he and his entourage were greeted with enthusiasm and fascination he was accompanied by seyum mangasha and hailu tekle haymanot who like tafari were sons of generals who contributed to the victorious war against italy a quarter century earlier at the battle of adwa another member of his entourage mulugeta yeggazu actually fought at adwa as a young man the oriental dignity of the ethiopians and their rich picturesque court dress were sensationalized in the media among his entourage he even included a pride of lions which he distributed as gifts to president alexandre millerand and prime minister raymond poincaré of france to king george v of the united kingdom and to the zoological garden jardin zoologique of paris as one historian noted rarely can a tour have inspired so many anecdotes in return for two lions the united kingdom presented ras tafari with the imperial crown of emperor tewodros ii for its safe return to empress zewditu the crown had been taken by robert napier during the  expedition to abyssinia in this period the crown prince visited the armenian monastery of jerusalem there he adopted  armenian orphans አርባ ልጆች arba lijoch forty children who had lost their parents in ottoman massacres ras tafari arranged for the musical education of the youths and they came to form the imperial brass band king and emperoredit see also modernisation of ethiopia under haile selassie i in  the authority of ras tafari makonnen was challenged when dejazmatch balcha safo went to addis ababa with a sizeable armed force when tafari consolidated his hold over the provinces many of meneliks appointees refused to abide by the new regulations balcha safo the governor shum of coffeerich sidamo province was particularly troublesome the revenues he remitted to the central government did not reflect the accrued profits and tafari recalled him to addis ababa the old man came in high dudgeon and insultingly with a large armynb  the dejazmatch paid homage to empress zewditu but snubbed ras tafari on  february while balcha safo and his personal bodyguardnb  were in addis ababa ras tafari had ras kassa haile darge buy off his army and arranged to have him displaced as the shum of sidamo province by birru wolde gabriel who himself was replaced by desta damtew cover of time magazine  november  even so the gesture of balcha safo empowered empress zewditu politically and she attempted to have tafari tried for treason he was tried for his benevolent dealings with italy including a year peace accord which was signed on  august in september a group of palace reactionaries including some courtiers of the empress made a final bid to get rid of tafari the attempted coup détat was tragic in its origins and comic in its end when confronted by tafari and a company of his troops the ringleaders of the coup took refuge on the palace grounds in meneliks mausoleum tafari and his men surrounded them only to be surrounded themselves by the personal guard of zewditu more of tafaris khaki clad soldiers arrived and with superiority of arms decided the outcome in his favor popular support as well as the support of the police remained with tafari ultimately the empress relented and on  october  she crowned tafari as negus amharic king the crowning of tafari as king was controversial he occupied the same territory as the empress rather than going off to a regional kingdom of the empire two monarchs even with one being the vassal and the other the emperor in this case empress had never occupied the same location as their seat in ethiopian history conservatives agitated to redress this perceived insult to the dignity of the crown leading to the rebellion of ras gugsa welle gugsa welle was the husband of the empress and the shum of begemder province in early  he raised an army and marched it from his governorate at gondar towards addis ababa on  march  gugsa welle was met by forces loyal to negus tafari and was defeated at the battle of anchem gugsa welle was killed in action news of gugsa welles defeat and death had hardly spread through addis ababa when the empress died suddenly on  april  although it was long rumored that the empress was poisoned upon the defeat of her husband or alternately that she died from shock upon hearing of the death of her estranged yet beloved husband it has since been documented that the empress succumbed to a flulike fever and complications from diabetes with the passing of zewditu tafari himself rose to emperor and was proclaimed neguse negest zeityoppya king of kings of ethiopia he was crowned on  november  at addis ababas cathedral of st george the coronation was by all accounts a most splendid affair and it was attended by royals and dignitaries from all over the world among those in attendance were george vs son the duke of gloucester marshal franchet desperey of france and the prince of udine representing the king of italy emissaries from the united states egypt turkey sweden belgium and japan were also present british author evelyn waugh was also present penning a contemporary report on the event and american travel lecturer burton holmes shot the only known film footage of the event one newspaper report suggested that the celebration may have incurred a cost in excess of  many of those in attendance received lavish gifts in one instance the christian emperor even sent a goldencased bible to an american bishop who had not attended the coronation but who had dedicated a prayer to the emperor on the day of the coronation haile selassie introduced ethiopias first written constitution on  july  providing for a bicameral legislature the constitution kept power in the hands of the nobility but it did establish democratic standards among the nobility envisaging a transition to democratic rule it would prevail until the people are in a position to elect themselves the constitution limited the succession to the throne to the descendants of haile selassie a point that met with the disapprobation of other dynastic princes including the princes of tigrai and even the emperors loyal cousin ras kassa haile darge in  the sultanate of jimma was formally absorbed into ethiopia following the death of sultan abba jifar ii of jimma conflict with italyedit see also abyssinia crisis and second italoabyssinian war ethiopia became the target of renewed italian imperialist designs in the s benito mussolinis fascist regime was keen to avenge the military defeats italy had suffered to ethiopia in the first italoabyssinian war and to efface the failed attempt by liberal italy to conquer the country as epitomised by the defeat at adwa a conquest of ethiopia could also empower the cause of fascism and embolden its rhetoric of empire ethiopia would also provide a bridge between italys eritrean and italian somaliland possessions ethiopias position in the league of nations did not dissuade the italians from invading in  the collective security envisaged by the league proved useless and a scandal erupted when the hoarelaval pact revealed that ethiopias league allies were scheming to appease italy mobilizationedit following the  december  italian invasion of ethiopia at walwal ogeden province haile selassie joined his northern armies and set up headquarters at desse in wollo province he issued his mobilization order on  october  if you withhold from your country ethiopia the death from cough or headcold of which you would otherwise die refusing to resist in your district in your patrimony and in your home our enemy who is coming from a distant country to attack us and if you persist in not shedding your blood you will be rebuked for it by your creator and will be cursed by your offspring hence without cooling your heart of accustomed valour there emerges your decision to fight fiercely mindful of your history that will last far into the future… if on your march you touch any property inside houses or cattle and crops outside not even grass straw and dung excluded it is like killing your brother who is dying with you… you countryman living at the various access routes set up a market for the army at the places where it is camping and on the day your districtgovernor will indicate to you lest the soldiers campaigning for ethiopias liberty should experience difficulty you will not be charged excise duty until the end of the campaign for anything you are marketing at the military camps i have granted you remission… after you have been ordered to go to war but are then idly missing from the campaign and when you are seized by the local chief or by an accuser you will have punishment inflicted upon your inherited land your property and your body to the accuser i shall grant a third of your property… on  october  haile selassie gave more precise orders for his army to his commanderinchief ras kassa when you set up tents it is to be in caves and by trees and in a wood if the place happens to be adjoining to these―and separated in the various platoons tents are to be set up at a distance of  cubits from each other when an aeroplane is sighted one should leave large open roads and wide meadows and march in valleys and trenches and by zigzag routes along places which have trees and woods when an aeroplane comes to drop bombs it will not suit it to do so unless it comes down to about  metres hence when it flies low for such action one should fire a volley with a good and very long gun and then quickly disperse when three or four bullets have hit it the aeroplane is bound to fall down but let only those fire who have been ordered to shoot with a weapon that has been selected for such firing for if everyone shoots who possesses a gun there is no advantage in this except to waste bullets and to disclose the mens whereabouts lest the aeroplane when rising again should detect the whereabouts of those who are dispersed it is well to remain cautiously scattered as long as it is still fairly close in time of war it suits the enemy to aim his guns at adorned shields ornaments silver and gold cloaks silk shirts and all similar things whether one possesses a jacket or not it is best to wear a narrowsleeved shirt with faded colours when we return with gods help you can wear your gold and silver decorations then now it is time to go and fight we offer you all these words of advice in the hope that no great harm should befall you through lack of caution at the same time we are glad to assure you that in time of war we are ready to shed our blood in your midst for the sake of ethiopias freedom… compared to the ethiopians the italians had an advanced modern military which included a large air force the italians would also come to employ chemical weapons extensively throughout the conflict even targeting red cross field hospitals in violation of the geneva conventions progress of the waredit starting in early october  the italians invaded ethiopia but by november the pace of invasion had slowed appreciably and haile selassies northern armies were able to launch what was known as the christmas offensive during this offensive the italians were forced back in places and put on the defensive in early  the first battle of tembien stopped the progress of the ethiopian offensive and the italians were ready to continue their offensive following the defeat and destruction of the northern ethiopian armies at the battle of amba aradam the second battle of tembien and the battle of shire haile selassie took the field with the last ethiopian army on the northern front on  march  he launched a counterattack against the italians himself at the battle of maychew in southern tigray the emperors army was defeated and retreated in disarray as haile selassies army withdrew the italians attacked from the air along with rebellious raya and azebo tribesmen on the ground who were armed and paid by the italians when the struggle to resist italy appeared doomed haile selassie traveled to the rockhewn churches of lalibela for fasting and prayer haile selassie made a solitary pilgrimage to the churches at lalibela at considerable risk of capture before returning to his capital after a stormy session of the council of state it was agreed that because addis ababa could not be defended the government would relocate to the southern town of gore and that in the interest of preserving the imperial house the emperors wife menen asfaw and the rest of the imperial family should immediately depart for french somaliland and from there continue on to jerusalem exile debateedit the emperor arrives in jerusalem may  after further debate as to whether haile selassie should go to gore or accompany his family into exile it was agreed that he should leave ethiopia with his family and present the case of ethiopia to the league of nations at geneva the decision was not unanimous and several participants including the nobleman blatta tekle wolde hawariat strenuously objected to the idea of an ethiopian monarch fleeing before an invading force haile selassie appointed his cousin ras imru haile selassie as prince regent in his absence departing with his family for french somaliland on  may  on  may marshal pietro badoglio led italian troops into addis ababa and mussolini declared ethiopia an italian province victor emanuel iii was proclaimed as the new emperor of ethiopia on the previous day the ethiopian exiles had left french somaliland aboard the british cruiser hms enterprise they were bound for jerusalem in the british mandate of palestine where the ethiopian royal family maintained a residence the imperial family disembarked at haifa and then went on to jerusalem once there haile selassie and his retinue prepared to make their case at geneva the choice of jerusalem was highly symbolic since the solomonic dynasty claimed descent from the house of david leaving the holy land haile selassie and his entourage sailed aboard the british cruiser hms capetown for gibraltar where he stayed at the rock hotel from gibraltar the exiles were transferred to an ordinary liner by doing this the government of the united kingdom was spared the expense of a state reception collective security and the league of nations edit mussolini upon invading ethiopia had promptly declared his own italian empire because the league of nations afforded haile selassie the opportunity to address the assembly italy even withdrew its league delegation on  may  it was in this context that haile selassie walked into the hall of the league of nations introduced by the president of the assembly as his imperial majesty the emperor of ethiopia sa majesté imperiale lempereur dethiopie the introduction caused a great many italian journalists in the galleries to erupt into jeering heckling and whistling as it turned out they had earlier been issued whistles by mussolinis soninlaw count galeazzo ciano the romanian delegate nicolae titulescu famously jumped to his feet in response and cried show the savages the door and they were cleared out haile selassie waited calmly for the hall to be cleared and responded majestically with a speech sometimes consideredby whom among the most stirring of the th century although fluent in french the working language of the league haile selassie chose to deliver his historic speech in his native amharic he asserted that because his confidence in the league was absolute his people were now being slaughtered he pointed out that the same european states that found in ethiopias favor at the league of nations were refusing ethiopia credit and matériel while aiding italy which was employing chemical weapons on military and civilian targets alike it was at the time when the operations for the encircling of makale were taking place that the italian command fearing a rout followed the procedure which it is now my duty to denounce to the world special sprayers were installed on board aircraft so that they could vaporize over vast areas of territory a fine deathdealing rain groups of nine fifteen eighteen aircraft followed one another so that the fog issuing from them formed a continuous sheet it was thus that as from the end of january  soldiers women children cattle rivers lakes and pastures were drenched continually with this deadly rain in order to kill off systematically all living creatures in order to more surely poison waters and pastures the italian command made its aircraft pass over and over again that was its chief method of warfare noting that his own small people of  million inhabitants without arms without resources could never withstand an attack by a large power such as italy with its  million people and unlimited quantities of the most deathdealing weapons he contended that all small states were threatened by the aggression and that all small states were in effect reduced to vassal states in the absence of collective action he admonished the league that god and history will remember your judgment it is collective security it is the very existence of the league of nations it is the confidence that each state is to place in international treaties… in a word it is international morality that is at stake have the signatures appended to a treaty value only in so far as the signatory powers have a personal direct and immediate interest involved the speech made the emperor an icon for antifascists around the world and time named him man of the year he failed however to get what he most needed the league agreed to only partial and ineffective sanctions on italy only six nations in  did not recognize italys occupation they were china new zealand the soviet union the republic of spain mexico and the united states exileedit haile selassie in  haile selassie spent his exile years – in bath england in fairfield house which he bought the emperor and kassa haile darge took morning walks together behind the high walls of the room georgian house haile selassies favorite reading was diplomatic history but most of his serious hours were occupied with the word story of his life that he was laboriously writing in amharic prior to fairfield house he briefly stayed at warnes hotel in worthing and in parkside wimbledon a bust of haile selassie is in nearby cannizaro park to commemorate this time and is a popular place of pilgrimage for londons rastafari community haile selassie stayed at the abbey hotel in malvern in the s and his granddaughters and daughters of court officials were educated at clarendon school in north malvern during his time in malvern he attended services at holy trinity church in link top a blue plaque commemorating his stay in malvern was unveiled on saturday  june  as part of the ceremony a delegation from the rastafari movement gave a short address and a drum recital haile selassies activity in this period was focused on countering italian propaganda as to the state of ethiopian resistance and the legality of the occupation he spoke out against the desecration of houses of worship and historical artifacts including the theft of a yearold imperial obelisk and condemned the atrocities suffered by the ethiopian civilian population he continued to plead for league intervention and to voice his certainty that gods judgment will eventually visit the weak and the mighty alike though his attempts to gain support for the struggle against italy were largely unsuccessful until italy entered world war ii on the german side in june  the emperors pleas for international support did take root in the united states particularly among africanamerican organizations sympathetic to the ethiopian cause in  haile selassie was to give a christmas day radio address to the american people to thank his supporters when his taxi was involved in a traffic accident leaving him with a fractured knee rather than canceling the radio appearance he proceeded in much pain to complete the address in which he linked christianity and goodwill with the covenant of the league of nations and asserted that war is not the only means to stop war with the birth of the son of god an unprecedented an unrepeatable and a longanticipated phenomenon occurred he was born in a stable instead of a palace in a manger instead of a crib the hearts of the wise men were struck by fear and wonder due to his majestic humbleness the kings prostrated themselves before him and worshipped him peace be to those who have good will this became the first message although the toils of wise people may earn them respect it is a fact of life that the spirit of the wicked continues to cast its shadow on this world the arrogant are seen visibly leading their people into crime and destruction the laws of the league of nations are constantly violated and wars and acts of aggression repeatedly take place… so that the spirit of the cursed will not gain predominance over the human race whom christ redeemed with his blood all peaceloving people should cooperate to stand firm in order to preserve and promote lawfulness and peace during this period haile selassie suffered several personal tragedies his two sonsinlaw ras desta damtew and dejazmach beyene merid were both executed by the italians the emperors daughter princess romanework wife of dejazmach beyene merid was herself taken into captivity with her children and she died in italy in  his daughter tsehai died during childbirth shortly after the restoration in  after his return to ethiopia he donated fairfield house to the city of bath as a residence for the aged until modified in the s where it is now used as a day care centre advanced negotiations are progressing for a community group to run the house to preserve

colonial troops under the gideon force of colonel orde wingate coordinated the military effort to liberate ethiopia the emperor himself issued several imperial proclamations in this period demonstrating that while authority was not divided up in any formal way british military might and the emperors populist appeal could be joined in the concerted effort to liberate ethiopia on  january  during the east african campaign haile selassie crossed the border between sudan and ethiopia near the village of um iddla the standard of the lion of judah was raised again two days later he and a force of ethiopian patriots joined gideon force which was already in ethiopia and preparing the way italy was defeated by a force of the united kingdom the commonwealth of nations free france free belgium and ethiopian patriots on  may  haile selassie entered addis ababa and personally addressed the ethiopian people five years to the day since his  exile today is the day on which we defeated our enemy therefore when we say let us rejoice with our hearts let not our rejoicing be in any other way but in the spirit of christ do not return evil for evil do not indulge in the atrocities which the enemy has been practicing in his usual way even to the last take care not to spoil the good name of ethiopia by acts which are worthy of the enemy we shall see that our enemies are disarmed and sent out the same way they came as saint george who killed the dragon is the patron saint of our army as well as of our allies let us unite with our allies in everlasting friendship and amity in order to be able to stand against the godless and cruel dragon which has newly risen and which is oppressing mankind on  august  haile selassie abolished the legal basis of slavery throughout the empire and imposed severe penalties including death for slave trading after world war ii ethiopia became a charter member of the united nations in  the ogaden a region disputed with somalia was granted to ethiopia on  december  the un general assembly adopted resolution  v establishing the federation of eritrea the former italian colony into ethiopia eritrea was to have its own constitution which would provide for ethnic linguistic and cultural balance while ethiopia was to manage its finances defense and foreign policy despite his centralization policies that had been made before world war ii haile selassie still found himself unable to push for all the programs he wanted in  he attempted to institute a progressive tax scheme but this failed due to opposition from the nobility and only a flat tax was passed in  he agreed to reduce this as well ethiopia was still semifeudal and the emperors attempts to alter its social and economic form by reforming its modes of taxation met with resistance from the nobility and clergy which were eager to resume their privileges in the postwar era where haile selassie actually did succeed in effecting new land taxes the burdens were often passed by the landowners to the peasants despite his wishes the tax burden remained primarily on the peasants between  and  haile selassie worked to establish the autocephaly of the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church the ethiopian orthodox church had been headed by the abuna a bishop who answered to the pope of the coptic orthodox church of alexandria in  and  haile selassie applied to the holy synod of the

kyrillos vi elevated the abuna to patriarchcatholicos the ethiopian church remained affiliated with the alexandrian church in addition to these efforts haile selassie changed the ethiopian churchstate relationship by introducing taxation of church lands and by restricting the legal privileges of the clergy who had formerly been tried in their own courts for civil offenses in keeping with the principle of collective security for which he was an outspoken proponent he sent a contingent under general mulugueta bulli known as the kagnew battalion to take part in the korean war by supporting the united nations command it was attached to the american th infantry division and fought in a number of engagements including the battle of pork chop hill in a  speech the emperor spoke of ethiopian participation in the korean war as a redemption of the principles of collective security nearly two decades ago i personally assumed before history the responsibility of placing the fate of my beloved people on the issue of collective security for surely at that time and for the first time in world history that issue was posed in all its clarity my searching of conscience convinced me of the rightness of my course and if after untold sufferings and indeed unaided resistance at the time of aggression we now see the final vindication of that principle in our joint action in korea i can only be thankful that god gave me strength to persist in our faith until the moment of its recent glorious vindication haile selassie emperor of ethiopia photographed during a radio broadcast during the celebrations of his silver jubilee in november  haile selassie introduced a revised constitution whereby he retained effective power while extending political participation to the people by allowing the lower house of parliament to become an elected body party politics were not provided for modern educational methods were more widely spread throughout the empire and the country embarked on a development scheme and plans for modernization tempered by ethiopian traditions and within the framework of the ancient monarchical structure of the state haile selassie compromised when practical with the traditionalists in the nobility and church he also tried to improve relations between the state and ethnic groups and granted autonomy to afar lands that were difficult to control still his reforms to end feudalism were slow and weakened by the compromises he made with the entrenched aristocracy the revised constitution of  has been criticized for reasserting the indisputable power of the monarch and maintaining the relative powerlessness of the peasants charitable gestureedit he sent aid to the british government in  when britain was affected by heavy flooding his letter to lord meork national distress fund london said even though we are busy of helping our people who didnt recover from the crises of the war we heard that your fertile and beautiful country is devastated by

congo peacekeeping force during the  congo crisis to preserve congolese integrity per united nations security council resolution  on  december  while haile selassie was on a state visit to brazil his imperial guard forces staged an unsuccessful coup briefly proclaiming haile selassies eldest son asfa wossen as emperor the coup détat was crushed by the regular army and police forces the coup attempt lacked broad popular support was denounced by the ethiopian orthodox church and was unpopular with the army air force and police nonetheless the effort to depose the emperor had support among students and the educated classes the coup attempt has been characterized as a pivotal moment in ethiopian history the point at which ethiopians for the first time questioned the power of the king to rule without the peoples consent student populations began to empathize with the peasantry and poor and to advocate on their behalf the coup spurred haile selassie to accelerate reform which was manifested in the form of land grants to military and police officials the emperor continued to be a staunch ally of the west while pursuing a firm policy of decolonization in africa which was still largely under european colonial rule the united nations conducted a lengthy inquiry regarding the status of eritrea with the superpowers each vying for a stake in the states future britain the administrator at the time suggested the partition of eritrea between sudan and ethiopia separating christians and muslims the idea was instantly rejected by eritrean political parties as well as the un a un plebiscite voted  to  to have eritrea be federated with ethiopia which was later stipulated on  december  in resolution  v eritrea would have its own parliament and administration and would be represented in what had been the ethiopian parliament and would become the federal parliament haile selassie would have none of european attempts to draft a separate constitution under which eritrea would be governed and wanted his own  constitution protecting families to apply in both ethiopia and eritrea in  the year eritrean struggle for independence began followed by haile selassies

proposition later taken up by muammar gaddafi on  october  haile selassie addressed the general assembly of the united nations referring in his address to his earlier speech to the league of nations twentyseven years ago as emperor of ethiopia i mounted the rostrum in geneva switzerland to address the league of nations and to appeal for relief from the destruction which had been unleashed against my defenceless nation by the fascist invader i spoke then both to and for the conscience of the world my words went unheeded but history testifies to the accuracy of the warning that i gave in  today i stand before the world organization which has succeeded to the mantle discarded by its discredited predecessor in this body is enshrined the principle of collective security which i unsuccessfully

president charles de gaulle who traveled to washington dc and attended the funeral of assassinated president john f kennedy in  haile selassie attempted to create a modern progressive taxcitation needed that included registration of land which would significantly weaken the nobility even with alterations this law led to a revolt in gojjam which was repressed although enforcement of the tax was abandoned the revolt having achieved its design in undermining the tax encouraged other landowners to defy haile selassie haile selassie on a state visit to washington  while he had fully approved of and assured ethiopias participation in unapproved collective security operations including korea and congo haile selassie drew a distinction with the nonun approved foreign intervention in indochina and consistently deplored it as needless suffering calling for the vietnam war to end on several occasions at the same time he remained open toward the united states and commended it for making progress with african americans civil rights legislation in the s and s while visiting the us several times during these years in  he visited montreal canada to open the ethiopian pavilion at the expo  worlds fair where he received great acclaim amongst other world leaders there for the occasion student unrest became a regular feature of ethiopian life in the s and s marxism took root in large segments of the ethiopian intelligentsia particularly among those who had studied abroad and had thus been exposed to radical and leftwing sentiments that were becoming popular in other parts of the globe resistance by conservative elements at the imperial court and parliament and by the ethiopian orthodox church made haile selassies land reform proposals difficult to implement and also damaged the standing of the government costing haile selassie much of the goodwill he had once enjoyed this bred resentment among the peasant population efforts to weaken unions also hurt his image as these issues began to pile up haile selassie left much of domestic governance to his prime minister aklilu habte wold and concentrated more on foreign affairs sedit haile selassie i in toledo spain in april  picture by eduardo butragueño outside of ethiopia haile selassie continued to enjoy enormous prestige and respect as the longestserving head of state in power he was often given precedence over other leaders at state events such as the state funerals of john f kennedy and charles de gaulle the summits of the nonaligned movement and the  celebration of the  years of the persian empire in  he visited italy as a guest of president giuseppe saragat and in milan he met giordano dellamore president of italian savings banks association he visited china in october  and was the first foreign head of state to meet mao zedong following the death of maos designated successor lin biao in a plane crash in mongolia human rights in ethiopia under selassies regime were poor civil liberties and political rights were low with freedom house giving ethiopia a not free score for both civil liberties and political rights in the last years of selassies rule common human right abuses included imprisonment and torture of political prisoners and very poor prison conditions the ethiopian army also carried out a number of these atrocities while fighting the eritrean separatists this was due to a policy of destroying eritrean villages that supported the rebels there were a number of mass killings of hundreds of civilians during the war in the late s and early s wollo famineedit famine—mostly in wollo northeastern ethiopia as well as in some parts of tigray—is estimated to have killed  to  ethiopians between  and  a bbc news report has cited a  estimate that  deaths occurred based on a contemporaneous estimate from the ethiopian nutrition institute while this figure is still repeated in some texts and media sources it was an estimate that was later found to be overpessimistic although the region is infamous for recurrent crop failures and continuous food shortage and starvation risk this episode was remarkably severe a  production of the itv programme the unknown famine by jonathan dimbleby relied on the unverified estimate of  dead stimulating a massive influx of aid while at the same time destabilizing haile selassies regime against that background a group of dissident army officers instigated a creeping coup against the emperors faltering regime to guard against a public backlash in favour of haile selassie who was still widely revered they contrived to obtain a copy of the unknown famine which they intercut with images of africas grand old man presiding at a wedding feast in the grounds of his palace retitled the hidden hunger it was shown round the clock on ethiopian television to coincide with the day that they finally summoned the nerve to seize the emperor himself the  oil crisis the severity of which is demonstrated by this graph hit ethiopia amidst a devastating famine compounding its effect and undermining support for the emperor some reports suggest that the emperor was unaware of the extent of the famine while others assert that he was well aware of it in addition to the exposure of attempts by corrupt local officials to cover up the famine from the imperial government the kremlins depiction of haile selassies ethiopia as backwards and inept relative to the purported utopia of marxismleninism contributed to the popular uprising that led to its downfall and the rise of mengistu haile mariam the famine and its image in the media undermined popular support of the government and haile selassies once unassailable personal popularity fell the crisis was exacerbated by military mutinies and high oil prices the latter a result of the  oil crisis the international economic crisis triggered by the oil crisis caused the costs of imported goods gasoline and food to skyrocket while unemployment spiked revolutionedit in february  four days of serious riots in addis ababa against a sudden economic inflation left five dead the emperor responded by announcing on national television a reduction in petrol prices and a freeze on the cost of basic commodities this calmed the public but the promised  military wage hike was not substantial enough to pacify the army which then mutinied beginning in asmara and spreading throughout the empire this mutiny led to the resignation of prime minister aklilu habtewold on  february  haile selassie again went on television to agree to the armys demands for still greater pay and named endelkachew makonnen as his new prime minister despite endalkatchews many concessions discontent continued in march with a fourday general strike that paralyzed the nation imprisonmentedit

haile selassie was placed under house arrest briefly at the th army division in addis ababa while most of his family was detained at the late duke of harars residence in the north of the capital the last months of the emperors life were spent in imprisonment in the grand palace reportedly his mental condition was such that he believed he was still emperor of ethiopia later most of the imperial family was imprisoned in the addis ababa prison kerchele also known as alem bekagne or ive had enough of this world on  november  sixty former high officials of the imperial government were executed without trial the executed included haile selassies grandson and two former prime ministers these killings known to ethiopians as bloody saturday were condemned by crown prince asfa wossen the derg

exmonarch haile selassie had died on  august of respiratory failure following complications from a prostate examination followed up by a prostate operation his doctor asrat woldeyes denied that complications had occurred and rejected the government version of his deathcitation needed some imperial loyalists believed that the emperor had in fact been assassinated and this belief remains widely held to this day one western correspondent in ethiopia at the time commented while it is not known what actually happened there are strong indications that no efforts were made to save him it is unlikely that he was actually killed such rumors were bound to arise no matter what happened given the atmosphere of suspicion and distrust prevailing in addis ababa at the time the sovietbacked derg fell in  in  the emperors bones were found under a concrete slab on the palace grounds some reports suggest that his remains were discovered beneath a latrine for almost a decade thereafter as ethiopian courts attempted to sort out the circumstances of his death his coffin rested in bhata church near his greatuncle menelik iis resting place on  november  haile selassie was given an imperialstyle funeral by the ethiopian orthodox church the postcommunist government refused calls to declare the ceremony an official imperial funeral although such prominent rastafari figures as rita

diaspora to freedom his official titles are conquering lion of the tribe of judah and king of kings of ethiopia and elect of god and his traditional lineage is thought to be from solomon and sheba these notions are perceived by rastafari as confirmation of the return of the messiah in the prophetic book of revelation in the new testament king of kings lord of lords conquering lion of the tribe of judah and root of david rastafari faith in the incarnate divinity of haile selassie began after news reports of his coronation reached jamaica particularly via the two time magazine articles on the coronation the week before and the week after the event haile selassies own perspectives permeate the philosophy of the movement in  the jamaican government sent a delegation composed of both rastafari and nonrastafari leaders to ethiopia to discuss the matter of repatriation among other issues with the emperor he reportedly told the rastafari delegation which included mortimer planno tell the brethren to be not dismayed i personally will give my assistance in the matter of repatriation haile selassie visited jamaica on  april  and approximately one hundred thousand rastafari from all over jamaica descended on palisadoes airport in kingston having heard that the man whom they considered to be their messiah was coming to visit them spliffs and chalices were openly smoked causing a haze of ganja smoke to drift through the air haile selassie arrived at the airport but was unable to come down the mobile steps of the airplane as the crowd rushed the tarmac he then returned into the plane disappearing for several more minutes finally jamaican authorities were obliged to request ras mortimer planno a wellknown rasta leader to climb the steps enter the plane and negotiate the emperors descent planno reemerged and announced to the crowd the emperor has instructed me to tell you to be calm step back and let the emperor land this day is widely held by scholars to be a major turning point for the movement and it is still commemorated by rastafari as grounation day the anniversary of which is celebrated as the second holiest holiday after  november the emperors coronation day from then on as a result of plannos actions the jamaican authorities were asked to ensure that rastafari representatives were present at all state functions attended by the emperor and rastafari elders also ensured that they obtained a private audience with the emperor where he reportedly told them that they should not emigrate to ethiopia until they had first liberated the people of jamaica this dictum came to be known as liberation before repatriation haile selassie defied expectations of the jamaican authorities and never rebuked the rastafari for their belief in him as the returned jesus instead he presented the movements faithful elders with gold medallions – the only recipients of such an honor on this visit during pnp leader later jamaican prime minister michael manleys visit to ethiopia in october  the emperor allegedly still recalled his  reception with amazement and stated that he felt that he had to be respectful of their beliefs this was the visit when manley received the rod of correction or rod of joshua as a present from the emperor which is thought to have helped him to win the  election in jamaica rita marley bob marleys wife converted to the rastafari faith after seeing haile selassie on his jamaican trip she claimed in interviews and in her book no woman no cry that she saw a stigmata print on the palm of haile selassies hand as he waved to the crowd which resembled the markings on christs hands from being nailed to the cross—a claim that was not supported by other sources but was used as evidence for her and other rastafari to suggest that haile selassie i was indeed their messiah she was also influential in the conversion of bob marley who then became internationally recognized as a result rastafari became much better known throughout much of the world bob marleys posthumously released song iron lion zion refers to haile selassie question of his divinityedit in a  recorded interview haile selassie appeared to deny his alleged divinity in the interview bill mcneil says there are millions of christians throughout the world your imperial majesty who regard you as the reincarnation of jesus christ selassie replied in his native language i have heard of that idea i also met certain rastafarians i told them clearly that i am a man that i am mortal and that i will be replaced by the oncoming generation and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity for many rastafari the cbc interview is not interpreted as a denial of his divinity and according to robert earl hood haile selassie neither denied nor affirmed his divinity either way in reggae routes the story of jamaican music kevin chang and wayne chen note its often said though no definite date is ever cited that haile selassie himself denied his divinity former senator and gleaner editor hector wynter tells of asking him during his visit to jamaica in  when he was going to tell rastafari he was not god who am i to disturb their belief replied the emperor after his return to ethiopia he dispatched archbishop abuna yesehaq mandefro to the caribbean to help draw rastafari and other west indians to the ethiopian church and according to some sources denied his divinity in  haile selassie donated a piece of land at shashamane  km south of addis ababa for the use of people of african descent from

referring to him as jah jah jah jah rastafari and him the abbreviation of his imperial majesty biographyedit early lifeedit ras makonnen woldemikael and his son lij tafari makonnen haile selassies royal line through his fathers mother originated from the amhara people he was born on  july  in the village of ejersa goro in the harar province of ethiopia his mother was woizero lady yeshimebet ali abba jifar daughter of the renowned oromo ruler of wollo province dejazmach ali abba jifar his maternal grandmother was of gurage heritage tafaris father was ras makonnen woldemikael gudessa the governor of harar ras makonnen served as a general in the first italo–ethiopian war playing a key role at the battle of adwa he too was paternally oromo but maternally amhara haile selassie was thus able to ascend to the imperial throne through his paternal grandmother woizero tenagnework sahle selassie who was an aunt of emperor menelik ii and daughter of negus sahle selassie of shewa as such haile selassie claimed direct descent from makeda the queen of sheba and king solomon of ancient israel ras makonnen arranged for tafari as well as his first cousin imru haile selassie to receive instruction in harar from abba samuel wolde kahin an ethiopian capuchin monk and from dr vitalien a surgeon from guadeloupe tafari was named dejazmach literally commander of the gate roughly

governorship of selale in  a realm of marginal importance but one that enabled him to continue his studies in  he was appointed governor over part of the province of sidamo it is alleged that during his late teens haile selassie was married to woizero altayech and that from this union his daughter princess romanework was born following the death of his brother yelma in  the governorate of harar was left vacant and its administration was left to meneliks loyal general dejazmach balcha safo balcha safos administration of harar was ineffective and so during the last illness of menelik ii and the brief reign of empress taitu bitul tafari was made governor of harar in  or  on  august he married menen asfaw of ambassel niece of heir to the throne lij iyasu regencyedit the extent to which tafari makonnen contributed to the movement that would come to depose iyasu v has been discussed extensively particularly in haile selassies own detailed account of the matter iyasu v or lij iyasu was the designated but uncrowned emperor of ethiopia from  to  iyasus reputation for scandalous behavior and a disrespectful attitude towards the nobles at the court of his grandfather menelik ii damaged his reputation iyasus flirtation with islam was considered treasonous among the ethiopian orthodox christian leadership of the empire on  september  iyasu was deposed contributing to the movement that deposed iyasu were conservatives such as fitawrari habte giyorgis menelik iis longtime minister of war the movement to depose iyasu preferred tafari as he attracted support from both progressive and conservative factions ultimately iyasu was deposed on the grounds of conversion to islam in his place the daughter of menelik ii the aunt of iyasu was named empress zewditu while tafari was elevated to the rank of ras and was made heir apparent and crown prince in the power arrangement that followed tafari accepted the role of regent plenipotentiary balemulu inderasenb  and became the de facto ruler of the ethiopian empire mangista ityoppya zewditu would govern while tafari would administer empress zewditu with one of her trusted priests while iyasu had been deposed on  september  on  october he managed to escape into the ogaden desert and his father negus mikael of wollo had time to come to his aid on  october negus mikael and his army met an army under fitawrari habte giyorgis loyal to zewditu and tafari during the battle of segale negus mikael was defeated and captured any chance that iyasu would regain the throne was ended and he went into hiding on  january  after avoiding capture for about five years iyasu was taken into custody by gugsa araya selassie on  february  the coronation for zewditu took place she pledged to rule justly through her regent tafari while tafari was the more visible of the two zewditu was far from an honorary ruler her position required that she arbitrate the claims of competing factions in other words she had the last word tafari carried the burden of daily administration but because his position was relatively weak this was often an exercise in futility for him initially his personal army was poorly equipped his finances were limited and he had little leverage to withstand the combined influence of the empress the minister of war or the provincial governors during his regency the new crown prince developed the policy of cautious modernization initiated by menelik ii also during this time he survived the  flu pandemic having come down with the illness he secured ethiopias admission to the league of nations in  by promising to eradicate slavery each emperor since tewodros ii had issued proclamations to halt slavery but without effect the internationally scorned practice persisted well into haile selassies reign with an estimated  million slaves in ethiopia in the early s travel abroadedit in  ras tafari toured europe and the middle east visiting jerusalem alexandria paris brussels amsterdam stockholm london geneva and athens with him on his tour was a group that included ras seyum mangasha of western tigray province ras hailu tekle haymanot of gojjam province ras mulugeta yeggazu of illubabor province ras makonnen endelkachew and blattengeta heruy welde sellase the primary goal of the trip to europe was for ethiopia to gain access to the sea in paris tafari was to find out from the french foreign ministry quai dorsay that this goal would not be realized however failing this he and his retinue inspected schools hospitals factories and churches although patterning many reforms after european models tafari remained wary of european pressure to guard against economic imperialism tafari required that all enterprises have at least partial local ownership of his modernization campaign he remarked we need european progress only because we are surrounded by it that is at once a benefit and a misfortune throughout ras tafaris travels in europe the levant and egypt he and his entourage were greeted with enthusiasm and fascination he was accompanied by seyum mangasha and hailu tekle haymanot who like tafari were sons of generals who contributed to the victorious war against italy a quarter century earlier at the battle of adwa another member of his entourage mulugeta yeggazu actually fought at adwa as a young man the oriental dignity of the ethiopians and their rich picturesque court dress were sensationalized in the media among his entourage he even included a pride of lions which he distributed as gifts to president alexandre millerand and prime minister raymond poincaré of france to king george v of the united kingdom and to the zoological garden jardin zoologique of paris as one historian noted rarely can a tour have inspired so many anecdotes in return for two lions the united kingdom presented ras tafari with the imperial crown of emperor tewodros ii for its safe return to empress zewditu the crown had been taken by robert napier during the  expedition to abyssinia in this period the crown prince visited the armenian monastery of jerusalem there he adopted  armenian orphans አርባ ልጆች arba lijoch forty children who had lost their parents in ottoman massacres ras tafari arranged for the musical education of the youths and they came to form the imperial brass band king and emperoredit see also modernisation of ethiopia under haile selassie i in  the authority of ras tafari makonnen was challenged when dejazmatch balcha safo went to addis ababa with a sizeable armed force when tafari consolidated his hold over the provinces many of meneliks appointees refused to abide by the new regulations balcha safo the governor shum of coffeerich sidamo province was particularly troublesome the revenues he remitted to the central government did not reflect the accrued profits and tafari recalled him to addis ababa the old man came in high dudgeon and insultingly with a large armynb  the dejazmatch paid homage to empress zewditu but snubbed ras tafari on  february while balcha safo and his personal bodyguardnb  were in addis ababa ras tafari had ras kassa haile darge buy off his army and arranged to have him displaced as the shum of sidamo province by birru wolde gabriel who himself was replaced by desta damtew cover of time magazine  november  even so the gesture of balcha safo empowered empress zewditu politically and she attempted to have tafari tried for treason he was tried for his benevolent dealings with italy including a year peace accord which was signed on  august in september a group of palace reactionaries including some courtiers of the empress made a final bid to get rid of tafari the attempted coup détat was tragic in its origins and comic in its end when confronted by tafari and a company of his troops the ringleaders of the coup took refuge on the palace grounds in meneliks mausoleum tafari and his men surrounded them only to be surrounded themselves by the personal guard of zewditu more of tafaris khaki clad soldiers arrived and with superiority of arms decided the outcome in his favor popular support as well as the support of the police remained with tafari ultimately the empress relented and on  october  she crowned tafari as negus amharic king the crowning of tafari as king was controversial he occupied the same territory as the empress rather than going off to a regional kingdom of the empire two monarchs even with one being the vassal and the other the emperor in this case empress had never occupied the same location as their seat in ethiopian history conservatives agitated to redress this perceived insult to the dignity of the crown leading to the rebellion of ras gugsa welle gugsa welle was the husband of the empress and the shum of begemder province in early  he raised an army and marched it from his governorate at gondar towards addis ababa on  march  gugsa welle was met by forces loyal to negus tafari and was defeated at the battle of anchem gugsa welle was killed in action news of gugsa welles defeat and death had hardly spread through addis ababa when the empress died suddenly on  april  although it was long rumored that the empress was poisoned upon the defeat of her husband or alternately that she died from shock upon hearing of the death of her estranged yet beloved husband it has since been documented that the empress succumbed to a flulike fever and complications from diabetes with the passing of zewditu tafari himself rose to emperor and was proclaimed neguse negest zeityoppya king of kings of ethiopia he was crowned on  november  at addis ababas cathedral of st george the coronation was by all accounts a most splendid affair and it was attended by royals and dignitaries from all over the world among those in attendance were george vs son the duke of gloucester marshal franchet desperey of france and the prince of udine representing the king of italy emissaries from the united states egypt turkey sweden belgium and japan were also present british author evelyn waugh was also present penning a contemporary report on the event and american travel lecturer burton holmes shot the only known film footage of the event one newspaper report suggested that the celebration may have incurred a cost in excess of  many of those in attendance received lavish gifts in one instance the christian emperor even sent a goldencased bible to an american bishop who had not attended the coronation but who had dedicated a prayer to the emperor on the day of the coronation haile selassie introduced ethiopias first written constitution on  july  providing for a bicameral legislature the constitution kept power in the hands of the nobility but it did establish democratic standards among the nobility envisaging a transition to democratic rule it would prevail until the people are in a position to elect themselves the constitution limited the succession to the throne to the descendants of haile selassie a point that met with the disapprobation of other dynastic princes including the princes of tigrai and even the emperors loyal cousin ras kassa haile darge in  the sultanate of jimma was formally absorbed into ethiopia following the death of sultan abba jifar ii of jimma conflict with italyedit see also abyssinia crisis and second italoabyssinian war ethiopia became the target of renewed italian imperialist designs in the s benito mussolinis fascist regime was keen to avenge the military defeats italy had suffered to ethiopia in the first italoabyssinian war and to efface the failed attempt by liberal italy to conquer the country as epitomised by the defeat at adwa a conquest of ethiopia could also empower the cause of fascism and embolden its rhetoric of empire ethiopia would also provide a bridge between italys eritrean and italian somaliland possessions ethiopias position in the league of nations did not dissuade the italians from invading in  the collective security envisaged by the league proved useless and a scandal erupted when the hoarelaval pact revealed that ethiopias league allies were scheming to appease italy mobilizationedit following the  december  italian invasion of ethiopia at walwal ogeden province haile selassie joined his northern armies and set up headquarters at desse in wollo province he issued his mobilization order on  october  if you withhold from your country ethiopia the death from cough or headcold of which you would otherwise die refusing to resist in your district in your patrimony and in your home our enemy who is coming from a distant country to attack us and if you persist in not shedding your blood you will be rebuked for it by your creator and will be cursed by your offspring hence without cooling your heart of accustomed valour there emerges your decision to fight fiercely mindful of your history that will last far into the future… if on your march you touch any property inside houses or cattle and crops outside not even grass straw and dung excluded it is like killing your brother who is dying with you… you countryman living at the various access routes set up a market for the army at the places where it is camping and on the day your districtgovernor will indicate to you lest the soldiers campaigning for ethiopias liberty should experience difficulty you will not be charged excise duty until the end of the campaign for anything you are marketing at the military camps i have granted you remission… after you have been ordered to go to war but are then idly missing from the campaign and when you are seized by the local chief or by an accuser you will have punishment inflicted upon your inherited land your property and your body to the accuser i shall grant a third of your property… on  october  haile selassie gave more precise orders for his army to his commanderinchief ras kassa when you set up tents it is to be in caves and by trees and in a wood if the place happens to be adjoining to these―and separated in the various platoons tents are to be set up at a distance of  cubits from each other when an aeroplane is sighted one should leave large open roads and wide meadows and march in valleys and trenches and by zigzag routes along places which have trees and woods when an aeroplane comes to drop bombs it will not suit it to do so unless it comes down to about  metres hence when it flies low for such action one should fire a volley with a good and very long gun and then quickly disperse when three or four bullets have hit it the aeroplane is bound to fall down but let only those fire who have been ordered to shoot with a weapon that has been selected for such firing for if everyone shoots who possesses a gun there is no advantage in this except to waste bullets and to disclose the mens whereabouts lest the aeroplane when rising again should detect the whereabouts of those who are dispersed it is well to remain cautiously scattered as long as it is still fairly close in time of war it suits the enemy to aim his guns at adorned shields ornaments silver and gold cloaks silk shirts and all similar things whether one possesses a jacket or not it is best to wear a narrowsleeved shirt with faded colours when we return with gods help you can wear your gold and silver decorations then now it is time to go and fight we offer you all these words of advice in the hope that no great harm should befall you through lack of caution at the same time we are glad to assure you that in time of war we are ready to shed our blood in your midst for the sake of ethiopias freedom… compared to the ethiopians the italians had an advanced modern military which included a large air force the italians would also come to employ chemical weapons extensively throughout the conflict even targeting red cross field hospitals in violation of the geneva conventions progress of the waredit starting in early october  the italians invaded ethiopia but by november the pace of invasion had slowed appreciably and haile selassies northern armies were able to launch what was known as the christmas offensive during this offensive the italians were forced back in places and put on the defensive in early  the first battle of tembien stopped the progress of the ethiopian offensive and the italians were ready to continue their offensive following the defeat and destruction of the northern ethiopian armies at the battle of amba aradam the second battle of tembien and the battle of shire haile selassie took the field with the last ethiopian army on the northern front on  march  he launched a counterattack against the italians himself at the battle of maychew in southern tigray the emperors army was defeated and retreated in disarray as haile selassies army withdrew the italians attacked from the air along with rebellious raya and azebo tribesmen on the ground who were armed and paid by the italians when the struggle to resist italy appeared doomed haile selassie traveled to the rockhewn churches of lalibela for fasting and prayer haile selassie made a solitary pilgrimage to the churches at lalibela at considerable risk of capture before returning to his capital after a stormy session of the council of state it was agreed that because addis ababa could not be defended the government would relocate to the southern town of gore and that in the interest of preserving the imperial house the emperors wife menen asfaw and the rest of the imperial family should immediately depart for french somaliland and from there continue on to jerusalem exile debateedit the emperor arrives in jerusalem may  after further debate as to whether haile selassie should go to gore or accompany his family into exile it was agreed that he should leave ethiopia with his family and present the case of ethiopia to the league of nations at geneva the decision was not unanimous and several participants including the nobleman blatta tekle wolde hawariat strenuously objected to the idea of an ethiopian monarch fleeing before an invading force haile selassie appointed his cousin ras imru haile selassie as prince regent in his absence departing with his family for french somaliland on  may  on  may marshal pietro badoglio led italian troops into addis ababa and mussolini declared ethiopia an italian province victor emanuel iii was proclaimed as the new emperor of ethiopia on the previous day the ethiopian exiles had left french somaliland aboard the british cruiser hms enterprise they were bound for jerusalem in the british mandate of palestine where the ethiopian royal family maintained a residence the imperial family disembarked at haifa and then went on to jerusalem once there haile selassie and his retinue prepared to make their case at geneva the choice of jerusalem was highly symbolic since the solomonic dynasty claimed descent from the house of david leaving the holy land haile selassie and his entourage sailed aboard the british cruiser hms capetown for gibraltar where he stayed at the rock hotel from gibraltar the exiles were transferred to an ordinary liner by doing this the government of the united kingdom was spared the expense of a state reception collective security and the league of nations edit mussolini upon invading ethiopia had promptly declared his own italian empire because the league of nations afforded haile selassie the opportunity to address the assembly italy even withdrew its league delegation on  may  it was in this context that haile selassie walked into the hall of the league of nations introduced by the president of the assembly as his imperial majesty the emperor of ethiopia sa majesté imperiale lempereur dethiopie the introduction caused a great many italian journalists in the galleries to erupt into jeering heckling and whistling as it turned out they had earlier been issued whistles by mussolinis soninlaw count galeazzo ciano the romanian delegate nicolae titulescu famously jumped to his feet in response and cried show the savages the door and they were cleared out haile selassie waited calmly for the hall to be cleared and responded majestically with a speech sometimes consideredby whom among the most stirring of the th century although fluent in french the working language of the league haile selassie chose to deliver his historic speech in his native amharic he asserted that because his confidence in the league was absolute his people were now being slaughtered he pointed out that the same european states that found in ethiopias favor at the league of nations were refusing ethiopia credit and matériel while aiding italy which was employing chemical weapons on military and civilian targets alike it was at the time when the operations for the encircling of makale were taking place that the italian command fearing a rout followed the procedure which it is now my duty to denounce to the world special sprayers were installed on board aircraft so that they could vaporize over vast areas of territory a fine deathdealing rain groups of nine fifteen eighteen aircraft followed one another so that the fog issuing from them formed a continuous sheet it was thus that as from the end of january  soldiers women children cattle rivers lakes and pastures were drenched continually with this deadly rain in order to kill off systematically all living creatures in order to more surely poison waters and pastures the italian command made its aircraft pass over and over again that was its chief method of warfare noting that his own small people of  million inhabitants without arms without resources could never withstand an attack by a large power such as italy with its  million people and unlimited quantities of the most deathdealing weapons he contended that all small states were threatened by the aggression and that all small states were in effect reduced to vassal states in the absence of collective action he admonished the league that god and history will remember your judgment it is collective security it is the very existence of the league of nations it is the confidence that each state is to place in international treaties… in a word it is international morality that is at stake have the signatures appended to a treaty value only in so far as the signatory powers have a personal direct and immediate interest involved the speech made the emperor an icon for antifascists around the world and time named him man of the year he failed however to get what he most needed the league agreed to only partial and ineffective sanctions on italy only six nations in  did not recognize italys occupation they were china new zealand the soviet union the republic of spain mexico and the united states exileedit haile selassie in  haile selassie spent his exile years – in bath england in fairfield house which he bought the emperor and kassa haile darge took morning walks together behind the high walls of the room georgian house haile selassies favorite reading was diplomatic history but most of his serious hours were occupied with the word story of his life that he was laboriously writing in amharic prior to fairfield house he briefly stayed at warnes hotel in worthing and in parkside wimbledon a bust of haile selassie is in nearby cannizaro park to commemorate this time and is a popular place of pilgrimage for londons rastafari community haile selassie stayed at the abbey hotel in malvern in the s and his granddaughters and daughters of court officials were educated at clarendon school in north malvern during his time in malvern he attended services at holy trinity church in link top a blue plaque commemorating his stay in malvern was unveiled on saturday  june  as part of the ceremony a delegation from the rastafari movement gave a short address and a drum recital haile selassies activity in this period was focused on countering italian propaganda as to the state of ethiopian resistance and the legality of the occupation he spoke out against the desecration of houses of worship and historical artifacts including the theft of a yearold imperial obelisk and condemned the atrocities suffered by the ethiopian civilian population he continued to plead for league intervention and to voice his certainty that gods judgment will eventually visit the weak and the mighty alike though his attempts to gain support for the struggle against italy were largely unsuccessful until italy entered world war ii on the german side in june  the emperors pleas for international support did take root in the united states particularly among africanamerican organizations sympathetic to the ethiopian cause in  haile selassie was to give a christmas day radio address to the american people to thank his supporters when his taxi was involved in a traffic accident leaving him with a fractured knee rather than canceling the radio appearance he proceeded in much pain to complete the address in which he linked christianity and goodwill with the covenant of the league of nations and asserted that war is not the only means to stop war with the birth of the son of god an unprecedented an unrepeatable and a longanticipated phenomenon occurred he was born in a stable instead of a palace in a manger instead of a crib the hearts of the wise men were struck by fear and wonder due to his majestic humbleness the kings prostrated themselves before him and worshipped him peace be to those who have good will this became the first message although the toils of wise people may earn them respect it is a fact of life that the spirit of the wicked continues to cast its shadow on this world the arrogant are seen visibly leading their people into crime and destruction the laws of the league of nations are constantly violated and wars and acts of aggression repeatedly take place… so that the spirit of the cursed will not gain predominance over the human race whom christ redeemed with his blood all peaceloving people should cooperate to stand firm in order to preserve and promote lawfulness and peace during this period haile selassie suffered several personal tragedies his two sonsinlaw ras desta damtew and dejazmach beyene merid were both executed by the italians the emperors daughter princess romanework wife of dejazmach beyene merid was herself taken into captivity with her children and she died in italy in  his daughter tsehai died during childbirth shortly after the restoration in  after his return to ethiopia he donated fairfield house to the city of bath as a residence for the aged until modified in the s where it is now used as a day care centre advanced negotiations are progressing for a community group to run the house to preserve and develop the house s and sedit newspaper illustration drawn by charles h alston for the us office of war information domestic operations branch news bureau  meeting with crown prince akihito in

colonial troops under the gideon force of colonel orde wingate coordinated the military effort to liberate ethiopia the emperor himself issued several imperial proclamations in this period demonstrating that while authority was not divided up in any formal way british military might and the emperors populist appeal could be joined in the concerted effort to liberate ethiopia on  january  during the east african campaign haile selassie crossed the border between sudan and ethiopia near the village of um iddla the standard of the lion of judah was raised again two days later he and a force of ethiopian patriots joined gideon force which was already in ethiopia and preparing the way italy was defeated by a force of the united kingdom the commonwealth of nations free france free belgium and ethiopian patriots on  may  haile selassie entered addis ababa and personally addressed the ethiopian people five years to the day since his  exile today is the day on which we defeated our enemy therefore when we say let us rejoice with our hearts let not our rejoicing be in any other way but in the spirit of christ do not return evil for evil do not indulge in the atrocities which the enemy has been practicing in his usual way even to the last take care not to spoil the good name of ethiopia by acts which are worthy of the enemy we shall see that our enemies are disarmed and sent out the same way they came as saint george who killed the dragon is the patron saint of our army as well as of our allies let us unite with our allies in everlasting friendship and amity in order to be able to stand against the godless and cruel dragon which has newly risen and which is oppressing mankind on  august  haile selassie abolished the legal basis of slavery throughout the empire and imposed severe penalties including death for slave trading after world war ii ethiopia became a charter member of the united nations in  the ogaden a region disputed with somalia was granted to ethiopia on  december  the un general assembly adopted resolution  v establishing the federation of eritrea the former italian colony into ethiopia eritrea was to have its own constitution which would provide for ethnic linguistic and cultural balance while ethiopia was to manage its finances defense and foreign policy despite his centralization policies that had been made before world war ii haile selassie still found himself unable to push for all the programs he wanted in  he attempted to institute a progressive tax scheme but this failed due to opposition from the nobility and only a flat tax was passed in  he agreed to reduce this as well ethiopia was still semifeudal and the emperors attempts to alter its social and economic form by reforming its modes of taxation met with resistance from the nobility and clergy which were eager to resume their privileges in the postwar era where haile selassie actually did succeed in effecting new land taxes the burdens were often passed by the landowners to the peasants despite his wishes the tax burden remained primarily on the peasants between  and  haile selassie worked to establish the autocephaly of the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church the ethiopian orthodox church had been headed by the abuna a bishop who answered to the pope of the coptic orthodox church of alexandria in  and  haile selassie applied to the holy synod of the coptic orthodox church to establish the independence of ethiopian bishops and when his appeals were denied he threatened to sever relations with the coptic church of alexandria finally in  pope kyrillos vi elevated the abuna to patriarchcatholicos the ethiopian church remained affiliated with the alexandrian church in addition to these efforts haile selassie changed the ethiopian churchstate relationship by introducing taxation of church lands and by restricting the legal privileges of the clergy who had formerly been tried in their own courts for civil offenses in keeping with the principle of collective security for which he was an outspoken proponent he sent a contingent under general mulugueta bulli known as the kagnew battalion to take part in the korean war by supporting the united nations command it was attached to the american th infantry division and fought in a number of engagements including the battle of pork chop hill in a  speech the emperor spoke of ethiopian participation in the korean war as a redemption of the principles of collective security nearly two decades ago i personally assumed before history the responsibility of placing the fate of my beloved people on the issue of collective security for surely at that time and for the first time in world history that issue was posed in all its clarity my searching of conscience convinced me of the rightness of my course and if after untold sufferings and indeed unaided resistance at the time of aggression we now see the final vindication of that principle in our joint action in korea i can only be thankful that god gave me strength to persist in our faith until the moment of its recent glorious vindication haile selassie emperor of ethiopia photographed during a radio broadcast during the celebrations of his silver jubilee in november  haile selassie introduced a revised constitution whereby he retained effective power while extending political participation to the people by allowing the lower house of parliament to become an elected body party politics were not provided for modern educational methods were more widely spread throughout the empire and the country embarked on a development scheme and plans for modernization tempered by ethiopian traditions and within the framework of the ancient monarchical structure of the state haile selassie compromised when practical with the traditionalists in the nobility and church he also tried to improve relations between the state and ethnic groups and granted autonomy to afar lands that were difficult to control still his reforms to end feudalism were slow and weakened by the compromises he made with the entrenched aristocracy the revised constitution of  has been criticized for reasserting the indisputable power of the monarch and maintaining the relative powerlessness of the peasants charitable gestureedit he sent aid to the british government in  when britain was affected by heavy flooding his letter to lord meork national distress fund london said even though we are busy of helping our people who didnt recover from the crises of the war we heard that your fertile and beautiful country is devastated by

congo peacekeeping force during the  congo crisis to preserve congolese integrity per united nations security council resolution  on  december  while haile selassie was on a state visit to brazil his imperial guard forces staged an unsuccessful coup briefly proclaiming haile selassies eldest son asfa wossen as emperor the coup détat was crushed by the regular army and police forces the coup attempt lacked broad popular support was denounced by the ethiopian orthodox church and was unpopular with the army air force and police nonetheless the effort to depose the emperor had support among students and the educated classes the coup attempt has been characterized as a pivotal moment in ethiopian history the point at which ethiopians for the first time questioned the power of the king to rule without the peoples consent student populations began to empathize with the peasantry and poor and to advocate on their behalf the coup spurred haile selassie to accelerate reform which was manifested in the form of land grants to military and police officials the emperor continued to be a staunch ally of the west while pursuing a firm policy of decolonization in africa which was still largely under european colonial rule the united nations conducted a lengthy inquiry regarding the status of eritrea with the superpowers each vying for a stake in the states future britain the administrator at the time suggested the partition of eritrea between sudan and ethiopia separating christians and muslims the idea was instantly rejected by eritrean political parties as well as the un a un plebiscite voted  to  to have eritrea be federated with ethiopia which was later stipulated on  december  in resolution  v eritrea would have its own parliament and administration and would be represented in what had been the ethiopian parliament and would become the federal parliament haile selassie would have none of european attempts to draft a separate constitution under which eritrea would be governed and wanted his own  constitution protecting families to apply in both ethiopia and eritrea in  the year eritrean struggle for independence began followed by haile selassies dissolution of the federation and shutting down of eritreas parliament in september  haile selassie attended the conference of heads of state of government of nonaligned countries in belgrade fpr

proposition later taken up by muammar gaddafi on  october  haile selassie addressed the general assembly of the united nations referring in his address to his earlier speech to the league of nations twentyseven years ago as emperor of ethiopia i mounted the rostrum in geneva switzerland to address the league of nations and to appeal for relief from the destruction which had been unleashed against my defenceless nation by the fascist invader i spoke then both to and for the conscience of the world my words went unheeded but history testifies to the accuracy of the warning that i gave in  today i stand before the world organization which has succeeded to the mantle discarded by its discredited predecessor in this body is enshrined the principle of collective security which i unsuccessfully invoked at geneva here in this assembly reposes the best – perhaps the last – hope for the peaceful survival of mankind on  november  the emperor was among other heads of state including frances president charles de gaulle who traveled to washington dc and attended the funeral of assassinated president john f kennedy in  haile selassie attempted to create a modern progressive taxcitation needed that included registration of land which would significantly weaken the nobility even with alterations this law led to a revolt in gojjam which was repressed although enforcement of the tax was abandoned the revolt having achieved its design in undermining the tax encouraged other landowners to defy haile selassie haile selassie on a state visit to washington  while he had fully approved of and assured ethiopias participation in unapproved collective security operations including korea and congo haile selassie drew a distinction with the nonun approved foreign intervention in indochina and consistently deplored it as needless suffering calling for the vietnam war to end on several occasions at the same time he remained open toward the united states and commended it for making progress with african americans civil rights legislation in the s and s while visiting the us several times during these years in  he visited montreal canada to open the ethiopian pavilion at the expo  worlds fair where he received great acclaim amongst other world leaders there for the occasion student unrest became a regular feature of ethiopian life in the s and s marxism took root in large segments of the ethiopian intelligentsia particularly among those who had studied abroad and had thus been exposed to radical and leftwing sentiments that were becoming popular in other parts of the globe resistance by conservative elements at the imperial court and parliament and by the ethiopian orthodox church made haile selassies land reform proposals difficult to implement and also damaged the standing of the government costing haile selassie much of the goodwill he had once enjoyed this bred resentment among the peasant population efforts to weaken unions also hurt his image as these issues began to pile up haile selassie left much of domestic governance to his prime minister aklilu habte wold and concentrated more on foreign affairs sedit haile selassie i in toledo spain in april  picture by eduardo butragueño outside of ethiopia haile selassie continued to enjoy enormous prestige and respect as the longestserving head of state in power he was often given precedence over other leaders at state events such as the state funerals of john f kennedy and charles de gaulle the summits of the nonaligned movement and the  celebration of the  years of the persian empire in  he visited italy as a guest of president giuseppe saragat and in milan he met giordano dellamore president of italian savings banks association he visited china in october  and was the first foreign head of state to meet mao zedong following the death of maos designated successor lin biao in a plane crash in mongolia human rights in ethiopia under selassies regime were poor civil liberties and political rights were low with freedom house giving ethiopia a not free score for both civil liberties and political rights in the last years of selassies rule common human right abuses included imprisonment and torture of political prisoners and very poor prison conditions the ethiopian army also carried out a number of these atrocities while fighting the eritrean separatists this was due to a policy of destroying eritrean villages that supported the rebels there were a number of mass killings of hundreds of civilians during the war in the late s and early s wollo famineedit famine—mostly in wollo northeastern ethiopia as well as in some parts of tigray—is estimated to have killed  to  ethiopians between  and  a bbc news report has cited a  estimate that  deaths occurred based on a contemporaneous estimate from the ethiopian nutrition institute while this figure is still repeated in some texts and media sources it was an estimate that was later found to be overpessimistic although the region is infamous for recurrent crop failures and continuous food shortage and starvation risk this episode was remarkably severe a  production of the itv programme the unknown famine by jonathan dimbleby relied on the unverified estimate of  dead stimulating a massive influx of aid while at the same time destabilizing haile selassies regime against that background a group of dissident army officers instigated a creeping coup against the emperors faltering regime to guard against a public backlash in favour of haile selassie who was still widely revered they contrived to obtain a copy of the unknown famine which they intercut with images of africas grand old man presiding at a wedding feast in the grounds of his palace retitled the hidden hunger it was shown round the clock on ethiopian television to coincide with the day that they finally summoned the nerve to seize the emperor himself the  oil crisis the severity of which is demonstrated by this graph hit ethiopia amidst a devastating famine compounding its effect and undermining support for the emperor some reports suggest that the emperor was unaware of the extent of the famine while others assert that he was well aware of it in addition to the exposure of attempts by corrupt local officials to cover up the famine from the imperial government the kremlins depiction of haile selassies ethiopia as backwards and inept relative to the purported utopia of marxismleninism contributed to the popular uprising that led to its downfall and the rise of mengistu haile mariam the famine and its image in the media undermined popular support of the government and haile selassies once unassailable personal popularity fell the crisis was exacerbated by military mutinies and high oil prices the latter a result of the  oil crisis the international economic crisis triggered by the oil crisis caused the costs of imported goods gasoline and food to skyrocket while unemployment spiked revolutionedit in february  four days of serious riots in addis ababa against a sudden economic inflation left five dead the emperor responded by announcing on national television a reduction in petrol prices and a freeze on the cost of basic commodities this calmed the public but the promised  military wage hike was not substantial enough to pacify the army which then mutinied beginning in asmara and spreading throughout the empire this mutiny led to the resignation of prime minister aklilu habtewold on  february  haile selassie again went on television to agree to the armys demands for still greater pay and named endelkachew makonnen as his new prime minister despite endalkatchews many concessions discontent continued in march with a fourday general strike that paralyzed the nation imprisonmentedit

general aman mikael andom a protestant of eritrean origin served briefly as provisional head of state pending the return of crown prince asfa wossen who was then receiving medical treatment abroad haile selassie was placed under house arrest briefly at the th army division in addis ababa while most of his family was detained at the late duke of harars residence in the north of the capital the last months of the emperors life were spent in imprisonment in the grand palace reportedly his mental condition was such that he believed he was still emperor of ethiopia later most of the imperial family was imprisoned in the addis ababa prison kerchele also known as alem bekagne or ive had enough of this world on  november  sixty former high officials of the imperial government were executed without trial the executed included haile selassies grandson and two former prime ministers these killings known to ethiopians as bloody saturday were condemned by crown prince asfa wossen the derg

exmonarch haile selassie had died on  august of respiratory failure following complications from a prostate examination followed up by a prostate operation his doctor asrat woldeyes denied that complications had occurred and rejected the government version of his deathcitation needed some imperial loyalists believed that the emperor had in fact been assassinated and this belief remains widely held to this day one western correspondent in ethiopia at the time commented while it is not known what actually happened there are strong indications that no efforts were made to save him it is unlikely that he was actually killed such rumors were bound to arise no matter what happened given the atmosphere of suspicion and distrust prevailing in addis ababa at the time the sovietbacked derg fell in  in  the emperors bones were found under a concrete slab on the palace grounds some reports suggest that his remains were discovered beneath a latrine for almost a decade thereafter as ethiopian courts attempted to sort out the circumstances of his death his coffin rested in bhata church near his greatuncle menelik iis resting place on  november  haile selassie was given an imperialstyle funeral by the ethiopian orthodox church the postcommunist government refused calls to declare the ceremony an official imperial funeral although such prominent rastafari figures as rita

duke—tafari makonnen which emerged in jamaica during the s under the influence of marcus garveys pan africanism movement he is viewed as the messiah who will lead the peoples of africa and the african diaspora to freedom his official titles are conquering lion of the tribe of judah and king of kings of ethiopia and elect of god and his traditional lineage is thought to be from solomon and sheba these notions are perceived by rastafari as confirmation of the return of the messiah in the prophetic book of revelation in the new testament king of kings lord of lords conquering lion of the tribe of judah and root of david rastafari faith in the incarnate divinity of haile selassie began after news reports of his coronation reached jamaica particularly via the two time magazine articles on the coronation the week before and the week after the event haile selassies own perspectives permeate the philosophy of the movement in  the jamaican government sent a delegation composed of both rastafari and nonrastafari leaders to ethiopia to discuss the matter of repatriation among other issues with the emperor he reportedly told the rastafari delegation which included mortimer planno tell the brethren to be not dismayed i personally will give my assistance in the matter of repatriation haile selassie visited jamaica on  april  and approximately one hundred thousand rastafari from all over jamaica descended on palisadoes airport in kingston having heard that the man whom they considered to be their messiah was coming to visit them spliffs and chalices were openly smoked causing a haze of ganja smoke to drift through the air haile selassie arrived at the airport but was unable to come down the mobile steps of the airplane as the crowd rushed the tarmac he then returned into the plane disappearing for several more minutes finally jamaican authorities were obliged to request ras mortimer planno a wellknown rasta leader to climb the steps enter the plane and negotiate the emperors descent planno reemerged and announced to the crowd the emperor has instructed me to tell you to be calm step back and let the emperor land this day is widely held by scholars to be a major turning point for the movement and it is still commemorated by rastafari as grounation day the anniversary of which is celebrated as the second holiest holiday after  november the emperors coronation day from then on as a result of plannos actions the jamaican authorities were asked to ensure that rastafari representatives were present at all state functions attended by the emperor and rastafari elders also ensured that they obtained a private audience with the emperor where he reportedly told them that they should not emigrate to ethiopia until they had first liberated the people of jamaica this dictum came to be known as liberation before repatriation haile selassie defied expectations of the jamaican authorities and never rebuked the rastafari for their belief in him as the returned jesus instead he presented the movements faithful elders with gold medallions – the only recipients of such an honor on this visit during pnp leader later jamaican prime minister michael manleys visit to ethiopia in october  the emperor allegedly still recalled his  reception with amazement and stated that he felt that he had to be respectful of their beliefs this was the visit when manley received the rod of correction or rod of joshua as a present from the emperor which is thought to have helped him to win the  election in jamaica rita marley bob marleys wife converted to the rastafari faith after seeing haile selassie on his jamaican trip she claimed in interviews and in her book no woman no cry that she saw a stigmata print on the palm of haile selassies hand as he waved to the crowd which resembled the markings on christs hands from being nailed to the cross—a claim that was not supported by other sources but was used as evidence for her and other rastafari to suggest that haile selassie i was indeed their messiah she was also influential in the conversion of bob marley who then became internationally recognized as a result rastafari became much better known throughout much of the world bob marleys posthumously released song iron lion zion refers to haile selassie question of his divinityedit in a  recorded interview haile selassie appeared to deny his alleged divinity in the interview bill mcneil says there are millions of christians throughout the world your imperial majesty who regard you as the reincarnation of jesus christ selassie replied in his native language i have heard of that idea i also met certain rastafarians i told them clearly that i am a man that i am mortal and that i will be replaced by the oncoming generation and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity for many rastafari the cbc interview is not interpreted as a denial of his divinity and according to robert earl hood haile selassie neither denied nor affirmed his divinity either way in reggae routes the story of jamaican music kevin chang and wayne chen note its often said though no definite date is ever cited that haile selassie himself denied his divinity former senator and gleaner editor hector wynter tells of asking him during his visit to jamaica in  when he was going to tell rastafari he was not god who am i to disturb their belief replied the emperor after his return to ethiopia he dispatched archbishop abuna yesehaq mandefro to the caribbean to help draw rastafari and other west indians to the ethiopian church and according to some sources denied his divinity in  haile selassie donated a piece of land at shashamane  km south of addis ababa for the use of people of african descent from

week’s parsha study we should take an indepth look at the name of the portion for this week ækeb ekeveiqebעֵקֶב other various phonetic pronunciations   the significance of this parsha’s name should be a notated because the resemblance it has to isaac’s son jacob brother of esau in the amharic  hebrew languages finding relations to the parsha for this week and the name jacob will be very telling in the order of overstanding“understanding” where this portion of the scriptures intends to enlighten the mind with this said let us begin our comprehensive reflection on the study of the scripture lesson  the beginning of the readings of deuteronomy begin with moses speaking to the children of israel instructing them in the way god commanded him  moses is to teach the people of the blessings for obedience to god his commandments laws and statutes also the directions for taking possession of the land of promise after moses receives the instructions from god to teach the children of israel he then instructs them insuring that they know they should observe and do them for things to go well  in their favor pertaining to god  god in turn will not only bring them into the land but will bless them abundantly deut   warnings and exhortations were given to the children of israel in the sense of them taking advantage of pursuing the inheritance that was a covenant between god abraham isaac  jacob  deut   “…a land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and pomegranates a land of oil olive and honey…” deut  israel after receiving instruction was to then go over the river jordan to possess the land  drive out those who would not dwell peaceably with them  for god strove against the wickedness of other nations deut   crossing over jordan deut  but even with all of this brewing in good favor for the children of israel they stray from the path which should have led straightway to the fullness of jahgod’s grace and blessing   but because israel is  always has been a “stiffnecked people” moses has to plead a case to god for the children of israel  god had sought to utterly destroy the children of israel for their constant disobedience  moses intercedes for israel for they had brought nearly about god’s wrath upon them  recalling the time at horeb israel making a molten image to worship and provoked god to anger so much so that god prepared obliterate them  make a nation out of moses  tsipporah  new nation hence the ethiohebrews that would later come with sheba  solomon in spite of the various surrounding happenings  for moses’ sake god’s wrath was turned away from israel deut   painting by gustave dore after this god told moses to hew two stone tablets for the words which were on the set before them moses broke for he waxed hot in anger towards israel for their stubbornness and disobedience to god ‘s laws  along with these was a wooden ark made to be put into the ark of the covenant  so the words of the sinaitic covenant were restored deut   for the children of israel to dwell in the land of promise in peace and prosperity observation and the diligence to keep the laws commandments  and statutes of god was a vital part of the covenant between israel  their god  obedience would bring forth favor protection and abundance deut    african unity and panafricanism without acknowledging the role of ethiopia and emperor haile selassie is a

exitcoming out of egypt  the wandering in the wilderness  on the eastern side of the jordan river in the plains moses spoke on a number of subjects  including the kings of the lands which sought the destruction of the children of israel  how god spoke to him instructing him to lead the israel onward deut   painting by tissot moses spoke to the children of israel on how god blessed  multipled their numbers while travailing through the toils of the journey in the wilderness  he also mentioned how the appointing of the judgescaptains princeschiefs of israel was a significant moment for the children of israel seeing as how moses’ fatherinlaw jethro saw that moses discerned matters of concern among all of israel alone  from that moment on jethro advised moses by the grace of god to appoint heads of each tribe to handle certain matters within certain subjects  to bring the matters of great concern to moses for he would be consulted of god on the greater issues of concern for israel deut   jethro  moses the murmuring disobedience of the children of israel which led to the seemingly endless wandering in the wilderness was also topic of discussion from moses to israel  even with the power of god working in  through the children of israel there were always those that failed to yield to the wordjohn  but god kept israel through upholding the covenant to the israel’s

mattotmatotnegedoch which both the hebrew  amharic words could be equivalent to “tribes” in the english at this point moses speaks to the heads of the tribes of israel on what god spoke about pertaining to vows  when one of the children of israel were to make a vow or swear an oath to god they were to uphold the words of that vowoath if men were to make vowsoathsespecially to god they were to speak those words which consisted of it and keep those words which they had spoken  numb   if women were to make vowsoathsespecially to god even in the house of their fathers if the father heard the vow  didn’t speak against it then vows would stand  she would have to be completely responsible for every word of her vowoath the same applied if the woman had a husband as well numb   when the bible speak on these vows it shows the countenance of the hebrew men willing to take on the burdens of accountability  responsibility for the women of their congregation  though women could make oathsvows they were only held fully accountable  if their father or husbands would allow them to take on the burdens of fulfilling a vowoath seeing as how hebrew men  men in general would rather shoulder a burdens for their households than see their women bear those strenuous experiences  but women of course were free to choose to bear those burdens or not   including those women who were widowed  those that happened to be divorced god then spoke to moses to prepare the children of israel to avenge themselves and those they lost during the plague for the troubles that the midianites brought upon them at the sin of baalpeor those midianites that sought to destroy them along with the moabites of balak ref st parsha study moses sent a thousand of each tribe of israel along with phineas son of eleazar grandson of aaron so israel warred against midian  overtook them numb   a general presumption of the whereabouts of midian the remains of midian were shared among the children of israel  the cattle riches estates and land divided it all among the tribes  the children of israel even made an offering to god for their triumph for every one of them that took up arms had enough

numbers the journeys from out of egypt to the land of canaan is shown again to us to retrace the steps of the children of israel  from rămesēs to succoth in and around the fifthteenth day of the hebrews’ first month israel journeyed out of egypt numb   one of the closet assumptions for the exodus of the children of israel out of egypt then god gave specific instructions for taking possession of the land which was promised  in the plains of moab god spoke these words to moses for him to tell the children of israel numb   more instructions were explained with the extent of specifying the borders of the land and the portions which would be apportioned to each tribe numbers chpt  now god also spoke to moses about preserving things for the tribe of lewvi seeing as how god had placed on them that they should not be apportioned land in the same sense as the rest of the tribes along with other aspects the levites were given portions of land which were adjacent to the rest of the tribes and their possessions of land numb   with the setting up of certain places for the tribe of lewvi there also had to be a setting up of places for refugecities of refuge  these cities of refuge were to be places of solitude but most of all they were to be places of judgment to hold people accountable for their actions in this land which had been given the hebrews numb   now remembering the daughters of zelophehad who came before the congregation to vie for the inheritance of their father for he died and bear no son to inherit his due property as a son of israel  zelophehad’s five daughters appealed to received his portion as their due inheritance and moses after consultation of god along with the congregation granted that the daughters of zelophehad take up their father’s possessions as their own   but of course the responsibility as daughters of israel were to be upheld in the taking up of inheritance among the hebrews numb   digital patchwork version of the painting from phinkh’as

rastafari biography advertisements early life ras makonnen father of haile selassie i in  haile selassie i was born tafari makonnen from a mixed oromo amhara and gurage family on  july  in the village of ejersa goro in the harar province of ethiopia his mother was woizero lady yeshimebet ali abajifar daughter of the renowned oromo ruler of wollo province dejazmach ali abajifar haile selassies father was ras makonnen woldemikael gudessa the governor of harar ras makonnen served as a general in the first italo–ethiopian war playing a key role at the battle of adwa he inherited his imperial blood through his paternal grandmother princess tenagnework sahle selassie who was an aunt of emperor menelik ii and as such asserted direct descent from makeda the queen of sheba and king solomon of ancient israel ras makonnen arranged for tafari as well as his first cousin ras imru haile selassie to receive instruction in harar from abba samuel wolde kahin an ethiopian capuchin monk and from dr vitalien a surgeon from guadeloupe tafari was named dejazmach literally commander of the gate roughly equivalent to count at the age of  on  november  shortly thereafter his father ras makonnen died at kulibi in  governorship tafari assumed the titular governorship of selale in  a realm of marginal importance but one that enabled him to continue his studies in  he was appointed governor over part of the province of sidamo it is alleged that during his late teens haile selassie was married to woizero altayech and that from this union his daughter romanework haile selassie was born following the death of his brother yelma in  the governorate of harar was left vacant and its administration was left to meneliks loyal general dejazmach balcha safo balcha safos administration of harar was ineffective and so during the last illness of menelik ii and the brief reign of empress taitu bitul tafari was made governor of harar in  or  on  august he married menen asfaw of ambassel niece of heir to the throne lij iyasu regency the extent to which tafari makonnen contributed to the movement that would come to depose iyasu v is unclear iyasu v or lij iyasu was the designated but uncrowned emperor of ethiopia from  to  iyasus reputation for scandalous behavior and a disrespectful attitude towards the nobles at the court of his grandfather menelik ii damaged his reputation his flirtation with islam was considered treasonous among the ethiopian orthodox christian leadership of the empire on  september  iyasu was deposed contributing to the movement that deposed iyasu were conservatives such as fitawrari habte giyorgis menelik iis longtime minister of war the movement to depose iyasu preferred tafari as he attracted support from both progressive and conservative factions ultimately iyasu was deposed on the grounds of conversion to islam in his place the daughter of menelik ii  the aunt of iyasu was named empress zewditu and made regent for tafari during his minority tafari was elevated to the rank of ras and was made heir apparent and crown prince in the power arrangement that followed tafari accepted the role of regent plenipotentiary balemulu inderase and became the de facto ruler of the ethiopian empire mangista ityoppya zewditu would govern while tafari would administer while iyasu had been deposed on  september  on  october the coup detat went awry iyasu managed to escape into the ogaden desert and his father negus mikael of wollo had time to come to his aid on  october negus mikael and his army met an army under fitawrari habte giyorgis loyal to zewditu and tafari during the battle of segale negus mikael was defeated and captured any chance that iyasu would regain the throne was ended and he went into hiding on  january  after avoiding capture for about five years iyasu was taken into custody by gugsa araya selassie on  february  the coronation for zewditu took place she pledged to rule justly through her regent tafari while tafari was the more visible of the two zewditu was far from an honorary ruler her position required that she arbitrate the claims of competing factions in other words she had the last word tafari carried the burden of daily administration but because his position was relatively weak this was often an exercise in futility for him initially his personal army was poorly equipped his finances were limited and he had little leverage to withstand the combined influence of the empress the minister of war or the provincial governors empress zewditu preceded haile selassie as empress of ethiopia from  until her death in april  he served as regent of ethiopia during her reign during his regency the new crown prince developed the policy of cautious modernization initiated by menelik ii he secured ethiopias admission to the league of nations in  by promising to eradicate slavery each emperor since tewodros ii had issued proclamations to halt slavery but without effect the internationally scorned practice persisted well into haile selassies reign travel abroad in  ras tafari toured europe and the middle east visiting jerusalem cairo alexandria brussels amsterdam stockholm london geneva and athens with him on his tour was a group that included ras seyum mangasha of western tigre province ras hailu tekle haymanot of gojjam province ras mulugeta yeggazu of illubabor province ras makonnen endelkachew and blattengeta heruy welde sellase the primary goal of the trip to europe was for ethiopia to gain access to the sea in paris tafari was to find out from the french foreign ministry quai dorsay that this goal would not be realized however failing this he and his retinue inspected schools hospitals factories and churches although patterning many reforms after european models tafari remained wary of european pressure to guard against economic imperialism tafari required that all enterprises have at least partial local ownership of his modernization campaign he remarked we need european progress only because we are surrounded by it that is at once a benefit and a misfortune throughout ras tafaris travels in europe the levant and egypt he and his entourage were greeted with enthusiasm and fascination he was accompanied by seyum mangasha and hailu tekle haymanot who like tafari were sons of generals who contributed to the victorious war against italy a quarter century earlier at the battle of adwa another member of his entourage mulugeta yeggazu actually fought at adwa as a young man the oriental dignity of the ethiopians  and their rich picturesque court dress were sensationalized in the media among his entourage he even included a pride of lions which he distributed as gifts to president alexandre millerand and prime minister raymond poincaré of france to king george v of the united kingdom and to the zoological garden jardin zoologique of paris as one historian noted rarely can a tour have inspired so many anecdotes in return for two lions the united kingdom presented ras tafari with the imperial crown of emperor tewodros ii for its safe return to empress zewditu the crown had been taken by robert napier during the  expedition to abyssinia in this period the crown prince visited the armenian monastery of jerusalem there he adopted  armenian orphans አርባ ልጆች arba lijoch forty children who had escaped the armenian genocide of the ottoman empire ras tafari arranged for the musical education of the youths and they came to form the imperial brass band king and emperor in  the authority of ras tafari makonnen was challenged when dejazmatch balcha safo went to addis ababa with a sizeable armed force when tafari consolidated his hold over the provinces many of menileks appointees refused to abide by the new regulations balcha safo governor shum of coffeerich sidamo province was particularly troublesome the revenues he remitted to the central government did not reflect the accrued profits and tafari recalled him to addis ababa the old man came in high dudgeon and insultingly with a large armynb  the dejazmatch paid homage to empress zewditu but snubbed ras tafari on  february while balcha safo and his personal bodyguardnb  were in addis ababa ras tafari had ras kassa haile darge buy off his army and arrange to have him displaced as the shum of sidamo province by birru wolde gabriel who himself was replaced by desta damtew cover of time magazine  november  even so the gesture of balcha safo empowered empress zewditu politically and she attempted to have tafari tried for treason he was tried for his benevolent dealings with italy including a year peace accord which was signed on  august in september a group of palace reactionaries including some of the courtiers of the empress made a final bid to get rid of tafari the attempted coup détat was tragic in its origins and comic in its end when confronted by tafari and a company of his troops the ringleaders of the coup took refuge on the palace grounds in menileks mausoleum tafari and his men surrounded them only to be surrounded themselves by the personal guard of zewditu more of tafaris khaki clad soldiers arrived and with superiority of arms decided the outcome in his favor popular support as well as the support of the police remained with tafari ultimately the empress relented and on  october  she crowned tafari as negus amharic king the crowning of tafari as king was controversial he occupied the same territory as the empress rather than going off to a regional kingdom of the empire two monarchs even with one being the vassal and the other the emperor in this case empress had never occupied the same location as their seat in ethiopian history conservatives agitated to redress this perceived insult to the dignity of the crown leading to the rebellion of ras gugsa welle gugsa welle was the husband of the empress and the shum of begemder province in early  he raised an army and marched it from his governorate at gondar towards addis ababa on  march  gugsa welle was met by forces loyal to negus tafari and was defeated at the battle of anchem gugsa welle was killed in action news of gugsa welles defeat and death had hardly spread through addis ababa when the empress died suddenly on  april  although it was long rumored that the empress was poisoned upon the defeat of her husband or alternately that she died from shock upon hearing of the death of her estranged yet beloved husband it has since been documented that the empress succumbed to a flulike fever and complications from diabetes with the passing of zewditu tafari himself rose to emperor and was proclaimed neguse negest zeityoppya king of kings of ethiopia he was crowned on  november  at addis ababas cathedral of st george the coronation was by all accounts a most splendid affair and it was attended by royals and dignitaries from all over the world among those in attendance were george vs son prince henry marshal franchet desperey of france and the prince of udine representing italy emissaries from the united states egypt turkey sweden belgium and japan were also present british author evelyn waugh was also present penning a contemporary report on the event one newspaper report suggested that the celebration may have incurred a cost in excess of  many of those in attendance received lavish gifts in one instance the christian emperor even sent a goldencased bible to an american bishop who had not attended the coronation but who had dedicated a prayer to the emperor on the day of the coronation haile selassie introduced ethiopias first written constitution on  july  providing for a bicameral legislature the constitution kept power in the hands of the nobility but it did establish democratic standards among the nobility envisaging a transition to democratic rule it would prevail until the people are in a position to elect themselves the constitution limited the succession to the throne to the descendants of haile selassie a point that met with the disapprobation of other dynastic princes including the princes of tigrai and even the emperors loyal cousin ras kassa haile darge in  the kingdom of jimma was formally absorbed into ethiopia following the death of king abba jifar ii of jimma conflict with italy the emperor photography by walter mittelholzer february  see also abyssinia crisis and second italoabyssinian war ethiopia became the target of renewed italian imperialist designs in the s benito mussolinis fascist regime was keen to avenge the military defeats italy had suffered to ethiopia in the first italoabyssinian war and to efface the failed attempt by liberal italy to conquer the country as epitomised by the defeat at adowa a conquest of ethiopia could also empower the cause of fascism and embolden its rhetoric of empire ethiopia would also provide a bridge between italys eritrean and italian somaliland possessions ethiopias position in the league of nations did not dissuade the italians from invading in  the collective security envisaged by the league proved useless and a scandal erupted when the hoarelaval pact revealed that ethiopias league allies were scheming to appease italy mobilization following the  italian invasion of ethiopia haile selassie joined his northern armies and set up headquarters at desse in wollo province he issued his famous mobilization order on  october  “ if you withhold from your country ethiopia the death from cough or headcold of which you would otherwise die refusing to resist in your district in your patrimony and in your home our enemy who is coming from a distant country to attack us and if you persist in not shedding your blood you will be rebuked for it by your creator and will be cursed by your offspring hence without cooling your heart of accustomed valour there emerges your decision to fight fiercely mindful of your history that will last far into the future if on your march you touch any property inside houses or cattle and crops outside not even grass straw and dung excluded it is like killing your brother who is dying with you you countryman living at the various access routes set up a market for the army at the places where it is camping and on the day your districtgovernor will indicate to you lest the soldiers campaigning for ethiopias liberty should experience difficulty you will not be charged excise duty until the end of the campaign for anything you are marketing at the military camps i have granted you remission after you have been ordered to go to war but are then idly missing from the campaign and when you are seized by the local chief or by an accuser you will have punishment inflicted upon your inherited land your property and your body to the accuser i shall grant a third of your property ” on  october  haile selassie gave more precise orders for his army to his commanderinchief ras kassa when you set up tents it is to be in caves and by trees and in a wood if the place happens to be adjoining to these―and separated in the various platoons tents are to be set up at a distance of  cubits from each other when an aeroplane is sighted one should leave large open roads and wide meadows and march in valleys and trenches and by zigzag routes along places which have trees and woods when an aeroplane comes to drop bombs it will not suit it to do so unless it comes down to about  metres hence when it flies low for such action one should fire a volley with a good and very long gun and then quickly disperse when three or four bullets have hit it the aeroplane is bound to fall down but let only those fire who have been ordered to shoot with a weapon that has been selected for such firing for if everyone shoots who possesses a gun there is no advantage in this except to waste bullets and to disclose the mens whereabouts lest the aeroplane when rising again should detect the whereabouts of those who are dispersed it is well to remain cautiously scattered as long as it is still fairly close in time of war it suits the enemy to aim his guns at adorned shields ornaments silver and gold cloaks silk shirts and all similar things whether one possesses a jacket or not it is best to wear a narrowsleeved shirt with faded colours when we return with gods help you can wear your gold and silver decorations then now it is time to go and fight we offer you all these words of advice in the hope that no great harm should befall you through lack of caution at the same time we are glad to assure you that in time of war we are ready to shed our blood in your midst for the sake of ethiopias freedom compared to the ethiopians the italians had an advanced modern military which included a large air force the italians would also come to employ chemical weapons extensively throughout the conflict even targeting red cross field hospitals in violation of the geneva convention progress of the war starting in early october  the italians invaded ethiopia on  october italian honor was avenged when adwa fell but by november the pace of invasion had slowed appreciably and haile selassies northern armies were able to launch what was known as the christmas offensive during this offensive the italians were forced back in places and put on the defensive however by early in  the first battle of tembien stopped the progress of the ethiopian offensive and the italians were ready to continue their offensive following the defeat and destruction of the northern ethiopian armies at the battle of amba aradam the second battle of tembien and the battle of shire haile selassie took the field with the last ethiopian army on the northern front on  march  he launched a counterattack against the italians himself at the battle of maychew in southern tigray the emperors army was defeated and retreated in disarray as haile selassies army withdrew the italians attacked from the air along with rebellious raya and azebo tribesmen on the ground who were armed and paid by the italians when the struggle to resist italy appeared doomed haile selassie traveled to the rockhewn churches of lalibela for fasting and prayer haile selassie made a solitary pilgrimage to the churches at lalibela at considerable risk of capture before returning to his capital after a stormy session of the council of state it was agreed that because addis ababa could not be defended the government would relocate to the southern town of gore and that in the interest of preserving the imperial house the emperors wife menen asfaw and the rest of the imperial family should immediately depart for djibouti and from there continue on to jerusalem exile debate the emperor arrives in jerusalem after further debate as to whether haile selassie should go to gore or accompany his family into exile it was agreed that haile selassie should leave ethiopia with his family and present the case of ethiopia to the league of nations at geneva the decision was not unanimous and several participants including the nobleman page blatta tekle wolde hawariat objected to the idea of an ethiopian monarch fleeing before an invading force haile selassie appointed his cousin ras imru haile selassie as prince regent in his absence departing with his family for djibouti on  may  on  may marshal pietro badoglio led italian troops into addis ababa and mussolini declared ethiopia an italian province victor emanuel iii was proclaimed as the new emperor of ethiopia however on the previous day the ethiopian exiles had left djibouti aboard the british cruiser hms enterprise they were bound for jerusalem in the british mandate of palestine where the ethiopian royal family maintained a residence the imperial family disembarked at haifa and then went on to jerusalem once there haile selassie and his retinue prepared to make their case at geneva the choice of jerusalem was highly symbolic since the solomonic dynasty claimed descent from the house of david leaving the holy land haile selassie and his entourage sailed for gibraltar aboard the british cruiser hms capetown from gibraltar the exiles were transferred to an ordinary liner by doing this the government of the united kingdom was spared the expense of a state reception collective security and the league of nations  mussolini upon invading ethiopia had promptly declared his own italian empire because the league of nations afforded haile selassie the opportunity to address the assembly italy even withdrew its league delegation on  may  it was in this context that haile selassie walked into the hall of the league of nations introduced by the president of the assembly as his imperial majesty the emperor of ethiopia sa majesté imperiale lempereur dethiopie the introduction caused a great many italian journalists in the galleries to erupt into jeering heckling and whistling as it turned out they had earlier been issued whistles by mussolinis soninlaw count galeazzo ciano haile selassie waited calmly for the hall to be cleared and responded majestically with a speech sometimes considered among the most stirring of the th century although fluent in french the working language of the league haile selassie chose to deliver his historic speech in his native amharic he asserted that because his confidence in the league was absolute his people were now being slaughtered he pointed out that the same european states that found in ethiopias favor at the league of nations were refusing ethiopia credit and war matériel while aiding italy which was employing chemical weapons on military and civilian targets alike it was at the time when the operations for the encircling of makale were taking place that the italian command fearing a rout followed the procedure which it is now my duty to denounce to the world special sprayers were installed on board aircraft so that they could vaporize over vast areas of territory a fine deathdealing rain groups of nine fifteen eighteen aircraft followed one another so that the fog issuing from them formed a continuous sheet it was thus that as from the end of january  soldiers women children cattle rivers lakes and pastures were drenched continually with this deadly rain in order to kill off systematically all living creatures in order to more surely poison waters and pastures the italian command made its aircraft pass over and over again that was its chief method of warfare noting that his own small people of  million inhabitants without arms without resources could never withstand an attack by a large power such as italy with its  million people and unlimited quantities of the most deathdealing weapons he contended that all small states were threatened by the aggression and that all small states were in effect reduced to vassal states in the absence of collective action he admonished the league that god and history will remember your judgment it is collective security it is the very existence of the league of nations it is the confidence that each state is to place in international treaties in a word it is international morality that is at stake have the signatures appended to a treaty value only in so far as the signatory powers have a personal direct and immediate interest involved the speech made the emperor an icon for antifascists around the world and time magazine named him man of the year he failed however to get what he most needed the league agreed to only partial and ineffective sanctions on italy and several members even recognized the italian conquest exile haile selassie in  haile selassie spent his exile years – in bath united kingdom in fairfield house which he bought the emperor and ras kassa took morning walks together behind the high walls of the room georgian house haile selassies favorite reading was diplomatic history but most of his serious hours were occupied with the word story of his life which he was laboriously writing in amharic prior to fairfield house he briefly stayed at warnes hotel in worthing and in parkside wimbledon a bust of haile selassie is in nearby cannizaro park to commemorate this time and is a popular place of pilgrimage for londons rastafarian community haile selassies activity in this period was focused on countering italian propaganda as to the state of ethiopian resistance and the legality of the occupation he spoke out against the desecration of houses of worship and historical artifacts including the theft of a year old imperial obelisk and condemned the atrocities suffered by the ethiopian civilian population he continued to plead for league intervention and to voice his certainty that gods judgment will eventually visit the weak and the mighty alike though his attempts to gain support for the struggle against italy were largely unsuccessful until italy entered world war ii on the german side in june  the emperors pleas for international support did take root in the united states particularly among african american organizations sympathetic to the ethiopian cause in  haile selassie was to give a christmas day radio address to the american people to thank his supporters when his taxi was involved in a traffic accident leaving him with a fractured knee rather than canceling the radio appearance he proceeded in much pain to complete the address in which he linked christianity and goodwill with the covenant of the league of nations and asserted that war is not the only means to stop war with the birth of the son of god an unprecedented an unrepeatable and a longanticipated phenomenon occurred he was born in a stable instead of a palace in a manger instead of a crib the hearts of the wise men were struck by fear and wonder due to his majestic humbleness the kings prostrated themselves before him and worshipped him peace be to those who have good will this became the first message  although the toils of wise people may earn them respect it is a fact of life that the spirit of the wicked continues to cast its shadow on this world the arrogant are seen visibly leading their people into crime and destruction the laws of the league of nations are constantly violated and wars and acts of aggression repeatedly take place so that the spirit of the cursed will not gain predominance over the human race whom christ redeemed with his blood all peaceloving people should cooperate to stand firm in order to preserve and promote lawfulness and peace during this period haile selassie suffered several personal tragedies his two sonsinlaw ras desta damtew and dejazmach beyene merid were both executed by the italians the emperors daughter princess romanework wife of dejazmach beyene merid was herself taken into captivity with her children and she died in italy in  his daughter tsehai died during childbirth shortly after the restoration in  after his return to ethiopia he donated fairfield house to the city of bath as a residence for the aged and it remains so to this day s and s british forces which consisted primarily of ethiopianbacked african and south african colonial troops under the gideon force of colonel orde wingate coordinated the military effort to liberate ethiopia the emperor himself issued several imperial proclamations in this period demonstrating that while authority was not divided up in any formal way british military might and the emperors populist appeal could be joined in the concerted effort to liberate ethiopia on  january  during the east african campaign haile selassie crossed the border between sudan and ethiopia near the village of um iddla the standard of the lion of judah was raised again two days later he and a force of ethiopian patriots joined gideon force which was already in ethiopia and preparing the way italy was defeated by a force of the united kingdom the commonwealth of nations free france free belgium and ethiopian patriots on  may  haile selassie entered addis ababa and personally addressed the ethiopian people five years to the day since his  exile today is the day on which we defeated our enemy therefore when we say let us rejoice with our hearts let not our rejoicing be in any other way but in the spirit of christ do not return evil for evil do not indulge in the atrocities which the enemy has been practicing in his usual way even to the last take care not to spoil the good name of ethiopia by acts which are worthy of the enemy we shall see that our enemies are disarmed and sent out the same way they came as st george who killed the dragon is the patron saint of our army as well as of our allies let us unite with our allies in everlasting friendship and amity in order to be able to stand against the godless and cruel dragon which has newly risen and which is oppressing mankind after world war ii ethiopia became a charter member of the united nations in  the ogaden a region disputed with somalia was granted to ethiopia on  december  the un general assembly adopted resolution  v establishing the federation of eritrea the former italian colony into ethiopia eritrea was to have its own constitution which would provide for ethnic linguistic and cultural balance while ethiopia was to manage its finances defense and foreign policy despite his centralization policies that had been made before world war ii haile selassie still found himself unable to push for all the programs he wanted in  he attempted to institute a progressive tax scheme but this failed due to opposition from the nobility and only a flat tax was passed in  he agreed to reduce this as well ethiopia was still semifeudal and the emperors attempts to alter its social and economic form by reforming its modes of taxation met with resistance from the nobility and clergy which were eager to resume their privileges in the postwar era where haile selassie actually did succeed in effecting new land taxes the burdens were often passed by the landowners to the peasants despite his wishes the tax burden remained primarily on the peasants between  and  haile selassie worked to establish the autocephaly of the ethiopian orthodox church the ethiopian orthodox church had been headed by the abuna a bishop who answered to the partriarchate in egypt haile selassie applied to egypts holy synod in  and  to establish the independence of ethiopian bishops and when his appeals were denied he threatened to sever relations with the see of st mark finally in  pope kyrillos vi elevated the abuna to patriarchcatholicos the ethiopian church remained affiliated with the alexandrian church in addition to these efforts haile selassie changed the ethiopian churchstate relationship by introducing taxation of church lands and by restricting the legal privileges of the clergy who had formerly been tried in their own courts for civil offenses in keeping with the principle of collective security for which he was an outspoken proponent he sent a contingent under general mulugueta bulli known as the kagnew battalion to take part in the un conflict in korea it was attached to the american th infantry division and fought in a number of engagements including the battle of pork chop hill in a  speech the emperor spoke of ethiopian participation in the korean conflict as a redemption of the principles of collective security nearly two decades ago i personally assumed before history the responsibility of placing the fate of my beloved people on the issue of collective security for surely at that time and for the first time in world history that issue was posed in all its clarity my searching of conscience convinced me of the rightness of my course and if after untold sufferings and indeed unaided resistance at the time of aggression we now see the final vindication of that principle in our joint action in korea i can only be thankful that god gave me strength to persist in our faith until the moment of its recent glorious vindication haile selassie emperor of ethiopia photographed during a radio broadcast during the celebrations of his silver jubilee in november  haile selassie introduced a revised constitution whereby he retained effective power while extending political participation to the people by allowing the lower house of parliament to become an elected body party politics were not provided for modern educational methods were more widely spread throughout the empire and the country embarked on a development scheme and plans for modernization tempered by ethiopian traditions and within the framework of the ancient monarchical structure of the state haile selassie compromised when practical with the traditionalists in the nobility and church he also tried to improve relations between the state and ethnic groups and granted autonomy to afar lands that were difficult to control still his reforms to end feudalism were slow and weakened by the compromises he made with the entrenched aristocracy the revised constitution of  has been criticized for reasserting the indisputable power of the monarch and maintaining the relative powerlessness of the peasants his international fame and acceptance also grew in  he visited west germany becoming the first head of state to do so after the end of world war iicitation needed many elderly germans still vividly recall the emperors visit as it signaled their acceptance back into the world as a peaceful nation he donated blankets produced by the debre birhan blanket factory in ethiopia to the warravaged german people emperor haile selassie and empress menen attending mass on their silver jubilee day november   at the orthodox cathedral of st george s haile selassie contributed ethiopian troops to the united nations operation in the congo peacekeeping force during the  congo crisis to consolidate congolese integrity and independence from belgian troops per united nations security council resolution  on  december  while haile selassie was on a state visit to brazil his imperial guard forces staged an unsuccessful coup attempt briefly proclaiming haile selassies eldest son asfa wossen as emperor the coup détat was crushed by the regular army and police forces the coup attempt lacked broad popular support was denounced by the ethiopian orthodox church and was unpopular among the army air and police forces nonetheless the effort to depose the emperor had support among students and the educated classes the coup attempt has been characterized as a pivotal moment in ethiopian history the point at which ethiopians for the first time questioned the power of the king to rule without the peoples consent student populations began to empathize with the peasantry and poor and to advocate on their behalf the coup spurred haile selassie to accelerate reform which manifested in the form of land grants to military and police officials the emperor continued to be a staunch ally of the west while pursuing a firm policy of decolonization in africa which was still largely under european colonial rule the united nations conducted a lengthy inquiry regarding the status of eritrea with the superpowers each vying for a stake in the states future britain the administrator at the time suggested the partition of eritrea between sudan and ethiopia separating christians and muslims the idea was instantly rejected by eritrean political parties as well as the un a un plebiscite voted  to  to have eritrea be federated with ethiopia which was later stipulated on  december  in resolution  v eritrea would have its own parliament and administration and would be represented in what had been the ethiopian parliament and would become the federal parliament however haile selassie would have none of european attempts to draft a separate constitution under which eritrea would be governed and wanted his own  constitution protecting families to apply in both ethiopia and eritrea in  the year eritrean struggle for independence began followed by haile selassies dissolution of the federation and shutting down of eritreas parliament in  tensions between independenceminded eritreans and ethiopian forces culminated in the eritrean war of independence the emperor declared eritrea the fourteenth province of ethiopia in  the war would continue for  years as first haile selassie then the sovietbacked junta that succeeded him attempted to retain eritrea by force in  haile selassie presided over the establishment of the organisation of african unity with the new organization establishing its headquarters in addis ababa as more african states won their independence he played an important role as panafricanist and along with modibo keïta of mali was successful in negotiating the bamako accords which brought an end to the border conflict between morocco and algeria also in  on october  selassie addressed the general assembly of the united nations referring in his address to his earlier speech to the league of nations twentyseven years ago as emperor of ethiopia i mounted the rostrum in geneva switzerland to address the league of nations and to appeal for relief from the destruction which had been unleashed against my defenceless nation by the fascist invader i spoke then both to and for the conscience of the world my words went unheeded but history testifies to the accuracy of the warning that i gave in  today i stand before the world organization which has succeeded to the mantle discarded by its discredited predecessor in this body is enshrined the principle of collective security which i unsuccessfully invoked at geneva here in this assembly reposes the best — perhaps the last — hope for the peaceful survival of mankind on  november  the emperor was among other headsofstate including french president charles de gaulle who traveled to washington dc and attended the burial of assassinated american president john f kennedy at arlington national cemetery in  haile selassie attempted to create a modern progressive taxcitation needed that included registration of land which would significantly weaken the nobility even with alterations this law led to a revolt in gojjam which was repressed although enforcement of the tax was abandoned the revolt having achieved its design in undermining the tax encouraged other landowners to defy haile selassie haile selassie on a state visit to washington  student unrest became a regular feature of ethiopian life in the s and s marxism took root in large segments of the ethiopian intelligentsia particularly among those who had studied abroad and had thus been exposed to radical and leftwing sentiments that were becoming popular in other parts of the globe resistance by conservative elements at the imperial court and parliament and by the ethiopian orthodox church made haile selassies land reform proposals difficult to implement and also damaged the standing of the government costing haile selassie much of the goodwill he had once enjoyed this bred resentment among the peasant population efforts to weaken unions also hurt his image as these issues began to pile up haile selassie left much of domestic governance to his prime minister aklilu habte wold and concentrated more on foreign affairs s outside of ethiopia haile selassie continued to enjoy enormous prestige and respect as the longest serving head of state in power haile selassie was often given precedence over other leaders at state events such as the state funerals of john f kennedy and charles de gaulle the summits of the nonaligned movement and the  celebration of the  years of the persian empire his high profile and frequent travels around the world raised ethiopias international imagecitation needed wollo famine famine mostly in wollo northeastern ethiopia as well as in some parts of tigray is estimated to have killed  to  ethiopians between  although the region is infamous for recurrent crop failures and continuous food shortage and starvation risk this episode was remarkably severe it led to the  production of the itv programme the unknown famine by jonathan dimbleby dimblebys report suggested a far higher death toll than was borne out by the facts stimulating a massive influx of aid while at the same time destabilizing haile selassies regime the  oil crisis the severity of which is demonstrated by this graph hit ethiopia amidst a devastating famine compounding its effect and undermining support for the emperor some reports suggest that the emperor was unaware of the extent of the famine while others assert that he was well aware of it in addition to the exposure of attempts by corrupt local officials to cover up the famine from the imperial government the kremlins depiction of haile selassies ethiopia as backwards and inept relative to the purported utopia of marxismleninism contributed to the popular uprising that led to its downfall and the rise of mengistu haile mariam the famine and its image in the media undermined popular support of the government and haile selassies once unassailable personal popularity fell the crisis was exacerbated by military mutinies and high oil prices the latter a result of the  oil crisis the international economic crisis triggered by the oil crisis caused the costs of imported goods gasoline and food to skyrocket while unemployment spiked revolution in february  four days of serious riots in addis against a sudden economic inflation left five dead the emperor responded by announcing on national television a rollback of gasoline prices and a freeze on the cost of basic commodities this calmed the public but the promised  military wage hike was not substantial enough to pacify the army which then mutinied beginning in asmara and spreading throughout the empire this mutiny led to the resignation of prime minister aklilu habte wold on  february  haile selassie again went on television to agree to the armys demands for still greater pay and named endalkatchew makonnen as his new prime minister however despite endalkatchews many concessions discontent continued in march with a fourday general strike that paralyzed the nation imprisonment the derg a committee of lowranking military officers and enlisted men set up in june to investigate the militarys demands took advantage of the governments disarray to depose haile selassie on  september  general aman mikael andom a protestant of eritrean origin served briefly as provisional head of state pending the return of crown prince asfa wossen who was then receiving medical treatment abroad haile selassie was placed under house arrest briefly at the th army division in addis ababa while most of his family was detained at the late duke of harrars residence in the north of the capital the last months of the emperors life were spent in imprisonment in the grand palace later most of the imperial family was imprisoned in the addis ababa prison known as alem bekagn or i am finished with the world on  november   former high officials of the imperial government known as the sixty were executed without trial the executed included haile selassies grandson and two former prime ministers these killings known to ethiopians as bloody saturday were condemned by crown prince asfa wossen the derg responded to his rebuke by revoking its acknowledgment of his imperial legitimacy and announcing the end of the solomonic dynasty death and internment on  august  the state media officially reported publicly that the exmonarch haile selassie had died on  august of respiratory failure following complications from a prostate operation his doctor asrat woldeyes denied that complications had occurred and rejected the government version of his death some imperial loyalists believed that the emperor had in fact been assassinated and this belief remains widely held one western correspondent in ethiopia at the time commented while it is not known what actually happened there are strong indications that no efforts were made to save him it is unlikely that he was actually killed such rumors were bound to arise no matter what happened given the atmosphere of suspicion and distrust prevailing in addis ababa at the time the sovietbacked derg fell in  in  the emperors bones were found under a concrete slab on the palace grounds some reports suggest that his remains were discovered beneath a latrine for almost a decade thereafter as ethiopian courts attempted to sort out the circumstances of his death his coffin rested in bhata church near his great uncle menelik iis imperial resting place on  november  haile selassie was given an imperial funeral by the ethiopian orthodox church the postcommunist government refused calls to declare the ceremony an official imperial funeral although such prominent rastafarian figures as rita marley and others participated in the grand funeral most rastafari rejected the event and refused to accept that the bones were the remains of haile selassie there remains some debate within the rastafari movement as to whether haile selassie actually died in  children asfaw wossen eldest son of haile selassie i on a voyage to jerusalem in  by menen asfaw haile selassie had six children princess tenagnework crown prince asfaw wossen princess tsehai princess zenebework prince makonnen and prince sahle selassie there is some controversy as to haile selassies eldest daughter princess romanework haile selassie while the living members of the royal family state that romanework is the eldest daughter of empress menen it has been asserted that princess romanework is actually the daughter of a previous union of the emperor with woizero altayech the emperors own autobiography makes no mention of a previous marriage or having fathered children with anyone other than empress menen prince asfaw wossen was first married to princess wolete israel seyoum and then following their divorce to princess medferiashwork abebe prince makonnen was married to princess sara gizaw prince

incarnate among followers of the rastafari movement taken from haile selassies preimperial name ras — meaning head  a title equivalent to duke — tafari makonnen which emerged in jamaica during the s under the influence of marcus garveys pan africanism movement and as the messiah who will lead the peoples of africa and the african diaspora to freedom his official titles conquering lion of the tribe of judah king of kings and elect of god and his traditional lineage from solomon and sheba are perceived by rastafarians as confirmation of the return of the messiah in the prophetic book of revelation in the new testament king of kings lord of lords conquering lion of the tribe of judah and root of david rastafari faith in the incarnate divinity of haile selassie began after news reports of his coronation reached jamaica particularly via the two time magazine articles on the coronation the week before and the week after the event haile selassies own perspectives permeate the philosophy of the movement in  the jamaican government sent a delegation composed of both rastafari and nonrastafari leaders to ethiopia to discuss the matter of repatriation among other issues with the emperor he reportedly told the rastafarian delegation which included mortimer planno tell the brethren to be not dismayed i personally will give my assistance in the matter of repatriation when haile selassie visited jamaica on the st april  somewhere around one hundred thousand rastafari from all over jamaica descended on palisadoes airport in kingston having heard that the man whom they considered to be their messiah was coming to visit them spliffs and chalices were openly smoked causing a haze of ganja smoke to drift through the air when haile selassie arrived at the airport he was unable to come down the mobile steps of the airplane as the crowd rushed the tarmac he then returned into the plane disappearing for several more minutes finally jamaican authorities were obliged to request ras mortimer planno a wellknown rasta leader to climb the steps enter the plane and negotiate the emperors descent when planno reemerged he announced to the crowd the emperor has instructed me to tell you to be calm step back and let the emperor land this day widely held by scholars to be a major turning point for the movement is still commemorated by rastafarians as grounation day the anniversary of which is celebrated as the second holiest holiday after  november the emperors coronation day from then on as a result of plannos actions the jamaican authorities were asked to ensure that rastafarian representatives were present at all state functions attended by his majesty and rastafarian elders also ensured that they obtained a private audience with the emperor where he reportedly told them that they should not emigrate to ethiopia until they had first liberated the people of jamaica this dictum came to be known as liberation before repatriation defying expectations of the jamaican authorities haile selassie never rebuked the rastafari for their belief in him as the returned jesus instead he presented the movements faithful elders with gold medallions – the only recipients of such an honor on this visit during pnp leader later jamaican prime minister michael manleys visit to ethiopia in october  the emperor allegedly still recalled his  reception with amazement and stated that he felt he had to be respectful of their beliefs this was the visit when manley received as a present from the emperor the rod of correction or rod of joshua that is thought to have helped him to win the  election in jamaica rita marley bob marleys wife converted to the rastafari faith after seeing haile selassie on his jamaican trip she claimed in interviews and in her book no woman no cry that she saw a stigmata print on the palm of haile selassies hand as he waved to the crowd that resembled the envisioned markings on christs hands from being nailed to the cross—a claim that was not supported by other sources but was used as evidence for her and other rastafarians to suggest that haile selassie i was indeed their messiah she was also influential in the conversion of bob marley who then became internationally recognized and as a result rastafari became much better known throughout much of the world bob marleys posthumously released song iron lion zion refers to haile selassiecitation needed haile selassies attitude to the rastafari haile selassie i was the titular head of the ethiopian orthodox church and until his visit to jamaica in  he had never confirmed nor denied that he was divine during his visit he specifically declined to contradict the rastafari belief that he was god after his return to ethiopia he dispatched archbishop abuna yesehaq mandefro to the caribbean to help draw rastafarians and other west indians to the ethiopian church and according to some sources denied his divinity in  haile selassie donated a piece of land at shashamane  km south of addis ababa for the use of blacks from the west indies numerous rastafari families settled there and still live as a community to this day famous quotations a house built on granite and strong foundations not even the onslaught of pouring rain gushing torrents and strong winds will be able to pull down some people have written the story of my life representing as truth what in fact derives from ignorance error or envy but they cannot shake the truth from its place even if they attempt to make others believe it —preface to my life and ethiopias progress autobiography of hm haile selassie i english translation that until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another inferior is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned that until there are no longer firstclass and secondclass citizens of any nation that until the color of a mans skin is of no more significance than the color of his eyes that until the basic human rights are equally guaranteed to all without regard to race that until that day the dream of lasting peace and world citizenship and the rule of international morality will remain but a fleeting illusion to be pursued but never attained and until the ignoble but unhappy regimes that hold our brothers in angola in mozambique and in south africa in subhuman bondage have been toppled and destroyed until bigotry and prejudice and malicious and inhuman selfinterest have been replaced by understanding and tolerance and goodwill until all africans stand and speak as free human beings equal in the eyes of the almighty until that day the african continent shall not know peace we africans will fight if necessary and we know that we shall win as we are confident in the victory of good over evil —english translation of  speech delivered to the united nations and popularized in a song called war by bob marley apart from the kingdom of the lord there is not on this earth any nation that is superior to any other should it happen that a strong government finds it may with impunity destroy a weak people then the hour strikes for that weak people to appeal to the league of nations to give its judgment in all freedom god and history will remember your judgment —address to the league of nations  we have finished the job what shall we do with the tools — telegram to winston churchill  throughout history it has been the inaction of those who could have acted the indifference of those who should have known better the silence of the voice of justice when it mattered most that has made it possible for evil to triumph today i stand before the world organization which has succeeded to the mantle discarded by its discredited predecessor —in a speech to the united nations misguided people sometimes create misguided ideas some of my ancestors were oromo how can i colonize myself — in response to accusations by dissidents i have heard of that idea ie of haile selassie being the reincarnation of jesus christ i also met certain rastafarians i told them clearly that i am a man that i am mortal and that i would be replaced by the oncoming generation and that they should never
