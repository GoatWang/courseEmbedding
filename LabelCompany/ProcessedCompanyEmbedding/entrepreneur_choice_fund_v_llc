llc basics  entrepreneurcom home top  how to magazine franchise  spotlight subscribe starting a business llc basics this hybrid entity brings together some of the best features of partnerships and corporations and is a great choice for entrepreneurs who want to move beyond the sole proprietorship shares june   probably the single greatest disadvantage of the corporate form is the burdensome range of formalities that corporate managers must observe a modern corporations heavy administrative burden is a remnant of the more traditional and formal legal system under which corporate law was cultivated the llc changed all that limited liability companies llcs have been around since  but their popularity among smallbusiness owners is a relatively recent phenomenon the llc offers the liability protection benefits of the corporation without the corporations burdensome formalities this simplicity has made the llc an instantly popular business form for smaller companies llcs are the favorite choice for small businesses with one to three owners working who dont plan to grow the business significantly and dont expect to raise significant amounts of cash but as the number of owners grows the corporation often becomes a more attractive choice as a business form an llc is a hybrid entity bringing together some of the best features of partnerships and corporations llcs were created to provide business owners with the liability protection that corporations enjoy without the double taxation earnings and losses pass through to the owners and are included on their personal tax returns sound similar to an s corporation it is except an llc offers smallbusiness owners even more attractions than an s corporation for example there is no limitation on the number of shareholders an llc can have unlike an s corporation which has a limit of  in addition any member or owner of the llc is allowed a full participatory role in the businesss operation in a limited partnership on the other hand partners are not permitted any say in the operation unlike corporations and like partnerships llcs do not have perpetual life some state statutes stipulate that the company must dissolve after  or  years technically the company dissolves when a member dies quits or retires more pros and cons here are more advantages of the llc form of business organization an llc allows for an unlimited number of members however if the llc has just one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietorship the llc allows for the special allocation of profitsthe disproportionate splitting of member profits and losses in different percentages than their respective percentages of ownership this means that members can enjoy the benefits of receiving profits and writing off losses in excess of their individual ownership percentage the members enjoy limited liability which means they are personally protected from any liability of the llc and successful judgments as well as from the llc itself managing members share of bottomline profit is considered earned income because the managing member is considered to be an active ownertherefore qualifying the managing member for special fringe benefit treatment the members share of the bottomline profit of an llc is not considered earned income and therefore is not subject to selfemployment tax members are compensated using either distributions of profit or guaranteed payments a distribution of profit allows each member to pay themselves by merely writing checkswhenever they need the money provided the business has the available cash guaranteed payments represent earned income to the members thereby qualifying them to enjoy the benefits of taxfavored fringe benefits the managing member of an llc can deduct  percent of the health insurance premiums he or she paysup to the extent of their prorata share of the llcs net profit because the profit is considered earned income note if a member has earned income he or she will also qualify a corporation can be a member of an llc this allows you to create an additional level of ownership which is designed to create an entity that can offer such traditional fringe benefits as retirement plans and an additional level of protection from liability as a member you can contribute capital or other assets to the llc or loan the llc money to put dollars or value into the business you can take dollars out by taking a repayment of your loan plus interest a distribution of profit or a guaranteed payment if any of the members die the llc can continue to existsubject to the unanimous positive vote on the part of all remaining members some of the disadvantages of an llc include each members prorata share of profits represents taxable incomewhether or not a members share of profits is distributed to him or her the managing members share of the bottomline profit of the llc is considered earned income and therefore is subject to selfemployment tax the members share of bottomline profit is not considered earned income because the members are considered to be inactive owners therefore the members do not qualify for special taxfavored fringe benefit treatment as a member of an llc you are not allowed to pay yourself wages some states do not allow the organization of llcs for certain professional vocations for companies that wish to pursue venture capital accumulate a large number of shareholders andor eventually pursue an initial public offering the llc is not an appropriate alternative to a corporation setting it up to set up an llc you must file articles of organization with the secretary of state in the state where you intend to do business some states also require you to file an operating agreement which is similar to a partnership agreement before deciding upon an llc remember to check with your lawyer or accountant about the advantages of the llc in your particular state ask up front what it would cost to form a corporation versus the cost of forming an llc you may be surprised to learn that in some states an llc could be established by filing a simple onepage document which lays out the articles of organization of your llc with the secretary of state you can form an llc for any lawful business as long as the nature of the business is not banking insurance and certain professional service operations such as doctor lawyers or accountants by simply filing articles of organization with the respective state agency an llc takes on a separate identity similar to a corporation but without the tax problems of the corporation it will be taxed like a partnership also youll need two people members to meet the state requirement in many states and to meet the basic federal tax law requirements to obtain the flowthrough tax provisions that are one of the advantages of an llc the cost of setting up an llc is roughly equivalent to setting up a corporation the secretary of states fees for filing articles of organization and for filing annual reports are often the same for both llcs and corporations entrepreneurs who wish to seek help in organizing an llc through an llc formation service or through an attorney will find the fees to be roughly the same even after you settle on a business structure remember that the circumstances that make one type of business organization favorable are always subject to changes in the laws it makes sense to reassess your form of business from time to time to make sure you are using the one that provides the most benefits outgrowing your business structure what should the owners of an llc do if their company grows in size such that an llc is no longer the appropriate business form the answer is simple it is possible to convert an llc into a corporation thus some small companies begin life as llcs outgrow the llc form and then the llcs owners transfer the assets of the llc to a newly formed corporation with the same owners as the llc as one might imagine it is also possible to convert a corporation into an llc or nearly any business form into any other it is also possible to reorganize a business in another state by transferring the assets of a business into a newly chartered entity converting business forms does require some sophisticated legal and tax analysis and should not be attempted without the services of a qualified attorney and accountant this article was excerpted from the books start your own business and entrepreneur magazines ultimate book on forming corporations llcs sole proprietorships and partnerships and the article

location legal topics business formation llcs  corporations llcs limited liability companies forming an llc sole proprietorships vs llcs share on google plus share on facebook as a budding entrepreneur you may face the issue of whether to start out as a sole proprietorship or a limited liability company llc there are key advantages and disadvantages to each form of business and the nature of your enterprise and other business and personal circumstances may impact your choice here are some important factors to consider when assessing the main pros and cons of a sole proprietorship versus an llc ease and costs of formation in the united states a sole proprietorship is the most popular business entity because it is the easiest to form compared to an llc a sole proprietorship is less complex and less expensive and demands less paperwork to start you only need to begin transacting business and make sure you have any required licenses and permits and you have started your new enterprise to establish an llc you must form and register your llc entity with the applicable state agency often the secretary of state’s office you must draft and file articles of organization and pay a filing fee which can be hundreds of dollars in some states your llc filing typically spells out your llc’s name principal office’s location your owners’ or members’ names the expected term of your llc and any other statemandated information if there are two or more owners of your llc you may want to seek the assistance of a legal professional to draft an operating agreement which spells out such details as each member’s duties capital contributions and rights to profits setting up an llc requires more upfront time money and effort than a sole proprietorship so you’ll have to factor that in when deciding which entity is best for you raising capital for your startup every business needs capital in order to start and maintain its operations with a sole proprietorship you will need to fund your own business using your personal resources or by seeking out loans establishing a line of credit or receiving loan approval from a bank or other lending institution may be a daunting challenge for a new entrepreneur often you will be required to provide a personal guaranty for any loan to your business however if your llc has other members you and your fellow owners can pool together your resources and reach out to a broader network of potential business contacts bringing in additional members may also help to fund your new llc reviewing your financial resources credit history and business investment potential will help determine if you can afford to go it alone as a sole proprietor or if you will need the additional resources that other owners can provide taxation of your business for federal tax purposes a sole proprietor’s income is taxed on an individual income tax return similarly llcs receive “pass through” treatment allowing allocated profits to be taxed on each member’s individual income tax return if your llc qualifies as a partnership or s corporation it may also receive “pass through” treatment since federal income tax treatment is similar this factor may not play a major role in choosing between a sole proprietorship and llc consult a tax professional to determine if state or local taxes will impact your startup’s tax situation your role in daily business management if you like being your own boss then a sole proprietorship or a single member llc may be right up your alley under either of these approaches you have the opportunity to go solo in managing marketing financing and determining the policies and direction of your business you won’t have to consult with or receive prior approval from other owners on your business decisions however if you have fellow llc owners you will need to delineate your roles and expectations in running your llc under an operating agreement if you are not an experienced business person you might find it helpful to collaborate with other owners on business decisions it may be useful to have other llc members so you may learn from their professional experiences share management and marketing duties and draw additional funding from your fellow llc owners determine if you prefer to operate your business solo or manage it with other owners risks of personal liability under the sole proprietorship you and your business are viewed as one in the same therefore you have unlimited personal liability for all of the debts and legal liabilities of your sole proprietorship your personal assets such as your home or personal bank account could be at risk to satisfy unpaid debts legal judgments and other legal obligations of your startup on the other hand an llc is a separate legal entity and an llc member is normally not personally liable for the llc’s debts or legal liabilities as an llc owner you are mainly putting your financial contribution to your llc not your other personal assets on the line however as an llc owner you may still be personally liable for your own conduct or llc loans in some cases for example you may still be responsible if you personally guaranteed repayment of an llc loan or if your own acts cause harm to a third party or to your llc like any business person it is important to consider appropriate liability and other forms of insurance to help protect your personal assets and your business overall the sole proprietorship tends to expose a business owner to greater risks of personal liability assessing your comfort level with personal liability risks should be an important aspect of your decisionmaking process the small business administration provides general information about starting

cee home  cee  nd edition  entrepreneurship an entrepreneur is someone who organizes manages and assumes the risks of a business or enterprise an entrepreneur is an agent of change entrepreneurship is the process of discovering new ways of combining resources when the market value generated by this new combination of resources is greater than the market value these resources can generate elsewhere individually or in some other combination the entrepreneur makes a profit an entrepreneur who takes the resources necessary to produce a pair of jeans that can be sold for thirty dollars and instead turns them into a denim backpack that sells for fifty dollars will earn a profit by increasing the value those resources create this comparison is possible because in competitive resource markets an entrepreneur’s costs of production are determined by the prices required to bid the necessary resources away from alternative uses those prices will be equal to the value that the resources could create in their nextbest alternate uses because the price of purchasing resources measures this opportunity cost— the value of the forgone alternatives—the profit entrepreneurs make reflects the amount by which they have increased the value generated by the resources under their control entrepreneurs who make a loss however have reduced the value created by the resources under their control that is those resources could have produced more value elsewhere losses mean that an entrepreneur has essentially turned a fiftydollar denim backpack into a thirtydollar pair of jeans this error in judgment is part of the entrepreneurial learning or discovery process vital to the efficient operation of markets the profitandloss system of capitalism helps to quickly sort through the many new resource combinations entrepreneurs discover a vibrant growing economy depends on the efficiency of the process by which new ideas are quickly discovered acted on and labeled as successes or failures just as important as identifying successes is making sure that failures are quickly extinguished freeing poorly used resources to go elsewhere this is the positive side of business failure successful entrepreneurs expand the size of the economic pie for everyone bill gates who as an undergraduate at harvard developed basic for the first microcomputer went on to help found microsoft in  during the s ibm contracted with gates to provide the operating system for its computers a system now known as msdos gates procured the software from another firm essentially turning the thirtydollar pair of jeans into a multibilliondollar product microsoft’s office and windows operating software now run on about  percent of the world’s computers by making software that increases human productivity gates expanded our ability to generate output and income resulting in a higher standard of living for all sam walton the founder of walmart was another entrepreneur who touched millions of lives in a positive way his innovations in distribution warehouse centers and inventory control allowed walmart to grow in less than thirty years from a single store in arkansas to the nation’s largest retail chain shoppers benefit from the low prices and convenient locations that walton’s walmarts provide along with other entrepreneurs such as ted turner cnn henry ford ford automobiles ray kroc mcdonald’s franchising and fred smith fedex walton significantly improved the everyday life of billions of people all over the world the word “entrepreneur” originates from a thirteenthcentury french verb entreprendre meaning “to do something” or “to undertake” by the sixteenth century the noun form entrepreneur was being used to refer to someone who undertakes a business venture the first academic use of the word by an economist was likely in  by richard cantillon who identified the willingness to bear the personal financial risk of a business venture as the defining characteristic of an entrepreneur in the early s economists jeanbaptiste say and john stuart mill further popularized the academic usage of the word “entrepreneur” say stressed the role of the entrepreneur in creating value by moving resources out of less productive areas and into more productive ones mill used the term “entrepreneur” in his popular  book principles of political economy to refer to a person who assumes both the risk and the management of a business in this manner mill provided a clearer distinction than cantillon between an entrepreneur and other business owners such as shareholders of a corporation who assume financial risk but do not actively participate in the daytoday operations or management of the firm two notable twentiethcentury economists joseph schumpeter and israel kirzner further refined the academic understanding of entrepreneurship schumpeter stressed the role of the entrepreneur as an innovator who implements change in an economy by introducing new goods or new methods of production in the schumpeterian view the entrepreneur is a disruptive force in an economy schumpeter emphasized the beneficial process of creative destruction in which the introduction of new products results in the obsolescence or failure of others the introduction of the compact disc and the corresponding disappearance of the vinyl record is just one of many examples of creative destruction cars electricity aircraft and personal computers are others in contrast to schumpeter’s view kirzner focused on entrepreneurship as a process of discovery kirzner’s entrepreneur is a person who discovers previously unnoticed profit opportunities the entrepreneur’s discovery initiates a process in which these newly discovered profit opportunities are then acted on in the marketplace until market competition eliminates the profit opportunity unlike schumpeter’s disruptive force kirzner’s entrepreneur is an equilibrating force an example of such an entrepreneur would be someone in a college town who discovers that a recent increase in college enrollment has created a profit opportunity in renovating houses and turning them into rental apartments economists in the modern austrian school of economics have further refined and developed the ideas of schumpeter and kirzner during the s and s state and local governments across the united states abandoned their previous focus on attracting large manufacturing firms as the centerpiece of economic development policy and instead shifted their focus to promoting entrepreneurship this same period witnessed a dramatic increase in empirical research on entrepreneurship some of these studies explore the effect of demographic and socioeconomic factors on the likelihood of a person choosing to become an entrepreneur others explore the impact of taxes on entrepreneurial activity this literature is still hampered by the lack of a clear measure of entrepreneurial activity at the us state level scholars generally measure entrepreneurship by using numbers of selfemployed people the deficiency in such a measure is that some people become selfemployed partly to avoid or even evade income and payroll taxes some studies find for example that higher income tax rates are associated with higher rates of selfemployment this counterintuitive result is likely explained by the higher tax rates encouraging more tax evasion through individuals filing taxes as selfemployed economists have also found that higher taxes on inheritance are associated with a lower likelihood of individuals becoming entrepreneurs some empirical studies have attempted to determine the contribution of entrepreneurial activity to overall economic growth the majority of the widely cited studies use international data taking advantage of the index of entrepreneurial activity for each country published annually in the global entrepreneurship monitor these studies conclude that between onethird and onehalf of the differences in economic growth rates across countries can be explained by differing rates of entrepreneurial activity similar strong results have been found at the state and local levels infusions of venture capital funding economists find do not necessarily foster entrepreneurship capital is more mobile than labor and funding naturally flows to those areas where creative and potentially profitable ideas are being generated this means that promoting individual entrepreneurs is more important for economic development policy than is attracting venture capital at the initial stages while funding can increase the odds of new business survival it does not create new ideas funding follows ideas not vice versa one of the largest remaining disagreements in the applied academic literature concerns what constitutes entrepreneurship should a smalltown housewife who opens her own daycare business be counted the same as someone like bill gates or sam walton if not how are these different activities classified and where do we draw the line this uncertainty has led to the terms “lifestyle” entrepreneur and “gazelle” or “high growth” entrepreneur lifestyle entrepreneurs open their own businesses primarily for the nonmonetary benefits associated with being their own bosses and setting their own schedules gazelle entrepreneurs often move from one startup business to another with a welldefined growth plan and exit strategy while this distinction seems conceptually obvious empirically separating these two groups is difficult when we cannot observe individual motives this becomes an even greater problem as researchers try to answer questions such as whether the policies that promote urban entrepreneurship can also work in rural areas researchers on rural entrepreneurship have recently shown that the internet can make it easier for rural entrepreneurs to reach a larger market because as adam smith pointed out specialization is limited by the extent of the market rural entrepreneurs can specialize more successfully when they can sell to a large number of online customers what is government’s role in promoting or stifling entrepreneurship because the early research on entrepreneurship was done mainly by noneconomists mostly actual entrepreneurs and management faculty at business schools the prevailing belief was that new government programs were the best way to promote entrepreneurship among the most popular proposals were governmentmanaged loan funds government subsidies governmentfunded business development centers and entrepreneurial curriculum in public schools these programs however have generally failed governmentfunded and managed loan funds such as are found in maine minnesota and iowa have suffered from the same poor incentives and political pressures that plague so many other government agencies my own recent research along with that of other economists has found that the public policy that best fosters entrepreneurship is economic freedom our research focuses on the public choice reasons why these government programs are likely to fail and on how improved “rules of the game” lower and less complex taxes and regulations more secure property rights an unbiased judicial system etc promote entrepreneurial activity steven kreft and russell sobel  showed entrepreneurial activity to be highly correlated with the “economic freedom index” a measure of the existence of such promarket institutions this relationship between freedom and entrepreneurship also holds using more widely accepted indexes of entrepreneurial activity from the global entrepreneurship monitor and economic freedom from gwartney and lawson’s economic freedom of the world that are available selectively at the international level this relationship holds whether the countries studied are economies moving out of socialism or economies of oecd countries figure  shows the strength of this relationship among oecd countries the dashed line in the figure shows the positive relationship between economic freedom and entrepreneurial activity when other demographic and socioeconomic factors are controlled for the relationship is even stronger this finding is consistent with the strong positive correlation between economic freedom and the growth of per capita income that other researchers have found one reason economic freedom produces economic growth is that economic freedom fosters entrepreneurial activity figure  economic freedom and entrepreneurship in oecd countries  zoom economists william baumol and peter boettke popularized the idea that capitalism is significantly more productive than alternative forms of economic organization because under capitalism entrepreneurial effort is channeled into activities that produce wealth rather than into activities that forcibly take other people’s wealth entrepreneurs note baumol and boettke are present in all societies in governmentcontrolled societies entrepreneurial people go into government or lobby government and much of the government action that results—tariffs subsidies and regulations for example—destroys wealth in economies with limited governments and rule of law entrepreneurs produce wealth baumol’s and boettke’s idea is consistent with the data and research linking economic freedom which is a measure of the presence of good institutions to both entrepreneurship and economic growth the recent academic research on entrepreneurship shows that to promote entrepreneurship government policy should focus on reforming basic institutions to create an environment in which creative individuals can flourish that environment is one of welldefined and enforced property rights low taxes and regulations sound legal and monetary systems proper contract enforcement and limited government intervention about the author russell s sobel is a professor of economics and james clark coffman distinguished chair in entrepreneurial studies at west virginia
