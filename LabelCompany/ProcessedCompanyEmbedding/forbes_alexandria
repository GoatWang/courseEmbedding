appointment although some may provide online scheduling as well be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early

and great functionality to their projects their recommendations were excellent for getting the best use out of available space and debis selections for colors and finishes were perfect we had a rather dark even with windows knotty pinepanelled darkcarpeted basement that hadnt been updated since the house was built in  they raised the ceilings increased the window size changed the wall coverings and carpet changed the look of the fireplace and added a mantel the space is now a warm inviting and lightfilled room that welcomes you to spend time in it we wanted a bathroom carved out of what had been an unfinished dark and uninviting utility room i dont know how they were able to create an absolutely beautiful and roomy bathroom in the space they had to work with but they did it its now the most the favorite room in the house and the utility room now looks larger even with an additional  long cabinet is certainly brighter and i no longer dread doing laundryall in all a great job the pynes were easy to work with listened carefully to what we wanted and the results show their care and innovation were very pleased and recommend them update we used pyne studios again this time for a more ambitious project of remodeling two bathrooms expanding to add a master closet and a x screened porch with skylights we also added a window in the master bedroom and removed a closet so hardwood floors had to be done and exterior brick had to be patched all of the work was firstrate and we couldnt be more pleased pyne studios inckurtlangenwalter rateddebi and mike came recommendeddebi and mike came recommended as detail oriented remodel professionals we had specific requirements with our bath remodel we wanted to consider and they listened and designed a plan that met them all in our master bath we moved just about everything to get more efficiency and space out of the room while fitting in all the special features debi and mike did a timestaking and detailed job of mapping out our every wisk on the bath we took months to select all the materials and once everything was planned down to the hinge they set a schedule and followed it very closely the subs and work crews were always friendly on time and met by mike or daniel every day we were amazed at the progress made daily we had some bumps along the way but they quickly and professionally took care of them and did all they could to keep the project on schedule with agreed on adjustments we have a wonderful bath that is truely a retreat now with the custom cabinets wonderful trim work marble counters heated marble floors and all the other special features we wanted additional we have reclaimed excess space from the bath into a much larger walkin closet thanks pyne studios pyne studios inclhughes ratedi hired pyne studios to renovate my kitchen  couldnt be happier with the decision from the first meeting to the final cleanup this job moved forward seamlessly the design was perfect for the house as well as me and the suggestions mike  debi offered made a monumental difference in the end i just love it they are talented professional friendly and very easy to work with they came in under budget finished more than  weeks ahead of schedule and minimized the disruptive nature of a kitchen redo so that i had no issues throughout the construction phase i already knew they did quality work because they renovated  bathrooms in my house and i love the results i had high expectations and they managed to far exceed them my kitchen has a wow factor now that keeps me smiling whenever im near it mike  debi pyne are responsible for that wow factor and i cant thank them enoughpyne studios incnora w ratedwe hired pyne studios inc to do a major project which involved a family room addition a covered porch a complete reconfiguration of the living area a new kitchen a complete bathroom remodel and a full bathroom addition we could not be happier with the resultsbeing home renovation virgins we only had a vague idea of what we wanted by asking questions and assessing our lifestyle debi came up with the most amazing design which not only functions perfectly for our family but is also stunningly beautifulseeing the design come to life was fascinating mike and joe made sure that everything went smoothly and everyone was so professional and courteous every day brought another wow substantial completion of the project came in way before schedule which is amazing considering the amount of work that was done we now love our house – thank you pyne studiosu s a contractors inctoppropmanager ratedi manage several properties and this company was referred to me by another property management company that always uses them weve been burned by other contractors in the past lack of work language barriers  punctuality so we were very hesitant and extremely strict with usa contractors at the beginning i had about a dozen properties that needed some upgrades and repairs someone came onsite the same day and i had the estimates the next day even though some of the properties were challenging usa contractors diligently did the work and left every property spotless there were never any language barriers and they were very professional we have used them several times since then and have always been extremely happy with their work these are the guys i always call first and have recommended them to many otherspyne studios incdsnandknv ratedwe worked with pyne studios to renovate our basement including a half bath and an upstairs study debi and mike did a fantastic job and we are very very pleased with their work they were completely professional  not to mention friendly – throughout the entire process they got a very good idea very quickly of what our tastes are and made excellent design recommendations they were sensitive to our schedules extremely neat paid great attention to detail and worked on final details until we were completely happy the contractors they work with were all professional and did quality work in sum it was a pleasure to work with debi and mike we recommend them highly and would work with them again in the future pyne studios incamyshaughnessyjohanek ratedwe used debi and mike to remodel our kitchen space powder room and  bathrooms i would highly recommend pyne studios debis design services were top notch  bringing great ideas such that everything we picked out we lovefrom the granite to the tiles to the light fixtures debi and mike were very transparent working with us around estimates costs and schedule we also liked that mike and his son did a good bit of the work themselves everything was very high touch and there was a sense of pride in all their efforts pyne studios incandrew s ratedwe had a fantastic experience with pyne studios from the design process through construction they were attentive to our needs detailed oriented and extremely thoughtful we trusted them with our master bedroom addition and had a great end result they look to build successful partnerships with clients and have a high degree of personal service we highly recommend them pyne studios increnajones ratedmike and debi remodeled my kitmike and debi remodeled my kitchen last summer and i have to say i am very pleased with the results it gets a little hectic remodeling in a condo but thanks to them daniel and casey the experience was painless and the results excellent did you knowthere has perhaps never been a better tool for doityourself home handymen than the internet with detailed instructions and videos explaining how to perform a number of common maintenance and renovation tasks around a house an untrained homeowner might be surprised at how much he or she can accomplish with a quick search online but even with all of this information there are still many jobs that lie far outside the scope of most diy enthusiasts general contractors are there to fill in this gapa general contractor specializes in seeing a home remodel or repair project through from start to finish to do this the contractor works with the client  whether they are a homeowner or business  to nail down the scope of the work then he or she will turn to one or more subcontractors for specific tasks like equipment operation design electrical work or whatever else is neededin essence general contractors could be thought of as middlemen between a homeowner or business owner and any number of specialists to get their moneys worth many assume they should just cut out the middleman and hire specialists directly but this often proves more difficult in practice general contractors wont be completing an entire project by themselves but should have a long list of dependable experts who can work together and accomplish any task they might also serve as the manager on the site of a construction project overseeing workers and providing guidance and assistance when needed for larger projects though the contractor might only handle administrative matters and employ a foreman or other professional for onsite supervisioncommon jobsthere are many general contractors who also specialize in certain tasks themselves there is usually at least one general contractor on hand to organize the construction of an entire home for example but general contractors could also help a homeowner add an additional bedroom build an inground pool or complete a major landscaping project they could also work with a business to add or improve office space whether that means making more room or converting a commercial building from a nail salon to a restaurant basically if its a job that involves building or repairing a general contractor probably knows how to get it doneno matter what the exact job may be a contractor will probably need to accomplish several other essential tasks in pursuit of the ultimate goal which may includeunderstanding and applying for building permits to meet local regulationsorganizing a budget and adhering to it throughout the projectgathering all the necessary tools and equipment from hammers and shovels to large excavators and generatorssecuring the construction site and equipment after work hoursworking with personnel onsite to address any issueskeeping records of materials labor and all other expenseslicensingevery general contractor performing any kind of work on a project must be licensed to do so in their state the guidelines for the specifics on licensing vary from state to state some states might only require registration of contractors which is different from licensing registration typically means that there must be a written record of what work is being performed and by whom but it does not guarantee professional knowledge licensing on the other hand involves an examination process to assess professional competencewhether your state requires licensing or registration of contractors there should be a record of most professionals willing to complete certain projects in your area check your state or county website for more information in states that require licensing every licensed contractors contact information is available online or from another public sourcenot every project needs to be completed by a licensed or registered contractor if its just a minor job that wont take more than a day or two and will cost less than a few hundred dollars its likely not necessary to find a licensed or registered contractor however anything bigger or more expensive or a project involving plumbing or electrical work needs to be completed by a licensed or registered professionalgeneral contractors also must be covered by an insurance policy this should include liability coverage for any property damage that could be inflicted in the course of a job it should also include a workers compensation policy in case anyone is injured on the job before hiring a contractor for anything ask for written proof of this insurance to see exactly what is covered trade associationsa number of trade associations for contractors in the us exist some of the biggest includeassociated general contractors of america represents more than  general contracting firms and more than  specialty contractors nationwideassociated builders and contractors represents nonunion contracting firmsmost trade associations for general contractors will provide references for anyone looking to hire a contractor for a specific project they may also provide a number of benefits for their members including assistance with licensing training insurance and business developmenthiring a general contractorno matter what you need accomplished you want to choose a contractor who can get the job done right at a reasonable price obviously this is easier said than done but there are a few steps you can take to ensure you find a trustworthy general contractorfinding general contractorsthe first and perhaps most reliable way to find a general contractor is to ask friends and family members for a recommendation if you know anyone who has had major work done on their home particularly if its a similar job ask them who they hired and if they were pleased with the result you could also ask neighbors about who theyve hired if you notice work being done on their house many remodeling contractors post signs in front of homes to advertise their services as a general rule its rarely a good idea to hire a contractor who solicits work by going door to doorif you are considering hiring a contractor without a personal recommendation ask the contractor for references from past clients and do as much background research on them as possible look for any complaints or compliments online to get a better idea of their track record there are a number of websites specializing in connecting contractors with people or businesses who need work done these sites may also allow past clients to submit their own reviews of the contractor budgetbefore hiring a contractor make sure you are both in agreement on the projects budget its normal for most contractors to charge clients a premium not only for the labor expenses and zoning expertise but for acquiring the materials as well be as clear and concise as possible regarding what youll be purchasing yourself and what you will be paying the contractor to complete homeowners may be able to find a better deal on raw materials when they purchase these directly but they first need to be sure they arent buying the wrong thingsdont forget to discuss how the project will be finalized and what will be done about cleanup plans for how the work site will be cleaned at the end of each day as well as at the conclusion of work need to be put in writing an experienced general contractor should make every effort to keep the workspace clean and prevent dirtying or damaging any other area even so talk with the contractor about the daily schedule the logistics of transporting workers and equipment and how cleanup will be handledprioritizing safetyas previously mentioned you need to make sure to follow any state and local regulations regarding construction work which includes hiring a licensed or registered general contractor ask the contractor for proof of their certification before signing anything as well as their proof of insurance you should also check your homeowners insurance policy to see if they offer coverage for contracted work you may want to call your insurance provider and ask for more details on what your plan will and wont coverperhaps the best way to feel safe about a contractor and the work being done is to hire a contractor you trust this is why relying on personal references from friends and family is so important and will often provide a great deal of peace of mind if you arent able to obtain a reference work to conduct extensive research on the contractor as well as the work you are hiring them to perform this should bring everyones expectations into alignment and result in a safe work environmentfinancial safetybefore any money changes hands there should be a contract to sign make sure the specifics of the work to be done and all costs are listed in the contract right down to the most precise details if you forget to have something included in the contract after signing it theres rarely a chance of recourse once the specifics of the job are nailed down be sure to discuss the payment schedule with the contractor this is important because paying too much up front offers the homeowner minimal leverage if the quality of work does not meet expectations or contractual specifications try to establish a reasonable pay schedule with the contractor such as paying  percent of the total cost for each  percent of the work that is completed its a good idea to include this payment plan in the contract as wellfinally look into getting a lien release signed before work begins if there is ever a dispute regarding payment over the course of the project a contractor or subcontractor could place a payment claim or lien on your property this can trigger a long legal process that may be frustrating to avoid this ask the contractor to sign a lien release which is a legal agreement that states that any payment accepted is final this can come in handy if a contractor has his or her own payment issues with their subcontractors signing a lien release form certifies that any payment made by a client to the contractor is enough to pay for any goods or services rendered a lien dispute could also be prevented by performing due diligence prior to picking a contractor as any contractor with good credit and a long track record of satisfied clients should have no trouble paying for materials and labor once all contract conditions have been metonce work is underway its never a bad idea to check up on the progress of the job either by staying in touch with the contractor over the phone or visiting the site in person if you work with a trustworthy professional its probably best to keep your distance and allow everyone to stay busy if you want to keep an eye on things make sure workers wear the right safety gear and that everything looks to be moving along according to schedule finally once work is finished and you are satisfied be sure to thank your contractor and tell friends or family members about
