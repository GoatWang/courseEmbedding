smaller companies copyright  houston chronicle published  am wednesday december   jan rask came to the united states in  from his native sweden expecting to stay not more than two or three years now he is heading up his third offshore oil and natural gas drilling company as president and chief executive of todco houston is a mecca for this type of business todco which used to be part of transocean went public early this year todco owns  drilling rigs with  operating in the united states and has about  employees the company boasts the nations largest fleet of inland drilling barges and the secondlargest fleet of jackup rigs story continues below   latest news video the barges are designed for drilling in shallow water basically the swamps of louisiana and to a lesser extent in texas the jackup rigs can work in shallow waters as well up to  or  feet rask talked to reporter nelson antosh about this important business in houston q whats the future for oil and gas in the gulf of mexico a the gulf is a place we have been drilling in for many years it is a mature basin in the past  years we have seen a gradual trend from the larger oil companies to the smaller oil companies taking over and i think that will continue obviously the reserves are getting smaller and smaller the larger oil companies really cant put their resources on something that may generate  or  billion cubic feet of gas the smaller guys can do that they have to be on a treadmill and do it all the time but their returns are just great q who are you working for there a nine out of  of our customers are independents and of those we work for half are established public companies and the other half are smaller private companies there are a lot of names you probably wouldnt know and i didnt know either three or four years ago q whats the outlook for the jackup type of drilling rig a that market is actually very strong worldwide it doesnt matter where you look some of the markets have strengthened because supply has diminished like the united states and also the north sea youve seen almost  jackups leave the us gulf in the past   years thats why the day rates have increased as much as they have the international markets have been strong enough to absorb all of these rigs q whats the zooming price of natural gas done for the business a the returns for the oil companies are just phenomenal with the natural gas price where it is today we can see day rates increase to what i call the replacement cost where it actually makes sense to build rigs and we havent seen those kinds of day rates since we built all these rigs in the early s natural gas prices have come up to around  per thousand cubic feet when actually we just need to see  to  gas we can charge replacementcost day rates and it still makes sense for our customers q whats happened to the inland barge business a in  we had well into  barges working in the united states and today it is down to around  the natural gas price collapsed and some of the bigger players in the inland waters quit drilling chevrontexaco used to be a big player there but not anymore we are waiting for two things to happen the first is we are waiting for them to sell their leases to the smaller players the second is we are waiting for the deep gas play to take off youve probably heard about the deep gas play in the gulf but there is a deep gas play in the inland waters as well we are talking about drilling beyond  feet nelsonantoshchroncom latest from the chroncom homepage click below for the top news from around the houston area
