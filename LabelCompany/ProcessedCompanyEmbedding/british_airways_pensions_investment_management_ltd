necessary research and followup could take several weeks if you have questions you can contact them at bwwebmasterbusinessweekcom close interview british airways pensions  the noughty graduate the noughty graduate search search for interviews interview british airways pensions september   the noughty graduate  comment losing my virginity the role i was applying for was a graduate trainee position working as an investment analyst for ba’s pension management team  however all i knew going into the interview was that the role involved “working with fund managers in a supportive environment”  the ad didn’t say much  i wasn’t sure if they outsourced their portfolio decisions to investment banks which is what most corporations do with their pension schemes or if they made their investment decisions in house  turns out they did it all in house  they had a team of  people managing assets in excess of £ billion   extremely impressive  this was exactly the position i wanted  i only wish i had learned that before going into the interview… i had read up on general pension fund management theory and ba’s schemes too but as my notes on investment analysis are currently being stored in my uncle’s attic in another part of the country i was unable to do a decent job reviewing the necessary information so when the financial statements of a holding company were put in front of me and i was asked to pick out three things i was concerned about with regards to the future growth of their two business units i was a bit stumped  and it didn’t help that i misread the question and only reported on one of the business units  but i’m getting ahead of myself first i like to rate companies on how they treat their interviewees  how a company treats you says a lot about the quality of the company itself and how they are going to treat you should you be hired  one way i like to gauge this is by how many weapons of mass rejection they use in the application process  my theory the less the better  bap got top marks in this respect  the application process involved sending my cv and covering letter to an email address  no competency questions  no online assessment  not even an initial telephone interview  this is not to say that companies that employ a high number of wmrs are poor quality companies  but it definitely says that they are too big a company to give the time of day to reading your cv without first having you successfully navigate a series of obstacles  and i have developed an animosity for these companies simply because i have filled out so many of their damn online applications only to be subsequently rejected and told to keep watching their careers website for future opportunities  for me time is money  the sooner i get a job the better  and the longer the application process becomes the less jobs i can apply for within a given timeframe  makes sense  right oh well  times have changed  deal with it so i received an email from bap two weeks after my initial submission asking me to come down to london in  weeks time for an interview and short assessment  what made this especially surprising and noteworthy was that i found this job on milkround  i later found out that there were  applications submitted for the role  they were going to hire  person maybe   i was shortlisted into a group of  for interview  this was going to be cut to about  then interviewed for a second time  then  would become  and go for a third interview  and finally a decision would be made  i was really chuffed to have succeeded this far for such a popular job  and even more so that the company was taking the time to really get to know every applicant not to mention reading  cvs and cover letters actually… they most likely used a program to filter through them so the first part of the interview consisted of  minutes spent on an assessment  half of which was excelbased involving basic calculation problems on investment returns and currency exchange  the other half involved analysing a snapshot of home retail group’s financial statements and writing down  questions you would ask the firm’s management regarding their future growth prospects the former part i did fine on the latter… well we already know how that went the next  minutes were spent interviewing with  fund managers  i was asked to expand on what i thought of home retail group’s financials  would i invest in the company what sort of additional information did i need to come to that decision the conversation then moved on to the general economy  what did i think caused the recent problems in greece and spain in ireland what caused the recent financial crisis following that the conversation turned towards pension funds and the sorts of investments they made  what sort of investments would a mature fund make an immature fund what about alternative investments what about art what do you think the differences are between investing in equities vs art how do you value art mixed throughout were some more common questions like “what are your weaknesses” and “how do you get on working in teams”  i’ve had plenty of practice receiving these questions  and by now you’d think i’d be able to give a decent response each time  but no  for my adeptness in the interview room is comparable to my performance with the opposite sex on a first date  i freeze up and my iq drops to that of a small woodland creature  i say things that as they come from my mouth i realize their stupidity but am powerless to stop  instead i continue on making the situation worse and embarrassing both parties moving on the interview closed with a brief overview of my cv and this was only because i brought up how i had not listed my complete work experience i had my reasons  followed by a brief overview of the training scheme and a chance for me to ask my questions to note the training would see me working for a time with the uk equities team followed by the us equities team  learning the different strategies used by each respective team and general practises  in the end i would be assigned to the team i was best suited for and left to my own devices  they seemed to accentuate that learning would be largely independently driven  they would sponsor the usual imc and cfa qualifications but noted that this scheme was not as extensive as that of other companies  this didn’t discourage me  i don’t expect to be spoonfed my career  i intend to work for it all in all the interview did not go very well for me  the main reason being that i failed to prepare in the areas i was questioned in  i focused most of my energies on learning my cv back to front  and this was barely a part of the interview oh well my fault  you live and you learn  i now know what i need to know one thought on “interview british airways pensions” dear tng thank you for attending the interview at our office on tuesday th september as mentioned previously you were one of the exceptional candidates selected to attend the first round of interviews from over  applicants however i am writing to advise you that unfortunately after careful consideration we have decided not to pursue your
