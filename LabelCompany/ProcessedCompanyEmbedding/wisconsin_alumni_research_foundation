startup companies  patent litigation  references  external links historyedit warf was founded in  to manage a discovery by harry steenbock who invented the process for using ultraviolet radiation to add vitamin d to milk and other foods rather than leaving the invention unpatented—then the standard practice for university inventions—steenbock used  of his own money to file for a patent he received commercial interest from quaker oats but declined the companys initial offer instead steenbock sought a way to protect discoveries made by uwmadison faculty ensure use of the ideas for public benefit and bring any financial gains back to the university his concept gained support from harry l russell dean of the college of agriculture and charles sumner slichter dean of the graduate school slichter began soliciting the interest and financial support of wealthy uwmadison alumni acquaintances in chicago and new york he gained a substantial sum in verbal pledges from a number of alumni nine of whom would eventually contribute  each the uw board of regents approved the plan on june   and the organizations charter was filed with the secretary of state of wisconsin on november  that same year the organization was named the wisconsin alumni research foundation to reflect both its governing body of five uw–madison alumni and its mission to promote encourage and aid scientific

steenbock then assigned the patent to the newly established wisconsin alumni research foundation warf then licensed the technology to quaker oats for use in their breakfast cereals in addition warf licensed the technology for use as a pharmaceutical viosterol warfs commercialization of vitamin d culminated in its enrichment of milk by the time the patent expired in  rickets was all but nonexistent through continued innovations from hector deluca vitamin d remains an important part of warfs technology portfolio warfarinedit warfarin also known as coumadin is named for warf and the story of its discovery is emblematic of the wisconsin idea and the relationship of the university to the wisconsin public in  a farmer from deer park showed up unannounced at the school of agriculture and walked into a professors laboratory with a milk can full of blood which would not coagulate in his truck he had also brought a dead heifer and some spoiled clover hay he wanted to know what had

patent infringement wisconsin alumni research foundation madison wis ap — a judge has ordered apple inc to pay more than  million in a patent infringement case brought by the wisconsin alumni research foundation after the two sides agreed on final damages a jury in  found apple infringed on a patent held by the foundation which supports research at the university of wisconsinmadison the patent involves chip technology developed at the university the technology was used in processors installed by apple in a number of products the wisconsin state journal reports that last month us district judge william conley upheld a  million damage award made by the jury he ordered the foundation and apple to work on a final figure based on the number of units sold that contained the technology

portfolio gasladen pellet microcellular injection molding foaming technology portfolio wempecfunded warf ip technologies for potential startup companies new inventions efficient in vitro assay for antigenspecific tolerance building on their work uw–madison researchers have now developed a t cellbound cytokine tcbc assay for detecting and quantifying regulatory t cells specific to selfantigens or donor alloantigens the new method comprises a culturing the subject’s t cells for  hours in the presence of one or more target antigens and b analyzing the cultured t cells for expression of a marker ebi tgfβlap indicative of antigenspecific immune suppression pus rhinovirusc peptide for development of vaccines and antivirals uw–madison researchers have identified novel immunogenic peptides from rvc that are useful targets for therapeutic antibodies recent advances in microscopy enabled the researchers to determine with atomic resolution the structure of an rvc strain both in its full infectious form and as native empty particles the structures highlighted immunogenic surfaces that could be used to design antivirals or vaccines against rvc pus new and more potent ugm inhibitors for treating tuberculosis other microbial infections uw–madison researchers have developed a new set of ugm inhibitors to fight tuberculosis and other diseases caused by microbial infections the compounds feature an nacylsulfonamide motif and are more potent in vitro than inhibitors previously identified by the researchers pus compound combination targets bacterial virulence the researchers have discovered that two lead compounds em can be combined to target multiple qs pathways at the same time rhlpqs resulting in enhanced activity against p aeruginosa and potentially other pathogens this new cocktail approach is superior because it attenuates virulence factor production across a range of relevant environments where single compounds fail pus inhibiting metadherinsnd interaction to treat cancer uw–madison researchers and collaborators have developed a method to fight tumor growth and metastasis using novel peptides that inhibit interaction between mtdh and a protein called snd the researchers found that mtdhsnd protein interaction is important for the expansion and function of prostate tumors as well as luminal and basal breast tumor initiating cells their work provides novel peptides that target this protein complex to help control tumor initiation recurrence and metastasis by combating tumor initiating cells with minimal impact on normal tissues pus view more new patents cooling bed for livestock uw–madison researchers have developed a new cooling mat for livestock that circulates chilled water through elastic conduction channels unlike existing systems that require an interfering layer of bedding the new design provides greater heat exchange because the chilled surface is placed directly beneath a reclining animal a layer of cushioning beneath the water channels provides support and comfort pus microbes produce high yields of fatty alcohols from glucose uw–madison researchers have developed a method to produce fatty alcohols such as dodecanol and tetradecanol from glucose using genetically engineered microorganisms the organism eg a modified e coli strain overexpresses several genes including fadd and a recombinant thioesterase gene acylcoa synthetase gene and acylcoa reductase gene other gene products are functionally deleted to maximize performance the strain is cultured in a bioreactor in the presence of glucose pus more potent ugm inhibitors for treating tuberculosis and other microbial infections uw–madison researchers and collaborators have identified a potent set of ugm inhibitors that may help fight tuberculosis and other diseases caused by microbial infections the compounds contain a bicyclic triazolo thiadiazine core with diversified aromatic substituents they were identified by virtually screening a database of nearly five million commercially available compounds the molecules inhibit the growth of microorganisms that depend on ugm to incorporate galf residues they also diminish the virulence of pathogenic microorganisms such as m tuberculosis m smegmatis and klebsiella pneumonia that rely on ugm pus view more copyright   warf all rights reserved home contact us disclose an invention discovery portal
