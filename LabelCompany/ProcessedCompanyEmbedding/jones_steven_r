physicist among scientists jones became known for his long research on muoncatalyzed fusion and geofusion jones is also known for his association with  controversies jones has claimed that mere airplane crashes and fires could not have resulted in so rapid and complete a fall of the world trade center towers and  world trade center suggesting controlled demolition instead based upon his own

muoncatalyzed fusion from  to  for the united states department of energy doe division of advanced energy projects from  to  jones studied deuteriumbased fusion in the context of condensed matter physics under doe and electric power research institute sponsorship jones also collaborated in experiments at other physics laboratories including triumf vancouver british columbia lanl los alamos nm kek tsukuba japan and the rutherford appleton laboratory near oxford university around  jones became interested in anomalous concentrations of helium and tritium found in gases escaping from volcanoes he hypothesized that metals and high pressures in the earths interior might make fusion more likely and began a series of experiments on what he referred to as geofusion or piezofusion highpressure fusion to characterize the reactions jones designed and constructed a neutron counter that was capable of accurately measuring minuscule numbers of neutrons produced in his experiments the counter indicated that a small amount of fusion was occurring jones claimed that the results indicate that fusion is at least possible although the process was unlikely to be useful as an energy source jones interests extend to archaeometry solar energy and like numerous professors at byu archaeology and the book of mormon he has interpreted archaeological evidence from the ancient mayans as supporting his faiths belief that jesus christ when resurrected visited america muoncatalyzed fusionedit in the mids jones and other byu scientists worked on what he referred to as cold nuclear fusion in a scientific american article the process is currently known as muoncatalyzed fusion to avoid confusion with the cold fusion concept proposed by pons and fleischman muoncatalyzed fusion was a field of some interest during the s as a potential energy source however its low energy output appears to be unavoidable because of alphamuon sticking losses jones led a research team that in  achieved  fusions per muon average releasing over  mev of fusion energy per muon a record which still stands stanley pons and martin fleischmann commenced their work at approximately the same time jones became aware of their work when they applied for research funding from the doe after which the doe forwarded their proposal to jones for peer review when jones realized that their work was similar he and pons and fleischmann agreed to release their papers to nature on the same day march   however pons and fleischmann announced their results at a press event the day before jones faxed his paper to nature a new york times article says that although peer reviewers were harshly critical of pons and fleischmanns research they did not apply such criticism to jones significantly more modest theoretically supported findings although critics insisted that jones results were probably caused by experimental error the majority of the reviewing physicists claimed that he was a careful scientist later research and experiments have supported jones metallic cold fusion geofusion reports in july  jones gave a poster talk at the th international conference on condensed matter nuclear science at the university of missouri titled empirical evidence for two distinct effects lowlevel dd fusion in metals and anomalous excess heat world trade center destruction controversyedit on september   jones presented his views on the collapse of the world trade center towers and world trade center  at a byu seminar attended by approximately  people jones claimed that a variety of evidence defies the mainstream collapse theory and favors controlled demolition using thermite the evidence jones cited included the speed and symmetry of the collapses and characteristics of dust jets later jones claimed he had identified greyred flakes found in the dust as nanothermite traces he has also claimed that the thermite reaction products aluminium oxide and ironrich microspheres were also found in the dust he called for further scientific investigation to test the controlled demolition theory and the release of all relevant data by the government shortly after the seminar jones placed a research paper entitled why indeed did the wtc buildings collapse on his page in the physics department web site noting that byu had no responsibility for the paper jones subsequently presented the wtc research in lectures at idaho state university utah valley state college university of colorado at boulder and university of denver the utah academy of science sonoma state university university of california at berkeley and the university of texas at austin on september   jones removed his paper from byus website at the request of administrators and was placed on paid leave the university cited its concern about the increasingly speculative and accusatory nature of jones work and that perhaps jones research had not been published in appropriate scientific venues as reasons for putting him under review the review was to have been conducted at three levels byu administration the college of physical and mathematical sciences and the physics department however byu discontinued the review some of jones colleagues also defended jones  work to varying degrees and project censored lists his  research among the top mainstream media censored stories of  jones placement on paid leave drew criticism from the american association of university professors and the foundation for individual rights in education both organizations have long been critics of byus record on academic freedom jones welcomed the review because he hoped it would encourage people to read his paper for themselves however the school abandoned the review and jones elected to retire effective january   jones has been interviewed by mainstream news sources and has made a number of public appearances although jones has urged caution in drawing conclusions some believe that his public comments have indicated a significant degree of certainty on the controlled demolition of the world trade center and the culpability of elements within the us government in one interview jones directly called into question the governments theory regarding the attacks and subsequent uncharacteristic total destruction of the buildings stating that we dont believe that  hijackers and a few others in a cave in afghanistan pulled this off acting alone his name is often mentioned in reporting about  conspiracy theories jones has published several papers suggesting that the world trade center was demolished with explosives but his  paper why indeed did the wtc buildings collapse was his first paper on the topic and was considered controversial both for its content and its claims to scientific rigor jones early critics included members of byus engineering faculty shortly after he made his views public the byu college of physical and mathematical sciences and the faculty of structural engineering issued statements in which they distanced themselves from jones work they noted that jones hypotheses and interpretations of evidence were being questioned by scholars and practitioners and expressed doubts on whether they had been submitted to relevant scientific venues that would ensure rigorous technical peer review jones further presented and defended his research

suggesting controlled demolition instead based upon his own experiments in late  some time after brigham young university byu officials placed him on paid leave he elected to retire in an agreement

physics facility research interests and backgroundedit jones conducted research at the idaho national laboratory in idaho falls idaho where from  to  he was a senior engineering specialist he was principal investigator for experimental muoncatalyzed fusion from  to  for the united states department of energy doe division of advanced energy projects from  to  jones studied deuteriumbased fusion in the context of condensed matter physics under doe and electric power research institute sponsorship jones also collaborated in experiments at other physics laboratories including triumf vancouver british columbia lanl los alamos nm kek tsukuba japan and the rutherford appleton laboratory near oxford university around  jones became interested in anomalous concentrations of helium and tritium found in gases escaping from volcanoes he hypothesized that metals and high pressures in the earths interior might make fusion more likely and began a series of experiments on what he referred to as geofusion or piezofusion highpressure fusion to characterize the reactions jones designed and constructed a neutron counter that was capable of accurately measuring minuscule numbers of neutrons produced in his experiments the counter indicated that a small amount of fusion was occurring jones claimed that the results indicate that fusion is at least possible although the process was unlikely to be useful as an energy source jones interests extend to archaeometry solar energy and like numerous professors at byu archaeology and the book of mormon he has interpreted archaeological evidence from the ancient mayans as supporting his faiths belief that jesus christ when resurrected visited america muoncatalyzed fusionedit in the mids jones and other byu scientists worked on what he referred to as cold nuclear fusion in a scientific american article the process is currently known as muoncatalyzed fusion to avoid confusion with the cold fusion concept proposed by pons and fleischman muoncatalyzed fusion was a field of some interest during the s as a potential energy source however its low energy output appears to be unavoidable because of alphamuon sticking losses jones led a research team that in  achieved  fusions per muon average releasing over  mev of fusion energy per muon a record which still stands stanley pons and martin fleischmann commenced their work at approximately the same time jones became aware of their work when they applied for research funding from the doe after which the doe forwarded their proposal to jones for peer review when jones realized that their work was similar he and pons and fleischmann agreed to release their papers to nature on the same day march   however pons and fleischmann announced their results at a press event the day before jones faxed his paper to nature a new york times article says that although peer reviewers were harshly critical of pons and fleischmanns research they did not apply such criticism to jones significantly more modest theoretically supported findings although critics insisted that jones results were probably caused by experimental error the majority of the reviewing physicists claimed that he was a careful scientist later research and experiments have supported jones metallic cold fusion geofusion reports in july  jones gave a poster talk at the th international conference on condensed matter nuclear science at the university of missouri titled empirical evidence for two distinct effects lowlevel dd fusion in metals and anomalous excess heat world trade center destruction controversyedit on september   jones presented his views on the collapse of the world trade center towers and world trade center  at a byu seminar attended by approximately  people jones claimed that a variety of evidence defies the mainstream collapse theory and favors controlled demolition using thermite the evidence jones cited included the speed and symmetry of the collapses and characteristics of dust jets later jones claimed he had identified greyred flakes found in the dust as nanothermite traces he has also claimed that the thermite reaction products aluminium oxide and ironrich microspheres were also found in the dust he called for further scientific investigation to test the controlled demolition theory and the release of all relevant data by the government shortly after the seminar jones placed a research paper entitled why indeed did the wtc buildings collapse on his page in the physics department web site noting that byu had no responsibility for the paper jones subsequently presented the wtc research in lectures at idaho state university utah valley state college university of colorado at boulder and university of denver the utah academy of science sonoma state university university of california at berkeley and the university of texas at austin on september   jones removed his paper from byus website at the request of administrators and was placed on paid leave the university cited its concern about the increasingly speculative and accusatory nature of jones work and that perhaps jones research had not been published in appropriate scientific venues as reasons for putting him under review the review was to have been conducted at three levels byu administration the college of physical and mathematical sciences and the physics department however byu discontinued the review some of jones colleagues also defended jones  work to varying degrees and project censored lists his  research among the top mainstream media censored stories of  jones placement on paid leave drew criticism from the american association of university professors and the foundation for individual rights in education both organizations have long been critics of byus record on academic freedom jones welcomed the review because he hoped it would encourage people to read his paper for themselves however the school abandoned the review and jones elected to retire effective january   jones has been interviewed by mainstream news sources and has made a number of public appearances although jones has urged caution in drawing conclusions some believe that his public comments have indicated a significant degree of certainty on the controlled demolition of the world trade center and the culpability of elements within the us government in one interview jones directly called into question the governments theory regarding the attacks and subsequent uncharacteristic total destruction of the buildings stating that we dont believe that  hijackers and a few others in a cave in afghanistan pulled this off acting alone his name is often mentioned in reporting about  conspiracy theories jones has published several papers suggesting that the world trade center was demolished with explosives but his  paper why indeed did the wtc buildings collapse was his first paper on the topic and was considered controversial both for its content and its claims to scientific rigor jones early critics included members of byus engineering faculty shortly after he made his views public the byu college of physical and mathematical sciences and the faculty of structural engineering issued statements in which they distanced themselves from jones work they noted that jones hypotheses and interpretations of evidence were being questioned by scholars and practitioners and expressed doubts on whether they had been submitted to relevant scientific venues that would ensure rigorous technical peer review jones further presented and defended his research before peers at the utah academy of sciences arts and letters on  april  at nearby snow college jones maintained that the paper was peerreviewed prior to publication within a book  and american empire intellectuals speak out by dr griffin the paper was published in the online journal of  studies a journal cofounded and coedited by jones for the purpose of covering the whole of research related to  the paper also appeared in a volume of essays edited by david ray griffin and peter dale scott in april  jones along with four other authors published a letter in the bentham open civil engineering journal titled fourteen points of agreement with official government reports on the world trade center destruction in august  jones along with kevin ryan and james gourley published a peerreviewed article in the environmentalist titled environmental anomalies at the world trade center evidence for energetic materials in april  jones along with niels h harrit and  other authors published a paper in the open chemical physics journal titled active thermitic material discovered in dust from the  world trade center catastrophe the editor of the journal professor mariepaule pileni an expert in explosives and nanotechnology resigned she received an email from the danish science journal videnskab asking for her professional assessment of the articles content according to pileni the article was published without her authorization subsequently numerous concerns arose regarding the reliability of the publisher bentham science publishing this included the publishing an allegedly peer reviewed article generated by scigen  although this program has also successfully submitted papers to ieee and springer  the resignation of multiple people at the administrative level and soliciting article submissions from researchers in unrelated fields through spam with regard to the peer review process of the research conducted by jones in the open chemical physics journal dr david griscom identified himself as one of the reviewers the paper which jones coauthored referenced dr griscom and multiple scientists studying  in the acknowledgements for elucidating discussions and encouragements almost four years prior to identifying himself as a reviewer and the welcome he received from jones for speaking out boldly griscom published a letter in defense of evidencebased  studies of which jones was an editor europhysics news in august  published  years later on the physics of highrise building collapses which strongly challenges the official us government nist narrative of the collapse of wtc and the wtc towers the paper was authored by steven jones robert korol anthony szamboti and ted walter scholars for  truth and scholars for  truth  justiceedit jones was a founding member of scholars for  truth for approximately one year as cochair with james h fetzer from midnovember  until the end of that year jones fetzer and a series of other researchers and individuals engaged in a dispute about the direction of the organization jones and others examined the claims of james fetzer and judy wood — ie that directed energy weapons or mininukes destroyed the wtc towers — and delineated empirical reasons for rejecting them in december  steven jones and about ths of the members voted to leave the scholars for  truth organization to establish scholars for

the day before jones faxed his paper to nature a new york times article says that although peer reviewers were harshly critical of pons and fleischmanns research they did not apply such criticism to

claimed that a variety of evidence defies the mainstream collapse theory and favors controlled demolition using thermite the evidence jones cited included the speed and symmetry of the collapses and characteristics of dust jets later jones claimed he had identified greyred flakes found in the dust as nanothermite traces he has also claimed that the thermite reaction products aluminium oxide and ironrich microspheres were also found in the dust he called for further scientific investigation to test the controlled demolition theory and the release of all relevant data by the government shortly
