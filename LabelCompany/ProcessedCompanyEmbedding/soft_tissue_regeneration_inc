for soft tissue reinforcement and regeneration includes breast reconstruction hernia repair dural repair vaginal slings skin repair sports medicine and tendon reinforcement and dental soft tissue regeneration general report contents market analyses include unit sales asps market value  growth trends market drivers  limiters for each chapter segment competitive analysis for each chapter segment section on recent mergers  acquisitions if there is one factor that affects nearly every segment in this report its aging population the demographic of those over the age of  is increasing in the united states which leads to a natural rise in the amount of people experiencing medical complications involving soft tissue repair as this population grows a greater number of devices used in surgery to augment and reinforcement suturebased repair will be purchased moreover sales of products that enhance healing of chronic wounds and tendon tears are expected to increase to meet the growing demand of this population soft tissue augmentation and reinforcement devices add significant costs to suturebased repair procedures the cost varies depending on the type of device used and the repair being performed but in general biological devices such as allografts and xenografts cost significantly more than synthetic devices within the same market segment for instance biological devices may offer superior longterm benefits in hernia repair by avoiding risks of infection and premature degradation and failure but their high cost continues to deter surgeons from using them broadly limiting the sales of the more expensive allografts and xenografts in uncomplicated hernia repair until biological devices can provide a justifiable benefitcost ratio synthetic meshes will remain dominant in the
