us today in todays call we would like to go over our  outlook and specifically important milestones for the next three months before getting into this i must say i am proud of our many accomplishments that now have cytodyn in the strongest position in our corporate history specifically we overcame many difficult obstacles and undertook many tough challenges and here we are two phase  clinical trials and the potential to submit a bla biologic licensing agreement for final approval in this year  as you know we have a clear regulatory path for us approval of pro  for treating hiv patients important milestones for  for our hiv program are we got to our phase  pivotal trial now this is the trial we will use to get our first approval for pro  we are on track to reach a major clinical and business inflection point by the end of march by reporting efficacy results from our pivotal phase  trial with pro  as a combination therapy in regards to our second phase  monotherapy trial this is a trial we hope to use to obtain second approval for pro  as a single agent therapy we are encouraged by interest from physicians clinicians and patients alike in our phase  clinical trial with pro  as the monotherapy and anticipate rapid enrollment in this trial in this regard we have recorded breathtaking testimonies in the form of interview of nine patients who have had over two years of pro  monotherapy and claim that their quality of life has been significantly improved and they all say that it is due to pro  having no significant toxicity or side effects in regards to our nonhiv indication we expect to treat the first patient in our phase  trial with pro  in graft versus host disease or gvhd and last but not least is our new development in evaluating pro  for autoimmune diseases and cancer in animal models we are encouraged with the results we have seen thus far and planned to submit the results for publication this quarter we have come a very long way over the past four years and our resumes speaks for itself which indicate our strength by taking pro  through fda approval process so briefly from  to  this is what we accomplished in  we successfully acquired all the rights to pro  from progenics in  we put together a worldclass team to develop pro  in  we defined a new path for pro  a path completely different than progenics top scientists and innovators in  we initiated our first pivotal phase  trial for pro  for hiv infection in combination therapy in  our longterm monotherapy trial results continue to be very impressive and we not only continued with our pivotal phase  combination therapy trial but injected the first patient in our highly anticipated phase  monotherapy our second phase  study so allow me to now tell you what we think we will be doing in  number one in regards to our pivotal phase  combination therapy i believe all eyes will be on the number of patients we have enrolled so let me update you in this regard as of today we have enrolled  patients and need  more to complete enrollment that said i am pleased to report that we also have additional  patients who are now in the screening process the total number of sites and hospitals that are actively enrolling for us in this study is currently  this gives us confidence in our ability to enroll the  additional patients needed to reach the patient mark and importantly to report our primary efficacy endpoint results before the end of march you recall back in january   cytodyn had applied breakthrough designation for this population however the fda indicated that cytodyn does not have data in this population and at that time we did not currently we have seven patients that have finished the week trial and total of  patients have been enrolled our regulatory team indicated that only five patient’s data could be enough and we have  so far i am hopeful that we can receive breakthrough designation utilizing this data in this quarter we are planning to submit this data to the fda furthermore we previously announced the finding of orphan drug designation with pro  as a combination therapy in this patient population and expect to receive a determination from the fda during this quarter this designation has several advantages including multiple years of commercial exclusivity we are often asked about the importance of the phase  combination trial when many hivinfected patients achieve suppressed viral load with haart alone highly active antiretroviral therapy why add another therapy the answer in the case of addition of pro  is because haart which is a combination of three or more drugs in pill form can have high level of toxicity with side effects and the pills must be taken at a specific time each day to avoid resistance this can lead to serious quality of life and compliance issues and resistance to four to five classes of drugs is dangerous so we believe that hiv patients who are on combination haart and pro  can eliminate the most toxic drug in their haart regimen and may even be able to miss taking their pills for several days with no repercussion to their health therefore we believe these reasons provide a very strong and compelling advantage for combined therapy and support an annual us market that we estimate at  billion so this concludes all of our updates about our pivotal phase  combination therapy and now i would like to give you update on our other phase  trial our monotherapy investigative trial so update number two we are delighted to have this trial underway and the first patient injected after receiving clearance from the fda in december we are enrolling  hiv patients with r strain or maintaining the viral load with haart the trial is being conducted under almost the same criteria as our previous phase  monotherapy trial with patients receiving weekly subcutaneous injection of pro  with the trial period extended from  weeks to  weeks due to the christmas holiday patient enrollment came to near standstill shortly after we open enrollment as a result of this currently enrollment stands at only seven patients that said i am pleased to report that about  more patients have been screened and could begin treatment with pro  soon this will be a rapid enrollment pace that we anticipate for the monotherapy trial now i must discuss an interesting and potentially very positive new development pertaining to the nonresponders to pro  by some patients with r strain in our phase  monotherapy trial that could have implication for our phase  monotherapy trial so just to remind you some patient did not respond more than few weeks to monotherapy in our previous phase b trial while others did and as you know some are now have passed two years of treatment at the fda’s suggestion we reviewed published data indicating that hiv patients can have widely varying density of ccr under cell surface according to this data that number could exceed the previous acknowledged level of ccr by factor exceeding  folds what does this mean well as we all know pro  works by blocking the ccr receptor that allows hiv to infect cells this means that those patients who didnt respond to pro  in phase  monotherapy trial might have had a high density of ccr which means they could have had more ccr under surface of their cell than others which could indicate that they needed more pro  than others we know that only  of  of the original enrolled patient completed week monotherapy trial among the  nonresponders eight were treated for infection which is a nonresponse issue that could be independent of pro  by excluding these patients  of  patients or about  were responders so to put this in a simple language the lack of response to pro  monotherapy by the other  patients in the trial may have been due to an insufficient dose of pro  to address the high ccr density this is encouraging as it may provide insights into why some patients with r strain responded while others did not like this is not the case from our  patients monotherapy phase  trial we should at least get a number of responded that would be statistically more significant than previous  patients trial now this we believe is important to seek second approval for monotherapy for pro  after we hopefully get our first approval for combination therapy okay let me now update you in regards to a third item which is our gvhd phase  trial graft versus host disease trial as i mentioned earlier the first patient is expected to be treated later this year furthermore you might recall that we had submitted application for orphan drug designation for pro  in gvhd and the fda has requested additional animal data this month we expect to have what we believe is the required data if this data is positive we will submit this data for the fda  to the fda in support of orphan drug designation this brings me to our very important next update we are excited about the many applications of pro  due to its novel mechanism of action i am delighted to share that we have very positive animal data in a colon cancer model and the model for multiple sclerosis and autoimmune disease these results have been slated for publication in the prereview journal during the current quarter given the strength of our results we will continue to seek opportunities to secure a partner for further development of pro  for these nonhiv indications turning now to corporate development update number five we entered  with the strengthened balance sheet having raised  million late last year in support of advancing the development of pro  we are proud to have raised more than  million in all of  and more than  million since i became ceo in  obviously under my leadership we never failed to deliver on this important task in regards to cytodyn’s visibility we are also actively creating greater visibility for cytodyn and awareness of pro  within the hiv and investment communities by teaming up public relations investor relations and media relations start next week we will be holding meetings with investment professions at jp morgan conference in san francisco and we are planning to have multiple road shows in a regular basis all of this current quarter and finally we have fulfilled fda request by meeting with hiv community advocates to get their input on our studies we held a sixhour meeting with six activists in december in vancouver washington where our corporate headquarters are located during this meeting we shared data discussed clinical trial design and implementation of three clinical trial and their extensions we were pleased with the participants meaningful input and feedback and their suggestions on study enroll and participant education we plan the second community meeting in seattle in late february following our presentation at croi and this brings us to our upcoming croi  presentations you may recall our announcement last august that  patients in our phase b monotherapy extension study were approaching two years of suppressed viral loads with weekly subcutaneous self injection of pro  in november we announced that data from this trial had been selected for presentation in a posters session and that we were among the very few designated to be featured during a special themed discussion this themed discussion will be held in february  and will include a panel of representatives from gilead merck and nih all major key players in hiv therapy dr paul maddon the inventor of pro  and senior science advisor to cytodyn was originally assigned to participate on the panel on our behalf please make sure you understand that it is an immense honor to be chosen for this session which promises to attract attention from top key opinion leaders in our field as well as many major media as a recap we are off to a very strong start to  and have the following expectations completing enrollment in our phase  pro  combination trial and reporting primary endpoint efficacy results by the end of the first quarter file the missing data for our breakthrough designation for combination trial receiving notice from the fda on orphan drug designation for pro  in treatment experienced hiv patients advancing recruitment in our phase  monotherapy trial presenting phase b monotherapy result at croi on february  and  and participating in a themed session along with elite companies injecting the first patient in the phase  gvhd trial submitting animal data in support of orphan drug designation for gvhd announcing the publication of new data that further validate the effectiveness of pro  in autoimmune diseases and cancer and submitting all three components of bla to support accelerated approval process for pro  first fda approval bla being biologic license application my dear shareholders we have come a very long way since making our  million upfront payment for pro  we expect an eventful and exciting year ahead that brings us significantly closer to gaining approval for pro  importantly we are advancing the development of this novel therapeutic to bring new treatment options to those with hiv and hopefully other undeserved disease  diseases and conditions with those remarks operator please open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from yi chen of rodman  renshaw please state your question yi chen hi thank you for taking my questions my question is i guess it is and still remains the same that you need the safety data from the maintenance therapy to support the bla you are filing of the pro  for as a combination therapy so my question is that have you get any idea from the fda how many patients’ data you need from the maintenance therapy as a support material for the combinations therapy when you will get that idea will it be after you report efficacy data from the combination therapy nader pourhassan sorry can you hear me now yi chen yes nader pourhassan can you hear me yi chen yes i can hear you nader pourhassan yeah yi chen yes nader pourhassan sorry about that so as i was saying we expect to get that data from our monotherapy phase  trial and the fda has indicated that we should go and meet back  and meet with them as soon as we have our th patient in combination therapy had one week and bring whatever information we have from  whatever number of patients we have from monotherapy yi chen okay –just from the phase  monotherapy alone do you expect to reach the halfway enrollment that is  patients maybe by the end of this year nader pourhassan so by the end of this year i expect to have every one of those  patients enrolled yi chen okay nader pourhassan that’s my expectation let me just explain that in phase b trial we close the first cohort of the patient in two weeks i currently get emails after emails from patients saying that we want to get in the monotherapy we are hearing that this is a great treatment and therefore we believe that it’s going to be a very very fast pace enrollment yi chen okay thank you and currently what you just said about why  the reason that some of the ccr patients did not response to pro  is because of the dosing of pro  was not sufficient so what kind of increased dosing we expect to see for going forward nader pourhassan yeah very good question so the half life of this product is  days  days i should say so in our protocol we have the option available to us to change the injection from every seven days to every four days so if any patient start having a peak in their viral load of  even let say  or anything more than target not detectable which is less than  copies per meal we will definitely switch them to every four days and hopefully that would give them enough pro  to be able to respond yi chen got it thank you nader pourhassan thank you operator our next question comes from robert detcher ph of paulson investment company please state your question unidentified analyst yes hi thank you for taking my call and thank you nader for all the progress that youre making i wanted to ask you a couple of questions one is what is the cost of the haart treatment for the average patient what’s the average cost for that and what you anticipate the cost would be once you get approval for pro  and how did they compare nader pourhassan yeah thank you for your question that’s a very good question so cost of haart is depends on which pills you take but in average the one pill a day like atripla complera quad quad so forth they are about  per year that’s the cost to the patient so we  the price that we will set for pro  is all going to be dependent on many  it depends on many factors but i can assure you that the cost of our product just to be manufactured is way way less than that and definitely would be very profitable if we were going to go with only exact same price as one pill a day and one pill a day we have tremendous amount of advantages to that in our opinion unidentified analyst but are  can you still hear me nader pourhassan i still do go ahead unidentified analyst aren’t most patients taking multiple  most haart – aren’t they taking multiple pills nader pourhassan so the one pill a day has three components where the patient can just take one pill a day but if they get resistance they then be on the second line therapy and third line and so forth and usually then they increase it to three pills a day and then four and five some patient in our phase b monotherapy was  were on six pills a day they put all of it away and enjoyed and hardly any toxicity and hardly any side effect therapy pro  unidentified analyst okay and what kind of financial assistance do people get with the haart treatment and what kind of financial assistance will they get would it be the similar or what is available to patients nader pourhassan well the insurance that right now covers haart i will think that they would be very very happy to see that there is a product that doesnt require patients to have all kind of problems with their liver and kidneys and as long as you have fda approval for your product and the product works for that indication we will be just competing with other products and same rules unidentified analyst well can you give us some idea what the relative cost you said your cost of manufacture is going to be substantially less could you give us some relative idea nader pourhassan yes it could be as low as  to  per year treatment and that’s giving a patient two injections a week which is two vials for us to provide for them unidentified analyst and that would be your costs to the company what would you anticipate patient might have to pay nader pourhassan well then you got a lot of other costs besides just manufacturing now then you got  the finance people have to get involved and that is going to be very difficult for me to elaborate on at this time unidentified analyst okay and another question about the monotherapy the  patients how long do you think that’s going how long  you said something about  to  weeks or could you elaborate a little bit on when you think you’ll have the  patients and how long that trial will go nader pourhassan so the trial is a week trial we were saying that this trial is very similar to our other trial that we just conducted but that other trial phase b was only a week trial this one is week trial so we believe that we will be able to enroll all those  patients this year for sure thats what we believe unidentified analyst and it will last  the trial will last  weeks nader pourhassan so each patient will be in this trial for  weeks unidentified analyst okay okay but if i may ask you one more indiscernible ive discussed this with other i mean investor of course i didn’t discuss it with you you mentioned that youre going to be on a panel that’s going to include gilead and merck nader pourhassan correct so we are selected to be on a themed discussion is on croi website actually you could access it and other companies include merck and gilead and nih unidentified analyst and nih and when is that in february did you say nader pourhassan february  is our themed discussion february  is our poster session unidentified analyst and when  where is it nader pourhassan seattle unidentified analyst in seattle and because the question im often asked is where  why have you not been approached by companies like gilead  especially gilead or some of the other companies with all the positive results you had or perhaps you have been approached i don’t know and i don’t know what you are  what you can say nader pourhassan so yeah the big pharmers they look at your trials and our first approval trial is combination combination therapy is among very difficult patients and according to our number there is about  to  patients that have three drug resistance which then they would be qualified for this product which is one drug resistance to three different classes so they are looking at this as a small population we need to show that our product is way different than other products because of the side effect and toxicity that is completely different profile and we need to show the advantages of our product and perhaps once we prove ourselves than peoples mind might change but i cannot talk about who we’ll talk into at this time and i have to go with the next question at this time thank you for your questions unidentified analyst thank you very much nader pourhassan yeah thanks operator operator instructions our next question comes from matt mckieska ph a private investor please state your question unidentified analyst hi nader thanks guys for the updates i really appreciate it nader pourhassan yeah thank you unidentified analyst and my question is kind of simple it’s  what’s the situation with having to raise capital to keep going with this stuff are we going to be start giving data results before we have to raise capital or vice versa nader pourhassan so i am going to prefer that to our chief financial officer mike michael mulholland yes let me briefly summarize our cash position we reported the  at the end of august that we had about  million of cash on hand since then we reported raises of  million net in midseptember and the  million net in middecember weve also reported in the last  in most recent filings that our monthly cash requirements are approximately  million a month and youll  i really cant do the math for you we will be updating our cash position as well as updating our forwardlooking estimates for trial costs in our next q which will be filed approximately in the next  days or so for the november th quarter but if one were to do the math it clearly would indicate that as we have said all along we will need additional capital in the future if all of these trials are to run to their conclusion nader nader pourhassan thank you mike next question please operator our next question comes from art saden ph a private investor unidentified analyst hello sir thank you for very informal presentation nader pourhassan thank you unidentified analyst i have a follow up to the last question which is what are the possibilities of raising nondilutive capital such as from the national health service cdc dod philanthropic the activity is because as you know hivaids is one of the most wellfunded philanthropic medical areas in the world and this is the science and why we have stayed with the company so long is because we believe in the science and the medicine and the hope for humanity in united states and around the world but as you know the stock market is an emprise indicator of the company’s real worth but the last two raises had very detrimental effect on the stock price coming at by more than half from the top where it sits now so have you explored nondilutive financing from any foundation agency governmental body or anybody nader pourhassan so thank you for your question in past we had been beneficiary of   almost  million worth of grant from nih progenics used those grant and the pace that they were going forward was really very very slow we definitely welcome any opportunities but we believe it is to our best of our shareholder and our future of our stock to get these products immediately to primary endpoint and hopefully to approval that would be very valuable to everybody and if we were going to spend few years to raise money from these places or not raise money to receive grants from them i think that would be very time consuming and the fact that we had that experienced before because we just need to go as fast as we can unidentified analyst okay and i am very familiar with the process and you are exactly right it’s very bureaucratic very time consuming and very slow the problem is if well without violating any safe harbor insider or information et cetera if there is private financing and the stock price just cut in half again when we all have to wait to the glory day when it stood up to  a share or  a share or you get joint venture to take over but are you  do you have concern at all about the shareholders investors which we have all seen cut by more than half right… nader pourhassan so that… unidentified analyst … in the way… nader pourhassan … concern to have and let me address what i think when we have breakthrough designation opportunity and two orphan drug designation opportunities and what we called coming out perhaps partly for us in croi bidding at to the among elite companies and our science has made progress but we have to overcome many obstacles but make no mistake please that we are not in the same position as we were before we are a very strong company when it comes to our science and our progress with fda and to be able to do what we have done we has little as money as we have used and with the speed that we have got to this point it makes me feel very strong and i believe this quarter would be a golden quarter in my opinion thats just my opinion and i think we have shown in the last four years what we were capable of doing taking this product and changing it completely around what many scientist and innovators at progenics were not able to do so i think we have proven ourselves and the future we have set it up very beautifully and i think everybody will be very excited in  because i believe if everything goes the way we are planning we have plenty of things to celebrate unidentified analyst let us pray nader pourhassan thank you next question please operator our next question comes from dean richard ph a private investor unidentified analyst yes hello i just have a quick question regarding p combo i know we only have  enrolled and your anticipation as we can get the other  enrolled in q along with primary efficacy point which is the one we followup why are you so optimistic about getting  when it’s taken so long to get the first  of that in all respectfully thank you nader pourhassan no very good question actually thank you when we first started this trial we immediately stopped our processes as we were enrolling hospitals and then back to fda and asked instead of having three drug resistance let us have two drug resistance that process when you send a letter it takes  days waiting and then you get it and you have to train all the sites again then we went back to fda say let us have one drug resistance and when you go through all of these processes it took us about a year doing all of these and as we got where we need to get which is reduce number during this one year we enrolled  sites and hospitals now if you check with any institute or any cro enrolling hospital two or three per month or maybe four or five per month is a lot so we were working on getting the hospital situated and now they are very excited and they are able to find the patient and the fact that we have  patients in the screening and these  hospitals just need to give us one patient per hospital and that’s  not counting the  in the screening we talked to our senior clinical person and he is very optimistic that we can have this obviously we are not saying that this is  we need to see how it folds out but it’s very positive and we went through thanksgiving and christmas and we still enrolled so i think these numbers are very exciting and we are going to be able to have our primary endpoint first quarter as we have said before unidentified analyst thank you very much and follow up real quick is you are saying the bla submission could be as early as  early part of q if we do get this primary efficacy follow up from the  patients what is your feelings and the strength of the bla going in discussion with the fda thank you nader pourhassan yeah very good question again yes with biologic license application we believe if we get breakthrough designation our cmc package could be prepared faster there could be other advantages fda has told us to enroll all  patients and come back and let’s talk about the bla so having a breakthrough designation and going back would be very big plus for us we would report as things come up next question unidentified analyst thank you nader pourhassan yeah thank you operator our next question comes from jared cohen of jm cohen  co jared cohen yeah just in terms of going back to funding because given all the signs that you have at this point it seems logical that you should be able to get a partner at this point to help fund you at this point in terms of get some type of upfront payment and then after that royalty stream if you did it in a way for one of your trials or indications to help fund the company have you looked into that nader pourhassan so we are open to any one of those opportunities and we cannot talk obviously about if we are talking to anybody on that those things but obviously if there is anything comes up we definitely would let everybody know and if we are in discussions currently we just can’t talk about those things jared cohen all right thank you operator our next question comes from richard butcher of argonne capital nader pourhassan richard richard butcher hi nader nader pourhassan hi richard richard butcher hey how are you doing nader pourhassan very good thank you richard butcher yeah all right so i kind of have a two part question here first how does the croi conference compared to the asm microbe conference that was involved in and then secondly you might have mentioned this earlier but just for the benefit of all the shareholders what did you think the market was for the monotherapy for pro  nader pourhassan sure so the market for monotherapy we believe is  billion now thats according to where we did a lot of the calculation and that was the final number we came up with and it’s now on our website richard butcher great thank you nader pourhassan yeah and in regards to your other question comparing croi with asm we thought that asm is going to be much bigger than what it was because they were joining with ph icag  and that was a first year they did that but obviously we didn’t think it was anywhere close to what croi is and has been all through these years richard butcher great and then the significance of the croi i mean how do you expect that presentation to go i mean especially since you will be with some of the larger players gilead and merck nader pourhassan yeah definitely so we talked to major key opinion leaders and the inventor dr paul maddon he reviewed the other presentations and he said to me that your abstract is the most exciting by far the themed discussion has to have something that’s new we are the only company that have done monotherapy with the results of two years obviously pro  works and we just got to get an approval and having results of  patients going past two years and getting interviews from them and they all indicate that for many years they were not able to hold the job they were not able to do any kind of good activities that they wanted to do and they said that they got their life back that’s  that was the statement we received from them so we believe that croi is a very important conference for us because its a biggest conference for hiv in the world richard butcher great thank you very much have good quarters and best of luck nader pourhassan yeah thank you so much richard i appreciate your question next please operator there are no further questions at the time nader pourhassan okay so thank you everybody for being on this call

brown bradshaw anderson  moffat llp salt lake city ut for defendant christopher b chaney us attorneys office american fork ut for plaintiff order on defendants motion to dismiss indictment j thomas greene district judge this matter is before the court on defendant nader z pourhassans motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the statute upon which his indictment is based is void for vagueness the court heard extensive oral argument on this motion and took it under advisement the united states was represented by assistant united states attorney felice john viti and pourhassan was represented by james bradshaw of brown bradshaw anderson  moffat now being fully advised the court enters the following order i criminal misrepresentation of products as indian produced or of indian origin under  usc §  the government has charged pourhassan with two counts of criminal misrepresentation of indian produced goods and products in violation of  usc §   usc §  makes it a criminal offense to offer or display for sale or sell any good  in a manner that falsely suggests it is indian produced an indian product or the product of a particular indian or indian tribe or indian arts and crafts organization resident within the united states  usc § a as used in the statute an indian is a member of an indian tribe or certified as an indian artisan by an indian tribe  usc § c  cfr § a an indian tribe is defined as a federally recognized or state recognized indian tribe see  usc § c  cfr §§ e  the code of federal regulations defines the term indian product as any art or craft product made by an indian  cfr § d see also  usc § c defining this term as the meaning given it by the secretary of the interior the phrases falsely suggests and indian produced are not defined in the statute or in the code of federal regulations  usc § b sets forth a scienter requirement in order for criminal liability to attach whoever knowingly violates subsection a shall—  in the case of a first violation if an individual be fined not more than  or imprisoned not more than five years or both and if a person other than an individual be fined not more than  and  in the case of subsequent violations if an individual be fined not more than  or imprisoned not more than fifteen years or both and if a person other than an individual be fined not more than  id emphasis added ii appropriateness of facial challenge in this motion pourhassan raises a facial vagueness challenge to the criminal provisions of  usc §  during oral argument defense counsel indicated that he anticipated bringing an as applied vagueness challenge to the statute after presentation of the evidence at trial if such a motion was warranted a preliminary matter is whether a facial challenge is appropriate at this stage of the proceedings according to the tenth circuit a facial vagueness challenge is proper when a statute  threatens to chill constitutionally protected conduct especially conduct protected by the first amendment if a statute is so vague that it can reasonably be interpreted to prohibit constitutionally protected speech as well as conduct the state may constitutionally forbid people may choose to refrain from speaking rather than challenge the statutes constitutionality in their criminal prosecution thus freedom of speech will be chilled we allow a person who is prosecuted for conduct which the state may constitutionally forbid to challenge the statute as vague on its face rather than restricting him to challenging it as applied to his conduct because those who refrain from speech will never have a chance to make their claims in court in this way the claims of those who would be silenced are heard vagueness and overbreadth challenges are similar in this respect united states v gaudreau  fd   th cir emphasis added see also united states v mazurie  us    sct   ledd   vagueness challenges to statutes which do not involve first amendment freedoms must be examined in the light of the facts of the case at hand quoted in united states v corrow  fd   th cir united states v day  fd   th cir same pourhassan hypothesizes that a literal reading of the statute implicates the rights of a category of individuals comprising manufacturers and sellers of products that are perceived by the public to be indian products a literal reading of the statute would arguably preclude any nonmember of a tribe from making and selling items such as totem poles dream catchers or tomahawks without expressly disclosing that the items were made by a nontribal member mem in supp of mot to dismiss indictment on vagueness grounds at  as the court understands his argument pourhassan contends that the statute implicates constitutionally protected conduct and thereby authorizes a facial vagueness challenge because it  discourages a person from expressing himself by manufacturing products that are publiclyperceived to be indian products and  forces a seller to speak by requiring him to disclose affirmatively the origin of such products or prohibits the seller from speaking or acting in a manner which though innocent may be wrongly interpreted by a potential purchaser as suggesting that the goods for sale are indian products notwithstanding the aforesaid argument the rights of manufacturers of publiclyperceived indian products are not affected by the statute since the statute only concerns the sale not the manufacture of goods an artisan or other manufacturer may continue to express himself artistically through the creation of any products without fear of running afoul of the scope of the law accord native am arts inc v village originals inc  fsuppd   ndill the statute does not interfere with the artistic content of defendants merchandise  hence the statute does not threaten  to chill the constitutionally protected conduct gaudreau  fd at  of any artisan or individual wishing to express himself through the creation of goods which may be publiclyperceived to be indian products pourhassans concern for individuals in the aforesaid category therefore cannot form the basis for pursuing a facial vagueness challenge to the statute the rights of a second category of individuals are more compelling two district courts have considered the constitutionality of the  usc § s civil counterpart  usc § e and concluded that the statute does implicate first amendment scrutiny since it involves the expressive aspects of commercial advertising village originals  fsuppd at  see also hochunk nation v natures gifts inc  wl   ndill mar  defendant concedes that the act restricts commercial speech commercial speech which is speech related solely to the economic interests of the speaker is protected by the first amendment this court agrees with the conclusions of village originals and natures gifts and rules that  usc §  implicates constitutionally protected speech since as discussed above the statute in substance and effect may require some actors to make some affirmative statement regarding the actual origin of certain products or be subject to prosecution while first amendment concerns exist in such a situation it is of some import to note that those constitutional rights are minimal although speech is at issue the statute restricts or forces some form of commercial advertising which is generally afforded a lower level of scrutiny than noncommercial speech see eg central hudson gas  elec corp v public serv commn  us    sct   ledd   us west inc v federal communications commn  fd   th cir moreover the supreme court has made clear that there are material differences between disclosure requirements and outright prohibitions on speech such that the first amendment interests implicated by disclosure requirements are substantially weaker than those at stake when speech is actually suppressed zauderer v office of disciplinary counsel of supreme court of ohio  us    n   sct   ledd   applying a rational relation test in reviewing a statutory requirement that attorney disclose contingentfee arrangement particulars based on the above analysis the statute threatens speech andor conduct which is protected albeit at a minimal level by the first amendment pursuant to the test set forth in gaudreau then a facial vagueness challenge is proper  fd at  iii standard of review having concluded that a facial vagueness challenge is proper the next issue is what standard of review applies as a starting point the court begins with the longstanding principle that when reviewing a statute alleged to be vague courts must indulge a presumption that it is constitutional and the statute must be upheld unless the court is satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the legislature went beyond the confines of the constitution day  fd at  quoting brecheisen v mondragon  fd   th cir jane l v bangerter  fd   th cir as a general matter the void for vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement kolender v lawson  us    sct   ledd   see also day  fd at  quoting corrow  fd at  while there is some overlap between these two concerns the supreme court and the tenth circuit have indicated that courts should treat each element separately see kolender  us at   sct  corrow  fd at  gaudreau  fd at  the meaning of sufficient definitiveness is an important question and that preliminary issue is considered in some detail here the level of specificity required in a particular statute and hence the standard of review of the statute involved in this case is dictated by several factors criminal statutes must be more precise than civil statutes because the consequences of vagueness are more severe further a scienter requirement may mitigate a criminal laws vagueness by ensuring that it punishes only those who are aware their conduct is unlawful also regulatory statutes governing business activities may be less precise because the conduct proscribed is usually in a narrow category and the regulated enterprise may have the ability to clarify the meaning of the regulation by inquiring of an administrative agency or resort to an administrative process finally the constitution demands more clarity of laws which threaten to inhibit constitutionally protected conduct especially conduct protected by the first amendment gaudreau  fd at  emphasis added since  usc §  is a criminal statute the first factor counsels in favor of more precision murphy v matheson  fd   th cir applying a strict test of specificity for a criminal statute that had no impact on constitutionally protected conduct as noted above  usc § b contains a knowing scienter requirement so the second factor requires less precision  usc §  is not a regulatory statute governing business activities so the third factor does not allow for less precision the last factor favors slightly more precision since the statute threatens to inhibit at least some minimal constitutionally protected conduct the supreme court has stated that this final factor is perhaps the most important factor affecting the clarity that the constitution demands of a law village of hoffman estates v flipside hoffman estates inc  us    sct   ledd   in considering the appropriate level of scrutiny it is of some help to consider two demonstrative cases in murphy the tenth circuit applied a strict test of specificity when considering a utah statute which regulated the possession manufacture delivery and advertisement of drug paraphernalia  fd at  the utah statute subjected offenders to criminal penalties see id at  n  quoting the statute although the court upheld the constitutionality of the statute in a facial vagueness challenge the court employed a strict standard of review the statute here like the ordinance in flipside regulates economic activity and contains a scienter requirement further  the statute does not inhibit constitutionally protected rights however because violations carry criminal penalties we apply a strict test of specificity id at  emphasis added the court upheld the statute despite an acknowledgment by the court that the phrase drug paraphernalia was a somewhat ambiguous term see id the supreme court applied a strict test concerning vagueness in kolender in that case the supreme court considered a california criminal statute which required that persons who loiter or wander on the streets provide credible and reliable identification and to account for their presence when requested by a police officer in a facial challenge the court held that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because the phrase credible and reliable could not be defined with sufficient precision and was subject to multiple meanings see kolender  us at   sct  we conclude the statute is unconstitutionally vague on its face because it encourages arbitrary enforcement by failing to describe with sufficient particularity what a suspect must do in order to satisfy the statute in so holding the court indicated that it was applying a higher level of scrutiny thus distinguishing flipside because the statute imposed criminal sanctions and implicated constitutional rights see id at  n   sct  based upon the above cases since this case involves a criminal statute which raises first amendment concerns a strict test concerning vagueness is demanded with this in mind the court proceeds to consider whether the statute implicated in this case passes muster iv analysis a fair notice the first element of the vagueness analysis is the fair notice requirement as generally stated the voidforvagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited id at   sct  gaudreau  fd at  pourhassan argues that the phrases indian produced and falsely suggests are both unconstitutionally vague see mem in supp of mot to dismiss indictment on vagueness grounds at   pourhassan contends that the phrase indian produced is vague because it provides no guidance on how to handle certain products is it sufficient that a member of an indian tribe design and supervise the production does the participation of any non native american in the production render an item violative of the statute for example if a native american handcarved a wooden totem pole but nonnative americans assisted in the roughcutting and subsequently cleaned and varnished the item prior to sale would the item be indian produced must the seller disclose the participation of a nonmember in the process id at  as discussed above the code of federal regulations defines the term indian product as any art or craft product made by an indian  cfr § d see also  usc § c defining this term as the meaning given it by the secretary of the interior in a brief discussion of this phrase the government responds that simply stated indian produced means made by an indian as that term is defined in §  and cfr § a supplemental mem in supp of governments oppn to defs mot to dismiss indictment on vagueness grounds at  the court agrees with the government and rules that items which are indian produced are indian products the phrase indian product is not vague and the phrase means what it says any art or craft product made by an indian  cfr § d it does not include products which are jointly manufactured by indians and nonindians or products which are designed by an indian and made by a nonindian the phrase indian produced therefore is not unconstitutionally vague pourhassan also contends that the phrase falsely suggests language is vague because it is unclear whether the phrase requires an affirmative misrepresentation such as false labeling or an oral or written warranty while pourhassan is correct that the phrase is somewhat ambiguous the vagueness of the term is lessened when the statute is read as a whole of particular importance is the wellestablished principle that a scienter requirement may mitigate a laws vagueness especially with respect to the adequacy of the notice to the complainant that his conduct is proscribed flipside  us at   sct  see also murphy  fd at  however it is evident that  the scienter which mitigates vagueness meant must be some other kind of scienter than that traditionally known to the common lawthe knowing performance of an act with the intent to bring about that thing whatever it is which the statute proscribes knowledge of the fact that it is so proscribed being immaterial such scienter would clarify nothing a clarificatory scienter must envisage not only a knowing what is done but a knowing that what is done is unlawful or at least so wrong that it is probably unlawful note the voidforvagueness doctrine in the supreme court  upalrev   n   emphasis added cited in flipside  us at  n   sct  in murphy for example the tenth circuit held that an intent scienter was sufficient to save a statute which criminalized the possession selling or manufacturing of drug paraphernalia from a vagueness challenge because in order to have a conviction it is necessary that a person possess sell or manufacture an item with the intent that the item be drug paraphernalia since the person must actually intend that an item be drug paraphernalia he has notice of his criminal act and due process is satisfied  fd at  citations omitted in this case criminal liability attaches only when a person knowingly violates  usc § a see  usc § b reading  usc §§ a and b together then an individual runs afoul of the law only when he knowingly makes a false suggestion stated another way a seller must know that his words or acts suggest a falsity in its most simple formulation then a seller is liable under the statute only when he knowingly lies while one may imagine different variations of how a seller could knowingly lie eg an outright misrepresentation or a false label the phrase does not criminalize a sellers innocent acts which are simply misinterpreted by a buyer the statute provides adequate notice to the public of what conduct is forbidden a seller may not knowingly lie by making the false suggestion that an item for sale was made by an indian when in fact it was not b enforcement standards the second element of the vagueness analysis is the adequacy of the enforcement standards whether the statute authorizes or encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by establishing a standardless sweep that allows policemen prosecutors and juries to pursue their personal predilections kolender  us at    sct  gaudreau  fd at  this element envisions a slightly different consideration than that considered in the discussion of fair notice above in coates v cincinnati for example the court invalidated a statute that criminalized the acts of three or more persons assembling on a sidewalk who there conduct themselves in a manner annoying to persons passing by  us   n   sct   ledd   the court stated the ordinances use of the word annoying is vague not in the sense that it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all id at   sct  since no standard for annoying was enunciated in the statute the court believed that it provided for policemen prosecutors and juries to make up their own standard based entirely on their own preferences and predilections as set forth above  usc §  prohibits a seller from knowingly lying about the origin of nonindian goods while a knowing false suggestion the prohibited act might take several forms and it will ultimately be a jurys responsibility to determine whether any particular seller made a knowingly false suggestion that an item was indian produced it is not vague in a way that authorizes or encourages arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement v conclusion based on the analysis above  usc §  is not unconstitutionally vague defendants motion to dismiss therefore is denied it is so ordered footnotes  during argument defense counsel indicated that he was satisfied with the specification of the factual predicate of the indictment that has been provided by the government and stated that he was withdrawing and no longer pursuing his motion for a bill of particulars accordingly this order only addresses defendants motion to dismiss   usc §  was amended in  the former law provided whoever willfully offers or displays for sale any goods  as indian products or indian products of a particular indian tribe or group resident within the united states or the territory of alaska when such person knows such goods are not indian products or are not indian products of the particular indian tribe or group shall be fined not more than  or imprisoned not more than six months or both  the gaudreau decision sets forth one additional circumstance when a facial challenge is appropriate in a declaratory judgment action where no one has yet been charged  the court cannot evaluate the statute as applied in these cases the challenger may attempt to facially attack the statute as vague in all of its applications  fd at  since pourhassan has been charged under this statute and this is not a declaratory judgment action this second circumstance is inapposite to the case at hand  the fact that pourhassans vagueness argument is difficult to distinguish from an overbreadth argument as evidenced by pourhassans use of the term overbroad throughout his memoranda is of little concern since the supreme court often speaks of the vagueness and overbreadth doctrines together see eg kolender v lawson  us   n   sct   ledd   we have traditionally viewed vagueness and overbreadth as logically related and similar doctrines see also ronald d rotunda  john e nowak treatise on constitutional law §  at  d ed the problem of vagueness in statutes regulating speech activities is based on the same rationale as the overbreadth doctrine and the supreme court often speaks of them together  as an example of the sellers behavior that may be innocent but wrongly interpreted by a buyer as a suggestion that the good for sale are indian products consider the situation of a seller of nonindian products who dresses in traditional indian garb in order to express himself or more likely in order to attract more business arguably the seller of nonindian products would be prohibited from such behavior because of the possibility that a potential buyer would equate the indian garb with a suggestion by the seller that the goods in question were manufactured by indians despite the fact that the seller has not made any affirmative representation about the origin of the goods  the majority opinion in kolender v lawson  us   sct   ledd   could be interpreted as support for a conclusion that a manufacturers speech is threatened by  usc §  in kolender the supreme court considered a california statute which required that persons who loiter or wander on the streets provide credible and reliable identification and to account for their presence when requested by a police officer without much discussion the majority concluded that the california statute implicated consideration of the constitutional right to freedom of movement id at   sct  but see id at   sct  j white dissenting here the majority makes a vague reference to potential suppression of first amendment liberties but the precise nature of the liberties threatened are never mentioned an argument could be made that kolender favors a conclusion that  usc §  implicates consideration of the rights of manufacturers or artisans to create art while this is a legitimate argument the court concludes that  usc §  is a different statute and the broad language of kolender is inapplicable to the instant case in any event the point is largely moot because as discussed at length below the court agrees that pourhassan is entitled to make a facial challenge   usc § e imposes civil liability upon an individual who as in its criminal counterpart offers or displays for sale or sells a good  in a manner that falsely suggests it is indian produced an indian product or the product of a particular indian or indian tribe or indian arts and crafts organization id  the real danger of the statute in this case is that it arguably threatens to force speech not quash it while the language of zauderer makes clear that the first amendment is implicated by disclosure requirements it is not immediately obvious that the test set forth in gaudreau for the appropriateness of a facial challenge which speaks in terms of a statute that threatens to chill constitutionally protected conduct means to apply to such first amendment concerns one response to this is that the statute at issue in this case does threaten to chill a sellers right to remain silent which is recognized as constitutionally protected conduct see eg russo v central sch dist  fd   d cir the right to remain silent in the face of an illegitimate demand for speech is as much a part of first amendment protections as the right to speak out in the face of an illegitimate demand for silence in any event there are no logical reasons to distinguish the types of first amendment concerns implicated in the instant case the court concludes that the constitutional concerns implicated in this statute are real recognizable and sufficient to allow a facial vagueness challenge  a fair reading of murphy is that a strict vagueness test applies whenever a court evaluates a criminal statutes a fortiori a strict vagueness test would apply in the instant case since the statute implicates some first amendment concerns  kolender is not directly on point according to the kolender court the california statute implicates consideration of the constitutional right to freedom of movement id at   sct  the opinion does not directly address the statutes requirement that a suspect identify himself which may implicate an individuals first amendment right by forcing him to speak like the statute at issue here in addition the speech at issue in this case is commercial speech which as discussed above is afforded a lower level of constitutional protection than the constitutional right at issue in kolender also the statute at issue in kolender does not appear to contain a scienter requirement like the statute at issue in this case see id at  n   sct  quoting the language of the california statute  the conclusion that a strict vagueness test is not necessarily obvious in village of hoffman estates v flipside hoffman estates inc  us   sct   ledd   for example the supreme court used a low level of scrutiny in that case the supreme court rejected a preenforcement facial vagueness challenge to a quasicriminal civil statute which regulated the sale of items designed or marketed for use with illegal cannabis or drugs id at    sct  the court held that the phrase designed or marketed for use was sufficiently specific in the context of the statute at issue because a business person of ordinary intelligence would understand that these terms refer  to the design of the manufacturer or marketing of the item not the intent of the retailer or customer id at   sct  in the later kolender decision the supreme court reemphasized that the flipside court was applying a less strict vagueness test because its subject matter ie the regulation of business behavior is often more narrow than noncommercial free speech or free association contexts  us at  n   sct  emphasis added see also parker v levy  us    sct   ledd   applying a less stringent vagueness analysis because of the factors differentiating military society from civilian society while the instant case also involves commercial speech the statute here is different from the one considering in flipside because  usc §  provides for criminal sanctions as noted in murphy the criminalcivil distinction is important and perhaps dispositive  to be clear consider the following sets of hypotheticals in the first seller x sells an item he knows to be made entirely by a nonindian if seller x knowingly lies to buyer b by indicating that the item is indian produced he violates the statute if seller x knowingly lies to buyer b by indicating that the item is produced by the combined efforts of an indian artisan and a nonindian artisan he does not violate the statute though he may be liable for fraud under a separate statute if seller x tells buyer b the truth or if buyer b misunderstands the innocent acts of seller x to be some indication that the item is entirely indian produced seller x does not violate the statute in the second hypothetical seller y sells an item he knows to be jointly made by an indian and a nonindian if seller y knowingly lies to buyer b by indicating that the item is entirely indian produced he violates the statute if seller y tells buyer b the truth or if buyer b misunderstands the innocent acts of seller y to be some indication that the item is entirely indian produced seller y does not violate the statute in the last hypothetical seller z sells an item that is entirely indian produced seller z cannot violate the statute comment your name your email comments  characters remaining leaglecom reserves the right to edit or remove comments but is under no

the story of one mans disenchantment with the modern teachings of islam the religious philosophy at the very heart of his ethnic and family identity it also shares a more important message  that of the common heritage of islam judaism and christianity and the simple commandment that they all share  human beings should love one another and do good this book has been written for moslems so that they might be encouraged to read the koran for themselves and question why their religious authorities have presumed to be the sole interpreters of this important religious work this book has been written for jews and christians so that they might recognize the heritage they share with islam in the koran is the passage god has sent down the book to you with truth to confirm whatever existed before he sent down the torah and the new testament christian readers especially will be interested to learn that the koran teaches that jesus was gods best prophet and that christians will be placed above nonbelievers until the day of judgement and finally this book has been written for anyone interested in learning the truth about one of the worlds oldest and most widespread religious traditionsproduct identifiersisbnxisbnkey detailsauthornader pourhassanformathardcoverpublication datelanguageenglishpublisherbarbed wire publishingpublication year ratings and reviews product ratingmost relevant reviewsby sgirloct  a must readthis is such a great book it is wellwritten in simple language with ample proof shown from the quran to back up his statements it is in no way a book that ridicules islam as i was a little weary about when i saw the title but rather it explains how the islam that is preached and practiced today by most muslims is actually not as allah god has ordered islam has been corrupted  sometimes intentionally sometimes purely unintentionally due to lack of education  over the centuries to become a religion that is feared by most nonmuslims anyone who has thought about becoming muslim or who just wants to understand islam should definately read this book it really should be required reading for every person today who calls themself a true muslim  then there would not be so much violence in this world read full reviewbest selling in other bookstrending price is based on prices over last  daysgeorge r r martins a game of thrones

pourhassan hiv drug could be ‘gamechanger’ august   vancouver’s the columbian–if all goes as planned the vancouverbased biotechnology company cytodyn inc will introduce a “gamechanging” hiv therapy for sale sometime in  “we could be commercialized in the first half of ” said nader pourhassan president and ceo of the company which has seismic ambitions “this is a very exciting time” he added this is indeed an exciting time for cytodyn a firm that pourhassan pulled from the verge of bankruptcy in  and whose headquarters is tucked inside an upperfloor office on downtown’s main street the reason for the excitement pro  it’s a selfinjectable antibody — not a chemically synthesized drug — that belongs to a class of hiv therapies known as “entry inhibitors” that shield healthy cells from viral infection and that block transmission of the virus to others or as pourhassan put it “you’re blocking the virus from opening the door” pro  has gone through multiple clinical trials each showing reduced or controlled hiv viral loads what’s more the us food and drug administration has designated pro  as a “fasttrack” drug candidate the fda’s fasttrack process speeds the development and review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill unmet medical needs to be certain pro  isn’t a cure however cytodyn believes it has advantages including less toxicity and fewer side effects over current treatments it also would replace gobs of daily pills with one shot per week in a recent federal regulatory filing the company which is traded publicly as a penny stock said pro  “has the potential to be the first longacting weekly or every other week selfadministered hiv therapy” “in the world of hiv right now the only thing you have is pills” pourhassan said “once the patient misses a pill they become resistant to one class then they have to change to others now you’ve got aids” with pro  he said you have a “huge gamechanger on many fronts” challenges to cytodyn loom though it remains unprofitable as of may  of this year the company said in a filing with the us securities and exchange commission “we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  million” the company has three local employees including pourhassan and several independent consultants assisting with research and manufacturing activities it’s also up against pharmaceutical giants such as pfizer and gilead sciences “we expect that these companies will compete fiercely to defend and expand their market share” cytodyn said in its sec filing still pourhassen who was born in iran and who has a phd in mechanical engineering from the university of utah exudes confidence about cytodyn’s future “i can tell you” he said “in the past we never failed to raise money” in fact pourhassen saved the firm from bankruptcy after joining it in  as chief operating officer he deferred his salary and used tens of thousands of his own dollars “doing road trips and raising money” he said to shore up cytodyn the company found its home base in vancouver after pourhassen decided to relocate its headquarters from lake oswegoo ore to ease the commute for the firm’s chief financial officer mike mulholland who lives in vancouver in the us alone pourhassen said pro  could sell “at least a billion dollars” if all goes as planned “we help humanity” he said “that’s something that goes on our rsum for the rest of our lives” by
