energy company engaged in the exploration and production of oil and gas and the transportation refining and marketing of gas and petroleum products founded in  under president hipólito yrigoyens administration ypf was the first oil company established as a state enterprise outside of the soviet union and the first state oil company to become vertically integrated its founder and first director was enrique mosconi who advocated economic independence and starting in  nationalization of oil supplies the latter however was never achieved due to a  military coup backed among others by foreign oil trusts against yrigoyen ypf was privatized in  and bought by the spanish firm repsol sa in  the resulting merger produced repsol ypf the renationalization of  of the firm was initiated in  by president cristina fernández de kirchner the government of argentina eventually agreed to pay  billion compensation to repsol contents  history  early development  energy selfsufficiency  decline

general enrique mosconi on whose initiative ypf was founded roughnecks at work in a chubut province well in  the early development of large deposits in the area allowed ypf to become a local market leader from its outset ypf administrative building in general mosconi a company town founded by ypf outside comodoro rivadavia former headquarters on diagonal norte avenue  a ypf gas station in chacarita buenos aires  oil train exhibited at the petroleum museum filling station in ushuaia the company specializing in the exploration production refining and commercialization of petroleum had its origin in  when oil was discovered near the city of comodoro rivadavia in chubut following world war i oil had become an important resource leading to struggles between rival powers to gain control of it ypf was created by president hipólito yrigoyen and general enrique mosconi on  june  it was the first entirely staterun oil company in the world the second being the french compagnie française des pétroles cfp french company of petroleum created in  by the conservative prime minister raymond poincaré ypfs creation was followed by the creation of ancap in uruguay  ypfb in bolivia  pemex in mexico  enap in chile  and petrobras in brazil  mosconi served as ypfs first director ypf bought its first tanker in the united states in  and built not only several extracting facilities but whole towns and cities such as comodoro rivadavia caleta olivia in santa cruz plaza huincul in neuquén and general mosconi in salta bolstered by production in comodoro rivadavia the firm produced  million barrels in its first year of operation  this represented over three quarters of domestic production and nearly a fourth of argentinas oil consumption that year contracts signed in  with bethlehem steel allowed ypf to begin the production of gasoline and kerosene mosconi who had previously been in charge of the aeronautics division of the army proposed to joaquín corvalán governor of salta province the exploitation of saltas oil by ypf offering  royalties for the province corvalán allied with the standard oil of new jersey rejected mosconis proposal however referring to the concept of provincial autonomy this refusal led mosconi to evolve in favor of the nationalization of oil supplies in order to strengthen argentinas independence the first ypf oil refinery was inaugurated in december  in la plata and was at the time the tenth largest in the world according to mosconi this spawned the beginning of the mobilization of all sort of resistance and obstacles from the oil trusts in particular from standard oil which was one of the most influential foreign companies in argentina with a presence in comodoro rivadavia jujuy and salta the chamber of deputies approved a law on  september  establishing a state monopoly on oil the monopoly however was not absolute being limited to oil exploration exploitation and transport but excluding selling and imports private firms opposed themselves to the law project refusing to pay a  royalty the bill was supported by president marcelo torcuato de alvear but was ultimately blocked by the conservatives in the senate oil nationalization became an important theme of yrigoyens electoral campaign of  although the yrigoyenistas focused their criticism on standard oil of new jersey abstaining themselves from attacking british empire interests to which argentinas economy was closely linked in particular royal dutch shell following yrigoyens victory in the  elections ypf still directed by enrique mosconi reduced oil prices in may  leading to the cheapest petroleum in the world and to an important increase in ypfs sales compared to its rival private companies forcing them to also lower their prices mosconi also reduced the price of kerosene and agrochemicals to contribute to the development of the interior regions of argentina ypf produced  million barrels by  and though its share of domestic output had declined to  from  in  amid a sharp rise of esso and royal dutch shell production in chubut the firm now covered a third of the nations oil market a partnership with distributor auger  co signed in  resulted in a network of over  filling stations selling  million liters  million gallons by  – an  market share company revenues in  reached us million the petroleum institute instituto del petróleo was created on  december  and directed by ricardo rojas the rector of the university of buenos aires foreseeing conflicts with us private companies mosconi proposed an agreement with the soviet state company amtorg which was to allow argentina to import  tons of petroleum each year paid by trade with leather wool tannin and mutton the agreement was to be made official in september  along with the complete nationalization of oil resources but on  september  yrigoyen was deposed by a military coup headed by general josé félix uriburu and the project was withdrawn energy selfsufficiencyedit the coup was lobbied for chiefly by standard oil whose interests in salta province and neighboring bolivia conflicted with those of ypf the subsequent concordance regime supported ypf however and its role as the nations leading oil distillates retailer was bolstered by a  agreement with the automóvil club argentino aca to supply a chain of aca service stations oil production by ypf continued to grow and soon eclipsed private production from just over  million barrels  of the total in  production grew to  million in   the development of the nations sizable natural gas resources also originated largely from ypf drawing from an initiative by ypf director julio canessa president juan perón ordered gas flared by ypf oil extraction captured and the staple nationalized thus establishing the sister firm gas del estado state gas in  the nations first gas compressor and what at the time was the worlds longest gas pipeline were completed by  leading to a fiftyfold increase in natural gas production oil production at ypf surpassed  million barrels  of the nations total by  this gain was partly offset by a  drop in privatesector output however such that overall oil production rose by only onethird during the peronist decade while annual consumption nearly doubled to  million barrels the nations oil supply thus shifted from  domestic in  to  imported by  oil imports by  rose to us million or over one fourth of total merchandise imports perón had made economic nationalism a policy centerpiece ypf was granted an exemption from steep oil import tariffs levied on private firms and article  of the constitution of  stipulated the nationalization of all energy and mineral resources the deteriorating oil deficit led perón to court foreign investment in the sector as early as  however when an oil drilling contract was signed by ypf with us firm drilexco total exploration doubled and significant reserves in salta province were developed a more controversial joint venture with standard oil of california was signed in  for the eventual production of up to  million barrels a year these initiatives were opposed by much of the army the opposition ucr and among others peróns point man on national oil policy ypf head julio canessa who was dismissed the venture ended following peróns overthrow in september an erstwhile critic of both the drilexco and standard oil contracts president arturo frondizi enacted policies in  which granted foreign firms rental contracts by ypf over new wells to foster exploration and production a key part of the developmentalist economic policy advanced by frondizi this policy was made with the caveat that oil and gas resources themselves would be renationalized thirteen contracts were signed with mainly us firms whereby each contractor would earn  of the revenues produced from the new wells private production which had virtually ceased grew to become one third of the nations total ypf itself benefited by way of a royalty bonanza which financed record investments these in turn led a doubling of ypf production to  million barrels including the private sector argentinas oil production thus nearly tripled to  million barrels by  and despite higher consumption imports fell to merely one sixth of total demand these contracts created a controversy referred to by frondizi himself as the oil battle and were ultimately cancelled by president arturo illia in  over concerns that ypf would be deprived of adequate returns for its exploration investments of the foreign firms which had taken part in the  bids only amoco remained the cancellations cost us million in indemnity payments though they proved fortuitous after the companys discovery of the puesto hernández field in  puesto hernández near rincón de los sauces neuquén province was later declared the national energy capital due to its having at the time around half of argentinas reserves of oil and natural gas this discovery allowed ypf output to rise by  between  and  to  million barrels its share of the nations oil output growing from twothirds to threefourths new oil field rental contracts were signed following a  policy change enacted by president juan carlos onganía which had the goal of achieving selfsufficiency in oil by  regaining its monopoly on oil imports in  which still averaged around  million barrels ypf retained a majority of production  as well as refining and distribution  of petroleum in argentina the firm operated  refineries and  service stations by  while production reached  million barrels decline and privatizationedit ypf business jet aeroparque newbery  roberto dromi opens the offers for the privatization of ypf peróns return to argentina and to the presidency in  was followed by the addition of nearly  employees ypf employed  by  it also coincided with the  oil shock however and the us million in added oil import costs combined with larger payrolls to erase profits in  while production declined slightly the dictatorship installed in a march  coup initially presided over a revitalization and streamlining of ypf output increased by  and its finances initially improved following a wave of layoffs that returned employment levels to around  by  the military government was openly hostile to ypfs paramount position in the oil industry however the company lost money every year after  and by  was us billion in debt ypf losses resulted at least in large part from policy decisions beyond its control government policy after  kept oil prices well below inflation with the consequence that costs increased faster than income ypf also bore an extremely heavy tax burden as  of its revenues were paid as tax to the national and provincial governments as well as a long list of state agencies that included the national energy fund the national highway council and the provincial road fund another serious drain resulted from the failure of other state enterprises such as argentine railways and the national airline to pay ypf for their fuel in full and on time these intergovernmental accounts represented  of ypfs sales and were as much as ten years in arrears the tax policy of the military government followed the same path as its civilian predecessors a path that regarded ypf as a convenient source of funds to ease the countrys chronic and serious fiscal deficit position the death in a helicopter crash of the firms director raúl ondarts and the appointment of general guillermo suárez mason in  was followed by a period of severe mismanagement moreover powerful as head of the first army corps which committed many of the dirty war atrocities suárez mason installed many of his hardline army intelligence colleagues in managerial posts at ypf they in turn diverted large quantities of fuel into the directors newly established company sol petróleo a dummy corporation used by suárez mason and his appointees for embezzlement as well as to divert funds to the contras and the fascist organization p to which the director belonged suárez mason had ypf borrow heavily not only to cover such asset stripping but also at the behest of economy minister josé alfredo martínez de hoz whose bid for currency strength and policy of financial deregulation required a sharp rise in foreign debt to maintain ypf debts thus rose fold during suárez masons tenure at the end of which in  the company recorded a us billion loss the largest in the world at the time ypf nonetheless remained the th largest firm in the world with sales of over us billion in  argentine president carlos menem initiated the privatization of ypf through an ipo on the new york and other stock exchanges on  june  at a value of us billion for stock equal to a  share in the company during the  months prior to the ipo ypf underwent a massive restructuring process led by its new ceo josé estenssoro who had been appointed by president menem the staff of ypf was reduced from  to  through layoffs agreed with unions and outsourcing of services to companies established by former ypf employees during the restructuring process the financial bottom line for the company was increased from a loss about  billion in  although the accounting system at the time could not accurately compute actual profit to a profit of  billion in  and the underlying value of ypf was increased from about us billion to the us billion after privatization estenssoro stayed on as ceo further streamlined the company while expanding its reach outside argentina acquiring maxus energy corporation of dallas for us million in  estenssoro died in a plane crash in ecuador where maxus maintained wells in may of that year his policy of high exploration investments was maintained by his successor nells león and reserves expanded by  while production rose from  million barrels in  to a record  million in  of the latter total  million were produced by maxus operations in ecuador and elsewhere repsol acquisitionedit repsolypf tower madridbased multinational corporation repsol sa purchased  of ypf in  in two stages a  share sold by the national government for us billion and a

of us billion in  the first negative figure since  and the relationship between ypf and the government became difficult investment in exploration at ypf as a percentage of profits had been far below those in most other repsol subsidiaries market analysts and repsol blamed the decline in exploration and production on government controls on exports and prospecting lease awards and price controls on domestic oil and gas political risks and government intervention including price controls have discouraged foreign investment in oil production in latin america in general president cristina fernández de kirchner raised ypf frequently in speeches during march  claiming that underinvestment and excessive dividends at the firm had caused declines in output governors in six fossilfuel producing provinces subsequently revoked ypf leases representing a fifth of its oil production cristina fernández de kirchner announces the bill to renationalize ypf citing brazilian oil giant petrobras as an example the president announced the introduction of a bill on  april  for the renationalization of ypf the national government would purchase a controlling  share with ten provincial governments

rajoy and other spanish officials objected to the nationalisation accusing the argentine government of driving down ypf shares ahead of the announcement market price of the shares declined by over half from february to april economy minister hernán lorenzino claimed in turn that asset stripping at ypf had financed repsols expansion in other parts of the world responses included a diplomatic offensive by rajoy in other countries in the region assurances by industry minister josé manuel soria of clear and decisive spanish government measures foreign minister josé garcíamargallo y marfils admonition that argentina had shot itself in the foot by damaging relations with spain and other threats the chinese state oil concern sinopec was reported to have been in talks to buy out repsols share in ypf – a potential deal scuttled by the argentine announcement both repsol and ypf shares fell sharply before and after the announcement and the cost of insuring argentine government bonds against default rose as did those of spain repsol chairman brufau estimated the company’s potential loss at € billion us billion the largest minority shareholder the petersen group had financed their initial purchase of  of the stock with a vendor’s loan from repsol for € billion the  agreement required repsol to buy back shares owned by the group and to assume the loan should the madridbased firm lose majority control of ypf sebastián eskenazi indicated however that the group would forgo this option the senate of argentina approved the takeover on  april with  votes in favor of the measure three opposing it and four abstentions the chamber of deputies in turn approved the bill on  may with  votes out of  and six abstentions the president signed the renationalization into law on  may miguel galluccio an argentine petroleum engineer with experience at both ypf and at oilfield services leader schlumberger as president of its production management division in london was appointed ceo argentine deputy economy minister axel kicillof rejected repsols initial demands for payment of us billion for a  stake in ypf the state sought  citing debts of nearly us billion the book value of ypf was us billion at the end of  its total market capitalization on the day of the announcement was us billion repsol officials submitted the matter to the world bank icisd for arbitration the argentine government and repsol reached agreement in principle on compensation in november  and on february   repsol announced final agreement that the argentine government would provide repsol with guaranteed argentine government bonds of varying maturities the nominal amount varying to assure that repsol would in fact receive us billion in compensation for the  of ypf nationalized ypf also acquired a

petrolíferos fiscales  english fiscal oilfields  is a vertically integrated argentine energy company engaged in the exploration and production of oil and gas and the transportation refining and marketing of gas and petroleum products founded in  under president hipólito yrigoyens administration ypf was the first oil company established as a state enterprise outside of the soviet union and the first state oil company to become vertically integrated its founder and first director was enrique mosconi who advocated economic independence and starting in  nationalization of oil supplies the latter however was never achieved due to a  military coup backed among others by foreign oil trusts against yrigoyen ypf was privatized in  and bought by the spanish firm repsol sa in  the resulting merger produced repsol ypf the renationalization of  of the firm was initiated in  by president cristina fernández de kirchner the government of argentina eventually agreed to pay  billion

outside comodoro rivadavia former headquarters on diagonal norte avenue  a ypf gas station in chacarita buenos aires  oil train exhibited at the petroleum museum filling station in ushuaia the company specializing in the exploration production refining and commercialization of petroleum had its origin in  when oil was discovered near the city of comodoro rivadavia in chubut following world war i oil had become an important resource leading to struggles between rival powers to gain control of it ypf was created by president hipólito yrigoyen and general enrique mosconi on  june  it was the first entirely staterun oil company in the world the second being the french compagnie française des pétroles cfp french company of petroleum created in  by the conservative prime minister raymond poincaré ypfs creation was followed by the creation of ancap in uruguay  ypfb in bolivia  pemex in mexico  enap in chile  and petrobras in brazil  mosconi served as ypfs first director ypf bought its first tanker in the united states in  and built not only several extracting facilities but whole towns and cities such as comodoro rivadavia caleta olivia in santa cruz plaza huincul in neuquén and general mosconi in salta bolstered by production in comodoro rivadavia the firm produced  million barrels in its first year of operation  this represented over three quarters of domestic production and nearly a fourth of argentinas oil consumption that year contracts signed in  with bethlehem steel allowed ypf to begin the production of gasoline and kerosene mosconi who had previously been in charge of the aeronautics division of the army proposed to joaquín corvalán governor of salta province the exploitation of saltas oil by ypf offering  royalties for the province corvalán allied with the standard oil of new jersey rejected mosconis proposal however referring to the concept of provincial autonomy this refusal led mosconi to evolve in favor of the nationalization of oil supplies in order to strengthen argentinas independence the first ypf oil refinery was inaugurated in december  in la plata and was at the time the tenth largest in the world according to mosconi this spawned the beginning of the mobilization of all sort of resistance and obstacles from the oil trusts in particular from standard oil which was one of the most influential foreign companies in argentina with a presence in comodoro rivadavia jujuy and salta the chamber of deputies approved a law on  september  establishing a state monopoly on oil the monopoly however was not absolute being limited to oil exploration exploitation and transport but excluding selling and imports private firms opposed themselves to the law project refusing to pay a  royalty the bill was supported by president marcelo torcuato de alvear but was ultimately blocked by the conservatives in the senate oil nationalization became an important theme of yrigoyens electoral campaign of  although the yrigoyenistas focused their criticism on standard oil of new jersey abstaining themselves from attacking british empire interests to which argentinas economy was closely linked in particular royal dutch shell following yrigoyens victory in the  elections ypf still directed by enrique mosconi reduced oil prices in may  leading to the cheapest petroleum in the world and to an important increase in ypfs sales compared to its rival private companies forcing them to also lower their prices mosconi also reduced the price of kerosene and agrochemicals to contribute to the development of the interior regions of argentina ypf produced  million barrels by  and though its share of domestic output had declined to  from  in  amid a sharp rise of esso and royal dutch shell production in chubut the firm now covered a third of the nations oil market a partnership with distributor auger  co signed in  resulted in a network of over  filling stations selling  million liters  million gallons by  – an  market share company revenues in  reached us million the petroleum institute instituto del petróleo was created on  december  and directed by ricardo rojas the rector of the university of buenos aires foreseeing conflicts with us private companies mosconi proposed an agreement with the soviet state company amtorg which was to allow argentina to import  tons of petroleum each year paid by trade with leather wool tannin and mutton the agreement was to be made official in september  along with the complete nationalization of oil resources but on  september  yrigoyen was deposed by a military coup headed by general josé félix uriburu and the project was withdrawn energy selfsufficiencyedit the coup was lobbied for chiefly by standard oil whose interests in salta province and neighboring bolivia conflicted with those of ypf the subsequent concordance regime supported ypf however and its role as the nations leading oil distillates retailer was bolstered by a  agreement with the automóvil club argentino aca to supply a chain of aca service stations oil production by ypf continued to grow and soon eclipsed private production from just over  million barrels  of the total in  production grew to  million in   the development of the nations sizable natural gas resources also originated largely from ypf drawing from an initiative by ypf director julio canessa president juan perón ordered gas flared by ypf oil extraction captured and the staple nationalized thus establishing the sister firm gas del estado state gas in  the nations first gas compressor and what at the time was the worlds longest gas pipeline were completed by  leading to a fiftyfold increase in natural gas production oil production at ypf surpassed  million barrels  of the nations total by  this gain was partly offset by a  drop in privatesector output however such that overall oil production rose by only onethird during the peronist decade while annual consumption nearly doubled to  million barrels the nations oil supply thus shifted from  domestic in  to  imported by  oil imports by  rose to us million or over one fourth of total merchandise imports perón had made economic nationalism a policy centerpiece ypf was granted an exemption from steep oil import tariffs levied on private firms and article  of the constitution of  stipulated the nationalization of all energy and mineral resources the deteriorating oil deficit led perón to court foreign investment in the sector as early as  however when an oil drilling contract was signed by ypf with us firm drilexco total exploration doubled and significant reserves in salta province were developed a more controversial joint venture with standard oil of california was signed in  for the eventual production of up to  million barrels a year these initiatives were opposed by much of the army the opposition ucr and among others peróns point man on national oil policy ypf head julio canessa who was dismissed the venture ended following peróns overthrow in september an erstwhile critic of both the drilexco and standard oil contracts president arturo frondizi enacted policies in  which granted foreign firms rental contracts by ypf over new wells to foster exploration and production a key part of the developmentalist economic policy advanced by frondizi this policy was made with the caveat that oil and gas resources themselves would be renationalized thirteen contracts were signed with mainly us firms whereby each contractor would earn  of the revenues produced from the new wells private production which had virtually ceased grew to become one third of the nations total ypf itself benefited by way of a royalty bonanza which financed record investments these in turn led a doubling of ypf production to  million barrels including the private sector argentinas oil production thus nearly tripled to  million barrels by  and despite higher consumption imports fell to merely one sixth of total demand these contracts created a controversy referred to by frondizi himself as the oil battle and were ultimately cancelled by president arturo illia in  over concerns that ypf would be deprived of adequate returns for its exploration investments of the foreign firms which had taken part in the  bids only amoco remained the cancellations cost us million in indemnity payments though they proved fortuitous after the companys discovery of the puesto hernández field in  puesto hernández near rincón de los sauces neuquén province was later declared the national energy capital due to its having at the time around half of argentinas reserves of oil and natural gas this discovery allowed ypf output to rise by  between  and  to  million barrels its share of the nations oil output growing from twothirds to threefourths new oil field rental contracts were signed following a  policy change enacted by president juan carlos onganía which had the goal of achieving selfsufficiency in oil by  regaining its monopoly on oil imports in  which still averaged around  million barrels ypf retained a majority of production  as well as refining and distribution  of petroleum in argentina the firm operated

streamlining of ypf output increased by  and its finances initially improved following a wave of layoffs that returned employment levels to around  by  the military government was openly hostile to ypfs paramount position in the oil industry however the company lost money every year after  and by  was us billion in debt ypf losses resulted at least in large part from policy decisions beyond its control government policy after  kept oil prices well below inflation with the consequence that costs increased faster than income ypf also bore an extremely heavy tax burden as  of its revenues were paid as tax to the national and provincial governments as well as a long list of state agencies that included the national energy fund the national highway council and the provincial road fund another serious drain resulted from the failure of other state enterprises such as argentine railways and the national airline to pay ypf for their fuel in full and on time these intergovernmental accounts represented  of ypfs sales and were as much as ten years in arrears the tax policy of the military government followed the same path as its civilian predecessors a path that regarded ypf as a convenient source of funds to ease the countrys chronic and serious fiscal deficit position the death in a helicopter crash of the firms director raúl ondarts and the appointment of general guillermo suárez mason in  was followed by a period of severe mismanagement moreover powerful as head of the first army corps which committed many of the dirty war atrocities suárez mason installed many of his hardline army intelligence colleagues in managerial posts at ypf they in turn diverted large quantities of fuel into the directors newly established company sol petróleo a dummy corporation used by suárez mason and his appointees for embezzlement as well as to divert funds to the contras and the fascist organization p to which the director belonged suárez mason had ypf borrow heavily not only to cover such asset stripping but also at the behest of economy minister josé alfredo martínez de hoz whose bid for currency strength and policy of financial deregulation required a sharp rise in foreign debt to maintain ypf debts thus rose fold during suárez masons tenure at the end of which in  the company recorded a us billion loss the largest in the world at the time ypf nonetheless remained the th largest firm in the world with sales of over us billion in  argentine president carlos menem initiated the privatization of ypf through an ipo on the new york and other stock exchanges on  june  at a value of us billion for stock equal to a  share in the company during the  months prior to the ipo ypf underwent a massive restructuring process led by its new ceo josé estenssoro who had been appointed by president menem the staff of ypf was reduced from  to  through layoffs agreed with unions and outsourcing of services to companies established by former ypf employees during the restructuring process the financial bottom line for the company was increased from a loss about  billion in  although the accounting system at the time could not accurately compute actual profit to a profit of  billion in  and the underlying value of ypf was increased from about us billion to the us billion after privatization estenssoro stayed on as ceo further streamlined the company while expanding its reach outside argentina acquiring maxus energy corporation of dallas for us million in  estenssoro died in a plane crash in ecuador where maxus maintained wells in may of that year his

ypf as a percentage of profits had been far below those in most other repsol subsidiaries market analysts and repsol blamed the decline in exploration and production on government controls on exports

other parts of the world responses included a diplomatic offensive by rajoy in other countries in the region assurances by industry minister josé manuel soria of clear and decisive spanish government measures foreign minister josé garcíamargallo y marfils admonition that argentina had shot itself in the foot by damaging relations with spain and other threats the chinese state oil concern sinopec

minority shareholder the petersen group had financed their initial purchase of  of the stock with a vendor’s loan from repsol for € billion the  agreement required repsol to buy back shares owned by the group and to assume the loan should the madridbased firm lose majority control of ypf sebastián eskenazi indicated however that the group would forgo this option the senate of argentina approved the takeover on  april with  votes in favor of the measure three opposing it and four abstentions the chamber of deputies in turn approved the bill on  may with  votes out of  and six abstentions the

petrolíferos fiscales  english fiscal oilfields  is a vertically integrated argentine energy company engaged in the exploration and production of oil and gas and the transportation refining and marketing of gas and petroleum products founded in  under president hipólito yrigoyens administration ypf was the first oil company established as a state enterprise outside of the soviet union and the first state oil company to become vertically integrated its founder and first director was enrique mosconi who advocated economic independence and starting in  nationalization of oil supplies the latter however was never achieved due to a  military coup backed among others by foreign oil trusts against yrigoyen ypf was privatized in  and bought by the spanish firm repsol sa in  the resulting merger produced repsol ypf the renationalization of  of the firm was initiated in  by president cristina fernández de kirchner the government of argentina eventually agreed to pay  billion

outside comodoro rivadavia former headquarters on diagonal norte avenue  a ypf gas station in chacarita buenos aires  oil train exhibited at the petroleum museum filling station in ushuaia the company specializing in the exploration production refining and commercialization of petroleum had its origin in  when oil was discovered near the city of comodoro rivadavia in chubut following world war i oil had become an important resource leading to struggles between rival powers to gain control of it ypf was created by president hipólito yrigoyen and general enrique mosconi on  june  it was the first entirely staterun oil company in the world the second being the french compagnie française des pétroles cfp french company of petroleum created in  by the conservative prime minister raymond poincaré ypfs creation was followed by the creation of ancap in uruguay  ypfb in bolivia  pemex in mexico  enap in chile  and petrobras in brazil  mosconi served as ypfs first director ypf bought its first tanker in the united states in  and built not only several extracting facilities but whole towns and cities such as comodoro rivadavia caleta olivia in santa cruz plaza huincul in neuquén and general mosconi in salta bolstered by production in comodoro rivadavia the firm produced  million barrels in its first year of operation  this represented over three quarters of domestic production and nearly a fourth of argentinas oil consumption that year contracts signed in  with bethlehem steel allowed ypf to begin the production of gasoline and kerosene mosconi who had previously been in charge of the aeronautics division of the army proposed to joaquín corvalán governor of salta province the exploitation of saltas oil by ypf offering  royalties for the province corvalán allied with the standard oil of new jersey rejected mosconis proposal however referring to the concept of provincial autonomy this refusal led mosconi to evolve in favor of the nationalization of oil supplies in order to strengthen argentinas independence the first ypf oil refinery was inaugurated in december  in la plata and was at the time the tenth largest in the world according to mosconi this spawned the beginning of the mobilization of all sort of resistance and obstacles from the oil trusts in particular from standard oil which was one of the most influential foreign companies in argentina with a presence in comodoro rivadavia jujuy and salta the chamber of deputies approved a law on  september  establishing a state monopoly on oil the monopoly however was not absolute being limited to oil exploration exploitation and transport but excluding selling and imports private firms opposed themselves to the law project refusing to pay a  royalty the bill was supported by president marcelo torcuato de alvear but was ultimately blocked by the conservatives in the senate oil nationalization became an important theme of yrigoyens electoral campaign of  although the yrigoyenistas focused their criticism on standard oil of new jersey abstaining themselves from attacking british empire interests to which argentinas economy was closely linked in particular royal dutch shell following yrigoyens victory in the  elections ypf still directed by enrique mosconi reduced oil prices in may  leading to the cheapest petroleum in the world and to an important increase in ypfs sales compared to its rival private companies forcing them to also lower their prices mosconi also reduced the price of kerosene and agrochemicals to contribute to the development of the interior regions of argentina ypf produced  million barrels by  and though its share of domestic output had declined to  from  in  amid a sharp rise of esso and royal dutch shell production in chubut the firm now covered a third of the nations oil market a partnership with distributor auger  co signed in  resulted in a network of over  filling stations selling  million liters  million gallons by  – an  market share company revenues in  reached us million the petroleum institute instituto del petróleo was created on  december  and directed by ricardo rojas the rector of the university of buenos aires foreseeing conflicts with us private companies mosconi proposed an agreement with the soviet state company amtorg which was to allow argentina to import  tons of petroleum each year paid by trade with leather wool tannin and mutton the agreement was to be made official in september  along with the complete nationalization of oil resources but on  september  yrigoyen was deposed by a military coup headed by general josé félix uriburu and the project was withdrawn energy selfsufficiencyedit the coup was lobbied for chiefly by standard oil whose interests in salta province and neighboring bolivia conflicted with those of ypf the subsequent concordance regime supported ypf however and its role as the nations leading oil distillates retailer was bolstered by a  agreement with the automóvil club argentino aca to supply a chain of aca service stations oil production by ypf continued to grow and soon eclipsed private production from just over  million barrels  of the total in  production grew to  million in   the development of the nations sizable natural gas resources also originated largely from ypf drawing from an initiative by ypf director julio canessa president juan perón ordered gas flared by ypf oil extraction captured and the staple nationalized thus establishing the sister firm gas del estado state gas in  the nations first gas compressor and what at the time was the worlds longest gas pipeline were completed by  leading to a fiftyfold increase in natural gas production oil production at ypf surpassed  million barrels  of the nations total by  this gain was partly offset by a  drop in privatesector output however such that overall oil production rose by only onethird during the peronist decade while annual consumption nearly doubled to  million barrels the nations oil supply thus shifted from  domestic in  to  imported by  oil imports by  rose to us million or over one fourth of total merchandise imports perón had made economic nationalism a policy centerpiece ypf was granted an exemption from steep oil import tariffs levied on private firms and article  of the constitution of  stipulated the nationalization of all energy and mineral resources the deteriorating oil deficit led perón to court foreign investment in the sector as early as  however when an oil drilling contract was signed by ypf with us firm drilexco total exploration doubled and significant reserves in salta province were developed a more controversial joint venture with standard oil of california was signed in  for the eventual production of up to  million barrels a year these initiatives were opposed by much of the army the opposition ucr and among others peróns point man on national oil policy ypf head julio canessa who was dismissed the venture ended following peróns overthrow in september an erstwhile critic of both the drilexco and standard oil contracts president arturo frondizi enacted policies in  which granted foreign firms rental contracts by ypf over new wells to foster exploration and production a key part of the developmentalist economic policy advanced by frondizi this policy was made with the caveat that oil and gas resources themselves would be renationalized thirteen contracts were signed with mainly us firms whereby each contractor would earn  of the revenues produced from the new wells private production which had virtually ceased grew to become one third of the nations total ypf itself benefited by way of a royalty bonanza which financed record investments these in turn led a doubling of ypf production to  million barrels including the private sector argentinas oil production thus nearly tripled to  million barrels by  and despite higher consumption imports fell to merely one sixth of total demand these contracts created a controversy referred to by frondizi himself as the oil battle and were ultimately cancelled by president arturo illia in  over concerns that ypf would be deprived of adequate returns for its exploration investments of the foreign firms which had taken part in the  bids only amoco remained the cancellations cost us million in indemnity payments though they proved fortuitous after the companys discovery of the puesto hernández field in  puesto hernández near rincón de los sauces neuquén province was later declared the national energy capital due to its having at the time around half of argentinas reserves of oil and natural gas this discovery allowed ypf output to rise by  between  and  to  million barrels its share of the nations oil output growing from twothirds to threefourths new oil field rental contracts were signed following a  policy change enacted by president juan carlos onganía which had the goal of achieving selfsufficiency in oil by  regaining its monopoly on oil imports in  which still averaged around  million barrels ypf retained a majority of production  as well as refining and distribution  of petroleum in argentina the firm operated  refineries and  service stations by  while production reached  million barrels decline and privatizationedit ypf business jet aeroparque newbery  roberto dromi opens the offers for the privatization of ypf peróns return to argentina and to the presidency in  was followed by the addition of nearly  employees ypf employed  by  it also coincided with the  oil shock however and the us million in

streamlining of ypf output increased by  and its finances initially improved following a wave of layoffs that returned employment levels to around  by  the military government was openly hostile to ypfs paramount position in the oil industry however the company lost money every year after  and by  was us billion in debt ypf losses resulted at least in large part from policy decisions beyond its control government policy after  kept oil prices well below inflation with the consequence that costs increased faster than income ypf also bore an extremely heavy tax burden as  of its revenues were paid as tax to the national and provincial governments as well as a long list of state agencies that included the national energy fund the national highway council and the provincial road fund another serious drain resulted from the failure of other state enterprises such as argentine railways and the national airline to pay ypf for their fuel in full and on time these intergovernmental accounts represented  of ypfs sales and were as much as ten years in arrears the tax policy of the military government followed the same path as its civilian predecessors a path that regarded ypf as a convenient source of funds to ease the countrys chronic and serious fiscal deficit position the death in a helicopter crash of the firms director raúl ondarts and the appointment of general guillermo suárez mason in  was followed by a period of severe mismanagement moreover powerful as head of the first army corps which committed many of the dirty war atrocities suárez mason installed many of his hardline army intelligence colleagues in managerial posts at ypf they in turn diverted large quantities of fuel into the directors newly established company sol petróleo a dummy corporation used by suárez mason and his appointees for embezzlement as well as to divert funds to the contras and the fascist organization p to which the director belonged suárez mason had ypf borrow heavily not only to cover such asset stripping but also at the behest of economy minister josé alfredo martínez de hoz whose bid for currency strength and policy of financial deregulation required a sharp rise in foreign debt to maintain ypf debts thus rose fold during suárez masons tenure at the end of which in  the company recorded a us billion loss the largest in the world at the time ypf nonetheless remained the th largest firm in the world with sales of over us billion in  argentine president carlos menem initiated the privatization of ypf through an ipo on the new york and other stock exchanges on  june  at a value of us billion for stock equal to a  share in the company during the  months prior to the ipo ypf underwent a massive restructuring process led by its new ceo josé estenssoro who had been appointed by president menem the staff of ypf was reduced from  to  through layoffs agreed with unions and outsourcing of services to companies established by former ypf employees during the restructuring process the financial bottom line for the company was increased from a loss about  billion in  although the accounting system at the time could not accurately compute actual profit to a profit of  billion in  and the underlying value of ypf was increased from about us billion to the us billion after privatization estenssoro stayed on as ceo further streamlined the company while expanding its reach outside argentina acquiring maxus energy corporation of dallas for us million in  estenssoro died in a plane crash in ecuador where maxus maintained wells in may of that year his

ypf as a percentage of profits had been far below those in most other repsol subsidiaries market analysts and repsol blamed the decline in exploration and production on government controls on exports and prospecting lease awards and price controls on domestic oil and gas political risks and government intervention including price controls have discouraged foreign investment in oil production in latin america in general president cristina fernández de kirchner raised ypf frequently in speeches during march  claiming that underinvestment and excessive dividends at the firm had caused declines

other parts of the world responses included a diplomatic offensive by rajoy in other countries in the region assurances by industry minister josé manuel soria of clear and decisive spanish government measures foreign minister josé garcíamargallo y marfils admonition that argentina had shot itself in the foot by damaging relations with spain and other threats the chinese state oil concern sinopec

minority shareholder the petersen group had financed their initial purchase of  of the stock with a vendor’s loan from repsol for € billion the  agreement required repsol to buy back shares owned by the group and to assume the loan should the madridbased firm lose majority control of ypf sebastián eskenazi indicated however that the group would forgo this option the senate of argentina approved the takeover on  april with  votes in favor of the measure three opposing it and four abstentions the chamber of deputies in turn approved the bill on  may with  votes out of  and six abstentions the
