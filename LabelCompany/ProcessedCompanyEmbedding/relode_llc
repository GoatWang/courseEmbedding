agentrelode agents are friends colleagues and professionals they are stay at home parents highly connected individuals recruiters and clinicians they are the community looking out for each other and helping each other do what they love to do what are the benefits of becoming an agent earn extra income when someone you refer is hired earn extra income when a relode agent you invited refers someone who is hired take pleasure in connecting great people to great jobs without the traditional runaround work when you want where you want  you are in control of your schedule and location how do agents find out about jobsthere are three ways agents can find out about jobs to refer candidates from their network configure your agent profile is active to receive weekly emails of referral opportunities  remember to configure your agent settings to include all positions and locations from your network configure your agent profile to receive immediate emails when matching referral opportunities are identified  any time a new job order is added to the system we’ll immediately notify those agents whose settings match the job once logged in to your account at gorelodecom you can go to the jobs section browse all jobs from our web site and click on a job to refer a candidate anytime how do agents get paidagents are paid via direct deposit  once an agent has earned a reward with relode we’ll send information to the agent for registering with our payroll service  all agents are treated as independent contractors when do agents get paidagents are paid according to the specific details of their recruiting contract and relode’s recruiting policy  usually this means after relode receives payment from the client agents will receive  of their reward on day  of employment for their candidate who was hired and the remaining  reward on day   the same schedule also applies to sponsor rewards when someone you invite joins relode and refers a candidate who is hired what if i just want to connect others to jobs and not be paidno problem  we understand certain teaching advising or occupations are unable to accept rewards for connecting their networks to great jobs  in those cases relode will work with the agent to donate their reward to a local nonprofit on their behalf  no conflict for you a great candidate finds a great job and a local nonprofit is helped  winwinwin are there other ways agents get paidyes  you can invite members of your network to become relode agents and earn rewards when their candidates are hired  think of it as passive income  look for the “invite others” button in emails or under the agents area of the web site do i need to be a recruiter to be successfulnot at all  some agents are motivated and interested in actively searching for candidates while others rely on normal interactions with their network to reveal opportunities for connecting candidates to jobs is this a conflict with my current jobrelode relies on you to review all employment agreements to ensure you are compliant with them  if you are unsure please consult your own legal counsel how do i find candidates if i become a relode agenttap into your own

they interests them  you best know their interests and how the job is a match for them  don’t worry we’ll handle the heavy lifting of communication coordination and scheduling once you connect us to your screened candidate will i be paid if my candidate is hired for a different jobyes  you are attributed as the source of your screened candidate forever in relode’s system  if we find another job that is a good fit for your candidate we will reach out to you at that time how do i submit a candidate for a jobthere are three ways to submit a candidate if you receive our weekly email with

staff recruiting more cost effective and efficient while also providing employment for recruiters who want to work independently outside of an agentphoto george walker iv  the tennesseanbuy photo  connecttweet  linkedin  commentemailmorelike many in the business world matthew tant chose not to talk about his religion at work and kept it separate from his professional dutiesbut as he began developing relode — his startup aimed at streamlining the recruiting industry — tant decided he could put his christian faith at the core of it as part of the growing “business as mission” movement tant designed the business to empower individuals around the world through recruiting — seeking to make a difference in global issues while addressing a business need“we want to build profitable scalable products so we can help others “said tant ceo of relodebusiness as mission is a concept that brings god into the workplace and uses business solutions to help communities in need all over the world and to address social justice issues the approach is similar to that of social enterprises but encompasses a christian focus and stems from business leaders’ desire to direct their professional skills at efforts supported by their faithfor tant those skills were in staff recruiting and in creating new companies before launching healthcare recruiting firm hctec partners in franklin tant was an agent at floridabased csi companies staffing company he recognized inefficiencies within the industry that could be remedied with technology and began working with relode cofounder joe christopher a former director of software development at healthstream they developed an online marketplace — an uber for recruiting tant says — that connects companies directly to recruiters and trims hiring costs by cutting out the role of an agencyunder a typical recruitment model companies find new hires through a job posting site charging upward of  a month or through an equally expensive resume database  meanwhile recruiting agencies often charge  to  percent of a new hire’s salary fueling a more than  billion industry nationally according to staffing industry analyststhe reason recruiting agencies charge so much is because they cover overhead costs — office space search tools health benefits for agents — and because they only get paid for the hires they land a large company looking for new employees could be working with a handful of agents but the agent that finds the actual hire is the one paid with the majority of the fees going to the recruiting firmwith relode a company can choose from a pool of recruiters based on their industry expertise price or ratings from others a recruiter is ensured payment and companies pay a smaller fee per job candidate — closer to  than  tant said the hiring companies can pay for candidate leads qualified resumes or more advanced candidate research with relode taking between  and  percent of the feerelode is selffunded and has  employees the team based in brentwood is talking to experienced recruiters in cities across the us and in several industries to build its base of independent contractors the model allows individuals to work remotely as well as determine the amount of hours they are interested inhere’s where the business as mission comes in tant envisions a process where an individual supporting a cause can build expertise as a recruiter taking jobs as time permits to supplement their income the model could help a college graduate seeking to build a social enterprise overseas or missionaries who needs a revenue stream to fund their work or it could help those recruiters living in highpoverty regions find employment by working for relode with contractors already set up in honduras and in the phillipines taking on search jobsfor every recruiter that is working to support another social mission relode will donate  percent of the recruiter’s price to support their work“our ultimate goal would be to revive communities and lives of people around the world by creating income opportunities for them right where they are” tant said by training someone helping other communities “we have a multiplier effect”reach jamie mcgee at  and on twitter jamiemcgee  connecttweet  linkedin  commentemailmoreread or share this story httptnnewsdhsyva get help with hiring  empowering careers in
