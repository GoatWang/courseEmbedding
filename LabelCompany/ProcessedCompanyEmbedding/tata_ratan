edition of indian super league along with bengaluru fc controversies and criticismsedit the tata group has also attracted several controversies and criticisms including the following munnar keralaedit the kerala government filed an affidavit in the high court saying that tata tea had grabbed forest land of  acres  km at munnar the tatas said they possessed  acres  km of land which they are allowed to retain under the kannan devan hill resumption of lands act  and there was a shortage of  hectares in that the then chief minister of kerala vs achuthanandan who vowed to evict all on government land in munnar formed a special squad for the munnar land takeover mission and started acquiring back properties however later he had to abort the mission as there were many influential land grabbers and faced opposition from his own party kalinganagar odishaedit on  january  policemen at kalinganagar odisha opened fire at a crowd of tribal villagers the villagers were protesting the construction of a compound wall on land historically owned by them for a tata steel plant some of the corpses were returned to the families in a mutilated condition when pushed for comment tata officials said the incident was unfortunate but that it would continue with its plans to set up the plant supplies to burmas military regimeedit tata motors reported that deals to supply hardware and automobiles to burmas military junta had come in for criticism from human rights and democracy activists in december  gen thura shwe mann myanmars chief of general staff visited the tata motors plant in pune in  tata motors announced that it would press ahead with plans to manufacture trucks in myanmar land acquisition in singuredit the singur controversy in west bengal led to further questions over tatas social record with protests by locals and political parties though the involvement of mamata banerjees party was widely criticised as an act for political gains over the forced acquisition eviction and inadequate compensation to those farmers displaced for the tata nano plant as the protests grew and despite having the support of the communist party of india marxist state government tata eventually pulled the project out of west bengal citing safety concerns the singur controversy was one of the few occasions when ratan tata was forced to publicly address criticisms and concerns on any environmental or social issue ratan tata subsequently embraced narendra modi the then chief minister of gujarat who quickly made land available for the nano project in a historic judgement on aug   the honorable supreme court of india set aside the land acquisition by the west bengal government in  to facilitate tata motors to set up its nano plant and directed the west bengal government to take possession of the land and distribute it to the land owners within  weeks dhamra port odishaedit on the environmental front the port of dhamara controversy has received significant coverage both within india and in tatas emerging global markets the dhamra port a venture between tata steel and larsen  toubro has come in for criticism for its proximity to the gahirmatha sanctuary and bhitarkanika national park from indian and international organisations including greenpeace gahirmatha beach is one of the worlds largest mass nesting sites for the olive ridley turtle and bhitarkanika is a designated ramsar site and indias second largest mangrove forest tata officials have denied that the port poses an ecological threat and stated that mitigation measures are being employed with the advice of the iucn on the other hand conservation organisations including greenpeace have pointed out that no proper environment impact analysis has been done for the project which has undergone changes in size and specifications since it was first proposed and say that the port could interfere with mass nesting at the gahirmtha beaches and the ecology of the bitharkanika mangrove forest dhamra port stake has been hived off soda extraction plant in tanzaniaedit tata group along with a tanzanian company joined forces to build a soda ash extraction plant in tanzania environmental activists oppose the plant because it would be near lake natron and it has a very high chance of affecting the lakes ecosystem and its neighbouring dwellers it could also jeopardise the lesser flamingo birds there which are already endangered lake natron is where twothirds of lesser flamingos reproduce producing soda ash involves drawing out salt water from the lake and then disposing the water back to the lake this process could interrupt the chemical makeup of the lake  african nations are against the creation of the project and have signed a petition to stop its construction data and intellectual property theftedit in april  a us federal grand jury awarded epic systems a  million judgement against tata consultancy services and tata america international corp filed oct   the charges accused tata of brazenly stealing the trade secrets confidential information documents and data and that the  unauthorized downloads could be used to enhance tatas competing

has won the bid to form a football club based on jamshedpur of jharkhand in the th edition of indian super league along with bengaluru fc controversies and criticismsedit the tata group has also attracted several controversies and criticisms including the following munnar keralaedit the kerala government filed an affidavit in the high court saying that tata tea had grabbed forest land of  acres  km at munnar the tatas said they possessed  acres  km of land which they are allowed to retain under the kannan devan hill resumption of lands act  and there was a shortage of  hectares in that the then chief minister of kerala vs achuthanandan who vowed to evict all on government land in munnar formed a special squad for the munnar land takeover mission and started acquiring back properties however later he had to abort the mission as there were many influential land grabbers and faced opposition from his own party kalinganagar odishaedit on  january  policemen at kalinganagar odisha opened fire at a crowd of tribal villagers the villagers were protesting the construction of a compound wall on land historically owned by them for a tata steel plant some of the corpses were returned to the families in a mutilated condition when pushed for comment tata officials said the incident was unfortunate but that it would continue with its plans to set up the plant supplies to burmas military regimeedit tata motors reported that deals to supply hardware and automobiles to burmas military junta had come in for criticism from human rights and democracy activists in december  gen thura shwe mann myanmars chief of general staff visited the tata motors plant in pune in  tata motors announced that it would press ahead with plans to manufacture trucks in myanmar land acquisition in singuredit the singur controversy in west bengal led to further questions over tatas social record with protests by locals and political parties though the involvement of mamata banerjees party was widely criticised as an act for political gains over the forced acquisition eviction and inadequate compensation to those farmers displaced for the tata nano plant as the protests grew and despite having the support of the communist party of india marxist state government tata eventually pulled the project out of west bengal citing safety concerns the singur controversy was one of the few occasions when ratan tata was forced to publicly address criticisms and concerns on any environmental or social issue ratan tata subsequently embraced narendra modi the then chief minister of gujarat who quickly made land available for the nano project in a historic judgement on aug   the honorable supreme court of india set aside the land acquisition by the west bengal government in  to facilitate tata motors to set up its nano plant and directed the west bengal government to take possession of the land and distribute it to the land owners within  weeks dhamra port odishaedit on the environmental front the port of dhamara controversy has received significant coverage both within india and in tatas emerging global markets the dhamra port a venture between tata steel and larsen  toubro has come in for criticism for its proximity to the gahirmatha sanctuary and bhitarkanika national park from indian and international organisations including greenpeace gahirmatha beach is one of the worlds largest mass nesting sites for the olive ridley turtle and bhitarkanika is a designated ramsar site and indias second largest mangrove forest tata officials have denied that the port poses an ecological threat and stated that mitigation measures are being employed with the advice of the iucn on the other hand conservation organisations including greenpeace have pointed out that no proper environment impact analysis has been done for the project which has undergone changes in size and specifications since it was first proposed and say that the port could interfere with mass nesting at the gahirmtha beaches and the ecology of the bitharkanika mangrove forest dhamra port stake has been hived off soda extraction plant in tanzaniaedit tata group along with a tanzanian company joined forces to build a soda ash extraction plant in tanzania environmental activists oppose the plant because it would be near lake natron and it has a very high chance of affecting the lakes ecosystem and its neighbouring dwellers it could also jeopardise the lesser flamingo birds there which are already endangered lake natron is where twothirds of lesser flamingos reproduce producing soda ash involves drawing out salt water from the lake and then disposing the water back to the lake this process could interrupt the chemical makeup of the lake  african nations are against the creation of the project and have signed a petition to stop its construction data and intellectual property theftedit in april  a us federal grand jury awarded epic systems a  million judgement against tata consultancy services and tata america international corp filed oct   the charges accused tata of brazenly stealing the trade secrets confidential information documents and data and that

military regimeedit tata motors reported that deals to supply hardware and automobiles to burmas military junta had come in for criticism from human rights and democracy activists in december  gen thura shwe mann myanmars chief of general staff visited the tata motors plant in pune in  tata motors announced that it would press ahead with plans to manufacture trucks in myanmar land acquisition in singuredit the singur controversy in west bengal led to further questions over tatas social record with protests by locals and political parties though the involvement of mamata banerjees party was widely criticised as an act for political gains over the forced acquisition eviction and inadequate compensation to those farmers displaced for the tata nano plant as the protests grew and despite having the support of the communist party of india marxist state government tata eventually pulled the project out of west bengal citing safety concerns the singur controversy was one of the few occasions when ratan tata was forced to publicly address criticisms and concerns on any environmental or social issue ratan tata subsequently embraced narendra modi the then chief minister of gujarat who quickly made land available for the nano project in a historic judgement on aug   the honorable supreme court of india set aside the land acquisition by the west bengal government in  to facilitate tata motors to set up its nano plant and directed the west bengal government to take possession of the land and distribute it to the land owners within  weeks dhamra port odishaedit on the environmental front the port of dhamara controversy has received significant coverage both within india and in tatas emerging global markets the dhamra port a venture between tata steel and larsen  toubro has come in for criticism for its proximity to the gahirmatha sanctuary and bhitarkanika national park from indian and international organisations including greenpeace gahirmatha beach is one of the worlds largest mass nesting sites for the olive ridley turtle and bhitarkanika is a designated ramsar site and indias second largest mangrove forest tata officials have denied that the port poses an ecological threat and stated that mitigation measures are being employed with the advice of the iucn on the other hand conservation organisations including greenpeace have pointed out that no proper environment impact analysis has been done for the project which has undergone changes in size and specifications since it was first proposed and say that the port could interfere with mass nesting at the gahirmtha beaches and the ecology of the bitharkanika mangrove forest dhamra port stake has been hived off soda extraction plant in tanzaniaedit tata group along with a tanzanian company joined forces to build a soda ash extraction plant in tanzania environmental activists oppose the plant because it would be near lake natron and it has a very high chance of affecting the lakes ecosystem and its neighbouring dwellers it could also jeopardise the lesser flamingo birds there which are already endangered lake natron is where twothirds of lesser flamingos reproduce producing soda ash involves drawing out salt water from the lake and then disposing the water back to the lake this process could interrupt the chemical makeup of the lake  african nations are against the creation of the project and have signed a petition to stop its construction data and intellectual property theftedit in april  a us federal grand jury awarded epic systems a  million judgement against tata consultancy services and tata america international corp filed oct   the charges accused tata of brazenly stealing the trade secrets confidential information documents and data and that

in europe to tap interest on the car outside indiapti  nov    pm istratan tata said nano could be marketed as a changed product in europe to tap interest on the car outside india singapore the tata group may consider launching its small car nano in a new avatar in another country like indonesia where it doesnt have the stigma of being the cheapest car and bring it back to india for a fresh start with a new image according to chairman emeritus ratan tata tata who stepped down as the chairman of the salttosoftware conglomerate last december said nano could also be marketed as a changed product in europe to tap interest on the car outside india maybe it nano gets launched in another country like indonesia where it doesnt have the stigma and the new image comes back to india or maybe as a changed product that gets marketed in europe theres a lot of interest in nano outside india tata said in an interview on cnbcs managing asia stating that tatas are working on a refreshed nano he added a relaunched nano with some of the differences that were trying to incorporate yes i dowe are going to relaunch the car not as the cheapest car but in the image as it is admitting that tata motors made a mistake in the marketing and positioning of the nano he said it became termed as a cheapest car by the public and i am sorry to say by ourselves not by me but the company when it was marketing it i think that is unfortunate he further said i always felt that nano should have been marketed towards the owner of a twowheeler because it was conceived giving the people who rode on twowheels with the whole family an allweather safe form of affordable transportation not the cheapest in an interview last year tata had said that the nano was being refreshed to realise its full potential the nano has failed to live up to the expectations after being hyped as the cheapest car to hit the roads it sales have been dwindling despite the companys attempts to reposition it in the apriloctober period this fiscal it clocked just  units as against  units in the yearago period down  per cent in october this year tata motors launched a new version of the nano with cng and petrol bifuel system options the nano has a troubled past it was originally planned to roll out from a plant in singur west bengal but the plant had to be shifted to sanand in gujarat after political protests at its earlier plant instances of the car catching fire initially after it was launched didnt help its cause either the car was launched in march  with an initial exfactory price tag of close to rs one lakh for the basic

and played a significant role in continuing the vision of the group tatas assets climbed from inr million in  to inr billion in  tata motors had increased its sales to inr million in the year  and it had rolled out  million vehicles in the same year in  ratan naval tata took over the chairmanship from jrd tata although he was initially criticised for his poor performance over the years ratan tata disproved his critics he restructured tata groups business operations and made the group compete globally under ratan tatas chairmanship tata consultancy services went public and tata motors was listed in the new york stock exchange starting from the late s ratan revamped the operations of tata steel and made it one of the lowest cost steel producers in the world however as the tatas lack an

said its nano small car has been “a lossmaking product” in the highly pricesensitive market coupled with low volumes business updated nov    ist ians tata company chairman ratan tata during launched tata nano at the th auto expo in new delhi in ht file photo echoing tata sons’ ousted chairman cyrus p mistry tata motors on friday said its nano small car has been “a lossmaking product” in the highly pricesensitive market coupled with low volumesmistry had earlier stated that “as there is no line of sight to profitability for the nano any turnaround strategy for the company requires to shut it down”“considering the attention and excitement it created project investments were set up for capacities for around  cars per annum however unfortunately and due to combination of several factors including project delays due to change in location of the factory and the perception of being a ‘low priced’ car the volumes initially anticipated did not materialise and utilisation of capacities are significantly lower” said the car maker responding to clarifications sought by bsein a highly pricesensitive segment of the market coupled with low volumes it has been a loss making product it addedmistry had also alleged that the nano product development concept called “for a car below rs  lakh but the costs were always above this” “this product has consistently lost money peaking at rs  crore” he saidthe company further said that a major part of the investments in the factory are “capable of being utilised for other products” as is “evident from the production of company’s tiago cars” in the same factory“as far as development cost and investments in nano specific dies and toolings are concerned these have significantly written off in line with the accounting policies over the last several years” the filing saidmistry had also pointed out that challenge in shutting down nano is that it would “stop the supply of the nano gliders to an entity that makes electric cars and in which mr tata has stake”responding to that the company said “we would like to clarify that the matter is in a preliminary exploratory stage and no arrangement for supply of gliders has been conducted”the car maker said that it got approval of the board for its future passenger vehicle product and business strategy which envisages refocusing its strategy on growing and attractive segments of the passenger vehicle market in terms of volumes and profitability and “aligning with the changing and enhanced expectations of the consumers regarding contents and features”the company also said that it would pursue the refocused longterm strategy more from business india inc pay gap ceos earn up to  times of average staff jul    ist make in india initiative indigenous supercomputers to be

transformed itself from an indian giant into a global powerhouse mar rd   jamshedpur add this article to your reading list by clicking this button tweet ratan tata is as different as can be from the popular image of a business titan he is a natural gentleman who lives austerely litters his conversation with references to “dignity” and “duty” and is happiest when talking about his pet dogs two german shepherds he owns less than  of the group that bears his family name but he is a titan nonetheless the most powerful businessman in india and one of the most influential in the world the tata group of which he is chairman is a giant too—or rather a collection of them this family of companies covers cars and consulting software and steel tea and coffee chemicals and hotels tata consultancy services tcs is asias largest software company tata steel is indias largest steelmaker and number ten in the world taj hotels resorts and palaces is indias biggest luxury hotel group by far tata power is the countrys largest private electricity company tata global beverages is the worlds secondlargest maker of branded tea overall the group earned  trillion rupees or  billion in revenues in  see chart and  billion rupees in profits mr tata has transformed the group when he became chairman in  india was groaning under the licence raj and tata seldom ventured outside its home market today as he prepares to step down in late  and the search for a successor speeds up india is one of the worlds most dynamic economies and tata operates in over  countries the latest sign of its ambition came this week at the geneva motor show where tata motors showed a prototype of a small car for european drivers but the tata story is about more than its own transformation just as tata played a leading role in nationbuilding from its foundation in  creating indias first indianowned steel plant power station luxury hotel domestic airline and sundry other firsts it is now one of the stars of indias globalisation the group has also projected a new type of company onto the global stage—more diversified than western firms more engaged in the life of the community and if its employees are to be believed better equipped to prosper in both developed and developing markets the house that ratan built mr tatas enthronement in bombay house the groups headquarters took place just before the liberalisation of indias economy an event that indian business people habitually call the countrys “second independence” he spotted that liberalisation was both an opportunity and a threat it was an opportunity because it set tata free the economy had been so tightly regulated that you could be fined or even imprisoned for exceeding your output quotas it was a threat because tata was vulnerable its companies were uncoordinated overmanned and undermanaged they had competed with each other so vigorously that four textile mills drove each other out of business yet there was a serious risk that leaner fitter foreigners would wipe out the lot mr tata set about streamlining with a vengeance he focused the group on six industries that have provided most of its revenues since —steel motor vehicles power telecoms information technology it and hotels—and increased its often paltry shareholding in these core businesses he gradually established bombay houses power over the barons who had ruled the various businesses for decades companies now have to earn the right to use the tata brand the tata management training centre does as its name says and tas selects highflyers who move regularly from one company to another as their careers develop teams of “auditors” stars from across the group conduct annual surveys of selected companies reporting on progress and suggesting lessons to learn the group embraced globalisation the pace of foreign acquisitions has grown dramatically in  tata companies made on average one purchase a year in  they made six and in  more than  so has the scale tata teas takeover of tetley group a british company for m in  was the first of several bold buys of wellknown brands that announced the groups arrival in the global big league in  tata steel bought corus europes secondlargest steelmaker for  billion a year later tata motors paid  billion for jaguar land rover jlr in all tata has spent around  billion on foreign companies today it earns about threefifths of its revenue abroad and employs more british workers than any other manufacturer and two of its biggest companies tata motors and tata communications are listed on the new york stock exchange tata has been busy in emerging markets too tata steel and tata motors have been snapping up asian companies such as thailands millennium steel and south koreas daewoo trucks at home tata motors makes the first indiandesigned car the indica and the worlds cheapest the nano mr tata talks about the companys duty to produce groundbreaking products for the worlds poor with missionary zeal the changes have been dramatic a group that used to be identified with secure employment “for shoes theres bata and for jobs theres tata” has become obsessed by serving its customers and matching international standards tata steel has more than doubled its output since  from m tonnes to m while cutting its workforce in india by more than half from  to  a jaunty selfconfidence has replaced the selfdoubt of the early s yet mr tatas changes have gone only so far that is partly because of caution and reverence for tradition but also because there is logic behind the groups diversity e pluribus plura in jamshedpur men in thick denim shirts and hard hats watch as molten steel is poured from a gigantic ladle in mumbai young women in exquisite saris add to the allure of the taj mahal palace  tower hotel in pune phds from the massachusetts institute of technology and various indian institutes of technology feed data into one of the worlds most powerful privately owned supercomputers they are all part of tatas global workforce of about  people for all the frantic restructuring the group remains strikingly diversified by western standards  operating companies  of them listed on the bombay stock exchange in a bewildering range of industries it is bound together by complicated interlocking structures various central bodies such as the tata trusts and tata sons hold shares in the companies tata is also held together by a common culture that has been marinating for  years employees love to tell tales of how tata got the better of the british overlords they also love to point out that tata created many of indias greatest institutions such as the indian institute of science the tata institute of fundamental research and the tata memorial hospital reverence for jamsetji tata the groups founder borders on ancestor worship his everpresent busts are garlanded with fresh flowers daily on march rd thousands marched through the streets of jamshedpur as they do every year to celebrate his birthday tata prides itself above all on its culture which it argues is defined by three things loyalty dignity and what is now called corporate social responsibility csr it is not unusual to find a tata lifer whose spouse works for the firm and whose father also did tata is admirably restrained by the flashy—it is tempting to say moneygrubbing—standards of modern india it has always eschewed “sinful” industries such as drink tobacco and gambling it is as committed to public service as it was when jamsetji tata was laying the economic foundations of indian independence tata charitable trusts own twothirds of the holding company tata sons alan rosling a former tata executive who spearheaded the groups globalisation liked to say “were making money so that our shareholders can give it away” the trusts funded worthy causes from cleanwater projects and literacy programmes to the various tata institutions to the tune of m in  but the commitment to csr is deeper than this consider jamshedpur the home of tata steel and perhaps the worlds most successful company town tata steel runs almost all the citys institutions these include a bed hospital a zoo a giant sports stadium academies for football archery and athletics golf courses and the local utility company “they provide you with a house and a car” jokes prabhat sharma head of corporate affairs for tata steel “the only thing you need to bring is a wife” the company also employs  people to work with local tribespeople to improve agriculture health care and education and regularly sends a hospital train farther into the hinterland the city is remarkably well run by indian standards with broad avenues green parks reliable power and water that you can drink tata steel gently mocks all this corporate philanthropy with the slogan “we also make steel” this largesse has come under some strain in recent years tata steel has reined back some activities it no longer makes ice or shoes and created a separate utility company tata tea now tata global beverages has sold its vast plantation in the western ghat mountains where it was the biggest employer for more than a century but rationalisation has not gone far by western standards the tea plantations were sold to former employees tata steel gave generous pensions to the thousands of workers it got rid of the group has inevitably provoked criticism as it has stridden onto the international stage western investors who already apply a discount to american and european conglomerates are leery of indias more sprawling variety many indians may view the prominence of ambanis birlas and tatas as part of the natural order of things but westerners tend to associate it with unreconstructed tradition and messy family politics the widespread suspicion that tata had overpaid for corus and jlr seemed to be confirmed when the worlds stockmarkets tumbled in  even mr tata admits that the group had to reach deep into its pockets to keep some subsidiaries going but the crisis has done nothing to damage tatas growing selfconfidence the global deals are beginning to repay its patience jlr is likely to make  billion in profit this year as well as providing tata motors with valuable skills mr tata warns the group against drawing the wrong conclusion from the meltdown it needs to be more bullish rather than more conservative the sense behind the sprawl tata executives also insist that the groups sprawl makes sense even if they sometimes explain it in idiosyncratic terms r gopalakrishnan a director of tata sons explains the structure with reference to the extended indian family the patriarch sets an example to his “sons” and kicks them out of the house if they fail to live up to his values but they also claim support from management thinkers such as tarun khanna of harvard business school and jim collins the author of “good to great” mr khanna points out that diversified groups are the “dominant” form of business in many emerging markets including chile indonesia mexico pakistan and thailand he argues that this makes eminent sense in countries with weak governments and underdeveloped institutions india regularly comes in the bottom half of the world banks “doing business” rankings many institutions that western companies take for granted are missing the groups spread not only improves its chances of grappling with bureaucracy and filling various institutional voids but also helps it wage two of the hottest wars in modern india for talent and trust tata can compete with western talentmagnets such as general electric and accenture it is well enough known to appeal to people in the remotest villages in last years brandfinance global  a ranking of the worlds most valuable brands the tata name was reckoned to be worth  billion placing it first in india and th overall even the twin strategy of advancing at both the bottom and the top of the market makes sense it is hard to dismiss tata as a “cheap” brand when the group owns luxury hotels and fancy consultancies mr collins argues that “culture” is a rich corporate resource many of the “great” western companies that he studies share a propensity for ancestor worship tatas culture of probity has helped to insulate it from indias endemic corruption it has guided its behaviour when standards have slipped when the company discovered widespread irregularities in tata finance in  it blew the whistle on itself tata has not escaped unharmed from the snowballing scandal over the department of telecommunications decision in  to allocate wireless spectrum to favoured companies at below market prices but in general its reputation has earned its senior figures the benefit of the doubt tatas diversified structure has given it a valuable mixture of flexibility and deep pockets its companies have been able to seize opportunities such as tata steels takeover of millennium steel or tata motors joint venture with marcopolo a brazilian bus manufacturer bombay house provides tata companies with clout when they want to make ambitious acquisitions tetley was twice the size of tata tea or when the market turns against them tatas new frontiers a profile in fortune in  characterised tata as both “one of indias most beloved companies” and “a mess” the latter no longer looks correct but tata will be held to much higher standards as it competes with the worlds best its future success will depend on the answers to two questions can it use its muscle to become a master of innovation and can it become a truly global company rather than just an indian one that does well abroad mr tatas mission in his final years as chairman has been to foster innovation he has started an annual competition with a prize for the best failed idea failure is a “gold mine” for a great company he says he has also created five “clusters” plastics and composites nanotechnology engineering it and water that throw people from different businesses together the group is pursuing innovation on two levels at the high end tata chemicals is conducting research in nanotechnology and food science and tcs holds regular innovation conferences in silicon valley but what has caught more attention is the groups commitment to “frugal innovation” new products designed to appeal to poor people and the rising middle class tatas bestknown frugal product the tata nano a  rupee car has run into problems some cars have suffered from what ravi kant the vicechairman of tata motors calls “thermal incidents” and his customers call “catching fire” distribution has been poor although more are appearing on the roads carlpeter forster chief executive of tata motors admitted this week in geneva that the nano business model is having to be reinvented even if the nano proves disappointing frugal innovation looks promising overall tata motors is making small trucks that are replacing threewheelers tcs has coproduced a cheap water filter the swach using ingredients such as rice husks tata steel has made a prototype of a  house that can be bought in a shop the hotel company is building anight billets for indias army of commercial travellers the group is learning to combine the strengths of its various parts three companies collaborated on the swach after the asian tsunami in december  tcs and tata teleservices joined forces to develop a weatheralert system for fishermen the group is also marrying high and lowend innovation the supercomputer in pune was built in six weeks for around m tcs has created a cheap software package that can teach adults to read in  hours the nano needs sprucing up in globalising tata has been a fast learner absorbing lessons from jlr and daewoo it has become more ambitious tata global beverages presents itself as a global company rather than an agglomeration of acquisitions tata also claims that it is easier for indian companies to compete in western markets than it is for western ones to adapt to the complicated demands of developing markets but the group nevertheless faces serious problems one is the parochialism that afflicts big countries and companies the upper management is still dominated by indians who know only life within tata a second is hubris tata is too inclined to celebrate the great pruning of the s rather than ask whether another is due it may not be able to justify todays degree of diversification when the indian market is growing so rapidly and when it is doing so much business in the developed world it needs to consider whether it is time to lop off weaker limbs such as tata teleservices an alsoran in indias crowded telecoms market and tata financial services the most immediate task though is more humdrum replacing ratan tata this will not be easy mr tata has driven the groups big transformations from its restructuring to its focus on frugal innovation his personality pervades the organisation which is in a far better state than it was when he inherited it tata has plenty of senior executives who have grown up under his regime—not least noel tata ratans halfbrother and the soninlaw of pallonji mistry tata sons largest individual shareholder it has also forged a longterm strategy that could power its growth for years producing a stream of innovative products that will both cater for the rising masses of the emerging

govern the country and governance is an important thing not application where it suits one so to micro control where it suits them on the other hand ratan tata job government control apart from values and ethics which i have tried to live by the legacy i would like to leave behind is a very simple one  that i have always stood up for what i consider to be the right thing and i have tried to be as fair and equitable as i could be ratan tata simple ethics legacy if there are challenges thrown across then some interesting innovative solutions are found without challenges the tendency is to go on the same way ratan tata challenges interesting way what i would like to do is to leave behind a sustainable entity of a set of companies that operate in an exemplary manner in terms of ethics values
