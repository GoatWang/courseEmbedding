object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump

company was originally known as the dominion tar and chemical company limited its first plant was located in cape breton nova scotia dominion tar and chemical company ltd domtar operated a coal tar refining plant and a coal tar storage facility in sydney from  this facility was situated directly adjacent to and north of the coke oven operations it diverted coal tar from the coke ovens refined it moved it through pipes and stored it in tanks for shipping elsewhere domtar ceased operations in sydney in  abandoning its storage tanks waste disposal lagoons pipes buildings and equipment domtar conducted little or no clean up of the site a large tank referred to as the domtar tank remained in place adjacent to the coke ovens site into the s measuring  m  ft in diameter and  m  ft high it contained materials abandoned by domtar and other materials added in the years since the facilitys abandonment this site which is located adjacent to the former sydney steel plant is included in a  million government sponsored cleanup of what is referred to as the sydney tar ponds cornwalledit domtar operated a paper mill in cornwall until  the original mill was built by the toronto manufacturing company in  and purchased by howard smith paper mills in citation needed in the early s domtar persuaded the city of cornwall to permit the dumping of its paper mill waste sludge bark and lime dregs behind a shopping mall in the middle of the city part of the dump was sodded over while dumping continued and domtar funded a bunny ski hill there known as big ben by the mids this domtar landfill was rapidly filling up with sludge bark and lime dregs from the cornwall kraft and fine paper mill the problem was exacerbated when new waste water regulations required the cornwall mill to also remove lignin and starch—formerly discharged into the st lawrence river—from its waste water in response domtar began selling dewatered mill waste to cornwall and area residents labeled as soil conditioner” for some five years—until high levels of fecal coliforms and fecal streptococcus were discovered in the waste—this soil conditioner was sold for home garden use and was used by local farmers as fertilizer domtar at first claimed that their process could not have contributed ecoli and fecal coli from human feces the company later revealed to the ontario ministry of the environment moe that some toilets and urinals at the mill connected with the mill’s waste water treatment process rather than with the city’s sanitary sewers moreover a stormwater system also emptied into the sludge generating system the paper mill site now a brownfield was sold to paris holdings of cornwall in  with undisclosed terms and covenants relating to liability and clean up of soil and water affected for over  years by mill and human waste domtar still maintains control of the adjacent dump which is the source of a leachate plume polluting ground water between it and the st lawrence river with the city of cornwall water purification plant in between the dump which is officially named the big ben landfill and recreation area currently receives demolition waste and asbestos from the decommissioned paper mill in  domtar corporation made a request to the moe to additionally allow the dumping of soil at big ben contaminated with coal tar and bitumen waste from another dominion tar and chemical co limited site in cornwall this manufacturing facility at th st w and cumberland street in cornwall produced bituminous fibre pipe from  to  known variously as cornwall standard fibre conduit – cornwall nocrete conduit – and finally nocorode co ltd  fibre conduit division – in september  over public opposition and in spite of moe reports indicating offsite leachate impact from the dump and the likelihood of runoff to the st lawrence river the moe permitted dumping at the big ben site of contaminated soils from domtars former nocorode ltd site domtar has not remediated its former lands in cornwall including its paper mill site its sludge and bark dump and its coal tar pipe lands western canadaedit domtar also operated a wood treatment facility in cochrane alberta treating railroad ties this ceased operation about  leaving significantly contaminated land the latest of several cleanup operations is attempting to prevent the underground migration of the main contaminant plume building of nonresidential structures is now in progress on part of the land the company once operated a wood treatment facility in the transcona section of winnipeg manitoba the facility has been dismantled and a residential development was created adjacent to the site in the early s the site itself remained largely vacant in the late s years of debate and scientific study culminated with the redetoxification many properties adjacent to the site were excavated to remove contaminated earth dozens of homes had their backyards completely dug up and a handful also had parts of their homes removed and rebuilt—all at the companys expense the site itself was converted to a wildlife sanctuary with a nature path other locationsedit other domtar sites contaminated by creosote

the mids this domtar landfill was rapidly filling up with sludge bark and lime dregs from the cornwall kraft and fine paper mill the problem was exacerbated when new waste water regulations required the cornwall mill to also remove lignin and starch—formerly discharged into the st lawrence river—from its waste water in response domtar began selling dewatered mill waste to cornwall and area residents labeled as soil conditioner” for some five years—until high levels of fecal coliforms and fecal streptococcus were discovered in the waste—this soil conditioner was sold for home garden use and was used by local farmers as fertilizer domtar at first claimed that their process could not have contributed ecoli and fecal coli from human feces the company later revealed to the ontario ministry of the environment moe that some toilets and urinals at the mill connected with the mill’s waste water treatment process rather than with the city’s sanitary sewers moreover a stormwater

residents labeled as soil conditioner” for some five years—until high levels of fecal coliforms and fecal streptococcus were discovered in the waste—this soil conditioner was sold for home garden use
