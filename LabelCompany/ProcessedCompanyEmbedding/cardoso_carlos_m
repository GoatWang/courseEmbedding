pressgina johnson performs leak tests on hydraulic fittings at the eaton corp plant in berea in january for decades good manufacturing jobs allowed workers to own homes and cars take nice family vacations satisfy their health care needs send children to college and retire with financial security the importance of this group  the manufacturing middle class  to the united states has been immeasurable manufacturing jobs created a vision of american life that led immigrants around the world to our shores as chairman president and ceo of kennametal inc i have personally witnessed the american dream become a reality for many of our employees including the  who work at our durable steel engineered solutions and standards facility in solon and the additional  at our three other ohiobased locations as the middle class began to shift from manufacturing to service the us economy and the middle class began to experience a steady but sharp decline according to the congressional budget office manufacturing gross domestic product dropped  percent from  to  aftertax income for the middle  percent of americans fell  percent during the same time period manufacturers were challenged to comply with noncompetitive tax codes and policies and forced to make the decision to remain competitive or go under which essentially put the manufacturing middle class out of business contrast this trend with a regression analysis performed by our data research team at kennametal which found every onepoint increase in manufacturing activity translates to  percent growth in middle class income the absence of this powerful positive link has contributed to the financial pressure on the middle class during the last several years yet it is also part of how we must once again restore the vision and the reality of a strong manufacturing middle class the economy today is obviously different from a generation ago yet if the middle class is to rise again american manufacturing must also rebound the challenge is no longer about numbers it is about perception and overcoming it today manufacturing is alive and well in this country leading the economic recovery we see it every day at kennametal which sits on the front end of the supply line as a global leader in innovative custom and standard wearresistant solutions for demanding environments right now nearly  million us manufacturing jobs are unfilled including hundreds at kennametal recent economic forecasts from the manufacturers alliance for productivity and innovation predict manufacturing production will significantly outpace the overall economy and grow  percent this year adding another  jobs along the way at the same time however the national association of manufacturers estimates reveal that nearly  million manufacturing workers will retire in the next decade and that demand for skilled labor will increase the problem for manufacturing isnt the availability of jobs but rather the ability to find skilled workers to fill these jobs as the last large publicly traded company in our industry still headquartered in the united states we recognize training is critical to remaining competitive and rebuilding the middle class in pennsylvania kennametal recently completed its first high school young engineers pilot program to educate and inspire the next generation of skilled american manufacturing engineers this fall we will offer the program at solon high school our kennametal foundation also supports a manufacturing partnership in the form of an apprenticeship program at auburn career center although we do our part to offer unique educational and training opportunities to current and prospective employees we also understand these efforts alone will not solve all of our industrys problems regulations place american manufacturers at a  percent competitive disadvantage compared with our nine largest trading partners we need to examine taxrate taxcredit and taxcode solutions to help bridge that gap its time to reintroduce manufacturing to the middle class it will require common sense and the combined efforts of industry education and government to make it happen a prosperous middle class doesnt result from economic growth  it drives economic growth and recapturing the american dream starts with the manufacturing middle class carlos m cardoso is chairman
