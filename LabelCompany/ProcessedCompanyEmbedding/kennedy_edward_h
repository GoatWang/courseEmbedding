ethernetip edward h kennedy career pathlight readingcomment login tweet what’s it take to survive as a top executive in a sluggish telecom market ask edward h kennedy  senior vice president of the metro networking group at tellabs inc nasdaq tlab frankfurt btla in less than three years kennedy has gone from attacking tellabs’ digital crossconnect business as the ceo of a competing startup to actually running that group today from the beginning kennedy who cofounded ocular networks in  made sure to market the company’s product against tellabs the biggest digital crossconnect player around it was a bold strategy that differed from most optical networking startups of the day most startups were going after the competitive carrier or clec market with products that often promoted brand new architectures and discounted existing legacy deployments kennedy and his team decided to buck that trend instead they developed a nextgeneration product that could fit into existing atm and tdm networks while helping carriers migrate to an ip infrastructure the marketing schtick used was that the tellabs  is old and needs an update ocular set out to fill this niche and marketed its multiservice switch as a tellabs  killer with more functionality and more scaleability see ocular takes on tellabs not only did some customers seem to buy into this marketing campaign but tellabs did too in november of last year tellabs announced it would spend  million to acquire the startup see tellabs nabs ocular as part of the deal kennedy remained with the company to run the development of his old product line which is now known as the tellabs  perhaps it was luck or perhaps it was savvy career planning whatever it was kennedy ended up on the top of the list to run the company’s main business when it restructured in august of this year see tellabs regroups promotes kennedy ironically he is now in charge of the tellabs  a product he fought so hard to discredit while marketing the ocular platform the move is a sign of kennedys meteoric rise at tellabs see kennedy takes charge at tellabs it also emphasizes the key role that oculars products are playing in the companys future particularly the future of what it calls its wideband metro products the ones geared to aggregate and groom customer traffic at the metro edge indeed kennedy says one reason for his appointment as head of a new metro networking group will be to oversee further software and hardware integration between the  crossconnects and the  up to now the  has been billed as a smaller if more optically dense extension to the  for smaller points of presence see tellabs stays the course but it isn’t just his success with ocular that has made the folks at tellabs put their faith in him unlike many startup ceos of the late s and early  kennedy came from a telecom background and not a networking or lan switching background for over  years he has worked in telecom building contacts and learning how to play the rboc game very well prior to founding ocular he was in charge of international marketing for alcatel sa nyse ala paris cgeppa he held similar roles at dynatech and newbridge networks corp nyse nn toronto nnc early in his career he worked as a design engineer and product manufacturer for fujitsu ltd kls fujikl and harris corp nyse hrs kennedy acknowledges that the move is an exciting one for him im very ecstatic and honored that mike michael j birck ceo thinks enough of me to trust me with this responsibility he says but kennedy eschews any suggestion that the move puts him squarely in line of succession to the retirementage birck who said july  that hes planning a successor given his tenure at tellabs will probably last fewer than five more years birck recently

prioritize and simplify people in leadership positions tend to think their success and value at work is measured by how late they stay at the office or how much time they spend outside of work answering emails and reviewing reports as a result leaders often feel stressed and burned out from even the smallest tasks there’s a law of diminishing returns where the more time we spend on something the more the quality of work decreases setting a time limit for an activity can help you focus and get it done leading a group of people requires a mutual sense of trust and understanding between the leader and team members as a first step toward that goal leaders should learn to connect building a real personal connection with your teammates is vital to developing the shared trust necessary to build a strong culture of accountability and exceptional performance with that culture in place the team can achieve a successful business a happy team and a fulfilled leader one of the best ways to practice smart leadership is to delegate tasks to your team so you can focus your energy on the responsibilities that are specifically yours not only is it crucial to ensure that you have competent people on your team it’s also important to allocate work in ways that empower others to do their best and play to their strengths the most crucial role of leadership is facilitating the
