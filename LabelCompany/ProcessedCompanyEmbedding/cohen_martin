rhythm for over half a century lp has crafted classic percussion instruments as well as patented hundreds of improvements and new designs for musical instruments that meet the exacting standards of professional musicians latin percussion instruments have been featured in thousands of the world’s most famous charttopping recordings – from classic salsa – to classic rock in fact lp is such an essential part of so many musical genres it’s nearly impossible to turn on a radio or listen to a playlist and not hear an lp instrument in  martin cohen a young mechanical engineer and avid photographer from the bronx happened upon new york’s famous birdland jazz club he walked in and was immediately captivated by the sound and energy of latin jazz    martin cohen was so taken with the infectious music that he immersed himself in the ’s latin music scene and soon wanted his own set of bongos unfortunately due to trade embargoes high quality cubanmade bongos were unavailable in the united states so cohen put his engineering skills to use and created his own set of bongos after months of study martin cohen had successfully built what would eventually be heralded as “the finest bongos the world had ever seen”    in  martin cohen founded latin percussion lp and was soon delivering bongos cowbells and other instruments in brown paper bags to musicians cohen utilized new york’s latin nightclubs as his research and development labs – utilizing artist’s real world experience playing live music to craft and hone the best possible percussion instruments for live and recorded performance cohen’s selfdescribed “love affair” with latin music established a tradition still practiced at lp the needs of performing musicians are placed ahead of everything else          in  lp
