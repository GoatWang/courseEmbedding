us about us testimonials store freedom feeder » faq faq september th   comments off on faq which size mesh should i choose freedom feeders are a training system  start with the ″ size mesh then work down to the smaller mesh if you have kept your nets full continuously but your horse is not walking away and selfregulating after several months of use  even if your horse is insulin resistant start with the ″ mesh to get them used to the nets before you go to ″ to spread their meals out as long as possible  for ir horses your goal is to get where your horse does not go without hay for more than  hours after they’ve finished their last net can i throw my net on the ground like a pillow freedom feeders are extremely versatile  the extended day net comes with extra black cords that you can tie together to use as a weaving cord to close the flap  the trailermini net can be drawn closed then tuck the extra cord into the net the full bale net comes with a weaving cord  either size you choose is very versatile and your installation is only limited by your imagination can i pay by credit card yes you can just continue on through check out through the paypal route  it will give you a choice to pay by paypal or creditdebit card once you are in the paypal window why do you use those “cheesy” carabiners we have to provide something that is safe for all size horses mini’s to drafts that can safely get you started using your freedom feeders our “safety break away clips”  that come with your nets are designed to show you optimum placing for hanging and closure   we do sell replacement clips in our webstore or you should be able to find what you feel comfortably suits your animal at your local hardware store  please keep their safety in mind when changing out clips or other using hanging devices what are the black cords for that come in the extra package the extra black cords are spare parts that you can use to make a loop on your stall or fencing to clip the hanging clips to or they are actually long enough for you to weave them through the top of the net to make it into a traditional drawstring bag do you have a guaranteewarrantee on the nets we do stand behind our product with the most comprehensive warranty in the business however these are horses we are talking about   please visit wwwhttpfreedomfeedercomwarranty and we will do our very best to make sure you are a happy freedom feeder customer will my horse chew through the net freedom feeders are made from  test knotless woven mm nylon  they are soft yet extremely durable  the horses are going for the hay in the net not the net  however horses are horses and this is a working net not just a “not” holding net  it takes more abuse than the normal hay net because is it controlling the horses from eating so fast the key is to never let the net go empty especially when first transitioning horses onto the nets  they may get frustrated when they have an abundance of hay in front of them  and then it’s gone and they try to keep finding it somewhere in that net how long with my freedom feeder last depending on how many horses are using the nets but we have had some in use for more than  years  if you are asking how long it will take a horse to empty a net the average horse will consume  of it’s body weight in forage  so once a horse has transitioned and is selfregulating a  horse will consume  of forage  the extended day net should last the average  horse close to a day and a half is it normal for the netting to “fray” yes  this material is actually a  test mm nylon shrimp fishing netting  it is designed to hold up to some pretty harsh environments  the outer weave binds with use and protects the inner structure of the weave  this binding tends to look “frayed” will my horse get enough hay out with the ″ opening keeping the nets full at all times allows the horses to have feed  similar to what they would have if they were in pasture  the ″ openings are optimum in that they slow the horses eating forcing them to chew their food which makes them salivate more increasing the ph and lowering the acid in the stomach so they digest all of their feed better  any larger openings doesn’t control how fast the forage comes out enough  we are not restricting the amount of hay only controlling how fast they eat it  did you have an opportunity to watch the video on the website  my personal favorite is the full bale bag  we have  standing on end in each of the stalls and the extended day size out in the runs to create movement plus they get at least  minutes of exercise daily  i only need to fill my bags  times a month but they have alllllll the hay they want  no one’s fat no ones thin  their mega calorie and protein levels are adjusted by supplements not forage will my horse get fat with all that hay many horses do get a hay belly at first   hay bellies are not fat they are from stomach gasses ramping up to digest the extra foragethink of it like being on a very strict diet where your stomach has been burning with digestive acid for a very long time  then you go off the diet and are allowed to eat all you want at your favorite restaurant  you eat until you want to pop then realize that there’s still food and it’s not going anywhere soon  horses are the same way we are retraining them to trust that they will never have acid burning their stomachs again and that they can trust that the food will always be there for them when they need it we have had some horses that have taken up to  months before they slow down  we actually had to add more bags to their stalls until they finally felt safe that they weren’t going to run out ultimately they do start walking away and begin to selfregulate their intake  the hay belly goes away their temperament gets more relaxed many stall vices are greatly reduced if not eliminated and you have a truly grazing animal back if you have an ir or cushinoid horse please contact your vet or an equine nutritionist for some additional guidance it may be best to use the nets only to slow down their eating until their weight stabilizes  it’s also best with these horses to have a hay analysis so you can get a hay that is the very lowest in nonstructural carbs and sugars what kind of hay can i put into the freedom feeder you can put any kind of hay in the freedom feeder small mesh hay nets  it is best to use them for forage hays bermuda timothy orchard teff etc  although you can put alfalfa into the nets the leaf will fall through  we find it best to use the nets for forage and feed just enough alfalfa or protein to keep the top line on your horse from diminishing  some easy keeper type horses get enough calories from forage alone how many nets should i put up if you are using the minitrailer size net you will need at least  per horse per day  which is why we made the extended day nets  we got tired of filling the small ones  we recommend one extended day net per horse if they are all out together  spread them out so the horses are encouraged to move from net to net creating exercise and reducing competition for feed  once everyone is satiated they may start finding their favorite feeding station and sharing nets even with one horse if you have  nets separated on opposite sides of it’s area it will create movement as the horse goes from one net to the other seeing if the “grass is greener”  we personally have  of the full bale nets standing on end in our stalls and the extended day nets out in the runs to create movement does the net hold up in weather we’ve had the nets in snow wind rain and sun  no problem  hay doesn’t stay in them long enough to get moldy and with all the openings there is plenty of ventilation and light if it did stay in it long enough can i wash my freedom feeder small mesh hay nets sure  they’re nylon  they wash great  take off the strings and clips so nothing gets tangled though or wash them by hand as small hay particles will get into your washer how high should i hang the net optimally the nets should be hung as low as possible for proper grazing  you can even use the strings to lace the nets closed across the top then throw them on the ground like a hay pillow if your horses are shod you can put them over a feed bin to prevent them from pawing and possibly getting a shoe stuck  you can also hang the bottom of the net at chest height which is also out of reach from shoes if we haven’t covered your question please send us an email at infofreedomfeedercom comments are closed shopping cart your shopping cart is
