securities regulatory authorities  the funds are reporting issuers under the applicable securities legislation of each jurisdiction of canada  neither the filer nor the funds are in default of securities legislation in any jurisdiction of canada  unless an exemption has been obtained each of the funds follows the standard investment restrictions and practices established by the securities regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction in canada  the net asset value for units of the funds is calculated on a daily basis on each day that the toronto stock exchange is open for trading  each fund pays all expenses relating to its operation and the carrying on of its business although any subadvisory fees including taxes are an expense of each fund the filer has agreed to absorb  plus tax of any subadvisory fee payable for each fund  the filer proposes to merge the terminating fund into the continuing fund on or about july    prior to or concurrently with the implementation of the merger the filer anticipates changing the name of the continuing fund to bmo private canadian core equity portfolio unitholder meeting relief  the filer offers fully discretionary investment management services to clients in each jurisdiction in canada including all of the investors in the bmo private portfolios  the bmo private portfolios were established as an efficient and cost effective means of providing discretionary investment management services to many of the filers clients including all of the investors in the terminating fund and the continuing fund as an alternative to segregated account management  the filer has determined that it is appropriate to effect the merger without obtaining unitholder approval  the filer believes that the merger is in the best interests of the unitholders of the terminating fund and the continuing fund because a the merger would result in unitholders being invested in a continuing fund with a portfolio of greater value allowing for increased portfolio diversification opportunities b the merger will be effected on a taxdeferred basis and thus will not trigger a capital gain or loss upon the transfer of each unitholders investment from the terminating fund to the continuing fund c there will be a savings in brokerage charges over a straight liquidation of the terminating funds portfolio on a windup of the terminating fund and d the merger will eliminate the administrative and regulatory costs of operating the terminating fund as a separate mutual fund  the proposed merger is neutral to the unitholders of each of the funds from a fee and expense perspective  paragraph f of ni  requires that the approval of the securityholders of an investment fund be obtained before the investment fund undertakes a reorganization with or transfers its assets to another issuer  units of the terminating fund are only available for purchase by investors who have entered into a discretionary investment management agreement with the filer  the filer is authorized under its discretionary investment management agreement with each client who is an investor in a bmo private portfolio to make any investment on behalf of the client provided such investment is consistent with the mandate established by that client unitholders of a bmo private portfolio do not participate in the investment decision of purchasing holding or selling units of a bmo private portfolio  under its discretionary investment management agreement with each client the filer is authorized to receive all securityholder materials relating to the securities held in the clients account and to vote on behalf of the client on any matters relating to the securities held in the clients account provided that such vote is in the best interests of the client  the unitholders of the terminating fund are relying entirely on the filer to make investment decisions for them and in these circumstances the merger is analogous to the filer changing a clients investment from one bmo private portfolio to another as such investment changes do not require client approval the filer has determined that it is appropriate to effect the merger without obtaining unitholder approval  as every investor in the terminating fund has entered into a discretionary investment management agreement with the filer the filer believes that sending meeting materials and convening unitholder meetings for the purpose of obtaining unitholder approval to effect the merger is not desirable and represents an unnecessary cost and inconvenience to the filer and the unitholders of the terminating fund  prior to or no later than the next account statement mailing following the implementation of the merger the filer will communicate with each client that holds units of the terminating fund to explain the changes to their account occurring as a result of the merger merger approval  on april   the filer presented the terms of the merger to the irc for its approval the irc reviewed the proposed merger determined that the merger would achieve a fair and reasonable result for the funds and has provided its approval in respect of the merger  upon the approval of the merger by the boards of directors of the filer and of bmo trust company on may   a press release was issued and filed on may   and a material change report and amendment to the simplified prospectus of the terminating fund describing the merger were filed on sedar in accordance with the continuous disclosure obligations of the terminating fund set forth in part  of ni   the merger will be completed as a qualifying exchange within the meaning of section  of the tax act  a reasonable person may not consider the fundamental investment objectives of the terminating fund and the continuing fund to be substantially similar however both funds have substantially similar investment strategies and mandates in that they both provide exposure to equity securities of canadian issuers the terminating fund invests primarily in growthoriented equity securities of canadian issuers of any capitalization while the continuing fund invests primarily in equity securities of large canadian issuers with any investment characteristic  units of the terminating fund will continue to be available for sale until the close of business on july   following which time the distribution of new units will cease except under a continuous savings plan or similar systematic plan established prior to july    no sales charges will be payable in connection with the issuance of units of the continuing fund in exchange for the investment portfolio of the terminating fund  the portfolio assets of the terminating fund to be acquired by the continuing fund arising from the merger are currently or will be acceptable on or prior to the effective date of the merger to the portfolio advisor of the continuing fund and are or will be consistent with the investment objectives of the continuing fund  unitholders of the terminating fund will continue to have the right to redeem units of the terminating fund at any time up to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the effective date of the merger  the filer will bear the costs and expenses associated with the merger including all brokerage expenses incurred in respect of any required sale of portfolio assets of the terminating fund  pursuant to the merger holders of units of the terminating fund will receive units of the continuing fund  following the merger the continuing fund will continue as a publicly offered openended mutual fund and the terminating fund will be wound up as soon as reasonably practicable  regulatory approval of the merger is required because the merger does not satisfy all of the criteria for preapproved reorganizations and transfers as set out in section  of ni  because a a reasonable person may not consider the fundamental investment objectives of the terminating fund to be substantially similar to the fundamental investment objectives of the continuing fund as contemplated in paragraph aii b approval of the merger will not be obtained by the unitholders of the terminating fund as contemplated in subsection ei of ni  and c meeting materials will not be delivered to unitholders of the terminating fund in connection with such unitholder meeting as contemplated in subsection f of ni  since no unitholder meeting will be held in connection with the merger  the filer will except as noted above comply with all of the other criteria for preapproved reorganizations and transfers as set out in section  of ni  decision the principal regulator is satisfied that the decision meets the test set out in the legislation for the principal regulator to make the decision the decision of the principal regulator under the legislation is that the requested relief is granted raymond chan manager investment funds and structured products branch ontario
