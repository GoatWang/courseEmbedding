intellia’s statement on genome editing of human embryos by us researchers july   intellia is aware of the recent reports of us researchers editing the dna of human embryonic cells we cannot speculate on the specifics of the study the focus of intellia’s work is and will continue to be on finding treatments that help patients who suffer today to that end we are committed to using genome editing technologies including crisprcas only for patient benefit focusing on treating serious diseases of high unmet need refraining from directly modifying germline cells including sperm egg or embryonic tissue or developing any clinical applications of germline genome editing we acknowledge that some applications of genome editing raise important ethical issues specifically when used for nontherapeutic purposes or for modifying the genomes of germline cells with the intention of affecting future generations we take our ethical and social responsibility to not only patients but also humanity as a whole very seriously and will continue to develop the technology in an appropriate and ethical way we are aligned with the us national academies of sciences engineering and medicine that cautioned in its february  report on human genome editing“heritable germline editing is not ready to be tried in humans” and “should only be permitted in clinical trials to prevent serious diseases or disabilities if there is stringent oversight in the healthcare system” intellia’s joint position on germline editing with crispr therapeutics can be found here httpwwwintelliatxcomgermlinegeneeditingjointstatement     crispr therapeutics intellia therapeutics caribou biosciences and ers genomics announce appellate brief seeking reversal of us patent board decision on crisprcas gene editing july   • appeal seeks reversal of patent trial and appeal board decision terminating interference without determining priority of inventorship of crisprcas gene editing • brief asserts that the board failed to properly apply controlling us supreme court and federal circuit precedents and ignored evidence of multiple groups readily applying crisprcas gene editing to eukaryotic cells following teachings of charpentierdoudna team zug switzerland cambridge massachusetts berkeley california dublin ireland july   globe newswire – crispr therapeutics nasdaqcrsp intellia therapeutics inc nasdaqntla caribou biosciences inc and ers genomics ltd announced that the regents of the university of california the university of vienna and dr emmanuelle charpentier collectively “uc” coowners of foundational intellectual property relating to crisprcas genome engineering today submitted an appellate brief to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit the “federal circuit” seeking reversal of a decision by the us patent and trademark office’s patent trial and appeal board “ptab” in an interference proceeding relating to crisprcas gene editing technology in the appeal uc requests reversal of the ptab’s decision terminating the interference between certain crisprcas patent claims owned by uc and claims of the broad institute harvard university and the massachusetts institute of technology collectively “broad” in its brief to the federal circuit case no  uc asserts that the ptab’s february   determination that the uc patent claims did not make the broad’s patent claims obvious is based on a misapplication of controlling legal standards established by us supreme court and federal circuit precedent in its decision the ptab had concluded that uc’s claims covering crisprcas single guide gene editing technology and its application in any cellular or noncellular setting did not make obvious broad’s claims covering application of the same technology limited to use in eukaryotic cellular settings in its brief uc sets forth multiple errors in the ptab’s holding that the use of crisprcas in eukaryotes is separately patentable as alleged by broad including the following • with respect to the obviousness of applying the technology to eukaryotic cells us supreme court and federal circuit precedents clearly mandate that obviousness determinations be based on an “expansive and flexible approach” including consideration of “the inferences and creative steps that a person of ordinary skill in the art would employ” in contrast the ptab applied a narrow and restrictive approach that ignored certain key evidence including the steps actually employed by those of skill in the art at the time and also effectively required a “guarantee” that uc’s crisprcas invention would work in eukaryotic cells when wellestablished case law requires only a “reasonable expectation of success” • with respect to the reasonable expectation of success standard that establishes obviousness the ptab effectively ignored us supreme court and federal circuit case law which emphasize that an invention can be obvious if it is “obvious to try” even if success is not guaranteed “when there is a design need or market pressure to solve a problem” “there are a finite number of identified predictable solutions” and experimentation leads to “the anticipated success” • the ptab ignored us supreme court and federal circuit precedent highlighting that the occurrence of what appear to be simultaneous “inventions” arising close together in time is itself strong evidence of their obviousness and accordingly requiring that such evidence be considered in any obviousness analysis in contrast in terminating the interference the ptab essentially dismissed as “irrelevant” the evidence that six different laboratories successfully applied uc’s claimed crisprcas invention in eukaryotic cells using conventional techniques within months after uc publicly disclosed the invention – some of them prior to broad’s first filing • the ptab effectively ignored that broad’s own eukaryotic application of uc’s crisprcas invention had simply utilized conventional prior art techniques as a consequence it failed to consider that broad’s alleged invention did not reflect any significant innovation on broad’s part an important issue under applicable precedent • the ptab failed to hold broad to its burden of proving among other things the effective priority date for its patent claims as required by the ptab’s own rules and federal circuit precedent by not requiring the broad to meet its burden of proof and by merely assuming that all of the broad’s claims were entitled to their earliest possible filing date despite broad’s failure of proof the ptab improperly ignored relevant intervening art that made the broad’s claims obvious as explained in uc’s brief application of the correct legal standards to the case is believed to require reversal of the ptab’s decision for these reasons uc requests that the federal circuit instruct the ptab to reinstate the interference proceeding so that it can properly determine priority of inventorship as previously requested by uc the ptab’s failures to consider pertinent evidence and apply appropriate legal standards should at the very least require the matter to be remanded so that the ptab can properly consider the evidence related to obviousness and broad’s nointerferenceinfact motion using appropriate legal standards in the ptab’s february decision terminating the interference proceeding prematurely it had not yet considered the teachings of uc’s own priorfiled patent application with respect to using crisprcas in eukaryotic cells instead the ptab only addressed the threshold question of whether use in eukaryotic cells can be separately patentable from use in all settings as covered by uc’s claims however determinations on the underlying substantive matters have recently been made in parallel prosecution before the us patent  trademark office “uspto” the uspto has rejected a series of patent applications filed by broad that are directed to uses of crisprcas technology in eukaryotic cells as being nonnovel in view of uc’s priorfiled patent application which the uspto examiners considered to have effectively taught use of the crisprcas technology in eukaryotic cells in addition patent applications filed by sigmaaldrich and toolgen that similarly claim use of crisprcas in eukaryotic cells both of which filed applications before broad’s application have likewise recently been rejected as being either nonnovel or obvious in view of the priorfiled uc patent application with specific respect to its teachings regarding application of the invention to use in eukaryotic cells consistent with the substantive determinations reached by the uspto regarding the broad teachings of the uc patent application uc’s corresponding cases covering use of crisprcas in all settings including in eukaryotic cells have been advanced to grant or decisions to grant in numerous jurisdictions worldwide including in the united kingdom the nearly  other countries that are members of the european patent convention and more recently in other jurisdictions such as australia new zealand singapore and china about crispr

bell chief financial officer   graemebellintelliatxcom intellia’s response to nature methods article on crisprcas june   recently schaefer et al  reported the presence of more than a thousand genome differences between mice that had been edited with s pyogenes cas at the zygote stage and a control mouse of the same strain given the overlap of genetic differences between the two edited mice compared to the control mouse the authors concluded that these differences arose from a casdependent activity flaws in the study design and data analysis however make this conclusion inappropriate based on the information available on the mouse study the more plausible conclusion is that the genetic differences reflect a normal level of variation between individuals in a colony these alternative interpretations can be resolved by establishing when the reported differences arose in the lineage of these mice the authors assume given the pattern of homo and heterozygosity that they occurred in a burst in either the  or cell stage even though the intended cas repair occurred at a later stage given the mosaicism of these edited animals  unfortunately the authors did not sequence the parents nor do we know if the edited animals f and f are true sibs or simply closely related there is also no information given on how closely related the colony control animal was to the parents used in this study this missing evidence is critical to support their conclusion notably in an unrelated study wgs of unedited inbred mouse littermates showed  sites of variation between individuals  a number similar to that found in the authors’ dataset  snvs and indels furthermore a second unrelated study directly examined the effects of cas editing with intact cas cleavase or casda nickase using wgs  these authors saw significant variation between individuals but after comparison with relevant control parental and sib genomes demonstrated the opposite result namely that cas induced no unexpected mutations absent the parental dna sequence the schaefer authors could also have either looked at more than  f animals or examined the degree of overlap between the control genome and either edited mouse which they did not do they only reported on variant sites in the edited mice absent from the control genome this complete pairwise analysis could directly support or refute their claim beyond this missing evidence the authors’ explanation requires activities that cas is not known to possess first the authors show that none of the edited sites has sufficient target homology to the guide  to support watsoncrick grnadna base pairing there was no genomewide unbiased offtarget analysis done with the chosen guide rna  so we have no baseline for understanding its specificity second  sites presented  lack a gg pam within  bases of the variant the only known prerequisite for cas to engage with dna  third there is no known mechanistic basis for cas to induce snvs nor did the authors propose one indeed the preponderance of snvs reported is consistent with their being caused by spontaneous deamination a major driver of sequence drift in genomes  in summary we feel that the principal conclusions of the paper that the variation seen was unexpected and that it was casmediated have not been demonstrated and a simpler alternative explanation was not explored references
