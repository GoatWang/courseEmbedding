page to a friend      a critical look at dr robert youngs theories and credentials stephen barrett md in july  robert o young who has marketed himself as robert o young ms dsc phdwas sentenced to prison for practicing medicine without a license young would like you to believe that he is a highly educated and distinguished scientist i do not believe that is an accurate description this article describes his background and the activities that led to his conviction disreputable credentials one way to judge someones credibility is to examine the nature of his education youngs web site includes the following information before dr young began his extensive nutritional research his love for sports and science led him to the university of utah—where he studied biology and business in the early s    his education was temporarily interrupted by an ecclesiastical mission for the church of jesus christ of latterday saints he successfully served for two years in london england in the s following his mission and schooling at the university of utah dr young studied medical microbiology—training under dr robert bradford at the bradford research institute in chula vista california dr bradford is now a trustee and professor at capital university in washington dc where he teaches live and dry blood microscopy dr young also studied darkfield microscopy    in  dr young received a ms in nutrition from the american college in birmingham alabama in  he received his dsc with emphasis in chemistry and biology    in  dr young received a phd from clayton college of natural health his professor james e harvey from san diego state university reviewed and accepted his dissertation as completing all the requirements for a doctorate of philosophy degree in nutrition continuing his studies and research dr young later received an additional doctorate degree in naturopathy nd from clayton college   youngs books include back to the house of health rejuvenating recipes to alkalize and energize for life  sick and tired reclaim your inner terrain  back to the house of health rejuvenating recipes to alkalize and energize for life  the ph miracle for diabetes the revolutionary diet plan for type  and type  diabetics  the ph miracle for weight loss balance your body chemistry achieve your ideal weight  and the ph miracle balance your diet reclaim your health  none of these books has any scientific standing in  youngs web site claimed that he had devoted his life to researching the true cause of disease and for  years had been widely recognized as one of the top research scientists in the world  the ph miracle coauthored with his wife shelley radford young states that he headed the innerlight biological research and health education foundation and had gained national recognition for his research into diabetes cancer leukemia and aids  a recent article stated that young took only one undergraduate course in biology and did not graduate from the university of utah  the rest of his training is smoke and mirrors robert bradford who was convicted of laetrile smuggling in the s was not even a college graduate his alleged doctoral degrees—two of them—were acquired from credential mills for nearly  years he operated a network of enterprises that included a mexican clinic that offered quack treatments a company that marketed dubious drugs and dietary supplements a research institute that did no significant research and a nonaccredited medical school that operated for about five years  in  bradford his wife and their company american biologics doing business as crb inc were convicted of conspiring to violate federal food and drug laws and defraud individuals seeking medical care the indictment stated that he marketed bogus lyme disease products and a microscope system that was falsely claimed to diagnose the disease  clayton college of natural health was a nonaccredited correspondence school that advocated unscientific and quack methods  its requirements for graduation were minuscule compared to those for accredited colleges and universities that train health professionals it closed in  after alabama began requiring accreditation for license renewal moreover no correspondence school can prepare students to give competent health advice to clients because that requires years of clinical experience under expert supervision youngs connections with clayton and bradford reflect extremely poor judgment claims that robert young is a distinguished researcher are preposterous the national library of medicines database contains no articles authored by young ro that were published in a recognized scientific journal his foundations  tax return contain an expense item of  for food for research subjects but the returns from  to  contain nothing that appear related to human clinical research activity and the  return has no financial data questionable activities in addition to writing young has operated retreats and marketed herbal and dietary supplements many of which are his own brand young phorever the supplements are marketed by him directly and through a multilevel company called innerlight which he founded in  his web site stated the youngs supplements    literally bring new energy to each cell directly its a big idea that begins with the tiniest of particles—the particles called colloids since colloids are so small it is easy for our cells to absorb vitamins and minerals introduced at this size knowing this the ph miracle begins by breaking basic nutrient elements into billions of colloidal particles then unlike any other supplement provider we ensure these colloids remain individually separated through a proprietary process called microionization™ perhaps the most striking difference about the youngs products are their living energy not only are colloids separated for prime absorption they are given an additional electrical charge this charge actually attracts the colloids to your cells where they can be instantly utilized the energy within each cell literally jumps functionality is rejuvenated and your cells—and you yourself—can feel that maybe the energy you knew as a kid isnt so long gone after all  this description uses scientific terms but the processes he describes are fanciful in  youngs private retreats were said to include personal live and dried blood microscopy preceded by an indepth health history including developing an understanding of the physical social psychological medical and pharmaceutical components of a persons life  young promises to personally oversee each activity for the day which may include history microscopy supplements water and ionization exercise lymphatic massage cooking food preparation colonics and other health programs his findings would then provided in a page blood microscopy report plus a recommended program and a threemonth supply of supplements and other products he created there were also group retreats that cost from  to  depending on the length and setting in  the private retreats cost from  to  per night in  the ph miracle site also asserted that over the many years dr young has performed live and dry blood analysis on over  people repeatedly while simultaneously adjusting nutrition to create a ph balanced alkaline lifestyle this practice clearly makes dr young the preeminent nutritional microbiologist in history  not quite live blood cell analysis is carried out by placing a drop of blood from the patients fingertip on a microscope slide under a glass cover slip to keep it from drying out the slide is then viewed at high magnification with a darkfield microscope that forwards the image to a television monitor both practitioner and patient can then see the blood cells which appear as dark bodies outlined in white the practitioner may take polaroid photographs of the television picture or may videotape the procedure for himself andor the patient the results are then used as a basis for prescribing supplements dried blood cell analysis is similar but is done after the blood dries although much can be learned by looking at blood cells under a microscope the practitioners who do these tests draw conclusions that have no scientific validity are are used primarily to sell products  it would be interesting to know the context in which young performed  blood analyses in most states doing blood tests and recommending products based on these tests are considered diagnosing and prescribing and are restricted to licensed health professionals as far as i can tell young has never been eligible for any type of healthrelated professional license a dubious testimonial in  young claimed on youtube that he had cured kim tinkham a woman with breast cancer who had appeared on the oprah winfrey show and said she intended to heal herself rather than undergoing medical care he also posted six testimonial videos to his ph miracle living site however tinkham died of her disease about a year later  the videos have been removed but the images shown here—displayed on the site in november —still imply that young helped her   government actions young has been prosecuted three times in the mids he was charged with taking blood samples from two women and using the samples to diagnose illnesses and prescribe products that he sold young claimed that he merely looked at blood samples from two women and gave them nutritional advice however under a plea bargain he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of attempted practice of medicine without a license and was promised that the charge would be dismissed if he stayed out of trouble for  months  in  young was charged with another felony in utah when a woman suffering from cancer claimed he analyzed her blood and told her to stop chemotherapy and take his super greens product instead young told the woman that he had cured people suffering from aids the affidavit alleged a month later he was arrested when an undercover agent went to him for a consultation young allegedly analyzed her blood and prescribed a liquid diet a judge ordered young to stop drawing blood or risk being denied bail the san diego tribune reported that the charges were dropped because the prosecutor didnt think there were enough angry victims to get a conviction the article also reported that in  young moved to california because he thought the legal climate there was more tolerant for dietary researchers such as himself  in january  young and two associates were arrested and charged with multiple counts of grand theft and conspiring to practice medicine without a license the san diego district attorneys press release stated that young accepted patients including some who were terminally ill and temporarily housed them in ar his ph miracle ranch  the charges alleged that young and his associates broke the law when they went beyond advocating dietary changes and administered intravenous treatments to patients some of whom were terminally ill in february  following a month trial he was convicted of two counts of practicing medicine without a license during the trial deputy district attorney gina darvas portrayed young as a charlatan who preyed on the sick and vulnerable—including dying cancer patients—and duped them with bogus science  a few weeks after the trial ended darvas announced that young would be retried on the charges for which the jury was unable to reach a verdict  in  faced with the possibility of retrial young pleaded guilty to two more counts of practicing medicine without a license the plea agreement called for a month sentence some of which had already been served under house arrest  in june  the judge issued the sentence and expressed hope that young would not repeat what he did in the future  young and a medical associate bennie stephen johnson do of roswell georgia are also facing a suit by dawn kali who claims that her breast cancer progressed from stage i localized and easily treatable to stage iv widely spread because she followed youngs advice the complaint alleges without any medical support young advised kali to ignore her doctors forego conventional medical treatment and allow young to treat her with injections diet and other remedies young and ph miracle living falsely represented that he had credentials to practice medicine and treat cancer johnson improperly allowed young and ph miracle living to use his name and license as a cover for their unlicensed conduct  in  the osteopathic medical board of california charged johnson with gross negligence repeated negligence and general unprofessional conduct in connection with his treatment of four patients at the ph miracle center  in  his license was revoked and he was assessed  for the cost of the boards enforcement action  irrational theories young and his wife claim that health depends primarily on proper balance between an alkaline and acid cellular environment that can be optimized by dietary modification and taking supplements the degree of acidity or alkalinity of body fluids is expressed as ph but benjamin abelow md who authored the highly respected textbook understanding acidbase has concluded that their understanding of biochemistry is deficient after reading their  book sick and tired reclaim your inner terrain he wrote i read with special care the part of the book that purports to explain the fundamentals of ph to the nonscientist this section contains basic errors that suggest to me that dr young is not very knowledgeable about this area his understanding of basic chemistry seems limited his definitions of fundamental terms such as hydrogen ion are poor and his explanation of what table salt nacl is and how it dissociates in water is incorrect he gives the same ph values for blood that comes from arteries and veins in reality venous blood is more acidic than arterial blood the manner in which dr young writes suggests a religious fervor that has nothing to do with science i saw no footnotes that support his extreme views in fact judging by the titles of the journal articles he cites i saw no citations in either this or another book by him that pertain specifically to the effect of ph on disease further dr young does not describe any of his own experiments that might lead one to think he has a valid scientific basis for his ideas he makes many extreme statements without any supporting evidence from what i can see dr young does not have any interest in actually testing whether his ideas are correct for example the simple way to test his assertions about the effects of ph on disease would be to give sick people a couple of teaspoons of baking soda per day mixed with water baking soda nahco is a base and will alkalinize the persons blood at least as well as any of the dietary manipulations dr young suggests but he appears not to have done this or even to have studied the medical literature to see if others have  the same observations apply equally to the ph miracle which contains so many dubious passages that it would take a book to respond to them all young bases his notions about alkaline nutrition on the writings of antoine bechamp  and gunter enderlein  who held that microorganisms do not have fixed structures but arise from smaller entities that are always present but shift their form and function in response to environmental influences the youngs refer to the alleged entities as microforms or microzymas page  of the ph miracle states that all cells evolve from them to begin with and that red blood cells    can deevolve and then reevolve into any cell the body needs they also state that morbid changes in microforms are spurred by body acidity and that harmful pleomorphic organisms do not and cannot evolve in healthy alkaline surroundings they further claim to have videotaped transformations from bacteria to yeast fungus and mold and back again page  of the book claims that acidification and overgrowth of negative microforms in the body are the root cause of every symptom illness and disease however the notion of pleomorphism is unfounded and was abandoned by the scientific community long ago the book also advises readers to check their ph cleanse for several days eat a vegetarian diet that emphasizes vegetables and take various supplements including colloidal silver the foods to avoid include all dairy products meats eggs corn peanuts and foods that contain sugar including most fruits the food recommendations are based on their supposed effect on body acidity and alkalinity and whether or not they contain toxins the idea that dietary modification can change the acidity of the body is silly homeostatic mechanisms keep the acidity of the blood stream within a narrow range certain foods can leave endproducts called ash alkalineash foods include fresh fruit and raw vegetables acidash foods include all animal products whole grains beans and other seeds these foods can change the acidity of the urine but not the body as a whole but thats irrelevant since your urine is contained in your bladder and does not affect the ph elsewhere in the body  thus even if body ph were a primary cause of disease the strategies the youngs propose would not influence it in the way they claim references about us ph miracle living web site accessed feb   and

stars out of  july   j andries finally a book that provides proof of the unbiblical statements and ideas of the popular book the shack by william p young it is utterly frightening how many people including pastors have been deceived by the shack the god of the shack is not the god of the bible people who claim that the shack brought them closer to god are being misdirected and decieved into believing in a false god burning down the shack compares the concepts and ideas of the shack with the bible the author provides references to the bible so you can you can verify every false idea and statement burning down the shack is not confrontational  it is simply an analysis that is backed by the bible it is a must read for everyone who has read the shackwhile the shack is a fictional work it is clearly not being regarded as fiction many people claim the shack brought them closer to god and this demonstrates the shack is not simply being read as fiction quite honestly even as a fictional book the shack is offensive to god the bible and christianity i cannot stress enough that burning down the shack is a must read book the first few pages alone provides plenty of evidence of

is a new book by new testament scholar and professor james de young that examines the theology behind paul youngs publishing phenomenon the shack a paperback novel that spent more than  weeks on the bestsellers lists in both the christian and secular worlds in his book de young notes that many evangelicals and churches have been seduced by the shack because the story resonates with many who have difficult backgrounds in which theyve been deeply wounded emotionally and spiritually people who have been deeply hurt he said are reaching out for a sympathetic god who they can clearly understand and who loves them but unless you confront people with the truth people will not find ultimate resolution of their need he said only there will they find freedom from their past deliverance from that which they feel in bondage de young points to jesus promise you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you freeits important to understand that the shack de young said is an ageold heresy universal reconciliation that diminishes the work of jesus on the cross and the holiness and justice of god by asserting that everyone eventually will be saved from eternal damnationif you have

renewal but is the bestseller all it seems are youngs views orthodox more to the point are they truthin burning down the shack  james b de young thd a graduatelevel professor of greek and biblical studies for  years shows just how spiritually flimsy the shack truly is and how its enticing yet false doctrine is stealthily cracking the foundations of countless christians faithand rotting away their very concept of the true god with the skill of an investigator and the heart of a counselor de young addresses essential issues about biblical doctrine and scriptural truth bringing to light a series of troubling questions about the shack and its author de young clearly shows how this runaway hit is little more than a runaway from truthin burning down the shack  dr james b de young has done
