delivers higher design productivity and more fun kimball international faster new design edits and import of legacy cad data design breakthroughkimball international inc kimball provides a variety of products from two business segments the electronic manufacturing services segment and the furniture segment the kimball electronics group provides engineering and manufacturing services which utilize common production and support capabilities globally to automotive industrial medical and public safety markets the furniture segment provides furniture for the office and hospitality markets sold under the family of brand names kimball office national office furniture and kimball hospitality as with any company that adapts well to change kimball’s flexibility and versatility allow it to stay in front of business challenges including the everchanging office environment along with the escalating indirect and direct costs of running a responsible global company“office furniture has changed significantly in the last few years” says ricardo espinosa rd engineering services manager at kimball“the traditional office space continues to evolve” espinosa notes “a considerable number of office environments have migrated to an open plan concept for better interaction collaboration and networking new communication technology translates into people using office space in different ways we’re designing furniture to accommodate technology that has increased the integration of power and communications which places new demands on engineering”these business drivers impact more than  product designers at kimball the company develops several new product lines each year with hundreds of configurations each “resources must be managed carefully and we have to be very efficient to hit our targets and produce the highquality products kimball is known for” says espinosanew demands placed on engineering also increase the need to better leverage decades of design work lots of the computeraided design cad data was created using ideas™ software with a knowledge base dating back to the s and sthe legacy design data is extremely valuable to kimballin  kimball moved it designers to siemens plm software’s solid edge® software at the time solid edge was a historybased cad system only while the move updated kimball to a new modern cad system leveraging the older data created using ideas remained difficult but still importanteven though kimball products are unique they share similar components “we use these as a base for the final product which is ultimately being defined by the innovation features and functionality added to it” says espinosa “the final result is completely different”enter synchronous technologykimball used traditional historytree based solid edge for years in  siemens plm software launched solid edge with synchronous technology to enable users to accelerate new design processes make faster changes to existing designs and improve the reuse of imported data kimball moved to solid edge with synchronous technology to address its business and engineering challengeskimball started the change to synchronous technology with a small group of superusers in early summer with the knowledge from this experience kimball is now in the process of moving all  product engineers to synchronous technology with an expected completion in early fall“when you work with a traditional cad system it’s very slow to create all these little modifications basically you have to do the same thing over and over” says espinosa with synchronous technology kimball can create models without doing additional calculations “without even knowing the dimensions of the final components we can just edit the existing part and create something new we are learning how to adapt our products much faster”“even small changes may take hours if you have to open and edit individual parts in a traditional cad model” says espinosa“with synchronous technology we anticipate significant time savings in producing documentation and drawings for products with hundreds of different configurations we anticipate going from days to hours“before synchronous technology we had to start from scratch now with synchronous technology we can reuse the legacy data that came in during the ’s and ’s it’s really easy to use the existing information and create new components”according to the veteran designer the gamechanging speed of synchronous technology applies to both new and edited design workespinosa explains “we bring assemblies created using ideas into synchronous technology and then we use it to work on individual components we don’t modify everything sometimes we make small changes like adding holes or slots we change dimensions and that’s all we do sometimes we use one of these existing components and create a brandnew product based on the geometry we already have”kimball now imports legacy data created with ideas into solid edge quickly as opposed to what used to be a lengthy historybased cad process “we import parts and have them ready for use in a much more timely fashion with synchronous technology” says espinosaprior to synchronous technology kimball stopped reusing some of the important data it had created using ideas “in historybased cad if you aren’t the original designer there’s no way to figure out how it was designed” says espinosa “we had to redesign most components from scratch the data we could retrieve took days to import but using synchronous technology it now takes minutes”more userfriendly more enjoyable process for product developmentkimball estimates that most of the time savings will come from simply importing and editing its legacy cad designs with the challenge of not increasing staff synchronous technology’s potential to be a timesaver provides the opportunity for improved productivity” says espinosa“there’s a nice return on investment when adopting synchronous technology but our main reason for implementing the tool is to be more productive design better products get to market faster and create an easier process to leverage legacy data” says espinosaespinosa notes synchronous technology took some adjustment but proved itself quickly “i had to erase in my mind  years of historytree design technology within a couple of weeks i started liking it and so did the rest of the people in my company”“you can become more productive you can enjoy more of what you’re doing” says espinosa “when you work with traditional cad product engineering work becomes very repetitive with synchronous technology you can participate more in the design process the fun side of developing products” related page tools decrease text size increase text size text size recommend share feed print related
