incorporated in the state of delaware on september   since inception the company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing the company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination the business purpose of the company is to seek the acquisition of or merger with an existing company as described below the company has engaged in efforts to identify suitable target companies however the company has not entered into a definitive agreement concerning any target business   letter of intent with eurocar and park place   on october   afh holding  advisory llc “afh advisory” a major shareholder of the company entered into a letter of intent the “loi” with two target companies eurocar inc “eurocar” and park place motors ltd “park place” together with eurocar the “target companies” pursuant to which the company would acquire the target companies through a series of transactions including a merger or other business combination pursuant to which the company would cease to be a shell company as defined in the rules of the sec the “reverse merger”   on october   afh advisory eurocar and park place entered into an amendment to the loi pursuant to which the parties to the loi agreed to revise the provision with respect to the beneficial ownership of the company post reverse merger on january   the parties to the loi entered into an amended and restated letter of intent the “amended and restated loi” pursuant to which the parties to the loi agreed to revise the provision with respect to the beneficial ownership of the company post reverse merger provided for certain acknowledgments regarding the proceeds of the offering amended a provision regarding a potential subsequent financing and amended certain financial representations made by each of eurocar and park place on february   the parties to the amended and restated loi entered into an amendment to the amended and restated loi to revise among other things the beneficial ownership of the company post reverse merger on may   the parties to the amended and restated loi entered into a second amended and restated letter of intent the “second amended and restated loi”   the target companies acknowledged and agreed that they shall not be entitled to the proceeds of the offering  million of which will be kept in afh advisory’s account and used by afh advisory for all expenses incurred by afh advisory in connection with the offering the reverse merger and all related going public expenses the “going public expenses” the remaining proceeds of the offering will also be kept in afh advisory’s account and allocated by afh advisory in its sole discretion for any expenses incurred by the company in connection with the going public expenses in the event the reverse merger does not take place any remaining proceeds of the offering that have not been used in connection with the offering the reverse merger and the going public expenses will be used in a future transaction to date in excess of  has been either spent or allocated for certain expenses to the extent afh advisory advances expenses to the company in an amount in excess of the total proceeds raised in the offering afh advisory shall be entitled to be reimbursed such amount    current status of letter of intent with eurocar and park place   subsequent to the events referenced above eurocar informed the company that it was not proceeding forward with the terms of the loi as amended furthermore park place has expressed a reluctance to proceed forward under the terms of the loi as amended as such there is a substantial likelihood that afh will not effect the acquisition of park place and that the reverse merger referenced above will not be consummated for this reason afh has decided to pursue other targets to acquire it is currently expected that any acquisition target will be an entity focuses on the automobile space whether that be a new andor used car retailer andor such an entity with an additional primary focus on automotive repairs and ancillary services      in addition to the efforts described above the company has not restricted its search for any specific kind of businesses and it may acquire a business which is in its preliminary or development stage which is already in operation or in essentially any stage of its business life it is impossible to predict the status of any business in which the company may become engaged in that such business may need to seek additional capital may desire to have its shares publicly traded or may seek other perceived advantages which the company may offer   in implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition the company may become a party to a merger consolidation reorganization joint venture or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity   it is anticipated that any securities issued in any such business combination would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws in some circumstances however as a negotiated element of its transaction the company may agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter if such registration occurs it will be undertaken by the surviving entity after the company has entered into an agreement for a business combination or has consummated a business combination the issuance of additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in the company’s securities may depress the market value of the company’s securities in the future if such a market develops of which there is no assurance however if the company cannot effect a noncash acquisition the company may have to raise funds from a private offering of its securities under rule  of regulation d there is no assurance the company would obtain any such equity funding   the company will participate in a business combination only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate agreements negotiations with a target company will likely focus on the percentage of the company which the target company shareholders would acquire in exchange for their shareholdings   although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted generally such agreements will require certain representations and warranties of the parties thereto will specify certain events of default will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by the parties prior to and after such closing and will include miscellaneous other terms any merger or acquisition effected by the company can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by the company’s shareholders at such time   private placement commencing from october    in october  the company commenced a private placement offering as amended the “offering” to several accredited investors the “purchasers” for up to  shares for aggregate proceeds equal to  no warrants were issued to investors in the offering the offering was conducted pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended pursuant to regulation d section  and rule  thereunder   proceeds from the offering were used to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the reverse merger with the target companies as indicated in the second amended and restated loi   the offering was undertaken pursuant to a definitive subscription agreement between the company and the purchasers the “subscription agreement” which contains customary representations warranties and covenants of the parties   as of the date of this annual report the company has received proceeds in an aggregate amount of  no additional amounts are expected to be raised further to the offering until such time as other acquisition targets are identified   business strategy   the company based on proposed business activities is a “blank check” company the sec defines such a company as “a development stage company that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies or other entity or person and is issuing ‘penny stock’ as defined in rule a under the exchange act” under sec rule b under the exchange act the company also qualifies as a “shell company” because it has no or nominal operations and no or nominal assets other than cash or cash equivalents many states have enacted statutes rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions and certain sec rules and regulations restrict the activities of both blank check and shell companies management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in any of our securities either debt or equity until we have successfully concluded a business combination the company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the exchange act for so long as it is subject to those requirements      the company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation the company’s principal business objective for the next  months and beyond such time will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate shortterm earnings the company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business industry or geographical location and thus may acquire any type of business the company will seek to consummate its acquisition with eurocar and park place but if that is not completed it will continue its search for an appropriate operating business with which to consider consummating a business combination   the analysis of new business opportunities has and will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the company’s management the company has considered potential acquisition transactions but while one of its principal stockholders entered into the loi with eurocar and park place which contemplates a business combination between eurocar park place and afh as of this date has not entered into any definitive agreement with any party the company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities in its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets the company will consider the following kinds of factors   a potential for growth indicated by new technology anticipated market expansion or new products b competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole c strength and diversity of management either in place or scheduled for recruitment d capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds to be provided by the company or from operations through the sale of additional securities through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources e the cost of participation by the company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials f the extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced g the accessibility of required management expertise personnel raw materials services professional assistance and other required items and h other relevant factors   in applying the foregoing criteria no one of which will be controlling management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex due to the company’s limited capital available for investigation the company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired in addition we will be competing against other entities that possess greater financial technical and managerial capabilities for identifying and completing business combinations in evaluating a prospective business combination we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as possible given the lack of information which may be available regarding private companies our limited personnel and financial resources and the inexperience of our management with respect to such activities   we expect that our due diligence will encompass among other things meetings with the target business’s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities as necessary as well as a review of financial and other information which is made available to us this due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage including but not limited to attorneys accountants consultants or other such professionals at this time the company has not specifically identified any third parties that it may engage except that afh advisory whose sole member and manager is our president and secretary amir f heshmatpour may assist the company with due diligence in identifying a business combination target the costs associated with hiring third parties as required to complete a business combination may be significant and are difficult to determine as such costs may be vary depending on a variety of factors including the amount of time it takes to complete a business combination the location of the target company and the size and complexity of the business of the target company      our limited funds and the lack of fulltime management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination management decisions therefore will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies independent analysis market surveys and the like which if we had more funds available to us would be desirable we will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters owners sponsors or other associated with the target business seeking our participation   we do not currently intend to retain any entity to act as a “finder” to identify and analyze the merits of potential target businesses however we contemplate that at least one of the third parties who may introduce business combinations to us may be afh advisory there are currently no agreements or preliminary agreements or understandings between us and afh advisory other than those already disclosed any transaction or consulting fees paid to afh advisory will be comparable with unaffiliated third party fees   the time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty the amount of time it takes to complete a business combination the location of the target company and the size and complexity of the business of the target company are all factors that determine the costs associated with completing a business combination transaction the time and costs required to complete a business combination can be estimated once a business combination target has been identified any costs incurred with respect to the evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us   the company is in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination we are and will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with joint ventures with and acquisitions of small private and public entities a large number of established and wellfinanced entities including small public companies and venture capital firms are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do consequently we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination these competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination   form of acquisition   the manner in which the company participates in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity the respective needs and desires of the company and the promoters of the opportunity and the relative negotiating strength of the company and such promoters   it is likely that the company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of its common stock or other securities of the company although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a socalled “tax free” reorganization under section a of the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own  or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity if a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other “tax free” provisions provided under the code all prior stockholders would in such circumstances retain  or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity   under other circumstances depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties prior stockholders may retain substantially less than  of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity this could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who were stockholders of the company prior to such reorganization the company does not intend to supply disclosure to shareholders concerning a target company prior to the consummation of a business combination transaction unless required by applicable law or regulation in the event a proposed business combination involves a change in majority of directors of the company the company will file and provide to shareholders a schedule f which shall include information concerning the target company as required the company will file a current report on form k as required within four business days of a business combination which results in the company ceasing to be a shell company this form k will include complete disclosure of the target company including audited financial statements      the controlling stockholders of the company will likely not have control of a majority of the voting securities of the company following a reorganization transaction as part of such a transaction all or a majority of the company’s directors may resign and one or more new directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders   in the case of an acquisition the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management without any vote or approval by stockholders in the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving the company it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders’ meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding securities the necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders most likely management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval   it is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation drafting and execution of relevant agreements disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants attorneys and others the costs that will be incurred are not ascertainable at this time as the costs are expected to be tied to the amount of time it takes to identify and complete a business combination transaction as well as the specific factors related to the business combination target that is chosen including such factors as the location size and complexity of the business of the target company if a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable furthermore even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the company of the related costs incurred   we presently have no employees apart from our management our sole officer and our directors are engaged in outside business activities and anticipate that they will devote to our business very limited time until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified we expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes if any incident to a business combination   item a risk factors   as a “smaller reporting

able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury through deferral of fees by certain service providers and additional amounts as necessary to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders management or other investors   the company may consider acquiring a business which has recently commenced operations is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets is seeking to develop a new product or service or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital in the alternative a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding among other things the time delays significant expense and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering   any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth including entities without established records of sales or earnings in that event we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies in addition we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk and although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks   the company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky because of general economic conditions rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital which we will have andor the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include among other things facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities

reporting are designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

transactions and dispositions of our assets    provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and    provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements   because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected   management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this evaluation management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of october        this annual report does not include a report from the company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting due to the permanent exemption established by the securities and exchange commission for public companies designated as small filers   changes in internal control over financial reporting   the company did not maintain effective control over the preparation review

california los angeles county against emerald dairy inc “emerald” and its chairman mr shang asserting that they were entitled to a large number of shares of emerald both from emerald and from shares individually owned and pledged by chairman shang emerald and chairman shang defaulted there were some efforts to enforce the judgment against the chairman in china where he resides but we are not aware of the status of those efforts banner bank judgment mr amir heshmatpour is a defendant in two lawsuits related to banner bank which have been reduced to judgment the lawsuits arise from three loans issued in the late ’s the lender was town bank a washington state bank which is no longer in existence having been acquired by banner bank in the early ’s the borrowers on the three separate loans were hh holdings metrophone telecom and amir heshmatpour in the early ’s the three loans were consolidated into one loan shortly before banner bank acquired town bank once this acquisition occurred the relationship between the borrowers and the successor lender soured and a default was ultimately declared on the loans judgments were entered in the superior court for the state of washington in  and in the united states district court for the western district of washington   mr heshmatpour contends that negotiated agreements were reached for payment of the outstanding loan balance resulting in an agreement to pay approximately  mr heshmatpour further contends that the agreements were satisfied but that banner bank failed to properly account for the payments received since the early ’s banner bank has retained judgment creditor status against mr heshmatpour and his wife and has added interest to the superior court judgment in the amount of approximately  per year and to the district court action in the amount of approximately  per year however for almost the entire decade no further collection actions were taken and mr heshmatpour believed the matter was resolved   the two judgments have recently been domesticated in the united states district court for the central district of california and the california superior court banner bank is seeking to enforce the judgments and mr and mrs heshmatpour who are unaware of the reasons behind the renewed activity have retained counsel to defend them in the enforcement proceedings   in the district court action the court on june   issued an order charging the ownership interest in afh advisory of amir heshmatpour with payment of the unpaid balance in that case of approximately  and ordering afh advisory to pay any distributions due to amir heshmatpour directly to banner bank in the superior court action amir heshmatpour filed a motion to vacate andor reduce sister state judgment in the amount of approximately  which is set for hearing on june   the superior court action is otherwise stayed pending the hearing on june        compliance with section a of the exchange act   section a

company afh acquisition vii inc a development stage company the “company” was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on september   the company is  owned by afh holding  advisory llc the “parent” the financial statements presented represent only those transactions of afh acquisition vii inc the company is looking to acquire an existing company or acquire the technology to begin operations   as a blank check company the company’s business is to pursue a business combination through acquisition or merger with an existing company   since inception the company has been engaged in organization efforts and as set forth below has entered into an loi   on october   afh holding  advisory llc “afh advisory” a major shareholder of the company entered into a letter of intent the “loi” with two target companies eurocar inc “eurocar” and park place motors ltd “park place” together with eurocar the “target companies” pursuant to which the company will acquire the target companies through a series of transactions including a merger or other business combination pursuant to which the company would cease to be a shell company as defined in the rules of the sec the “reverse merger”   on october   afh advisory eurocar and park place entered into an amendment to the loi pursuant to which the parties to the loi agreed to revise the provision with respect to the beneficial ownership of the company post reverse merger on january   the parties to the loi entered into an amended and restated letter of intent the “amended and restated loi” pursuant to which the parties to the loi agreed to revise the provision with respect to the beneficial ownership of the company post reverse merger provided for certain acknowledgments regarding the proceeds of the offering amended a provision regarding a potential subsequent financing and amended certain financial representations made by each of eurocar and park place on february   the parties to the amended and restated loi entered into an amendment to the amended and restated loi to revise among other things the beneficial ownership of the company post reverse merger on may   the parties to the amended and restated loi entered into a second amended and restated letter of intent the “second amended and restated loi”   the letter of intent contemplating the potential business combination contained several and various covenants and milestones during the period it was determined that park place and eurocar were unable to achieve certain covenants or milestones after due consideration of the noncompliance the parties agreed that the proposed business combination be postponed until such time that the parties were able to achieve compliance or the terms of the letter of intent containing the covenants and performance target be renegotiated f   note   summary of significant accounting policies   method of accounting the company maintains its books and prepares its financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting   cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include time deposits certificates of deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less the company maintains cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions which periodically may exceed federally insured amounts    loss per common share  loss per common share is computed in accordance with fasb asc  by dividing income loss available to common stockholders by weighted average number of common shares outstanding for each period    use of estimates  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results can differ from those estimates    organizational costs organizational costs represent management consulting legal accounting and filing fees incurred to date in the formation of the company organizational costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with fasb asc    income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method wherein deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs  a valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the company will not realize tax assets through future operations   the companys shortterm and longterm deferred tax liability is based on the calculation of the deferred taxes on the companys unrealized gain on availableforsale securities using a  effective tax rate based on a  federal income tax rate net of state tax deduction combined with an  california state income tax rate the company recognizes a deferred tax asset through changes in the valuation allowance for the exact amount of the deferred tax liability  the classification of these deferred taxes is concurrent with the classification of investments for which the unrealized gain is derived for balance sheet presentation current deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset and presented as a single amount and noncurrent deferred tax assets and liabilities within each tax jurisdiction have been offset and presented as a single amount   when tax returns are filed it is highly probable that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained  the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which based on all available evidence management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes if any tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions  tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than  percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority  the portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination  as of october   the company had no unrecognized tax benefits and the company had no positions which in the opinion of management would be reversed if challenged by a taxing authority the company’s evaluation of tax positions was performed for those tax years which remain open to audit  the company may from time to time be assessed interest or penalties by the taxing authorities although any such assessments historically have been minimal and immaterial to the company’s financial results  in the event the company is assessed interest andor penalties such amounts will be classified as income tax expense in the financial statements   f   financial instruments the company’s financial instruments consist of cash and due to parent unless otherwise noted it is management’s opinion that the company is not exposed to significant interest currency or credit risks arising from these financial instruments the fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying value unless otherwise noted   recent pronouncements on june
