investment trusts act  qualifying managed investment trusts mits can make an irrevocable election to apply these rules pursuant to the notice provided to unitholders on our website on  may  under section gca of the corporations act  cth as inserted by asic corporations attribution managed investment trusts instrument  platinum investment management limited acn    platinum has made modifications to the constitutions of the funds modifications to enable each fund to elect into the amit regime copies of the modifications are available free of charge by contacting investor services on    australia only    nz only    or emailing investplatinumcomau reasons for modifications the amit regime was established by the australian government to provide qualifying mits with the ability to benefit from improved flexibility and greater certainty in respect of their tax treatment platinum has decided to elect the funds into the amit regime with effect from  july  for reasons which include the following under the amit regime taxable income will be allocated to unitholders using the concept of “attribution” replacing the “present entitlement” model  please note that whilst there is a change in terminology under the amit regime in practice distributions to unitholders will continue to be allocated by platinum on a proportionate basis in line with platinum’s distribution policy the amit regime permits a more equitable allocation of any taxable gains that may have been realised in order to fund large redemption payments to redeeming unitholders  currently all unitholders receive a distribution related to these taxable gains but under the amit regime the gains may be “streamed” to redeeming unitholders platinum may be taxed on any taxable income of a fund that it fails to allocate to unitholders and may be liable for tax in respect of any tax offsets that have been over attributed to unitholders the amit regime provides a set of rules to deal with instances where amounts have been overdistributed or underdistributed  it is a common feature of managed investment schemes that the tax components in unitholders’ annual tax statements may sometimes require subsequent adjustment  under existing laws a new tax statement may need to be issued requiring unitholders to amend their tax returns  whilst the prospect of reissuing tax statements and amending unitholder tax returns for socalled “unders and overs” remains possible under amit this possibility will be reduced the amit rules will also provide a mechanism to prevent double taxation if the amount distributed by a fund is less than the taxable income attributed the existing platinum trust funds’ annual distribution and tax statements will be amended to comply with the new amit rules amma statement  the amma statement for a unitholder will continue to detail the unitholder’s share of attributable income but the format will change slightly  we will update our unitholder tax guide for the first distribution impacted by amit currently envisaged to be  june  effect of modifications the modifications in respect of the funds amend the funds’ constitutions to provide platinum with the power to make an irrevocable election for the funds to operate as amits including the ability to make a choice to treat each class of units as a separate amit where relevant recover from the funds in relation to any income tax liability incurred as a result of the funds being amits do all things necessary to operate the funds as amits and insert other provisions considered by platinum as being necessary or incidental to the funds complying with the amit regime     platinum japan fund llc  who is raising money  sec filings of fundraisings and investments in hedge funds startups and private
