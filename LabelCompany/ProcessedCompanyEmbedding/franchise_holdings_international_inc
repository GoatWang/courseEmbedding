international inc otcmktsfnhi preparing for uplisting by michael luke  july    share on facebook tweet on twitter franchise holdings international inc otcmktsfnhi is appearing on street register for the first time today so our first order of business is to provide readers with a brief overview of the company’s core business   fnhi’s wholly owned subsidiary truxmart was founded in  to take advantage of the limited innovation provided by existing tonneau cover manufacturers tonneau covers have remained much the same in price and design since  with one main company controlling a majority of the tonneau cover market this dynamic market segment is in need of a new innovative manufacturer of high quality functional and aggressively priced tonneau covers truxmart has developed multiple products for all of the most prominent pickup trucks available in north america truxmart sells its products through master warehouse distributors dealers and online retailers in north america and is expanding to central and south american distribution of its products   recently franchise holdings international inc otcmktsfnhi management received board approval for the creation and issuance of  new shares of a series a preferred stock the purpose of the new share class is to tighten fnhi’s capitalization while maintaining ceo steven rossi’s voting control over fnhi in addition to accomplishing other management objectives presently fnhi currently has issued only “common shares” with one vote per share as a single share class rossi as ceo holds fnhi voting control by owning  of the  shares issued and outstanding rossi intends to retire up to  of his  fnhi common shares while issuing preferred shares reducing the fnhi issued and outstanding shares by up to  per cent each preferred share will vote the equivalent of  votes per  common share “this new share structure is just one step of many along our clear path and vision towards our future success” rossi commented in explaining the board’s action today “revenues and profits are what compensates me for my work not by selling my fnhi ownership” the process required an pre c information statement filing covering proposals by security holders whose actions do not require proxies and an sec filing defc which is expected to start this month and requires  days to complete and file with the state of nevada source marketwired   that announcement came shortly after an update from fnhi  stating that the company expects to complete and issue its  audited financial statements at any time now and that immediately after the audit is finalized the fnhi q  quarterly review will be underway with an anticipated expeditious timeframe following the issue of the audited financial statements and the quarterly review fnhi will seek relisting on the otc’s qb exchange for earlystage and developing us and international companies with this milestone achieved demonstrating the company’s growthoriented progress fnhi will move forward with its previously initiated dual listing on toronto’s canadian securities exchange cse rossi stated that truxmart’s business has continued its upward trend and that it “presently has over us in booked purchase orders its highest level to date” he also commented on a visit to the company’s chinese factories in may saying that as a result “manufacturing costs were reduced by approximately  percent increasing profits substantially while maintaining product quality” source marketwired we’ll be looking forward to the update confirming that the proper audits and filings have been made to clean up its delinquent status with otc markets the first step toward an eventual uplisting we’ll stay up on any further developments with fnhi and pass them along to you stay locked on
