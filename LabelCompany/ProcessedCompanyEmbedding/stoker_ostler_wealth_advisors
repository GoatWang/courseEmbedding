advisors  stoker ostler   home  harris private bank  contact us case studies publications event calendar links online brochure forms case studies case study anna “people get attached to certain stocks when they have performed exceedingly well  sometimes they are reluctant to sell investments partly due to their gratitude and partly because they think they might be leaving some upside potential behind if they do  if she had not diversified when she did it is very likely that she could be broke today  we use a very disciplined balancing approach in order to avoid these sorts of catastrophes” said phil stoker comanaging partner of stoker ostler wealth advisors view other stoker ostler case studies betty our most recent case a true client scenario  anna all names has been changed to protect the identity of our clients came to us in november  as a referral from her brother  anna a yearold retired nurse was divorced with two adult children one of whom was married with one child anna’s only investment was  shares of mciworldcom stock worth approximately  million  her cost basis in the stock which she purchased  years previously was    she was interested in receiving enough income each year to meet her needs and estimated that would mean   she also wanted to gift money each year to her two children our solution  our immediate concern was the need to diversify anna’s portfolio  she was very reluctant to part with all of the mci stock as it had been a good investment for her to that point with a huge runup in value over the prior two years  we explained to anna that there was always a chance that the stock could plummet and therefore she should cash out a majority of her gains and diversify  we discussed various options for diversification including a swap fund like those offered by goldman sachs a charitable remainder trust or just selling the stock outright and paying the tax we approached the diversification plan based on an assumption of “what if the stock went to zero” scenario – that is if the stock should become worthless in the future what can she afford to keep of the stock and what does she need to sell to protect her future   we laid out our plan to sell  shares of mci stock outright  the price at the time was  per share which turned out to be almost the top her shares were worth  million gross of which about  would go to pay the capital gains tax incurred on the sale  this left about  in mciworldcom stock  the  million left from the sale was divided between a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds  we also set up accounts for gifting to her two children   the lesson  never could we have predicted that the mciworldcom stock literally would be worthless in just three years  we did sell all of the stock before the collapse but at a lower price than the original sale   however anna is very happy knowing her assets were protected due to good advice at the time as well as the continuing rebalancing and monitoring of her portfolio
