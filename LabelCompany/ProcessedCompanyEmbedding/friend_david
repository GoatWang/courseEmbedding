 artist david shepherd – all art work available originals signed limited edition prints and sculptures david shepherd – “to start with my life was a series of disasters” growing up in the ’s his one ambition was to be a game warden in kenya and so on leaving school he went to kenya and was promptly told by the national parks people that he was not wanted on returning to england david was faced with two choices one was ‘to drive a bus for a living’ and the other was to pursue the only other possibility painting however he admits that he had very little interest in art and certainly no talent for he was promptly rejected by the slade school of fine art as ‘untrainable’ by chance he met robin goodwin a professional artist who took him under his wing david believes ‘as a challenge’ after three years with robin goodwin he started his artistic career pursuing his first two loves steam engines and aviation it was the latter that led him to the royal air force who began to fly him around the world as their guest and it was a trip to aden in  which changed his life it seemed that almost everyone wanted a painting but more important still the royal air force flew him down to kenya where he was commissioned by them to paint his very first wildlife painting and his career never looked back from that moment it was on that same visit that he became a conservationist after finding  dead zebra around a poisoned water hole on returning to london he had his first oneman show of wildlife paintings the exhibition sold out in the first twenty minutes and he has not looked back since apart from the tremendous demand for his originals a number of which he donates to wildlife through the david shepherd conservation foundation to pay back what in his own words is my enormous debt to the
