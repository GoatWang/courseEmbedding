though health cant be bought health care is a big business thanks john and thanks for inviting me the motion that youve heard is obamacare is now beyond rescue” what you heard dr gottlieb argue is not that its beyond rescue its that he doesnt like a lot of the provisions of the law what were here to discuss it seems to me is what has been in the proposed and the proposed was either obamacare is now beyond rescue  meaning its not doing what it was supposed to do  or it is not beyond rescue and therefore it is doing what it can do my partner jonathan chait and i will argue that not only is this law not beyond rescue it doesnt need to be rescued because the law already has worked and is working and to understand whether its working we need to understand where we were before the law was passed and what the goals of the law were ill cover that and jonathan will also discuss the achievements of obamacare but hell focus on criticisms and dire predictions of which weve already heard many from the opponents of the law speaking of the dire predictions well come back to some of the ones we heard but there are a few i think that well have to deal with sooner rather than later let me first turn to the question about obamacare and what it does its an insurance law but of course it includes cost controls and quality improvements as well i want to focus on the insurance stuff because the question occurs why is health insurance important there are a lot of studies that show a lot of reasons for it some include showing that kids who have healthcare insurance are less likely to miss their shots and if they dont have insurance theyre more likely to miss them healthy adults without insurance tend not to get mammograms and other preventive services that they need people who have diseases such as diabetes and hypertension and they dont have insurance do poorly they tend to be more out of control and if they have bad outcomes like strokes they tend to be more severe but just as important in terms of outcomes besides health people who have no insurance and have a serious health problem can be bankrupted by it in this system that we had until very recently this led a group at the institute of medicine in a big report to say that a lack of health care insurance results in needless illness needless suffering and needless death lets turn the clock back a little bit to   when this law was being debated at that time we had  to  million people uninsured we were spending two and a half trillion dollars a year on health and health care and growing and we had some of the worst statistics for health outcomes in the developed world in addition most of the insurance products that we saw at that time didnt have portability if you lost your job you often lost your insurance you didnt have guaranteed issue so if you had a preexisting condition and tried to get health insurance and youre not in a big group forget about it and there were no national standards for insurance policies we were largely  not exclusively but we were largely in a fee for service system with incentives really pushing towards more care not better care not the appropriate care but the more you did the more you got paid and so it was estimated at that time that unnecessary care couldve been  even  percent of the money that was being spent and equally important were the projections  and this is just now four years ago  the projections of where we are going to be by  which is just four years from now if nothing had been done over  million people uninsured at that point health care spending going from trillion to  trillion a year family health care premiums going up from  to average  a year medicare trust fund runs out of money and no change in that fee for service culture that pays for more medicine more health care and not necessarily better so in march  which is now almost four years ago we had this law signed obamacare the affordable care act aca hugely complex admittedly admittedly imperfect law but not just insurance  quality improvement cost reductions what are some of the things that have happened in the first three years of this law young adults  and under now can get coverage on their parents policies and three million have preexisting conditions not allowed to prevent coverage theres portability of insurance coverage no lifetime caps community rating which means if youre in a small business one person gets very sick or their family member does it doesnt raise the rates for everybody no lifetime caps on coverage lots of stuff and in some ways very importantly no copays no deductibles for preventive care thats evidence based also cost related things were now paying hospitals for outcomes and not the services they deliver there are penalties for hospital readmissions when someones discharged and then readmitted to the hospital soon afterwards something called accountable care organizations are getting paid for performance rather than piecework and there are many experiments and demonstrations from part of the government now called the center for medicare and medicaid innovation importantly cost reforms have slowed down cost dramatically that is the increase per year is just an average of  percent in the past three years  to  so in summary before this year before anything thats been controversial in the news happened there are already a lot of good things that are going on because of obamacare then we come to october  everyone knows what a disaster okay people cant sign up the computer systems dont work the websites a mess theres lots of confusion some provisions of the law were postponed but even conceding that all this was a mess lets look whats happened recently six million enrollees two million in exchanges  million in medicaid  well come back to medicaid  people up to  percent of the federal poverty levels are getting subsidies to help pay for insurance and cost increases continue to moderate  let me conclude now by asking you to remember where we were where weve been and where we are now i want to quote from a mock interview that was in one of my favorite newspapers a satirical newspaper called the onion the headline wasnation recalls simpler time when health care system was broken beyond repair heres the quoteback then if you couldnt afford health care insurance and got really sick you went bankrupt plain and simple said a modesto  california mother of three you didnt have this whole mess of lower cost options or all these subsidies you might or might not qualify for based on your income people didnt have to deal with any of that stuff and those headaches just went ahead and died of preventable causes scott can i ask a question scott youre saying  youre describing what you would have liked but lets be real  lets be realistic if the choice is we have obamacare now its a law what are the chances of any kind of scenario that youre describing taking  taking flight passing both houses of congress at any time in the foreseeable future i want to go back and ask the question to you all again if in fact youre saying that obamacare  well but i mean the point of the debate is to say that its beyond  you know either its beyond rescue or its not beyond rescue so you guys say cant be saved cant be fixed whats the plan then well i want to go back to your point though i think one of the things we have to remember is that this law changes lots of things it doesnt just change the coverage it also talks about whos going to be taking care of patient on medicaid what the doctor is going to be paid as you know as a practicing doctor where you practice a lot of places dont take medicaid and they dont take it because the rates are laughable reimbursement is very low its not because i dont think because the patients have certain problems that theyre not willing to deal with seems unlikely its a matter of dollars and cents one of the things it does at least temporarily it can presumably be extended raising the rates of medicaid and medicare a lot of doctors take care of medicare patients and also i would think that youd be happy to see these kinds of  it seems to me at least speaking from the inside  as a conservative philosophy youre saying look if this doesnt work very well clearly these highpriced providers wherever they are are going to have to make some kind of a change hospitals or other places that are going to be left out of the networks pretty soon  because youre predicting it because its free im not sure why they have to going to be  thats going to be delayed but even if it is delayed it still doesnt go to the point that its not going to ultimately be useful and even despite the tax dodges that people like dr gottlieb have access to   im sorry scott my mistake  that scott has access to even without those theres a bit of a moral imperative where people dont like to break the law people dont like to do what theyre not supposed to do and thats one of the reasons the moral imperative was put in there i think thats exactly point is is that is if you dont like a state run kind of program then you know you dont like the kind of systems that are elsewhere you can saywere not the same were different but it is interesting that every advanced economy in the west and some more in the east has these kinds of programs and yet there is something special about us where we cant seem apparently figure out a way to do it here weve got to have some special american take on it so i think we probably can learn from it i think we probably can learn a lot from other countries were also making a huge change here theres no question about that and it takes time to do that plus lots of the law has things that are demonstrations that are experiments that are trying to find different ways to improve things and were not going to know the results of those for a year two years or even more and they can the nice thing about it centers for medicare and medicaid can then ramp things up when they find successes in demonstrations to show how we can help to incentivize patients those kinds of things are out there in existence right now and of course other hospitals are working on programs where they have outreach workers for the first time to try to follow up with patients  very much part of obamacare i mean youre saying obamacare is beyond rescue were saying lots of parts are doing good things sure oh  you  there are a number of things and one of those is getting people into care so they dont have  thats exactly  thats exactly what insurance is about and so if you dont want to have a system where people contribute so that the entire population benefits then you dont have a system like that but as a youngish person i cant quite see yourself you know you may feel that this is a big problem guess what theres a future you and the future you is going to be much older and its going to be  brief correction never been an attorney or an assistant attorney general its okay no offense to the attorneys out there thank you very much john and thanks to you and the iq sponsors and to megan and scott for a spirited debate i want to thank the audience as well the motion that were talking about isobamacare is now beyond rescue weve had a lot of fun throwing statistics back and forth and trying to make clever remarks but it seems to me this really comes down to a very personal question given where we are whats come before and likely to happen in two scenarios we keep obamacare or we dump it what should we do and like most of us i could cite personal stories about health care coverage and access recent ones about friends who had trouble getting coverage because of preexisting conditions and now with the obamacare see their insurance and drug costs decrease markedly to  percent or about young people like two of our kids whove already gotten affordable insurance coverage between college and their first jobs but i think really the most telling story that i want to mention in conclusion is about medicaid much maligned in this discussion today but  years ago my first job for the public health service was working as a gp in the national service board the community health center in an urban underserved part of town but because that city was in this state that is in new york state the state that had and still has a generous medicaid program most of our patients had insurance most of our patients had access to care they were poor they were working or disabled but they had health care they had a medical home and they had prescription drug benefits and they benefitted from this despite what youve heard here today a lot of good care is delivered to medicaid patients when i later moved to washington dc and looked for a job in virginia i asked about medicaid  okay i want to say that because of obamacare a lot of people are going to have medicaid but also a lot of doctors are going to be paid more to take care of medicaid and theres more money for the national service corps with doctors like me taking care of them sample  speech sometwitteruser  user two well the vast majority of them really dont know what the law does theyre not policy wonks and when mitt romney said he was for it it sounded like a good solid republican idea when barack obama said he was for it then it became a socialist plot to destroy america and if you dont know whats in the law thats a pretty sensible way to think about what the law does doug kamerow has anybody here ever renovated a house ive done it twice it was hell every day i went through brought fresh misery and fresh reason to think why am i doing this but in the end it worked and the reason it worked is because we know how to renovate houses right so when you hear about the problems that our opponents are describing in the law they had to delay this they had to fix this the spanish language website didnt work as well as they wanted the first day you have to ask are these things that are going to fundamentally destroy the law or are they the kind of problems you have in a renovation they said oh we didnt quite get the counters we want oh this went a little bit over cost well then you have to ask  to answer that question you have to ask what kind of endeavor is obamacare is the obama administration trying to build a moon base is the obama administration trying to build a thriving liberal democracy in a hostile muslim country no what theyre trying to do is build a national health insurance plan can you build a national health insurance plan well every advanced economy in the world except the united states has built a national health insurance plan all of those countries insure all their citizens and all of them pay considerably less than we pay here in the united states so youre a priori assumption has to be yeah this is something you can basically do that the problems you have are not signs that everything is about to collapse onto itself but the problems you have any time you go through any major project so what our opponents have been trying to do for months and months and months actually is paint this picture where every time the contractor comes to you and saysoh it turns out they dont have this color oh it turns out the plumber is unavailable on this day it means the whole thing is going to collapse on its own but actually nothing like that is happening at all and there is no evidence that anything like this is happening the main argument that the opponents have been making the entire time is that there is going to be a death spiral thats the only plausible mechanism that they have that the law will fail a death spiral is a term that i expected them to talk about because thats what theyve been talking about for months its something theyve barely invoked at all and i think the reason is its become clear in recent days that theres no chance of a death spiral in the obamacare law a death spiral is when you have too many old sick people who drive up the cost making the premiums more expensive leading the healthy people to flee driving up costs more that is theoretically possible but is not something that can possibly happen in this law in fact if you want to sayis the law succeeding you dont have to ask the administration you could ask the insurers right because the insurers have recently been saying theyre very happy with the mix of people  the mix of people you have in the exchanges is sound its sustainable they dont need  they dont need it to change theyve got a mix of people thats healthy enough to keep the exchanges going forward whats more even if you had more old people going into the exchanges than they expect you had  the kaiser health foundation ran the numbers and saidwhats the worstcase scenario we dont get any increase in young people at all and they said it would be about a  percent increase in premiums  percent increase in health insurance premiums if any of you have ever had health insurance and you get a  percent increase over your bill last year youd saythank god its only a  percent increase right thats a rounding error no one notices  percent that couldnt possibly set off a death spiral so theres really no plausible mechanism that the law could fail so i think what theyre giving you  instead of what used to be the plausible mechanism for which the  this can fail theyre giving you a mix of wishes and hopes and completely debunked facts they saidcost growth leveled after ” no cost growth in  was lower than at any year in  years and in fact  this is important because when the law was passed cost growth was the main thing they talked about obamacare was supposed to control costs and they saidno no its going to make costs explode with all this bureaucracy regulation theyre going to go out of control” what happened is that cost growth came in way lower than the most optimistic estimates believed it would be before the law was signed and so now theyre reduced  instead of sayingthis disaster of cost growth is going to happen theyre going to saythis incredible miracle of low cost growth is simply a coincidence” so all theyre saying is essentially that this wonderful thing thats happened has nothing to do with the gigantic change in healthcare or that happened just before costs started going to the lowest level in  years and you cant prove that its not a coincidence but you have to  see this is indicative of the mentality were dealing with where it simply moves from one possible disastrous scenario to another possible disastrous scenario so you have to wonderwhy are they simple moving from one disaster scenario to another disaster scenario actually i wanted to debunk a couple points they made because a lot of this is just  weve heard from the other side  are not true i cant give you links and charts to debunk them but let me say that its not the case that  million policies have been canceled thats a number that was floating about that you cant verify its almost certainly not true many journalists have tried to figure out exactly how many policies have been canceled and they dont have good enough records to know but they know its not  million and they suspect  the administration suspects its closer to onetenth of that figure they cant actually prove that either but for various reasons you dont have a good enough count this  thats almost certainly nowhere close to  million and thats a big number thats  theyre citing because theyre saying that  those are the losers but its really nowhere close to that yet they say  megan said we cant  we cant say for sure how many  how  that there are more insured now than there were before we cant say for sure because again this number cant exactly be counted we dont know that   it was  but we know its not anywhere close to  million and its a mortal certainty that far more people have health insurance now than would have had in absence of the law so why are we having this kind of lurch from one argument abandoning these arguments when they disappear and simply coming up with new ones the truth is they disagree with the goals of the law and i think you could hear that in their remarks they saytheres less choice” and its true the government says insurers have to provide certain benefits right they have to provide pregnancy coverage thats  and maternity care those are the most controversial things that are mostly cited because they want people who are male or old to not have to pay for those things and they want people who are young and female and might have to bear children to pay those costs themselves because thats an ideological difference between the two sides and thats fine for them to have an ideological difference between the two sides but were not here to debate whether this law is a good idea were here to debate whether the law is actually working and the truth is the only reason theyre desperately trying to claim the law is not working is because they oppose national health insurance megan answer the question  no at the jpmorgan conference a series of insurers were interviewed and they all said that they were generally expecting getting what they expected there were a series of insurers quoted at the jpmorgan conference on january  right but what were seeing right now is that theyre not even going to need that kind of adjustment in the first place because theyre saying the pool of people is young enough that its meeting their expectations that they dont need to raise premiums whatsoever and so if you want to  if you have to askwhat is the definition of success the definition of success is putting in place a law that will get at a certain point to having a dramatic expansion of coverage so at one point you saidwell by january  there arent as many people covered as there were before right we dont know youre right you said  thats correct right we dont know exactly   right  we dont know the number of people who had their plans cancelled its way less than five million we dont know so we cant say exactly how many  but why is january  the first date the law started the best mark the laws supposed to  the reason i wrote that youre against national health care is because in  you wrote a column called why i oppose national health care youve also predicted  a few months ago you predicted the exchanges might not even open on january  that the administration would have to stop its whole law so if youre talking about moving the goal post your definition of failure just keeps getting smaller and smaller youre using the word death spiral in a way that no one in health care and economics ever uses it thats all you keep saying  obligate people to medicaid but i dont think the word means what you think it means no one is obligated to go on medicaid people are offered to go on medicaid and they very rationally choose to go on medicaid right now our opponents have made two different claims about medicaid scotts made a terrible argument about the quality of medicaid and megan made one that is merely bad scotts argument hes obliquely citing studies that have taken two populations one of which is on medicaid and one which is not on medicaid and compared their health now if youre on medicaid youre in a terrible place something has gone bad in your life youre very poor youre very sick bad things are happening to you so a lot of studies are comparing two completely different kinds of populations and finding the people on medicaid are worse off those are the studies people dont take seriously then the study that megan cited is still not a very good use of data its not a good use of data for two reasons  if i may  number one  so there are a series of studies on the effectiveness of medicaid many of these studies  most of them show what you would intuitively think going on medicaid and being able to see doctors even if you dont get a lot of choice even if a lot of doctors dont want to take the low prices is better than not having health insurance and going to good  going to the doctor at all because as my partner explained in fairly strong detail not having health insurance is dangerous its terrible nobody wants to have it and people are right not to want it  youve got to remember the proposition here is beyond repair” so theyre not  thats not a claim about beyond repair thats a claim about something that might happen in the future that they can plausibly say will be  right so  right so the initial projections were  cbo said they guess about  million people would be in the exchanges by the end of the open enrollment period in march now the website was broken for the first few months that wasnt just people could enroll that means the whole outreach campaign that the administration its outside allies and in the insurers had planned to direct people to this website  which was broken  had to be put off so basically weve lost twothirds of the time to enroll people in the exchanges it was trying to enroll people in the exchanges that weve had october november december only december wasnt working yet  so in one third of the time theyve had available they did a whole two thirds of the target they were supposed to have in the exchanges they thought by the end of december they would have three million instead they have two million so that seems to be  i  heres one way to tie this together for years and years when you asked conservatives about national health reform they would say some horror story right they would say some man in canada walked  miles in snow and lost his feet because of the socialist horrors of canada to come to the freedom of america and everyone in britain has lost their teeth because of the nih   and all these you know weird kind of mix of anecdotes and halftruths those   that was what was like floating around out there and i think whats happened here is that all these horror stories simply migrated to the united states and now describe obamacare theyve kind of forgotten all about the horrors of socialized medicine and the way that they understood national health insurance in the other countries is now the way they understand national health insurance in the united states its a very partial anecdotal kind of slightly hysterical way well   you know i think its kind of self evident that this target date that weve heard from the other side of  are things better by january  is oddly irrelevant the first day that the law is actually in operation the point is to make a change over a series of years now the outreach campaign to the public is something that by definition just takes months and months and months and years and years and years to build up and no one envisioned that the law would reach its coverage target even under the best circumstances the first year and again the website responded so in  they lost twothirds of the available time so naturally youre just going to move back the target for the ramp up year youre going to hit it more slowly but nothing about that process changes the laws ability to fundamentally reach its goals in the coarse of time part of the law is working and youre saying this functional part of the law could  might have been tapped without obamacare but whether or not thats true its in the law no the law set out to do things to reform the cost structure of benefits to control costs and by all evidence its succeeding beyond the best expectations and  no i mean the law intended to do a lot of things it intended to cover people in a lot of ways covering people under  that was the way they covered people under  but controlling costs  what they decided to do was not have one big blunt force wave to hold down medical inflation they let thousand flowers bloom and change the infrastructure in a lot of ways and theres a lot of good evidence  its a big law with a lot  with two major goals accomplished in a bunch of different ways so were  i think where we lack the metrics is how many people had their plans with their private insurance plans cancelled thats what we dont know and thats the kind of negative sum in their ledger that theyre trying to say the law failed we dont really know that no one has the  but we do know whos signing up weve got very good metrics on that so do we know how many people are going in the exchanges how many people are going into medicaid what type of healthcare costs all those things can be measured and are being measured and theyre all very positive i would like to actually theres a huge amount of data it contradicts what the others are trying to say let me cite one two urban institute researchers published a study finding that the number of adults reporting that they skipped care because of high costs in massachusetts fell  percent to  percent for the first two years of the law so i think of all the things its trying to do is  quit  stop people who cant get healthcare because they cant afford it that was the main goal of the law and it succeeded all right there were a lot of cost reforms in the way that hospitals were compensated that happened before  right so instead of paying people based on more care  the more medicine you perform the more money you get  it changed the model where people get paid based on providing quality of care and actually in measurable ways of improving patients health so one way is it penalized hospitals that have high rates of infections because previously hospitals  if your patients get an infection thats a bonus for you they have to go back in the hospital and get treated again and you make more money so instead the law changed and saidno were going to penalize you if you have a high rate of infections” and the rate of infection has actually fallen theres a wide series of reforms like this changed the cost structure of american medicine and i think a lot of researchers have looked at this and concluded theyre actually working on changing the cost model and making people try to provide quality instead of just more and more care for more and more money let me let you in on a secret when we set up this debate back in the fall it was a while ago it looked like obamacare might really collapse the website was broken we didnt know when it would be fixed we didnt know if it would be fixed some people thought it would never be fixed it looks like its possible the law would actually not come into effect but now it has come into effect now were actually living the experience of this law so the position that was an outlandish and somewhat exaggerated fear three months ago is now kind of silly and i think if you look back into the history of libertarian antistatism in america theres a long tradition of these kinds of fear mongering predictions senators who were opposed to child labor laws a few years ago saying that children would refuse to do chores in their household ronald reagan sayingif we pass medicare the government will tell doctors they cant live here they cant live there and one day well look back at a day when we had freedom in america and wonder what happened to it so this is a constant recurring pattern social security all kinds of civil rights laws labor laws the american far right lives in terror of government and its ideologically understandable that they would oppose these laws but they translate this ideological terror into a series of verifiable predictions about what will happen if these laws come into effect and one day were going to look back at the kinds of predictions theyve been making about obamacare and those will go in the time capsule and theyll look just as silly as the predictions that were made by all these other reforms which is not to say that it works perfectly its not to say those other things that work perfectly believe me child labor was a big part of the economy a hundred years ago and when we banned it it actually imposed a lot of disruption and pain on people right now it seems obvious and back then it was really hard families lost an income but these changes did fundamentally work the market responded people responded and i think when we look back time well see that the people who were saying the law must fail were really just people who didnt agree with its
