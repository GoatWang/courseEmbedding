participants including feminist intellectual gloria steinem who was a firm believer in the veracity of recovered memories of satanic ritual abuse the members of the panel presented for the first time in a public professional forum a skeptical viewpoint concerning sra reports the panel cast doubt on the corroborating evidence for the thousands of claims from patients in treatment that they were recovering memories of childhood abuse at the hands of persons often family members who were members of satanic cults such satanic cults were claimed to be intergenerational in families and had been abusing and ritually sacrificing children in secret for almost  years when american psychiatrists published purported historical evidence supporting these beliefs in the peerreviewed journal

all too many clinicians and law enforcement officials also share was the first unambiguous skepticism of the moral panic to be published in a medical journal noll continued his public skepticism elsewhere nolls  panel presentation was an elaboration of this earlier published critique other members of the  conference panel were anthropologist sherrill mulhern and psychiatrist george ganaway noll’s participation on the panel was viewed by sra believers as part of a deliberate disinformation campaign by frank putnam who was skeptical of the reality of satanic cults this set putnam apart from other prominent american psychiatrists who were less critical such as conference organizer bennett g braun a member of the dissociative disorders work group for the american psychiatric associations diagnostic manual dsmiiir  according to an account based on interviews conference attendees characterized noll as a professional expendable who had no idea he was being used through him

therapeutic community a minority joined them in refusing to believe sacrificial murder was going on the majority still believed their patients accounts psychiatric times published nolls memoir of the  conference online on  december  however after a week online the article was removed by the editors without explanation the backstory to this controversial editorial decision was explored in blog posts

editorinchief of dsmiv  and who led the dsmiv task force during the height of the satanic ritual abuse moral panic formally apologized for his public silence during that era and explained his reasons for keeping mpd as dissociative identity disorder in dsmiv despite his belief it was a purely iatrogenic idiom of distress on  march  the psychiatric times reposted nolls retracted article under a different title and with text deletions selected by the editors along with the article was commentaries by three american psychiatrists who were discussed in the article as well a response from noll allen frances added additional comments reproducing his blog posts from other websites the controversy drew to a close in august  with two letters to the editors of psychiatric times in response to an article by psychologist and attorney r christopher barden who sharply criticized noll for failing to address the repressedrecovered memory controversy and the fact that legal challenges in the courts

professionalscholarly book in psychology from the association of american publishers for his book the jung cult origins of a charismatic movement the resulting controversy over the book made frontpage headlines worldwide including a frontpage report in the  june  issue of the new york times princeton university press submitted the jung cult to the pulitzer prize competition that year without success the background to the controversy over nolls research on jung can be found in the preface of the new edition of the jung cult published in paperback by free press paperbacks in  and in an article he wrote for a random house inc promotional publication at random in that same year an august  interview with noll added new details at the urging of the jung family and estate princeton university press cancelled the publication of a second book edited by noll which had already made it into final page proofs form mysteria jung and the ancient mysteries selections from the writings of cg jung isbn  a pdf of the page proofs containing only nolls contributions to the book is available online a summary of his controversial conclusions was outlined in a short piece in the times higher education supplement on  november  noll also summarized his views in a  october  interview by terry gross on nprs fresh air in his intellectual history of the th century historian peter watson noted that nolls books provoked a controversy no less bitter than the one over freud     frederick crews lauded the jung cult as an important study noll was praised for his groundbreaking analyses of jungs life and work by cultural historian wouter hanegraaff in his comprehensive  study of new age religion in a recent work noting the absence of any reference to nolls scholarship on jung in the publications of prominent jung historians in the decade after the backlash to noll ended after  hanegraaff remarked unfortunately nolls historical scholarship is simply discarded along with the cult thesis     this absence has also been noted by other critics of nolls work according to an article by sara corbett the holy grail of the unconscious published in the new york times magazine on sunday  september  the jung familys fear of the specter of richard noll was cited as a contributing factor in the decision to allow jungs red book to be edited and published by ww norton in october  the most significant academic criticism of nolls scholarship and conclusions came from the historian of psychology sonu shamdasani in his  book cult fictions shamdasani disputed the attribution and interpretation of a central item of documentary evidence adduced by noll and also challenged the claim that jung established a cult however documents deposited by noll in  in the cummings center for the history of psychology in akron ohio reveal that prior to the publication of nolls book in september  shamdasani and john kerr held nearly identical views to nolls concerning the cult hypothesis the importance of jungs deification experiences and the interpretation of the contested document as authored by jung shamdasanis letter to noll of  july  and princeton university press editor eric rohmanns fax to shamdasani dated  march  in the cummings archives document this we cannot ask richard to remove this document simply because you have also read it and interpreted it as being what richard presents it as ie the inaugural address at the zurich psychological club wrote rohmann to shamdasani  further critics emerged among jungs family jungian analysts and others who were selfidentified jungians franz jung the son of the psychoanalyst reportedly told a german journalist that nolls work was mist bullshit in  anthony stevens jungian analyst added an afterword to the second edition of his book on jung entitled jungs adversary richard noll using the term adversary as an allusion to the biblical satan stevens wrote that it was necessary to counter the gravest of richard nolls charges because i believe    he has been so effective in promoting his ideas that there is a danger that they will enter public consciousness as received wisdom and tarnish jungs memory and the whole tradition of psychotherapy practiced in his name in a video of a  classroom lecture on jung posted on you tube university of toronto professor and clinical psychologist jordan peterson characterized noll as crooked he also incorrectly accused noll of deliberately using nazi imagery on the cover of his books to gain economic utility when in fact no nazi images appear in nolls books after noll left comments on the two websites hosting this video in which he pointed out petersons factual and interpretive errors peterson apologized in a  interview the noted jungian analyst and archetypal psychologist james hillman was asked by interviewer cliff bostock what he thought of nolls books on jung i hate them hillman replied i think hes a shit criticism of american psychiatryedit he was an early public critic of the american psychiatric profession’s complicity in the moral panic of the late s and early s concerning satanic ritual abuse except for the work of very few mentalhealth professionals such as psychologist richard noll and psychiatrists george k ganaway and frank w putnam what little psychiatric writing has emerged on survivors and their therapy has uncritically embraced the literal truth of survivors claims at the invitation of psychiatrist and researcher frank putnam then the chief of the dissociative disorders unit at the national institute of mental health noll was one of four members on a plenary session panel that opened the th international conference on multiple personalitydissociative states in chicago on  november  in a ballroom filled with television cameras and more than  conference participants including feminist intellectual gloria steinem who was a firm believer in the veracity of recovered memories of satanic ritual abuse the members of the panel presented for the first time in a public professional forum a skeptical viewpoint concerning sra reports the panel cast doubt on the corroborating evidence for the thousands of claims from patients in treatment that they were recovering memories of childhood abuse at the hands of persons often family members who were members of satanic cults such satanic cults were claimed to be intergenerational in families and had been abusing and ritually sacrificing children in secret for almost  years when american psychiatrists published purported historical evidence supporting these beliefs in the peerreviewed journal dissociation in march  noll challenged their extraordinary claims in a subsequent issue his december  conclusion that sra beliefs were a modern version of a paranoid mass delusion  and one in which all too many clinicians and law enforcement officials also share was the first unambiguous skepticism of the moral panic to be published in a medical journal noll continued his public skepticism elsewhere nolls  panel presentation was an elaboration of this earlier published critique other members of the  conference panel were anthropologist sherrill mulhern and psychiatrist george ganaway noll’s participation on the panel was viewed by sra believers as part of a deliberate disinformation campaign by frank putnam who was skeptical of the reality of satanic cults this set putnam apart from other prominent american psychiatrists who were less critical such as conference organizer bennett g braun a member of the dissociative disorders work group for the american psychiatric associations diagnostic manual dsmiiir  according to an account based on interviews conference attendees characterized noll as a professional expendable who had no idea he was being used through him they contended putnam could cast doubt on the contentious issue of linking mpd to ritual abuse however nolls skeptical

professionalscholarly book in psychology from the association of american publishers for his book the jung cult origins of a charismatic movement the resulting controversy over the book made frontpage headlines worldwide including a frontpage report in the  june  issue of the new york times princeton university press submitted the jung cult to the pulitzer prize competition that year without success the background to the controversy over nolls research on jung can be found in the preface of the new edition of the jung cult published in paperback by free press paperbacks in  and in an article he wrote for a random house inc promotional publication at random in that same year an august  interview with noll added new details at the urging of the jung family and estate princeton university press cancelled the publication of a second book edited by noll which had already made it into final page proofs form mysteria jung and the ancient mysteries selections from the writings of cg jung isbn  a pdf of the page proofs containing only nolls contributions to the book is available online a summary of his controversial conclusions was outlined in a short piece in the times higher education supplement on  november  noll also summarized his views in a  october  interview by terry gross on nprs fresh air in his intellectual history of the th century historian peter watson noted that nolls books provoked a controversy no less bitter than the one over freud     frederick crews lauded the jung cult as an important study noll was praised for his groundbreaking analyses of jungs life and work by cultural historian wouter hanegraaff in his comprehensive  study of new age religion in a recent work noting the absence of any reference to nolls scholarship on jung in the publications of prominent jung historians in the decade after the backlash to noll ended after  hanegraaff remarked unfortunately nolls historical scholarship is simply discarded along with the cult thesis     this absence has also been noted by other critics of nolls work according to an article by sara corbett the holy grail of the unconscious published in the new york times magazine on sunday  september  the jung familys fear of the specter of richard noll was cited as a contributing factor in the decision to allow jungs red book to be edited and published by ww norton in october  the most significant academic criticism of nolls scholarship and conclusions came from the historian of psychology sonu shamdasani in his  book cult fictions shamdasani disputed the attribution and interpretation of a central item of documentary evidence adduced by noll and also challenged the claim that jung established a cult however documents deposited by noll in  in the cummings center for the history of psychology in akron ohio reveal that prior to the publication of nolls book in september  shamdasani and john kerr held nearly identical views to nolls concerning the cult hypothesis the importance of jungs deification experiences and the interpretation of the contested document as authored by jung shamdasanis letter to noll of  july  and princeton university press editor eric rohmanns fax to shamdasani dated  march  in the cummings archives document this we cannot ask richard to remove this document simply because you have also read it and interpreted it as being what richard presents it as ie the inaugural address at the zurich psychological club wrote rohmann to shamdasani  further critics emerged among jungs family jungian analysts and others who were selfidentified jungians franz jung the son of the psychoanalyst reportedly told a german journalist that nolls work was mist bullshit in  anthony stevens jungian analyst added an afterword to the second edition of his book on jung entitled jungs adversary richard noll using the term adversary as an allusion to the biblical satan stevens wrote that it was necessary to counter the gravest of richard nolls charges because i believe    he has been so effective in promoting his ideas that there is a danger that they will enter public consciousness as received wisdom and tarnish jungs memory and the whole tradition of psychotherapy practiced in his name in a video of a  classroom lecture on jung posted on you tube university of toronto professor and clinical psychologist jordan peterson characterized noll as crooked he also incorrectly accused noll of deliberately using nazi imagery on the cover of his books to gain economic utility when in fact no nazi images appear in nolls books after noll left comments on the two websites hosting this video in which he pointed out petersons factual and interpretive errors peterson apologized in a  interview the noted jungian analyst and archetypal psychologist james hillman was asked by interviewer cliff bostock what he thought of nolls books on jung i hate them hillman replied i think hes a shit criticism of american psychiatryedit he was an early public critic of the american psychiatric profession’s complicity in the moral panic of the late s and early s concerning satanic ritual abuse except for the work of very few mentalhealth professionals such as psychologist richard noll and psychiatrists george k ganaway and frank w putnam what little psychiatric writing has emerged on survivors and their therapy has uncritically embraced the literal truth of survivors claims at the invitation of psychiatrist and researcher frank putnam then the chief of the dissociative disorders unit at the national institute of mental health noll was one of four members on a plenary session panel that opened the th international conference on multiple personalitydissociative states in chicago on  november  in a ballroom filled with television cameras and more than  conference participants including feminist intellectual gloria steinem who was a firm believer in the veracity of recovered memories of satanic ritual abuse the members of the panel presented for the first time in a public professional forum a skeptical viewpoint concerning sra reports the panel cast doubt on the corroborating evidence for the thousands of claims from patients in treatment that they were recovering memories of childhood abuse at the hands of persons often family members who were members of satanic cults such satanic cults were claimed to be intergenerational in families and had been abusing and ritually sacrificing children in secret for almost  years when american psychiatrists published purported historical evidence supporting these beliefs in the peerreviewed journal dissociation in march  noll challenged their extraordinary claims in a subsequent issue his december  conclusion that sra beliefs were a modern version of a paranoid mass delusion  and one in which all too many clinicians and law enforcement officials also share was the first unambiguous skepticism of the moral panic to be published in a medical journal noll continued his public skepticism elsewhere nolls  panel presentation was an elaboration of this earlier published critique other members of the  conference panel were anthropologist sherrill mulhern and psychiatrist george ganaway noll’s participation on the panel was viewed by sra believers as part of a deliberate disinformation campaign by frank putnam who was skeptical of the reality of satanic cults this set putnam apart from other prominent american psychiatrists who were less critical such as conference organizer bennett g braun a member of the dissociative disorders work group for the american psychiatric associations diagnostic manual dsmiiir  according to an account based on interviews conference attendees characterized noll as a professional expendable who had no idea he was being used through him they contended putnam could cast doubt on the contentious issue of linking mpd to ritual abuse however nolls skeptical presentation did have an effect mulhern and noll cut a line through the therapeutic community a minority joined them in refusing to believe sacrificial murder was going on the majority still believed their patients accounts psychiatric times published nolls memoir of the  conference online on  december  however after a week online the article was removed by the editors without explanation the backstory to this controversial editorial decision was explored in blog posts by the author gary greenberg and psychiatrist and psychoanalyst john mickey nardo the pdf of the published article is available on the web prompted by nolls article psychiatrist allen frances who was editorinchief of dsmiv  and who led the dsmiv task force during the height of the satanic ritual abuse moral panic formally apologized for his public silence during that era and explained his reasons for keeping mpd as dissociative identity disorder in dsmiv despite his belief it was a purely iatrogenic idiom of distress on  march  the psychiatric times reposted nolls retracted article under a different title and with text deletions selected by the editors along with the article was commentaries by three american psychiatrists who were discussed in the article as well a response from noll allen frances added additional comments reproducing his blog posts from other websites the controversy drew to a close in august  with two letters to the editors of psychiatric times in response to an article by psychologist and attorney r christopher barden who sharply criticized noll for failing to address the repressedrecovered memory controversy and the fact that legal challenges in the courts effectively ended the ability of mental health professionals to perpetuate the moral panic anthropological fieldworkedit chuonnasuan the last shaman of the oroqen in  richard noll and his colleague from ohio state university anthropologist kun shi explored manchuria just south of the amur river the natural

was provided in a  article in current anthropology which examined the ethnographic literature on shamanism from the perspective of cognitive science tanya luhrmann the watkins university professor of anthropology at stanford university lauded nolls  article as a novel turning point in the anthropological study of religion in june  noll and canadian psychologist leonard george of capilano

george delivered presentations to the institute of philosophy of the mongolian academy of sciences in ulaanbaatar at the invitation of chuluunbaatar gelegpil mongolias minister of education and

historical account of nosology said a reviewer in the american journal of psychiatry according to sociologist andrew scull in the journal of american history richard nolls american madness is an important book that deserves a wide readership among those interested in understanding the development of american psychiatry between  and the s in a september  review in isis historian john c burnham noted it is clearly written and is based on a remarkably thorough literature search and reading of primary sources    nolls book will become a useful narrative for much of the modern history of psychiatry in the united states he further added the research and thinking that went into this book make it refreshing and valuable collaborative scientific research on schizophreniaedit since  noll has occasionally collaborated with an interdisciplinary group of schizophrenia researchers at the bahn laboratory at the university of cambridge uk and the erasmus medical center in rotterdam the netherlands their research program seeks to identify valid biomarkers that might serve as molecular endophenotypes of schizophrenia and become the basis of a valid biological diagnostic test for

professionalscholarly book in psychology from the association of american publishers for his book the jung cult origins of a charismatic movement the resulting controversy over the book made frontpage headlines worldwide including a frontpage report in the  june  issue of the new york times princeton university press submitted the jung cult to the pulitzer prize competition that year without success the background to the controversy over nolls research on jung can be found in the preface of the new edition of the jung cult published in paperback by free press paperbacks in  and in an article he wrote for a random house inc promotional publication at random in that same year an august  interview with noll added new details at the urging of the jung family and estate princeton university press cancelled the publication of a second book edited by noll which had already made it into final page proofs form mysteria jung and the ancient mysteries selections from the writings of cg jung isbn  a pdf of the page proofs containing only nolls contributions to the book is available online a summary of his controversial conclusions was outlined in a short piece in the times higher education supplement on  november  noll also summarized his views in a  october  interview by terry gross on nprs fresh air in his intellectual history of the th century historian peter watson noted that nolls books provoked a controversy no less bitter than the one over freud     frederick crews lauded the jung cult as an important study noll was praised for his groundbreaking analyses of jungs life and work by cultural historian wouter hanegraaff in his comprehensive  study of new age religion in a recent work noting the absence of any reference to nolls scholarship on jung in the publications of prominent jung historians in the decade after the backlash to noll ended after  hanegraaff remarked unfortunately nolls historical scholarship is simply discarded along with the cult thesis     this absence has also been noted by other critics of nolls work according to an article by sara corbett the holy grail of the unconscious published in the new york times magazine on sunday  september  the jung familys fear of the specter of richard noll was cited as a contributing factor in the decision to allow jungs red book to be edited and published by ww norton in october  the most significant academic criticism of nolls scholarship and conclusions came from the historian of psychology sonu shamdasani in his  book cult fictions shamdasani disputed the attribution and interpretation of a central item of documentary evidence adduced by noll and also challenged the claim that jung established a cult however documents deposited by noll in  in the cummings center for the history of psychology in akron ohio reveal that prior to the publication of nolls book in september  shamdasani and john kerr held nearly identical views to nolls concerning the cult hypothesis the importance of jungs deification experiences and the interpretation of the contested document as authored by jung shamdasanis letter to noll of  july  and princeton university press editor eric rohmanns fax to shamdasani dated  march  in the cummings archives document this we cannot ask richard to remove this document simply because you have also read it and interpreted it as being what richard presents it as ie the inaugural address at the zurich psychological club wrote rohmann to shamdasani  further critics emerged among jungs family jungian analysts and others who were selfidentified jungians franz jung the son of the psychoanalyst reportedly told a german journalist that nolls work was mist bullshit in  anthony stevens jungian analyst added an afterword to the second edition of his book on jung entitled jungs adversary richard noll using the term adversary as an allusion to the biblical satan stevens wrote that it was necessary to counter the gravest of richard nolls charges because i believe    he has been so effective in promoting his ideas that there is a danger that they will enter public consciousness as received wisdom and tarnish jungs memory and the whole tradition of psychotherapy practiced in his name in a video of a  classroom lecture on jung posted on you tube university of toronto professor and clinical psychologist jordan peterson characterized noll as crooked he also incorrectly accused noll of deliberately using nazi imagery on the cover of his books to gain economic utility when in fact no nazi images appear in nolls books after noll left comments on the two websites hosting this video in which he pointed out petersons factual and interpretive errors peterson apologized in a  interview the noted jungian analyst and archetypal psychologist james hillman was asked by interviewer cliff bostock what he thought of nolls books on jung i hate them hillman replied i think hes a shit criticism of american psychiatryedit he was an early public critic of the american psychiatric profession’s complicity in the moral panic of the late s and early s concerning satanic ritual abuse except for the work of very few mentalhealth professionals such as psychologist richard noll and psychiatrists george k ganaway and frank w putnam what little psychiatric writing has emerged on survivors and their therapy has uncritically embraced the literal truth of survivors claims at the invitation of psychiatrist and researcher frank putnam then the chief of the dissociative disorders unit at the national institute of mental health noll was one of four members on a plenary session panel that opened the th international conference on multiple personalitydissociative states in chicago on  november  in a ballroom filled with television cameras and more than  conference participants including feminist intellectual gloria steinem who was a firm believer in the veracity of recovered memories of satanic ritual abuse the members of the panel presented for the first time in a public professional forum a skeptical viewpoint concerning sra reports the panel cast doubt on the corroborating evidence for the thousands of claims from patients in treatment that they were recovering memories of childhood abuse at the hands of persons often family members who were members of satanic cults such satanic cults were claimed to be intergenerational in families and had been abusing and ritually sacrificing children in secret for almost  years when american psychiatrists published purported historical evidence supporting these beliefs in the peerreviewed journal dissociation in march  noll challenged their extraordinary claims in a subsequent issue his december  conclusion that sra beliefs were a modern version of a paranoid mass delusion  and one in which all too many clinicians and law enforcement officials also share was the first unambiguous skepticism of the moral panic to be published in a medical journal noll continued his public skepticism elsewhere nolls  panel presentation was an elaboration of this earlier published critique other members of the  conference panel were anthropologist sherrill mulhern and psychiatrist george ganaway noll’s participation on the panel was viewed by sra believers as part of a deliberate disinformation campaign by frank putnam who was skeptical of the reality of satanic cults this set putnam apart from other prominent american psychiatrists who were less critical such as conference organizer bennett g braun a member of the dissociative disorders work group for the american psychiatric associations diagnostic manual dsmiiir  according to an account based on interviews conference attendees characterized noll as a professional expendable who had no idea he was being used through him they contended putnam could cast doubt on the contentious issue of linking mpd to ritual abuse however nolls skeptical presentation did have an effect mulhern and noll cut a line through the therapeutic community a minority joined them in refusing to believe sacrificial murder was going on the majority still believed their patients accounts psychiatric times published nolls memoir of the  conference online on  december  however after a week online the article was removed by the editors without explanation the backstory to this controversial editorial decision was explored in blog posts by the author gary greenberg and psychiatrist and psychoanalyst john mickey nardo the pdf of the published article is available on the web prompted by nolls article psychiatrist allen frances who was editorinchief of dsmiv  and who led the dsmiv task force during the height of the satanic ritual abuse moral panic formally apologized for his public silence during that era and explained his reasons for keeping mpd as dissociative identity disorder in dsmiv despite his belief it was a purely iatrogenic idiom of distress on  march  the psychiatric times reposted nolls retracted article under a different title and with text deletions selected by the editors along with the article was commentaries by three american psychiatrists who were discussed in the article as well a response from noll allen frances added additional comments reproducing his blog posts from other websites the controversy drew to a close in august  with two letters to the editors of psychiatric times in response to an article by psychologist and attorney r christopher barden who sharply criticized noll for failing to address the repressedrecovered memory controversy and the fact that legal challenges in the courts effectively ended the ability of mental health professionals to perpetuate the moral panic anthropological fieldworkedit chuonnasuan the last shaman of the oroqen in  richard noll and his colleague from ohio state university anthropologist kun shi explored manchuria just south of the amur river the natural border with russian siberia and inner mongolia and interviewed the last living tungus siberian shamans who had openly practiced prior to being forced to abandon their nomadic life and spirits after

of the solon ewenki shamaness dular ao yun hua born  appeared in the journal shaman in    the wennergren foundation supported the fieldwork that produced these reports the rationale for the research was provided in a  article in current anthropology which examined the ethnographic literature on shamanism from the perspective of cognitive science tanya luhrmann the watkins university professor of anthropology at stanford university lauded nolls  article as a novel turning point in the anthropological study of religion in june  noll and canadian psychologist leonard george of capilano university conducted fieldwork in mongolia and observed the practices of shamans and buddhist lamas who follow the tibetan vadrayana tradition and practice visualization meditations both noll and george delivered presentations to the institute of philosophy of the mongolian academy of sciences in ulaanbaatar at the invitation of chuluunbaatar gelegpil mongolias minister of education and

incorporated findings from american madness in its print and online timeline on the history of schizophrenia tales of personal drama enliven nolls story in a way that few would imagine possible for a historical account of nosology said a reviewer in the american journal of psychiatry according to sociologist andrew scull in the journal of american history richard nolls american madness is an important book that deserves a wide readership among those interested in understanding the development of american psychiatry between  and the s in a september  review in isis historian john c burnham noted it is clearly written and is based on a remarkably thorough literature search and reading of primary sources    nolls book will become a useful narrative for much of the modern history of psychiatry in the united states he further added the research and thinking that went into this book make it refreshing and valuable collaborative scientific research on schizophreniaedit since  noll has occasionally collaborated with an interdisciplinary group of schizophrenia researchers at the bahn laboratory at the university of cambridge uk and the erasmus medical center in rotterdam the netherlands their research program seeks to identify valid biomarkers that might serve as molecular endophenotypes of schizophrenia and become the basis of a valid biological diagnostic test for

this bookabout the authorsreviewstable of contents in  there was not a single case of dementia praecox reported in the united states by  there were tens of thousands of people with this diagnosis locked up in asylums hospitals and jails by  it was fading away how could such a terrible disease be discovered affect so many lives and then turn out to be something else in vivid detail richard noll describes how the discovery of this mysterious disorder gave hope to the overworked asylum doctors that they could at last explain—though they could not cure—the miserable patients surrounding them the story of dementia praecox and its eventual replacement by the new concept of schizophrenia also reveals how asylum physicians fought for their own respectability if what they were observing was a disease then this biological reality was amenable to scientific research in the early twentieth century dementia praecox was psychiatry’s key into an increasingly sciencefocused medical profession but for the moment nothing could be done to help the sufferers when the concept of schizophrenia offered a fresh understanding of this disorder and hope for a cure psychiatry abandoned the old disease for the new in this dramatic story of a vanished diagnosis noll shows the codependency between a disease and the scientific status of the profession that treats it the ghost of dementia praecox haunts
