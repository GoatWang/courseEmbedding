summary of some of these risks see the section entitled “item a risk factors” in the company’s most recent annual report on form k filed with the us securities and exchange commission for a discussion of the risks which should be considered in connection with your investment we have a limited operating history which makes our future performance difficult to predict all of our executive officers are also officers managers or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in our advisor new york city advisors llc our advisor and other entities affiliated with ar global investments llc the successor business to ar capital llc ar global as a result our executive officers our advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest including significant conflicts created by our advisor’s compensation arrangements with us and other investor entities advised by ar global affiliates and conflicts in allocating time among these entities and us which could negatively impact our operating results we depend on tenants for our revenue and accordingly our revenue is dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants we may not be able to achieve our rental rate objectives on new and renewal leases and our expenses could be greater which may impact operations our properties may be adversely affected by economic cycles and risks inherent to the new york metropolitan statistical area msa especially new york city we are obligated to pay fees which may be substantial to our advisor and its affiliates we may fail to continue to qualify to be treated as a real estate investment trust for united states federal income tax purposes reit because investment opportunities that are suitable for us may also be suitable for other ar globaladvised programs or investors our advisor and its affiliates may face conflicts of interest relating to the purchase of properties and other investments and such conflicts may not be resolved in our favor meaning that we could invest in less attractive assets which could reduce the investment return to our stockholders no public market currently exists or may ever exist for shares of our common stock and our shares are and may continue to be illiquid our stockholders are limited in their ability to sell their shares pursuant to our share repurchase program the srp and may have to hold their shares for an indefinite period of time if we and our advisor are unable to find suitable investments then we may not be able to achieve our investment objectives or pay distributions with cash flows from operations increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and limit our ability to pay distributions we do not expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund distributions at our current level and there can be no assurance we will be able to continue paying cash distributions at our current level or at all we may be deemed to be an investment company under the investment

is the difference between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first
