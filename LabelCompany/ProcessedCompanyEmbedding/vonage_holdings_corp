early adopter i guess you would call it i started an internet–based company in the s and was drawn to the technology that vonage seemed to pioneer and being in the technology industry i’ve always thought technology is most effective when you don’t even know it’s there what i like best about vonage is that i don’t even think about it anymore i don’t worry about the quality i don’t worry about the call i don’t worry about the price as our lives get more complicated we need these things that we don’t have to think about and vonage has become that for me nick p i have had to use vonage to call throughout the entire us just about every state i have had to make a phone call to or receive a call from because of my job but i still want to keep my mobile phone number private which was difficult before vonage came along but now with vonage i am free to conduct my business and still can keep my phone number protected jose o i am originally from lima peru but my mom and i have been in the us over  years my sister is still there and my mom has lots of friends and family still in peru my mom was spending a lot of money on calling cards until i told her there is this app from vonage and you can have it in your phone so i put the extensions app on her phone and she is saving a lot this way i also have extensions on my mobile phone when i travel abroad my sister also sent her kids to school in the us and she was spending a lot of money calling them so i sent her a vonage box and she was able to keep in touch with them which has made her very happy vincent f when we moved my wife and i knew we had to switch phone services we discussed getting a new number but it’s very inconvenient you have to notify everyone—and not everyone is going to receive the notification so when we switched to vonage they let us keep our number and lo and behold a couple years after moving i got a phone call from an old highschool buddy we were on the wrestling team together he calls me only every  or  years if we had changed our number i may not have gotten that phone call vikram s i came to the us a few years ago for a career opportunity and moved seven or eight times since then—virginia massachusetts new york and finally new jersey we had to keep updating our family in india with a new number every time we moved then i signed up for vonage and got to keep my number i have been with vonage for more than seven years and it’s been primarily because of how easy it is to take my number and my service with me when i move tools to help you decide keep your phone number do you want to keep your current phone number let’s check if your current phone number can be used for your new vonage service good news we will be able to transfer the phone number to your new vonage

submitted reviews  vonage review by whichvoip if you are considering vonage for your home phone service you have reached the right place vonage is a popular welladvertised voip service that was founded in edison new jersey during the early s with service extending to canada and the united kingdom in successive years vonage has had discrepancies in the past regarding user cancellation and advertisements involving free services since then however vonage has undergone several changes in business and advertising practices in its th quarter financial report that was released in february  vonage states that it has almost  million subscribers maintaining its position as one of the largest voip providers in the usa the good vonage offers a  day money back guarantee that covers monthly charges taxes and any shipping or activation fees this guarantee combined with a low introductory rate creates a welcoming offer for those who want to try the service out before committing long term standard features are included with all plans such as call transfer call waiting way calling caller id caller id block and vonage extensions which allows plans to be used from mobile phones voicemail can also be accessed from any phone or pc premium features are also available such as virtual numbers fax lines additional phone lines toll free lines and softphone a quick note on vonage caller id by default your outgoing caller id has a  character limit and it tries to use your last name and first initial if for some reason you choose to perform caller id block dial  it will block your vonage caller id and instead use anonymous these days this is frowned upon and many providers use anonymous call block so your call will not get through to its intended recipient the world plan is a very popular option for users that frequently make international calls due to its unlimited international calling to  countries feature the free vonage mobile app offers free video calling and video messaging for iphone and android users the app has received high ratings across both operating systems vonage is more accessible to customers than many other providers support is available via phone  hours a day  days a week with live chat support available through their website monday to sunday am to pm call quality is consistent for inbound and outbound domestic calls across all phone types and devices calls have generally been reported to be at landline or above sound quality the bad vonage is a popular service and has accumulated a good number of user reviews the majority of users on whichvoip reviewed vonage negatively and do not recommend the service to others with additional monthly fees and difficulties in resolving service issues being the primary complaint if a plan under contract is cancelled early a fee of up to  may be charged per voice line international phone calls have been reported to have lower sound quality than domestic calls the quality of international calls varies from country to country the bottom line vonage offers both nationwide and international residential plans each plan includes free activation free calling to other residential vonage customers the option to keep your current phone number or a new one and free shipping of the vonage box adapter with oneyear subscriptions if they prefer customers can sign up without committing to a oneyear contract us and canada unlimited plan  a month for the first  months after which the price increases to  a month although this is an unlimited plan there is a normal usage limit of  minutes per month after which minutes are billed at c a min us and canada  plan a oneyear agreement at  a month with free shipping and activation or a no annual contract option at the same  a month price without free shipping and activation this plan includes  minutes to landlines and mobiles within the us canada and puerto rico with additional minutes priced at  cents each and low rates within  other countries us and canada  plan a oneyear agreement at  a month with free shipping and activation or a no annual contract option at the same  a month price without free shipping and activation this plan includes  minutes to landlines and mobiles within the us canada and puerto rico with additional minutes priced at  cents and low international rates world plans  these include a regular world plan that has unlimited landline calling to  countries plus mobile phones in  countries the world plus plan is slightly more expensive but that plan adds  monthly minutes for calls to mobiles in  countries there is also a specific plan for those that are frequent callers to mexico or the philippines the mexico plan offers unlimited calling to both landlines and mobile phones in mexico and north america while the philippine plan provides  minutes of monthly calling to globe numbers in the philippines again remember that the unlimited calling is only unlimited up to the  minutes per month that are deemed to be within regular usage limits overall thoughts compared to other voip services with similar minute plans and features vonage is more expensive after the  month introductory rate expires while vonages business services are wellreviewed only  of the over  reviews on whichvoip recommend its residential service vonages strengths lie in its size which provides for a more stable and more accessible service to customers when compared to smaller voip providers if you plan on using a good number of minutes monthly at home or the home office the unlimited plans offer a cost effective solution while the world plans are a great option frequent international callers vonage overview whichvoip has amassed over  user submitted vonage reviews since it started covering vonage in  the extensive list below should be able to give you a full picture of what to expect if you sign up for the service whichvoip note  please check vonage reasonable usage policy for details of its requirements and limits around unlimited calling plans decent service and i am fairly happy customer service cant fix any problems all user reviews page  of  total number   thumbs up   thumbs down   average rating   more providers  vonage reviews are listed in chronological order beware    jul th   ladona recommended average ordering setup support quality reliability features value if you are looking for service through vonage plan to pay for the first month with no service i requested to have my number ported to them on june th and as of today july th i am still being told it will take  days for this to happen i have called every  days and get told the same thing every time i call when i ask to speak with a supervisor they totally ignore my request do not start this process if you can avoid it comment on this review  did not honor  rebate promise    jun th   lisa recommended average ordering setup support quality reliability features value i could give various ratings but there is no point because they have been dishonest with me i signed up for a christmas rebate then later after the minimum service period of  days plus a few weeks i couldnt get a valid number for customer service and their live chat wasnt working through emails they gave me the runaround about my rebate with no explanation of why they listed the status as  but invalid amount not verified then later invalid promotion expired since then emails have stated variously it has been under review needs further research and its in an escalation process its been several months now im confused because i dont see how a company can be legit and yet act like a scam furthermore one time i needed to call a local hospital quickly but the  service listed only animal hospitals with no way to try again or clarify comment on this review  false advertising    mar th   pamela recommended average ordering setup support quality reliability features value vonage practices false advertising i was enticed to get my phone services from them with a  visa card every time i have tried to use it is has been declined including paying for services from vonage i tried to resolve this using chat and i was told i needed to contact the number on the card that number only allows me to leave a message and purchase new services so i contacted vonage to disconnect my services and not only do i need to pay the remainder of the contract but to add insult to injury i cant use the visa card vonage gave me so again i say vonage has false advertising practices and i will not be continuing my phone services with vonage once the contract expires comment on this review  increasing competition and diminished value    mar th   m recommended average ordering setup support quality reliability features value ive been a vonage customer for over  years and they by and large provide good service and i like many of the features they offer especially extensions which lets you use their service on your mobile phone as with any service there are other options now on the market and they are more price competitive while vonage has increased rates for existing customers over the years it may be worth exploring other options comment on this review  price does not reflect additional fees    feb th   jacque recommended average ordering setup support quality reliability features value i still havent connected yet to the service as i am waiting for my number to switch over but i have received my first bill already i am suppose to get the service for  a month for the first year with the first month free but they tack another  on for so called surcharges taxes and fees i might just take advantage of my  day money back guarantee and give up the home phone altogether also i was charged from the first day i signed up even though my phone number isnt scheduled to be transferred for  days i feel like this is unfair trade practices it would have been nice if there were at least fine print that explained all of this stuff comment on this review  not a reliable phone system    feb th   randi recommended average ordering setup support quality reliability features value as a small business vonage has caused me to lose business because i cannot rely on the phones working daily constant dropped calls right now i cannot dial out on my office phone i call for a remedy and they tell me it is my server and then the very next day i get an email sent to all vonage customers explaining the reason for the very problem that they said was my server frustrating dropped calls and phone outages have definitely caused me to lose many orders i would advise everyone to reconsider before using vonage for a business especially if you take orders over the phone my worst choice for phone service ever comment on this review  great service    jan th   dena recommended average ordering setup support quality reliability features value i love vonage so much i would really recommend any one like family and friends to try it because it is the best phone service i ever had comment on this review  great features    jan th   yosef recommended average ordering setup support quality reliability features value i recently switched to vonage from a different voip provider i was impressed with the maturity of the vonage offering which includes an impressive array of features also the price was right a very good value comment on this review  very good service    jan th   sunil recommended average ordering setup support quality reliability features value i keep the vonage service because of its feature of international calling at reasonable rates i have had their service for a long time and i find this is the cheapest for me comment on this review  great service and reps    jan th   ernest recommended
