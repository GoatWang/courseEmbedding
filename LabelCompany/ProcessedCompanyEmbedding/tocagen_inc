publication of preclinical data in neurooncology from two independent research programs jun   tocagen inc announced the publication of preclinical data in neurooncology from two independent research programs which together detail proposed mechanisms of action for toca   toca fc involving direct tumor killing and activation of the immune system against cancer cells the papers were published in the july issue of neurooncology which appeared in print on june   and were featured on the cover and highlighted in an editorial the articles first appeared online on april   in the article titled toca  gene transfer and treatment with the prodrug fluorocytosine promotes durable antitumor immunity in a mouse glioma model mitchell et al monitored and characterized immune cell populations in the tumor microenvironment in mouse models of brain cancer over the course of treatment with toca  and fc the active component of the toca fc tablets used in humans results showed treatmentinduced loss of immune cell subsets that have been shown to contribute to the suppression of normal immune activity against cancer cells including reduction of tumor associated macrophages myeloidderived suppressor cells and tumor associated monocytes  depletion of immunesuppressive myeloid cells was followed by increases in cd and cd t cells which correlated with tumor reduction mice that cleared tumors following treatment with toca  and fc were protected against rechallenge with the same tumor type furthermore successful adoptive cell transfer experiments using isolated immune cells from successfully treated animals confirmed antitumor immune responses were t celldependent in the article titled retroviral replicating vectormediated gene therapy achieves longterm control of tumor recurrence and leads to durable anticancer immunity hiraoka and inagaki et al performed molecular imaging of immunedeficient and immunecompetent mouse models of brain cancer following treatment with toca  and cycles of fc these studies were performed in the laboratory of noriyuki kasahara md phd professor of cell biology and pathology at the university of miami while longterm survival benefit was seen in both models tumor was undetectable in immunecompetent mice after three cycles of fc in contrast immunedeficient mice required continuous treatment with cycles of fc for longterm survival benefit and tumor recurrence was still evident between cycles after clearance of tumors in immunecompetent mice by treatment with toca  and fc longterm protection against future challenge with the same tumor type was seen longterm immune memory against the tumor was lost upon depletion of t cell subsets indicating a t celldependent antitumor immune response the complementary findings reported in these publications demonstrate that antitumor immune effects are tcell dependent and correlate with depletion of immunesuppressive myeloid cells toca   toca fc is in clinical development for the treatment of recurrent high grade glioma or hgg a type of brain cancer tocagen has completed enrollment of the phase  portion of a phase  clinical trial and plans to report topline results of the
