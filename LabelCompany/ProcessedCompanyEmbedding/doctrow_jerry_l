over to ms debra cafaro chairman president and ceo of the company debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks rick good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants and welcome to our second quarter  earnings call i am pleased to be joined in chicago by my ventas colleagues ventass balance sheet and operations are continuing to perform well despite the sobering conditions in the financial economic and housing market we are finding selected healthcare investment opportunities of manageable size from the credit list dislocation that should provide our shareholders with excellent risk adjusted returns and we are maintaining our full year normalized ffo guidance of  to  per diluted share for the quarter our earnings were excellent and our liquidity position and balance sheet remain exceptionally strong today well discuss our earning portfolio performance and expectations for the balance of the year after rick schweinhart reports on our financial results well be happy to take your questions this quarter normalized ffo per share was  a  increase over the first quarter during the quarter we sold assets that generated a gain of over  million we also reached an agreement to sell five senior housing assets in a transaction that will likewise result in a gain on sale the pending sale price of  million represents an attractive cap rate of  on operator ebitdar at the assets and our rents those transactions provide liquidity for us to recycle into attractive investment opportunities on the investment front we have recently made about  million of new investments these include a newly opened medical office building that was in lease up during the second quarter and should generate unlevered yields to ventas of over  and as we foreshadowed in prior conversations with you we also purchased two pieces of healthcare debt at a discount this quarter we are currently in an interesting investment market because debt returns which are safer than equity returns can exceed equity cap rate in certain selected situations this is principally due to the desire by lenders to sell debt securities even when the debt is excellent quality well secured and high performing so this inversion of normal investment metrics makes us interested in buying or originating limited amounts of health care debt because we believe it can provide our shareholders with the superior risk adjusted return our goal is to make manageable multiple investments in quality health care operating companies where we believe we are in safe capital structure collateral and repayment position with that as background this quarter we purchased  million principal amount of debt in skilled nursing provider manor care for a substantial discount the loan piece we acquired is secured by a first mortgage on  assets and represent  loan to value on those assets so it is very secure with great cash flow coverage of over three and a half times the unlevered yield to maturity is  basis points over libor likewise we purchased  million principal amount of corporate debt in hca a premier national hospital company for less than  million this hca investment should produce unlevered yields to maturity of over  please note that we are not trying to time a bottom or trade debt securities rather we are averaging into a dislocated debt market in a measured way in companies and assets we understand and know working with motivated sellers of the debt and taking advantage of opportunities we seek to produce superior risk adjusted returns for our shareholders turning to a portfolio review our triplenet lease assets continued to perform well the ventas triplenet lease portfolio is stable and secure with solid occupancies and cash flow to rent coverages across the spectrum at independent living assisted living skilled nursing facilities and hospitals our triplenet lease portfolio of  assets accounts for  of our revenues and  of our noi a particular note kindred just reported an excellent second quarter to follow its great first one kindreds management deserves a lot of credit for operating the company so well and focusing on quality care for patients it is also very gratifying to see that kindred and ventas can succeed at the same time which is a goal both management teams have worked long and hard to accomplish specifically reporting on our  kindred healthcare assets the cash flow coverages at our four kindred master leases are excellent at  times kindreds full balance sheet stands behind its rent obligations to us and the combination of longterm acute care hospitals with skilled nursing assets in our master leases provides additional reliability to our forward cash flows in may our kindred annual rent increased by  million or  as an additional benefit to our kindred portfolio cms recently announced that the skilled nursing care providers will receive a  rate increase for fiscal year  which begins october   obviously this is a positive development for both kindred and ventas all in all then we are quite pleased with our diversified triplenet lease portfolio which is delivering steady reliable growing cash flow from a variety of tenant operators and asset types next i would like to discuss our operating portfolio our  sunrise assets and our medical office buildings provides a granular highly diversified revenue streams in our portfolio because we received the benefit of noi in these assets overtime they should also give us a lift in earnings and a classic real estate inflation hedge we first want to review our sunrise portfolio which is principally composed of needbased mansion style assisted living communities developed by sunrise these communities account for  of our revenue and  of our total noi the headline is that these  high quality private paid senior living communities are producing solid results in a difficult market during the first half of the year total community noi exceeded  million our pool of stable sunrise asset now consist of  communities for those  stable sunrise communities second quarter  average daily rate was up  yearoveryear and essentially flat sequentially occupancy debt in q  from  to  in the stable portfolio we are currently seeing a modest uptick in occupancies in our stable communities during july we are encouraged by this upward trend but it is too soon to determine whether the trend will continue for the second half of the year we also have five new sunrise communities leased up including the large independent living asset in toronto known as steeles importantly these five leased up communities we owned for the full first and second quarter of  showed excellent second quarter results noi increased in these five assets by  in the second quarter to  million versus  million dollars in the first quarter breaking out the four us mansion assisted living communities in leased up pool these four communities showed a sequential occupancy increase of  percentage points going to  in the second quarter versus  in the first our new steeles independent living community in toronto which is in early stage leased up is progressing nicely the community is  occupied within one year of opening consistent with our earlier projections we expect this asset to be cash flow positive by late  and to stabilize in mid to late  so to sum up sunrise the first half noi performance of our  communities is generally tracking our expectations occupancies were lower in the second quarter due to general economic conditions but shows signs of improvement and we are looking toward a generally consistent noi performance from the portfolio in the second half of the year assuming stable economic conditions if our communities produce that results  sunrise noi will fall within the  million to  million of guidance we provided at the beginning of the year touching briefly on the medical office building portion of our portfolio it contributed about  million of noi to ventas during the second quarter of  and average occupancies have increased sequentially our medical office building portfolio accounts for  of our revenue and about  of our noi it includes  assets mostly on campus containing approximately  million square feet on the investment front we continue to see plenty of opportunities large and small across the spectrum of healthcare and senior housing real estate we are being selective in determining what to invest in when to invest and what to pay we are being patient while asset level pricing debt costs and operating fundamentals come into focus among other things the medical office building joint venture we discussed last quarter is producing identified development opportunities that we are currently underwriting we remain committed to a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility in  we expect to make selected additional investments during the second half of the year to continue to move the company forward and create value for our shareholders our goal remains to provide our shareholders with consistent superior return in the context of a sustainable profitable and low risk enterprise with that ill be happy to turn the call over to rick for the review of our financial results and then well open the call for questions thank you richard a schweinhart  executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you debbie second quarter  normalized ffo per diluted share was  compared to  in last years second quarter and  in the first quarter of  second quarter results were better than the first quarter mainly due to improved triplenet lease revenue due to escalations improved sunrise noi well developed by decreases in property level of expenses our  million lease termination payment fee increases in loans receivable and investment income less interest expense slightly offset by higher ga and increased share count due to our february equity rates second quarter fad per diluted share were  compared to  in last year second quarter and  in the first quarter normalized ffo this quarter totaled  million compared to  million in the second quarter of last year and  million in the first quarter of this year normalized ffo and earnings are reported after deducting minority interest normalized ffo for the second and first quarters of  and the second quarter of  exclude the net benefit of  million  million and  million respectively of income tax benefits and merger related items normalized ffo increased  million from last years second quarter recently due to acquisitions revenue increased  million of that  million was due to rent increases and  million due to sunrise properties resident rental and services fees normalized ffo increased  million from the first quarter of  revenues increased  million with resident rental and services fees basically flat and rent escalations in mob revenues accounting for the increase sunrise property level expenses totaled  million for the second quarter and  million for the first half of the year second quarter expenses benefited from property level expense credits and expense reconciliations such as property taxes insurance and corporate allocations interest expense was essentially flat with the second quarter of  interest expense decreased  from the first quarter of  due to repayment of debt our second quarter effective interest rate of  improved slightly from  in the second quarter of  and was flat with first quarter of  general administrative and professional fees including stockbased compensation for the second quarter of  totaled  million consistent with our expectation of  million to  million annually on february   we issued  million common shares producing net proceeds to the company of  million as a result weighted average diluted shares grew to  million in the second quarter up from  million shares in the first quarter of  we currently have  million outstanding on our  million revolving credit agreement and unused capacity of over  million our debt to total capitalization is excellent at  at quarter end and our net debt to pro forma ebitda is  times our guidance for  remains between  and  per share our key assumptions remain the same the total sunrise noi from our  assets range from a  million to  million and sga extends approximately  million to  million our guidance does not include other unannounced acquisition or divesture activity our second quarter showed stable growing results and we look forward to continued stability and modest growth during the balance of  operator we will now take questions question and answer operator operator instructions and the first question comes from the line of michael bilerman from citi you may proceed sir david toti  citigroup hi this is david toti here debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer welcome david toti  citigroup thank you couple of questions around the balance sheet what you believe is your sort of maximum capacity or appetite for structured finance portfolio at the top end debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer are you asking us what our capacity is or our appetite for making investments in debt david toti  citigroup yes basically if you are buying debt pieces and pieces of the capital structure how do you see that portfolios popping out or maturing raymond j lewis  executive vice president and chief investment officer hi david this is ray lewis i think as debbie mentioned in her opening remarks we think there is a good opportunity in the market right now to generate good risk adjusted returns for our shareholders by investing in debt that having been said i mean it will always be a relatively small portion of our portfolio and i dont foresee us really having any more than say  of our total value in a debt portfolio at any one point in time david toti  citigroup okay are there loan loss reserves established for these debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer we are really at the leading edge of this program and so as required we would establish reserves but at this present time there are none david toti  citigroup okay and then im just sort of moving over to sort of a transaction environment are you seeing an increase in sort of distressed opportunities across respect from of investment areas debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer i mean the areas the healthcare areas that we participate in skilled nursing hospitals independent and assisted living and medical office by and large are showing good defensive characteristics and are generally performing quite well so there are very limited if any distressed opportunities in our sector unlike some of the more classic commercial real estate basis david toti  citigroup okay yes that was my expectation as well and just a sought of a detail question relative to some of the debt that you purchased i think it was the  million piece that appears to have a higher yield than some of the debt that was structured in the same transaction thats lower in the capital structure can you provide some color on that debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer we can i mean again i think we are trying to be patient about our acquisition opportunities although again not timing the market just waiting to see when we can buy manageable slices of what we believe are really secure debt pieces at returns that we think are attractive the market changes everyday in these securities and so we are trying to make intelligent manageable investment david toti  citigroup great thanks for the color i will get back in the queue thank you debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer okay david thanks operator and the next question comes from the line of karin ford from keybanc capital markets you may proceed karin ford  keybanc capital markets hi good morning first just a question on sunrise you mentioned that you have some expense declines there and the margin improved quite a bit sequentially is that a trend or is that just a onetime event that happened in the quarter debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer well the way we are looking at it karin is that we are sort of expecting a full year of noi to be in this sort of  to  range and so we would expect that margins would go back to a more normalized level in the second half karin ford  keybanc capital markets okay fair enough second question is on the guidance you had a good quarter you had the lease termination fee and you made some pretty attractive investments just curious to why you left guidance the same and what if anything offset some of the positive things that may have moved guidance somewhere upward debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer well the reason that we kept guidance the same is that we are trying to give the market our best expectation of where the year is going to out as it always is and thats really the range where we expect our earnings in ffo to come in and in terms of if we expect a sort comparable second half from sunrise to the first half and we had already included in our guidance originally the investment of about  million cash that we had on hand so it would really take additional investments to kind of move the needle and if we find those and then that will be great and we will advice the market at that time karin ford  keybanc capital markets okay fair enough final question the credit statistics that you gave on the mortgaged debt investment was really helpful do you have similar or any type of credit type indications you can give us on the hca debt debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer we can i mean those are corporate bonds so its different a little bit little animal ph but in terms of the company hca itself they have interest coverage of over two times and theyre about six times levered so theyre doing quite well and obviously the premier hospital company in the nation so we feel good about that as well karin ford  keybanc capital markets okay thanks very much debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you karin operator and our next question comes from the line of rob mains from morgan keegan you may proceed robert m mains  morgan keegan  co yes excuse me thanks good morning i just a follow up on the question on sunrise noi could you either i dont know if you can quantify or just give a little bit more depth into what went into the expense reductions or i guess those were reductions but kind of reverse those in the quarter debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer sure i think rick touched on those they are basically things like property taxes insurance and so on robert m mains  morgan keegan  co what happened was that they were closed or were reversed what exactly caused the expense to go down debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer well again basically as we told when we acquired the portfolio we expect the quarters to be lumpy and we are really looking at this portfolio and the noi performance over the course of the year and so basically we are expecting sort of we had  million noi sort of first half and then we are expecting sort of a comparable second half on the noi line robert m mains  morgan keegan  co right i understand i just wonder if this seasonal pattern we should be looking or is this kind of like debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer no i mean again i think its expected lumpiness and i think youll see sort of revenues and expenses both trend a little higher in the second half robert m mains  morgan keegan  co okay fair enough thank you debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator and the next question comes from the line of rich anderson from bmo capital markets you may proceed richard c anderson  bmo capital markets yes thanks and good morning everybody debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer hi rich unidentified company representative hi rich richard c anderson  bmo capital markets in terms of reit do you now take the assets out of your trs and free up space there and if so is there any financial impact as a result of that debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer good question for those of you who are not reit geek like i am the idea is richard c anderson  bmo capital markets you are not calling me a geek are you debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer yes i called myself one richard c anderson  bmo capital markets okay debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer theidea is to build that would just pass to benefit the reit industry that had a number of positives in it among them the tax free subsidiary cap is raised from  to  of you total value and in addition there was healthcare prong up the statute that gives healthcare reits structuring benefit as we go forward and some more tax efficiency and planning and when we acquired sunrise we were able to do under existing law and in compliance with existing law but as rich alertly points out i think the idea will give us a benefit of moving some of the assets around internally to create a more tax efficient structure over the long term so we wont see any immediate financial impact but over a longer period of time it will result in more tax efficiency richard c anderson  bmo capital markets okay and just on the topic of sunrise you guys are really into the mansion product but can you comment about how the sunrise business is done across its different price points and where mansion might stack or some of the lower quality types of products raymond j lewis  executive vice president and chief investment officer sure rich this is ray i think that if youve listened to sunrises comments recently you will know that they are really refocusing their efforts on the mansion product going forward and i think that it speaks to the fact that is sort of the best product in their portfolio primarily because its a purpose built product around the sunrise operating model it tends to be the case of our portfolio it is located in high period entry infill locations and major metropolitan markets as the consequence you tend to see the mansion portfolio and if you look at ours as an example generating higher average daily rates performing a little bit better in absolute occupancy and so i think that speaks well to the quality of that product type relative to their other products richard c anderson  bmo capital markets okay a small one here but i think i saw this right that merger related costs even though its on your nominal measure normalized measure of ffo but it went up second quarter versus the first why did that happen and is there anyone to take from that debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer i can answer that quite simply in that line is our litigation costs rising out of the merger and so now that we are in full swing of discovery those costs are going up thats why richard c anderson  bmo capital markets you mentioned that your plans to sell five assets to a current tenant seems like you are not does that tenant does it start with the letter k debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer no no it doesnt but if you would like to buy a vallow ph no it doesnt it doesnt richard c anderson  bmo capital markets okay and then last is on medical office with  of the portfolio it really seems like this has been an area where you probably wanted to be bigger by this time in medical correct me if i am wrong on that but it just seems like that has been a part of the investment conversation for the past year or so and still pretty small percentage of the total are you sort of happy with this or are you frustrated that you are not just like say  of your business at medical office i mean can you comment on that on the environment and what sort of slowed it down raymond j lewis  executive vice president and chief investment officer well i think rich you are right i think if you to ask me a year ago i would have said we probably would be a little bigger than we are right now but we are being patient and we are focusing on opportunities that build important relationships that will help us to grow this portfolio in the future and more importantly focusing on doing deals that are going to make money for our shareholders so i am actually happy with where we are we have a number of good relationships that have led to multiple transactions we announced development deal in the first quarter we are making progress we are doing the things that we want to do and we are well positioned when we find those good opportunities to count on them so its a patient strategy im pleased with what we are doing and hopefully as we continue to execute the portfolio size will grow and profitability will follow richard c anderson  bmo capital markets okay and maybe just a quick followon what would you how would you quantify your existing dry powder today as we progress debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer well we saw it basically less than  million of spending on the revolver and the capacity there is  and in addition our credit stats are about five times debt to ebitda so that looks pretty good and has leverage capacity as well so i think we are in pretty good shape there richard c anderson  bmo capital markets so debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer i feel really good about the balance sheet and i continue to think that its going to be an important differentiator as we go through the rest of  richard c anderson  bmo capital markets so maybe over  billion of dry powder debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer  billion probably is a good estimate richard c anderson  bmo capital markets okay thank you debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator and the next question comes from line of jerry doctrow from stifel nicolaus you may proceed jerry l doctrow  stifel nicolaus  company good morning i just had a couple of things a lot has been covered i think on the sunrise relationship i was curious how are you are feeling about development whether we would expect you to buy any new deals in the second half debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer good question jerry as you know we have an exclusive right of first offer to acquire everything sunrise developed in canada and also in selected defined geographies around our us assets and we are thrilled about that and we continue to believe that sunrise is a great developer particularly of the mansion product it was interesting mark ordan said on sunrises call that capital is really in this environment asking for robust yields on development and we are looking at things with them and wed be happy to do developments that meet our return expectations and that we think will be good development so it is possible we will do some with sunrise going forward and i think highly likely although not necessarily within a specific narrow time period but i think its highly likely over time that we will partner with them on transaction jerry l doctrow  stifel nicolaus  company okay and youre right its not a certain fixed deal it just depends somewhat on market condition are debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer right we think that theyll develop some good asset over time and that well be able to participate in that for the benefit of our shareholders jerry l doctrow  stifel nicolaus  company okay and then just trs sort of coming back to that i mean you talked about restructuring the existing deal just any thoughts about how it my used go forward kind of things you would think about think about doing debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer well i mean yes the most important thing say though is that right here makes the healthcare reit just like lodging reit and neither healthcare reit nor lodging reits will be able to operate asset healthcare assets except through an independent eligible contract or as we do now with our sunrise relationship so we see this is as structuring advantage in deals were we might want to have the reit through the trs center into a management contract under the right circumstances but we believe in the model that we have as a healthcare reit and has offered investors and great risk reward proposition over the past ten years and so i dont expect riet exchanges really to result in material changes and how we operate our business but it does give us a little bit of structuring flexibility cap sufficiency which we would hope to use to good advantage over time jerry l doctrow  stifel nicolaus  company and the results didnt change i think in the international figments too and we definitely make something like chartwell potentially an easier acquisition both because of trs and some of the other things debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer we will let you study that one jerry l doctrow  stifel nicolaus  company but it makes reit operator deals potentially more likely is that fair to say raymond j lewis  executive vice president and chief investment officer what you mean by that jerry i just want to make sure jerry l doctrow  stifel nicolaus  company well you could acquire somebodys spinoff may be the manager in a private subsidy and capture upside debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer i mean we could sort of do that now i mean its a sort of a classic prob so up so cost structure is sort of for ventas jerry l doctrow  stifel nicolaus  company right raymond j lewis  executive vice president and chief investment officer which is where the assets are held debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer its where the assets are held and how the relationship between the two is structured is it a lease is it a how is it structured and jerry l doctrow  stifel nicolaus  company but using a line interest better because you can both share an income now which you couldnt really do before your share in bottom line debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer in appropriate circumstances jerry l doctrow  stifel nicolaus  company okay thats fine thanks debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator and you next question comes from the line of adam feinstein from lehman brothers you may proceed adam feinstein  lehman brothers okay thank you good morning debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer hey adam adam feinstein  lehman brothers just a few questions here i guess just in terms of future assets sales just in terms of your thoughts there i know you guys havent put an official number out for the year in terms of the asset sales but just what are your thoughts you just talked a little about your though process on buying assets but just curious in terms of selling off additional assets and then ive got a couple of followup questions debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer well we have been opportunistic in our asset sales program overtime and many of the sales not all but many of them have been to operators in sort of winwin arrangements with them and were not planning any kind of mass disposition over the balance of  but well continue to prove and improve the portfolio and hopefully do some opportunistic things but i dont think you should pencil in a huge amount or anything like that adam feinstein  lehman brothers okay all right and then just i just wanted to get your thoughts in terms of senior housing obviously a lot of noise out there with respect to occupancy rates and just the impact that the economy is having on the senior housing sector it sounds like your operators are still doing pretty well but just curious to get your thoughts there in terms of how you think about that and would you have an interest in taking down your exposure to senior housing in the future meaning to the extent you are going to put capital work would you be inclined to invest being away from senior housing could you do a big concentration there debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer well we believe in senior housing and we have most of our senior housing is in the triplenet leases and weve seen good solid continued performance in that portfolio with some impact from the economy in the housing market really at the margin but again in the triplenet lease structure is set up to expect operating changes and then on the sunrise front we have seen again good solid occupancies the higher acuity product is really need based and we do believe in the business and in the growth of the business over a long period of time i am going to turn it over to ray i think youll see us continue to grow in other areas as well as senior housing raymond j lewis  executive vice president and chief investment officer yes i mean i think just to add to what debbie is saying i think the senior housing space has by enlarge exhibited pretty good resiliency in this economy and as debbie particularly in the need driven assisted living area medical office continues to be attractive from an operating fundamental standpoint we are continuing to make investments there and allocate capital there when we find deals that are priced appropriately i think if we look at some of the other areas certainly skilled nursing has looked attractive recently and given the fact that reimbursements have been stable and improving over the near term and the fact that we still have a relatively modest exposure to that space thats attractive area for us and then you know on the hospital front we still think that over the long run there is going to be a need for a tremendous amount of capital there to upgrade the real estate and technology infrastructure and refinancing can be a source of capital to help the hospital space to do that so i wouldnt say there is any decrease in the appetite to seniors housing and we continue to be interactive in the other areas as well adam feinstein  lehman brothers okay thank you for the details great quarter debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator and the next question comes from the line of tayo okusanya from ubs you may proceed tayo okusanya  ubs yes good morning well between bob jerry and rich all my questions have been answered but congratulations on a great quarter raymond j lewis  executive vice president and chief investment officer thanks tayo debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you for joining tayo operator and the next question comes from the line of rosemary pugh from green street advisors you may proceed rosemary pugh  green street advisors thank you yes rosemary pugh speaking my first question is related to the triplenet senior housing portfolio i am particularly interested in how the independent living properties are performing in recent months and what your outlook is and i know you have talked about the portfolio in general but how much would you in your sensitivity analysis how much would occupancy need to drop before your cash flow coverage covenants are crossed debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer well the io is a small portion of our triplenet portfolio and weve seen again like relatively steady occupancies across ao and io and the triplenet maybe going down a percentage point over the last year or so and remember that in most of these cases and actually all of the cases all of the assets are combined in master leases with guarantees and so on and so we feel really good about the reliability of our cash flow rents in the triplenet portfolio going forward rosemary pugh  green street advisors okay and then related to the sunrise portfolio how are incentives such as free rents or waving of move in and community fees that counted for in the monthly rent numbers so when you calculate average daily rate on a same store basis is that including these sorts of concessions net of these raymond j lewis  executive vice president and chief investment officer hi rosemary this ray there is a number of factors that go into average daily rate one of which is equity of the residence mix obviously if you have people receiving more and higher levels of services on your average daily rate will vary upwards on that but with regards to targeted move in incentives we do have some of that in our portfolio to in selected communities to fill some vacant units its really geared around optimizing noi and making sure that we are leveraging the fixed overhead in the communities so there is some of that going on i wouldnt say its widespread rosemary pugh  green street advisors great thank you very much operator and the next question comes from the line of chris pike from merrill lynch you may proceed christopher pike  merrill lynch good morning everybody debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer hi chris christopher pike  merrill lynch hi good morning i guess you said you saw an uptick in the operating portfolio in july was that broad based or did you see any geographic focus i guess i am just trying to get a further read across occupancy and the relationship to housing and the economy debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer good i mean i think i will comment on that broadly and it does seem to be a relatively widespread phenomenon again its something that we are waiting to see whether its going to be a trend thats going to hold through the balance of the year but across operators really and across product types i think what we are seeing is the second quarter was softer than expected on occupancies and still trending down but then you did see in july some steady pickup and i think hcp said on its call yesterday that they had talked to a wide variety of operators and that that all of them had seen the same trend and so it doesnt appear to be in pockets it appears to be a broader base trend christopher pike  merrill lynch okay but debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer and the question is will it continue as we look through the balance of  christopher pike  merrill lynch okay but then once again with respect to your portfolio the sequential changes in q are really with respect to just the operating assets and like or similar to some of your peers any other say out trends or in off trends are really based upon q data because yes debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer the triplenet is always yes the triplenet always lags a quarter christopher pike  merrill lynch okay debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer but some other senior housing operators to our public had started to report and i think they are to the extent they are reporting theyve been saying similar things christopher pike  merrill lynch okay i guess following to richs question with respect to increase in merger costs relating to certain litigation efforts i guess and just from a reporting prospective because of you definition of normalized and the white paper version of ffo so if you were to be fruitful at any proceeds from your litigations efforts would that be stripped out of your defined normalized ffo being you are not including them at this point debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer welli would consider that as a high class problem and so i dont have any answer for you yet that will be yet to be determined christopher pike  merrill lynch okay debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer but its a good question we will give it some thought christopher pike  merrill lynch okay and i guess just lastly with respect to steeles and i dont know if you can really use this as a witness across lease up in general but i guess the way that i calculated maybe its like nine units or nine residents per month per quarter of lease up and thats pretty consistent q and q are there any attributes of those residents who are coming in that are either surprising or that are worth noting whether it be the age the equity maybe the time in terms of shopping and then finally signing is there anything there to draw conclusions from debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer a couple of comments i want to remind everyone steeles is independent living a very large asset its in toronto so we are happy to answer your questions but it may have limited applicability to other situations either in our portfolio or across the industry we had projected sort of nine or ten move ins as you point each month during the first year and then have that start leveling to a lower level over the next couple of years as we look towards stabilization in late  we did see with the with the regional head of canada recently the residents who are moving in are consistent with i think the sunrise a profile which is a higher income residence in the case of steeles healthier and interested in some of the programs that sunrise has there for healthy ageing and so on so again its kind of a unique situation that may not be we may not be able to have broad lessons to derive christopher pike  merrill lynch okay thanks a lot guys debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you chris raymond j lewis  executive vice president and chief investment officer thanks chris operator and the next question comes from the line of hank farris ph from liberty mutual you may proceed unidentified analyst hi thanks for taking my question you indicated as you talked about the investments unlevered returns so you are using leverage beyond the balance sheet on those investments debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer there is no balance sheet leverage unidentified analyst okay and how are sourcing those ideas debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer we have lots of relationship built up in healthcare and in finance over a very long periods of time and so many of them are just coming to us and we are fairly now a few unidentified analyst is there any intention or desire to use some of these investments strategically beyond sort of the debt of the companies you are investing in debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer this is not a loan to own strategy i want to be clear about that this is a desire to make safe investments with what we believe to be superior risk adjusted returns arising out of a dislocated debt market so hopefully that answers your question unidentified analyst okay and the piece of manor care that you bought thats the cmbs piece debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer its the first mortgage piece at about  loan to value unidentified analyst okay debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer it matures in january  i think unidentified analyst okay because there is operating company piece as well thats sort of much more distant from the assets raymond j lewis  executive vice president and chief investment officer thats right debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer right this is defiantly the mortgage first mortgage piece unidentified analyst okay great thank you debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator operator instructions our question is a followup question from michael bilerman from citi you may proceed david toti  citigroup hi its david again debbie this question is for you and i am not sure how far you want to sort of jump into this but could you talk a little bit about your thoughts on the potential  impact of shift towards democratic control debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer yes dave thats a good question we have found after doing fairly exhausted research that a change in administration has had little impact on the performance of the operators over time so republican or democratic it really hasnt had a major impact there are positives and negatives of both and so its hard to draw any macro conclusions if indeed there is a democratic administration david toti  citigroup great thats helpful thank you debra a cafaro  chairman president and chief executive officer all right we are glad to have you on board david and i want to thank everyone who joined todays call i know its been a long earning season and we really appreciate your interest in our company we hope you enjoy the rest of your summer and we look forward to
