links international investing what is currency hedging why hedge hedging strategies dynamic currency hedging strategy europe  international japan  korea what is currency hedging international investing provides many exciting opportunities to investors but these opportunities come with additional risks—one of which is currency fluctuations while currency can sometimes push equity returns higher it can often pull returns down—and these fluctuations are typically a source of uncertainty   currency hedging is a strategy designed to mitigate the impact of currency or foreign exchange fx risk on international investments returns popular methods for hedging currency are forward contracts spot contracts and foreign currency options   at wisdomtree we have been implementing currencyhedging strategies for the last five years—in a way that is likely simpler and more costeffective than many investors expect the bottom line is that currency hedging allows investors to participate more fully in the local equity returns of international markets mechanics of the currency hedge here is how currency hedging typically works at wisdomtree   the wisdomtree currency hedged equity family of funds implements wisdomtree’s currencyhedging strategies by entering into onemonth forward contracts each month and rebalancing at monthend  ordinary brokerage commissions apply why hedge foreign currencies   investors allocating to foreign stocks typically assume a secondary risk exposure from currency this risk is due to the difference between what the foreign currency is worth and what the dollar is worth this “currency bet” as some might call it can help increase total returns during periods when the euro yen and other foreign currencies are rising versus the dollar but it can also help reduce returns when those foreign currencies are falling in value we believe that investors who do not have strong opinions on the potential direction of a currency should hedge at least a portion of their exposure in that currency when it comes to hedging foreign currencies there are several myths out there let’s take a look at some of the most common myth  it is expensive to hedge foreign currencies typically it is only expensive to hedge foreign currencies that have much higher shortterm interest rates than the united states as is the case in brazil for example however the euro yen and british pound—which combine to represent almost threequarters of the weight of the msci eafe index a widely followed benchmark composed of companies representative of the developed market structure of  developed countries in europe australasia and japan —each has a very low cost to hedge as figure  shows in addition as us rates rise relative to rates in europe and japan dollarbased investors could be paid to hedge euro and yen exposure put another way it could become “expensive” for investors not to hedge their euro and yen exposure   source wisdomtree bloomberg with data as of  past performance is not indicative of future results myth  euro or yen exposure can be a good hedge against a declining us dollar the values of the euro and yen in essence do not make good hedges against us inflation rates or declining us dollar purchasing power what does make a potentially good hedge against inflation we believe that stocks representing claims on real assets andor those that have historically seen their dividends grow with inflation over time make better hedges against inflation as figure  shows dividend growth on the sp  index and msci eafe index kept better pace with—and often outpaced—cpi in periods of high inflation while currency returns did not   myth  currency returns are a wash in the long run one of the arguments we hear often is that due to a concept called purchasing power parity ppp currencies offer no expected return in the long run and are therefore a wash yet currencies tend to move in very long secular trends interestingly international equities actually saw their strongest returns during down currency trends as shown in figures a and b and when the currency is down that can detract from the returns unless investors hedge their currency exposure   source msci with data as of  past performance is not indicative of future results you cannot invest directly in an index     source msci with data as of  past performance is not indicative of future results you cannot invest directly in an index strategic  tactical hedging   the strength of the us dollar relative to currencies like the euro or the yen can erode international returns if left unhedged and some countries are pursuing monetary policies that may weaken the value of their currency additionally currency exposure can offer an added risk with little or no positive expected returns—something we’d call a source of “uncompensated risk” although this risk has long been seen as a “necessary evil” of international equity investing it doesn’t have to be   for investors with a negative outlook on a particular currency or more generally those who believe that the dollar is going to strengthen currency hedging is an important option as it can enable them to pursue the international equity market returns without a drag from foreign currency weakness strategic hedging for the long term when investing for the long term it may not make sense to simply accept the additional currency risk—unless investors have a deep conviction about the currency in question in fact as figure  shows over the short and long term currency adds a fair amount of volatility to investments and over the long term shown below hedging the currency would have lowered the volatility below that of the sp  tactical hedging for shortterm allocations currency can make a big difference—even in the short term in the abenomics period starting november   and ending september   the msci japan index returned —a decent return until it is compared to the wisdomtree japan hedged equity index which achieved a  return over the same timeframe the difference the wisdomtree index hedges the yen which lost  over the same period while the msci index does not   and there were similar results throughout europe where the wisdomtree europe hedged equity index returned  while the msci emu index lost  and the euro lost    why hedge dynamically   historical data confirms that currency volatility can impact international investments over short and longterm holding periods while currency hedging has obvious advantages some investors may not want the challenge of timing us dollar strength or weakness building on our expertise in currency hedging wisdomtree pioneered dynamic currency hedging an adaptive strategy suited for longterm investors concerned about the impact of currency fluctuations on international equity holdings   problem solving   many leave it to their active manager to make the hedgeno hedge decision but most of these managers typically specialize in stock selection not currencies dynamic hedging  can solve the challenge of trying to time when a currency hedge should be in place and thus could serve as a core longrun allocation  dynamic hedging may lower trading costs and increase tax efficiency when compared to a strategy that rotates between hedged and unhedged solutions   how is it achieved   wisdomtree partnered with record currency management a currency manager with over  years of experience to determine hedging signals for the new index family targeting profitable hedges the strategy targets mid to longterm excess returns by seeking greater exposure to hedges with expected profitability versus hedges that are expected to generate losses diversification by signal time horizon signals used to determine hedges interest rates

future results you cannot invest directly in an index europe  international currencyhedged funds   international investments should have a place in every portfolio and now may be an opportune time to add them   of course we believe that international equities tend to perform better when the us dollar is strengthening—and if history repeats we may be on the cusp of a prolonged period with a rising dollar and if the dollar is rising other currencies are often weakening hedging them can help to reduce volatility europe hedged equity family   the european central bank’s recent monetary easing

higher it can often pull returns down—and these fluctuations are typically a source of uncertainty   currency hedging is a strategy designed to mitigate the impact of currency or foreign exchange fx risk on international investments returns popular methods for hedging currency are forward contracts spot contracts and foreign currency options   at wisdomtree we have been implementing currencyhedging strategies for the last five years—in a way that is likely simpler and more costeffective than many investors expect the bottom line is that currency hedging allows investors to participate more fully in the local equity returns of international markets mechanics of the currency hedge here is how currency hedging typically works at wisdomtree   the wisdomtree currency hedged equity family of funds implements wisdomtree’s currencyhedging strategies by entering into onemonth forward contracts each month and rebalancing at monthend  ordinary brokerage commissions apply why hedge foreign currencies   investors allocating to foreign stocks typically assume a secondary risk exposure from currency this risk is due to the difference between what the foreign currency is worth and what the dollar is worth this “currency bet” as some might call it can help increase total returns during periods when the euro yen and other foreign currencies are rising versus the dollar but it can also help reduce returns when those foreign currencies are falling in value we believe that investors who do not have strong opinions on the potential direction of a currency should hedge at least a portion of their exposure in that currency when it comes to hedging foreign currencies there are several myths out there let’s take a look at some of the most common myth  it is expensive to hedge foreign currencies typically it is only expensive to hedge foreign currencies that have much higher shortterm interest rates than the united states as is the case in brazil for example however the euro yen and british pound—which combine to represent almost threequarters of the weight of the msci eafe index a widely followed benchmark composed of companies representative of the developed market structure of  developed countries in europe australasia and japan —each has a very low cost to hedge as figure  shows in addition as us rates rise relative to rates in europe and japan dollarbased investors could be paid to hedge euro and yen exposure put another way it could become “expensive” for investors not to hedge their euro and yen exposure   source wisdomtree bloomberg with data as of  past performance is not indicative of future results myth  euro or yen exposure can be a good hedge against a declining us dollar the values of the euro and yen in essence do not make good hedges against us inflation rates or declining us dollar purchasing power what does make a potentially good hedge against inflation we believe that stocks representing claims on real assets andor those that have historically seen their dividends grow with inflation over time make better hedges against inflation as figure  shows dividend growth on the sp  index and msci eafe index kept better pace with—and often outpaced—cpi in periods of high inflation while currency returns did not   myth  currency returns are a wash in the long run one of the arguments we hear often is that due to a concept called purchasing power parity ppp currencies offer no expected return in the long run and are therefore a wash yet currencies tend to move in very long secular trends interestingly international equities actually saw their strongest returns during down currency trends as shown in figures a and b and when the currency is down that can detract from the returns unless investors hedge their currency exposure   source msci with data as of  past performance is not indicative of future results you cannot invest directly in an index     source msci with data as of  past performance is not indicative of future results you cannot invest directly in an index strategic  tactical hedging   the strength of the us dollar relative to currencies like the euro or the yen can erode international returns if left unhedged and some countries are pursuing monetary policies that may weaken the value of their currency additionally currency exposure can offer an added risk with little or no positive expected returns—something we’d call a source of “uncompensated risk” although this risk has long been seen as a “necessary evil” of international equity investing it doesn’t have to be   for investors with a negative outlook on a particular currency or more generally those who believe that the dollar is going to strengthen currency hedging is an important option as it can enable them to pursue the international equity market returns without a drag from foreign currency weakness strategic hedging for the long term when investing for the long term it may not make sense to simply accept the additional currency risk—unless investors have a deep conviction about the currency in question in fact as figure  shows over the short and long term currency adds a fair amount of volatility to investments and over the long term shown below hedging the currency would have lowered the volatility below that of the sp  tactical hedging for shortterm allocations currency can make a big difference—even in the short term in the abenomics period starting november   and ending september   the msci japan index returned —a decent return until it is compared to the wisdomtree japan hedged equity index which achieved a  return over the same timeframe the difference the wisdomtree index hedges the yen which lost  over the same period while the msci index does not   and there were similar results throughout europe where the wisdomtree europe hedged equity index returned  while the msci emu index lost  and the euro lost    why hedge dynamically   historical data confirms that currency volatility can impact international investments over short and longterm holding periods while currency hedging has obvious advantages some investors may not want the challenge of timing us dollar strength or weakness building on our expertise in currency hedging wisdomtree pioneered dynamic currency hedging an adaptive strategy suited for longterm investors concerned about the impact of currency fluctuations on international equity holdings   problem solving   many leave it to their active manager to make the hedgeno hedge decision but most of these managers typically specialize in stock selection not currencies dynamic hedging  can solve the challenge of trying to time when a currency hedge should be in place and thus could serve as a core longrun allocation  dynamic hedging may lower trading costs and increase tax efficiency when compared to a strategy that rotates between hedged and unhedged solutions   how is it achieved   wisdomtree partnered with record currency management a currency manager with over  years of experience to determine hedging signals for the new index family targeting profitable hedges the strategy targets mid to longterm excess returns by seeking greater exposure to hedges with expected profitability versus hedges that are expected to generate losses diversification by signal time horizon signals used to determine hedges interest rates

future results you cannot invest directly in an index europe  international currencyhedged funds   international investments should have a place in every portfolio and now may be an opportune time to add them   of course we believe that international equities tend to perform better when the us dollar is strengthening—and if history repeats we may be on the cusp of a prolonged period with a rising dollar and if the dollar is rising other currencies are often weakening hedging them can help to reduce volatility europe hedged equity family   the european central bank’s recent monetary easing
