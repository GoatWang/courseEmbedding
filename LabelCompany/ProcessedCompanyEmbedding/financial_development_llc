measurement protecting customers financial inclusion poor and low income people lead extremely complex financial lives portfolios of the poor vividly shows this by letting us into the homes of  families across three countries through financial diariesthis study and subsequent ones showed that finance currently mostly informal is useful to fulfill multiple objectives and aspirations some are daily shortterm and mundaneâput food on the table or renew stock for petty trading activities for this access to finance helps to smooth the often highly irregular income streams of the poor another need is to build some resilience to the shocks that life invariably brings so financial tools that help with risk management such as insurance are important enabling families to build assets for investment in the home businesses or human capital is another common use of finance and access to finance can help foster peace of mind allowing people to plan for the futurewith such a variety of evolving needs over the life of a client it is clear that one rigid product cannot respond to them all and yet with some important exceptions the main offer of microfinance to date has been microcreditdeveloping a broader range of quality transparent and affordable financial servicesâinformed by client needsâis an imperative of financial inclusion today the g national policymakers providers and donors all agree that people should have access to savings payments credit and insuranceensuring the availability of a broader range of products is not just good for clients it can also be good for the financial service providers responding to client needs with the right range of products will help ensure that providers can deepen their client relationships broaden market share grow responsibly and reduce their own riskthe need for a diverse range of products is not new but most providers have taken a long time to move beyond a single simple credit product many financial service providers have built their business model around a credit offering rather than exploring ways to offer a full set of services that their clients would find useful over time new ways of thinking about the business case for a diverse offering to low income clients are needed one study showed that savings can be profitable for microfinance institutions if they make deposit services part of a broader offeringthere are at least three core requirements to unleashing innovations in product developmentincentives management and boards of directors are often reluctant to invest in research and development when the core business is still growing incentives from investors for growth and high returns often within a shorttime frame can also stymie innovation and risk appetite running a business while innovating may be hard but it is essential for any business to surviveorganizational capacity the relative lack of innovation on products is not just an issue of incentive capacity is also needed integrating systematic ways to listen to and learn from clients to inform product development must be a priority for providers and it requires management buyin though this can be done inhouse the culture and skills needed to run the current business are often different from the entrepreneurial mindset needed to source and act on client insights one option is to bring in an outside firm to conduct market research and provide insights and ideas for products leveraging the expertise of specialists can bring fresh perspective and be highly effective another approach entails establishing product innovation labs or committees within a financial service provider that run as independent entitiesregulatory environment besides the issues of organizational capacity and incentives new product development can also be greatly affected by local regulations in some markets there is either a legal vacuum high barriers to entry or express restriction to offering diverse services for example in many parts of the middle east north africa and south asia microfinance providers are prohibited from mobilizing deposits for product innovation to flourish the regulatory environment must

new product development process for services industries differs from manufactured goods in more ways than the obvious differences in end products and for the financial services industry there are additional challenges beyond the minimal requirements of innovation for example merrill lynch altered the competitive landscape of the then heavily regulated banking and securities industries through the innovation of cash management accounts cmas merrill lynch saw a market opportunity for integrating all of a customers assets ie checking savings and brokerage under one umbrella they created a solution that met customer needs while complying with the complex regulatory standards of the day today many financial services institutions offer cma services but only merrill lynch reaped the rewards of first mover advantage creating offers that change the industry landscape is both an art and a science creating and maintaining competitive advantage in todays more challenging conditions requires vision innovation and a strong business process management solution companies have discovered many additional opportunities since merrills innovationâvariable rate mortgages open end and closed end mutual funds as well as hedge venture and derivative fundsâbut its not often that we see inventions of the cma magnitude after all if it were easy everyone would do it having business processes in place that enable you to take advantage of these opportunities and be the first to market is a powerful competitive weapon Â Â Â Â Â  recently the market has experienced two additional offers poised to change the competitive landscape in the same revolutionary way that merrill lynchs cmas did the first is by swiss reinsurance with managereinsurance swiss res global renewal application is a crosscorporate industry operating system that creates a seamless negotiation process between insurers swiss reinsurance and third party propertycasualty experts it is the first time that complex multiparty agreements among multiple companies have been brought together into a single unified process the second is from a subsidiary of halifax plc intelligent finance for integrated assets and liabilities management intelligent finance the fastest growing bank in the united kingdom and likely all of europe has discovered a way to create additional value for its customers and become a major player in the financial services industry by taking merrill lynchs cma concept to the next level and offering integrated asset and liability management the banks solution allows customers to fully use all credits from asset accounts against all debits from liability accounts thus for many intelligent finance customers their monthly interest credits fully pay for their monthly mortgage swiss reinsurances managereinsurance and intelligent finances integrated assets and liabilities management are core processes that are transforming the industry and giving their respective organizations significant competitive advantage both are experiencing rapid gains in market share because of their innovations and the processes they use to turn ideas into recurring actions that benefit customers its not surprising then given actions unique ability to enable companies to manage their complex high value decisionprocesses that require negotiation commitment and flexibility that both solutions are managed by actionworks companies attempt to create competitive advantage in many ways new product development is one of them in finance new product development is the orchestrated effort to invent the new offer gain regulatory approval implement the systems and finally establish the business processes that enable a company to deliver this value to its customersâwhile being faster to market than the competition and at costs lower than copycat firms while the responsibility for creating new offers may reside with a particular group within a financial services organization it requires the coordinated effort of nearly every department across the organization eg customers suppliers and marketing legal analysis services and other departments actionworks links the hundreds of people who need to plan invent negotiate and commit new product development process flows seamlessly from the institution to suppliers and customers from department to department and from person to

african development bank afdb group seeks to further the social and economic wellbeing of its regional member countries to attain this objective the bank uses the leverageÂ  afforded by its aaa rating to onlend to its borrower countries at favorable terms resources raised in international capital markets up until  only one loan product the multicurrency variable rate loan vlr was offered by the bank the shift to a more dynamic multiproduct institution that took place that year was predicated on the desire to increase flexibility and choice the bankâs lending environment was made more responsive to the borrower countriesâ varied and evolving needs with the introduction of single currency loans borrowers were given the option to choose from a number of currencies readily available to the bank including the south african rand along with three interest rate bases since  the afdb offers its borrowers flexibility to customize their debt repayment profile with access to annuities stepup or stepdown amortization of principal or bullet repayment these features enable sophisticated borrowers to profile their loans to fit their specific needs flexibility and freedom of choice
