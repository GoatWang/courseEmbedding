independent experts from edison electric institute ecologo the pge food service technology center and energy star to help advise them in the programs development “we firmly believe that a group of individuals going  percent of the way to make a change to promote sustainable practices is better than just a few individuals making  percent effort change can be made on a small level but can have a very powerful impact if done in aggregate” says steve kurtz vice president at fsw “energy star’s guidance has been integral to the development of the cgck program to promote this type of collective effort” for more information on fsws products and environmental efforts visit wwwfoodservicewarehousecom and wwwcgckorg back to the top  energy star partners awarded  best in class from fes in

marketing tool all stakeholders and program participants have committed to follow the programs identity guidelines and should request clarification whenever necessary cfs product offerings are developed to meet the complex demands of commercial kitchen operations consequently many cfs manufacturers develop a variety of models under a single product family but do not always qualify the entire family of models eg a ’ griddle but not the ’ version a standard depth convection oven but not the bakery depth equivalent in this situation clearly differentiated marketing is essential when a single specification sheet is used for a series of models where not all of the models have been energy star qualified partners must provide a clear easytofind statement to specify which model variations are or are not energy star qualified the full energy star brand book document along with the brief guidelines to using the energy star marks correctly document can be accessed at
