an early user of deinkling pulp and was amongst the first in the us to accept singlesource recycling materials this moves some of the recycling work from the recyclers thus cutting their costs in exchange for a stronger market position and lower raw prices however snowflake mill was stuck with a raw product flow which contain contaminants such as plastic and metals elk fall mills was shut down on  november  in addition to falling demand for newsprint the mill increasingly failed to secure sufficient virgin fiber as the mill used sawdust rather than woodchips as its source material the  recession caused a steep drop in demand for building materials causing at least three of the main sawdust suppliers to elk fall mill to shut down this was made worse by increasing power prices and a strengthening of the canadian dollar especially after  china started buying large quantities of old newsprint from north america particularly from the west coast in addition to causing a shortage in recycled paper the exports caused a steep increase in the prices combined with reduced demand for newsprint catalyst decided to curtail production at paper machine  from  december  the following year

chair number of employees  website catalystpapercom catalyst paper corporation is a pulp and paper company based in the canadian city of richmond british columbia it operates five pulp mills and paper mills producing a combined  million tonnes of paper and  tonnes of market pulp annually the mills mostly produce magazine paper and newsprint the company was established as norskecanada in  when norske skog bought the majority of fletcher challenge canada with elk falls mill and crofton mill the following year pacifica papers operating port alberni mill and powell river mill was merged into the group a recycling plant in coquitlam was bought in  the group took the catalyst name in  and the following year norske skog sold their shares snowflake mill was bought in  but in the following two years the elk falls coquitlam and one machine at crofton were shut down snowflake followed suit in  the reason was falling demand for newsprint and increased cost of recycled paper catalyst reentered us production in  with the purchase of biron mill and rumford mill contents  history  background  norskecanada  internationalization  operations  mills  references  bibliography historyedit backgroundedit port alberni mill in  catalysts canadian mills date back to  when powell river mill was established by the powell river paper company bloedel stewart and welch established port alberni mill in  merging to create macmillan bloedel in  they merged with the powell river paper company in  the mill assets were spun off to create pacifica papers in  crown zellerbach canada established elk falls mill in  british columbia forest products bcfp founded in  established crofton mill in  new zealands fletcher challenge acquired crown zellerbach canada in  changing its name to crown forest industries six years later it also bought bcfp changing the canadian divisions name to fletcher challenge canada norskecanadaedit norskecanada had its origins in the  purchase of fletcher challenge pulp and paper by norske skog the latter had not been particularly interested in entering the north american market but fletcher challenge had offered its assets as an all or nothing deal this included its  percent share in fletcher challenge canada which owned elk falls mill and crofton mill the annual meeting in fletcher challenge canada approved with  percent of the votes on  october  to take the name norske skog canada ltd at the time the company had nok  billion in cash which it paid in dividends to the owners powell river mill norske skog considered both selling its shares in norskecanada or developing the company further the latter was chosen resulting in norskecanada purchasing pacifica papers on  august  giving it control over port alberni mill and powell river mill two months previously pacifica papers had sold mackenzie mill the pacifica papers acquisition was funded through the issuing of new shares diluting norske skogs ownership to  percent more new shares were issued in may  reducing norske skogs ownership further to  percent unlike the rest of the group norske skog lacked the direct control over the assets in canada ceo russ horner was part of norske skogs corporate executive board until the share was diluted from then the two companies were legally regarded as competitors and the two were not allowed for cooperate closely for instance through joint sales offices crofton mill the company acquired newtech recycling of coquitlam in december  western canadas first and largest paper recycling plant was bought to vertically integrate a source of deinked paper the acquisition was partially paid for in cash partially in shares the site handled  tonnes of old newsprint from british columbia and alberta as well as more remote sources predominantly minnesota and kansas city shipped by train to coquitlam once deinkled the pulp was sent by barge to crofton mill by  norskecanada had operated with a deficit in  of  quarters and norske skog started considering its options for the company pöyry was hired to consider the operations and concluded that the mills were not competitive for export to asia a prime target market for norske skog the paper particularly emphasized inefficient mill designs which subsequently led to higher operating costs the first step was taken in october  when the general meeting approved the new name catalyst paper to signal that the group was leaving norske skog the norwegian group sold its  percent of catalyst for  million in a bought deal on  january  at the time catalysts four mills made it north americas fourthlargest producer of printing papers with an annual production of two million tonnes of paper and half a million tonnes of kraft pulp train on the apache railway used to transport old newsprint and coal to and newsprint from the snowflake mill internationalizationedit catalysts first us investment was snowflake mill which was acquired in  catalyst took steps to upgrade the mill including investments to allow the plant to produce finer grades of paper snowflake was an early user of deinkling pulp and was amongst the first in the us to accept singlesource recycling materials this moves some of the recycling work from the recyclers thus cutting their costs in exchange for a stronger market position and lower raw prices however snowflake mill was stuck with a raw product flow which contain contaminants such as plastic and metals elk fall mills was shut down on  november  in addition to falling demand for newsprint the mill increasingly failed to secure sufficient virgin fiber as the mill used sawdust rather than woodchips as its source material the  recession caused a steep drop in demand for building materials causing at least three of the main sawdust suppliers to elk fall mill to shut down this was made worse by increasing power prices and a strengthening of the canadian dollar especially after  china started buying large quantities of old newsprint from north america particularly from the west coast in addition to causing a shortage in recycled paper the exports caused a steep increase in the prices combined with reduced demand for newsprint catalyst decided to curtail production at paper machine  from  december  the following year the corporation decided to close the coquitlam plant and permanently terminate production at paper machine  in crofton rumford mill is situated on the androscoggin river from  snowflake fell into a steadily more competitive environment prices of recycled fibers rose with increased demand from chinese importers slack at quality controlling received papers at chinese mills allowed for the export of a steadily more contaminated wastes which again effected the quality and prices for snowflake this led to higher prices and lower quality for snowflake mill the price of old newsprint increased by  percent from  to   the mill was therefore permanently closed on  september  after having provided a negative ebidta every year since  as part of the verso corporation  acquisition of newpage us authorities required two mills to be sold catalyst therefore bought biron mill in biron wisconsin and rumford mill in rumford maine both produce coated paper allowing catalyst to expand its paper portfolio into finer grades the mills were bought for us million the deal led to a percent

changing its name to crown forest industries six years later it also bought bcfp changing the canadian divisions name to fletcher challenge canada norskecanadaedit norskecanada had its origins in the  purchase of fletcher challenge pulp and paper by norske skog the latter had not been particularly interested in entering the north american market but fletcher challenge had offered its assets as an all or nothing deal this included its  percent share in fletcher challenge canada which owned elk falls mill and crofton mill the annual meeting in fletcher challenge canada approved with  percent of the votes on  october  to take the name norske skog canada ltd at the time the company had nok  billion in cash which it paid in dividends to the owners powell river mill norske skog considered both selling its shares in norskecanada or developing the company further the latter was chosen resulting in norskecanada purchasing pacifica papers on  august  giving it control over port alberni mill and

quarters and norske skog started considering its options for the company pöyry was hired to consider the operations and concluded that the mills were not competitive for export to asia a prime target market for norske skog the paper particularly emphasized inefficient mill designs which subsequently led to higher operating costs the first step was taken in october  when the general meeting approved the new name catalyst paper to signal that the group was leaving norske skog the norwegian group sold its  percent of catalyst for  million in a bought deal on  january  at the time catalysts

to upgrade the mill including investments to allow the plant to produce finer grades of paper snowflake was an early user of deinkling pulp and was amongst the first in the us to accept singlesource recycling materials this moves some of the recycling work from the recyclers thus cutting their costs in exchange for a stronger market position and lower raw prices however snowflake mill was stuck with a raw product flow which contain contaminants such as plastic and metals elk fall mills was shut down on  november  in addition to falling demand for newsprint the mill increasingly failed to secure sufficient virgin fiber as the mill used sawdust rather than woodchips as its source material the  recession caused a steep drop in demand for building materials causing at least three of the main sawdust suppliers to elk fall mill to shut down this was made worse by increasing power prices and a strengthening of the canadian dollar especially after  china started buying large quantities of old newsprint from north america particularly from the west coast in addition to causing a shortage in recycled paper the exports caused a steep increase in the prices combined with reduced demand for newsprint catalyst decided to curtail production at paper machine  from  december  the following year the corporation decided to close the coquitlam plant and permanently terminate production at paper machine  in crofton rumford mill is situated on the androscoggin river from  snowflake fell into a steadily more competitive environment prices of recycled fibers rose with increased demand from chinese importers slack at quality controlling received papers at chinese mills allowed for the export of a steadily more contaminated wastes which again effected the quality and prices for snowflake this led to higher prices and lower quality for snowflake mill the price of old newsprint increased by  percent from  to   the mill was therefore permanently closed on  september  after having
