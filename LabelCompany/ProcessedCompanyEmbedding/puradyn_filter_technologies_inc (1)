intervals our new maintenance practices with the help of the puradyn systems allow extension of oil drain intervals to  hours from our previous practice of  hours this reduces oil drains to virtually once per year saving operating costs and reducing the amount of waste oil generation with the new scan vision rig as with all our rigs we are focused on constantly improving our operating efficiency including improvements to maintenance which this product assists“it’s a winwin for our customers the environment and scandrill” — paul mosvold president  chief operating officer scandrill inc houston tx“we focus on providing outstanding service and valueadded products to our customers  one of the ways we do this is by providing our customers with a technology that allows their equipment to operate as effectively and efficiently as possible  there is a reason we use puradyn – it offers the best solution for keeping engines clean safely extending oil drain intervals and reducing overall lifecycle costs protecting substantial investments in the commercial marine and industrial industries  with over  years of experience in bypass filtration puradyn was the natural choice to offer our customers“the return on investment for the system is the cost of one to two oil changes” — harry lartigue jr power generation marine and industrial sales manager mni diesel inc corpus christi texas   “we had the mv sunrise built in  with the puradyn filtration system included  it enables us to extend the oil drain intervals from our old standard of  hours to  hours  this equates to a savings of  gallons of oil or  per year  another boat in our fleet the mv southern cross has been able to exceed  hours prior to overhaul with the puradyn filtration system installed it’s nice to run across a product that actually does what it’s supposed to  keep up the good work” – captain bill clark south ferry island shelter island ny “considering that our fleet would normally require mile oil drains we calculate that by using the puradyn system and running on the same oil over  million miles we’ve saved over  gallons of oil the engines remain clean perform at peak level   and the overall maintenance costs have been drastically reduced”“we’ve also performed extensive fuel consumption measurements and consistently achieve a  –  savings in fuel” — ross hare hare express inc troy michigan    related

you extend oil drain intervalsoil rigs need to be fully selfsufficient with regards to energy water and electrical needs as well as the processes and equipment necessary for oil and gas production  equipment malfunction resulting in operational failure onboard a rig can easily result in days to weeks of downtime and heavy expenses related to repairsthe number of engines per oil rig varies greatly from as low as three to well over eight depending on drilling application and location  these engines typically run  and require oil drains ranging from  hours or just under  days and the amount of oil needed to operate and maintain runs into millions of dollars in new oil purchases and waste oil disposal costsour largest oil filtration system the mts is a workhorse that easily handles the  operational environments on engines with large oil sump capacities  unique in the industry the mts will microfilter an oil sump capacity of  gallons  liters and is designed to be used in multiples on oil rigs where engines can hold up to  gallons  liters of oilthe puradyn® systems utilized on the generators used on land and offshore oil drilling platforms are able to significantly reduce oil maintenance needs and costs by keeping engine oil continuously clean and in good working orderthe resultant decrease in downtime and increased productivity make it ideal for use in remote locations on rigs possessing a high oil sump capacity and the necessity to be operable  there is no need to shut down the engine when changing the filter cartridge which must be changed in lieu of changing the oiladditionally the safe extension of oil drains translates to a significant reduction in the amount of oil being transported to and from remote locations decreasing operating costs and lessening the amount of co and nox emitted into the atmosphere  likewise due to the extension of oil drains production of waste oil is also reduced further diminishing the operator’s environmental impactnatural gas pipeline industry the gas pipeline industry is another industry where it is crucial to keep engines running at all times  puradyn has worked for over five years with one natural gas pipeline operator that operates a fleet of natural gas compressors made up of waukesha and cat engines  our customer specifically cites engine cleanliness from operating with oil kept constantly clean by the bypass oil filtration system as the determining factor in extending its engine overhaul intervals  since installing the system the operating company changes oil the puradyn® replacement filter

microfine filtration technology they have been able to extend engine overhauls by  hoursdon’t forget puradyn systems work just as well to extend oil drain intervals on hydraulic systems which often

oil filtration responsible environmental use of natural resourcesengines are critical to our way of life as they operate in almost every aspect of daytoday living  transportation habitat food production infrastructure economic stability and defense  as long as engines are powered by oil the environmental benefits of energy oil and natural resources conservation remain an important part of our national energy conversation  it’s logical to assume that removal of a powerful and essential natural resource as oil might have an equally powerful effect upon the very source from which it’s being removed some of the current exploration and extraction methods used to produce ‘new’ oil remain controversial as they take a toll on the natural environment waste oil recycled to be used as heating oil heavy lubricant and asphalt contains its own set of issues in that these products still contain a substantial amount of harmful contaminants such as carbon potassium and lead to name a few as well as levels of antifreeze and gas  think about this  one gallon of used oil which contains impurities and toxins can contaminate one million gallons of potable water if disposed of improperly oil spills which can and often do occur during the transport of fossil fuels wreak havoc on the underwater environment and affect the chemical balance and life species for decadesenvironmental benefits of bypass oil filtrationthe good news is that engine and hydraulic oil can stay continuously clean for longer periods of time through the use of bypass oil filtration similar in concept to blood being filtered through a kidney dialysis machine and oil analysis  this means lubricating oil can stay in play extending the life of the oil by numerous oil drain cycles  in some instances the purchase of ‘new’ engine oil can be reduced by as much as   and when ‘new’ oil can be reduced there is a subsequent reduction of waste oil bypass filtration technology extends the life of the oil by safely removing harmful solid liquid and gaseous contaminants  it also extends the life of the engine which is now running on continuously clean oil thereby reducing additional wear and pollution contributors to the engine components using bypass oil filtration to reduce significant oil consumption can minimize your company’s carbon footprint   bypass oil filtering bypass oil filtration

and everincreasing set of responsibilities anita has been with puradyn for the better part of  years and over the past few years has moved up from production associate to team leader of the unit line manufacturing team and materials controlin her new position anita will be overseeing the entire production floor  congratulations anita production puradyn people update shop supervisor causes of engine contamination foreign matter in lubricating oil is destined to end up as engine contamination and a costly maintenance fix whether that cost is from taking equipment offline for oilrelated maintenance or wear from friction on engine components reducing the life of the enginedirty oil is created by the generation of solid and liquid contaminants from the engine combustion process general oxidation and by outside contaminants entering the oil the combustion process creates water carbon particles and sulfur oxides when combined with the ingress of dirt dust and foreign matter entering the lubrication system through blowby sludge varnish and acids are formed thereby adversely affecting the viscosity and lubricating properties of the oilto begin covering the basic potential types of contaminant in lubricating oil all petroleum products contain some amount of natural sulfur in the engine combustion process this natural sulfur becomes sulfur dioxide so which also contaminates the oil through blowby past the piston rings when mixed with water so produces sulfuric acid  this acid builds up in the oil causing corrosion and pitting of metal surfaces which in turn can lead to engine contamination and premature engine wear  so is linked with a number of adverse effects on the respiratory system the largest sources of so emissions are from fossil fuel combustion at power plants  and other industrial facilities   smaller sources of so emissions include industrial processes such as extracting metal from ore and the burning of high sulfur containing fuels by locomotives large ships and nonroad equipment  water in the oil is a natural byproduct of the engine combustion process and is caused by condensation as well excessive fuel water or engine coolant dilution will seriously impair the lubricating properties of oil water is the most damaging because it leads to the formation of corrosive acids and sludge water can also cause up to an  loss of oil additivesengine coolant can be introduced into the oil through leaking head gaskets liner seals and oil cooler seals causing corrosion and forming sludgepuradyn technology is designed to remove nearly  of water and solid contaminant to below one micron in lubricating oil thereby helping maintain the oil’s viscosityalthough solid contaminants formed from engine wear and chemical reactions are initially extremely small they tend to agglomerate in suspension in the oil increasing in size until they are large enough to fall out of suspension forming layers of sludge and varnishthe puradyn system captures and removes solid contaminants in the oil down to below  micron in size which prevents them from creating internal engine wear in areas of extremely tight clearances such as bearing and bushing surfaces and linerring clearance it has been proven that filtering particles within oil down to  microns in size does not significantly reduce engine wear whereas filtering down to  micron does significantly reduce engine wear continuously clean oil lubricating and cooling your engine while removing solid contaminant to below one micron is vital to extending engine lifethe last phase of the fine filtration process to reduce engine wear is the replenishment of the base additive and the viscosity enhancer which maintains the engine’s oil chemical balance and viscosity  the combination of the three processes listed above provides the necessary steps to safely extending the engine’s oil life and reducing engine wear leading to extended engine life and better performance over the life of the engineregardless of oil price fluctuations bypass oil filtration offers several benefits to end users as well as being one of the single greatest technologies available for maintaining engine and
