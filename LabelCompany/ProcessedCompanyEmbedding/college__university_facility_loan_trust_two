t e in finance a loan is the lending of money from one individual organization or entity to another individual organization or entity a loan is a debt provided by an entity organization or individual to another entity at an interest rate and evidenced by a promissory note which specifies among other things the principal amount of money borrowed the interest rate the lender is charging and date of repayment a loan entails the reallocation of the subject assets for a period of time between the lender and the borrower in a loan the borrower initially receives or borrows an amount of money called the principal from the lender and is obligated to pay back or repay an equal amount of money to the lender at a later time the loan is generally provided at a cost referred to as interest on the debt which provides an incentive for the lender to engage in the loan in a legal loan each of these obligations and restrictions is enforced by contract which can also place the borrower under additional restrictions known as loan covenants although this article focuses on monetary loans in practice any material object might be lent acting as a provider of loans is one of the principal tasks for financial institutions such as banks and credit card companies for other institutions issuing of debt contracts such as bonds is a typical source of funding contents  types  secured  unsecured  demand

see also loan guarantee a secured loan is a loan in which the borrower pledges some asset eg a car or property as collateral a mortgage loan is a very common type of loan used by many individuals to purchase things in this arrangement the money is used to purchase the property the financial institution however is given security – a lien on the title to the house – until the mortgage is paid off in full if the borrower defaults on the loan the bank would have the legal right to repossess the house and sell it to recover sums owing to it in some instances a loan taken out to purchase a new or used car may be secured by the car in much the same way as a mortgage is secured by housing the duration of the loan period is considerably shorter – often corresponding to the useful life of the car there are two types of auto loans direct and indirect a direct auto loan is where a bank gives the loan directly to a consumer an indirect auto loan is where a car dealership acts as an intermediary between the bank or financial institution and the consumer unsecurededit unsecured loans are monetary loans that are not secured against the borrowers assets these may be available from financial institutions under many different guises or marketing packages credit card debt personal loans bank overdrafts credit facilities or lines of credit corporate bonds may be secured or unsecured peertopeer lending the interest rates applicable to these different forms may vary depending on the lender and the borrower these may or may not be regulated by law in the united kingdom when applied to individuals these may come under the consumer credit act  interest rates on unsecured loans are nearly always higher than for secured loans because an unsecured lenders options for recourse against the borrower in the event of default are severely limited an unsecured lender must sue the borrower obtain a money judgment for breach of contract and then pursue execution of the judgment against the borrowers unencumbered assets that is the ones not already pledged to secured lenders in insolvency proceedings secured lenders traditionally have priority over unsecured lenders when a court divides up the borrowers assets thus a higher interest rate reflects the additional risk that in the event of insolvency the debt may be uncollectible demandedit demand loans are short term loans that are typically in that they do not have fixed dates for repayment and carry a floating interest rate which varies according to the prime lending rate they can be called for repayment by the lending institution at any time demand loans may be unsecured or secured subsidizededit a subsidized loan is a loan on which the interest is reduced by an explicit or hidden subsidy in the context of college loans in the united states it refers to a loan on which no interest is accrued while a student remains enrolled in education concessionaledit a concessional loan sometimes called a soft loan is granted on terms substantially more generous than market loans either through belowmarket interest rates by grace periods or a combination of both such loans may be made by foreign governments to developing countries or may be offered to employees of lending institutions as an employee benefit target marketsedit personaledit see also credit finance § consumer credit loans can also be subcategorized according to whether the debtor is an individual person consumer or a business common personal loans include mortgage loans car loans home equity lines of credit credit cards installment loans and payday loans the credit score of the borrower is a major component in and underwriting and interest rates apr of these loans the monthly payments of personal loans can be decreased by selecting longer payment terms but overall interest paid increases as well for car loans in the us the average term was about  months in citation needed commercialedit main article business loan loans to businesses are similar to the above but also include commercial mortgages and corporate bonds underwriting is not based upon credit score but rather credit rating loan

monthly interest rate c is p  l ⋅ c    c  n    c  n −   for more information see monthly loan or mortgage payments under compound interest abuses in lendingedit predatory lending is one form of abuse in the granting of loans it usually involves granting a loan in order to put the borrower in a position that one can gain advantage over him or her where the moneylender is not authorized they could be considered a loan shark usury is a different form of abuse where the lender charges excessive interest in different time periods and cultures the acceptable interest rate has varied from no interest at all to unlimited interest rates credit card companies in some countries have been accused by consumer organizations of lending at usurious interest rates and making money out of frivolous extra charges abuses can also take place in the form of the customer abusing the lender by not repaying the loan or with an intent to defraud the lender united states taxesedit most of the basic rules governing how loans are handled for tax purposes in the united states are codified by both congress the internal revenue code and the treasury department treasury regulations – another set of rules that interpret the internal revenue code  a loan is not gross income to the borrower since the borrower has the obligation to repay the loan the borrower has no accession to wealth  the lender may not deduct from own gross income the amount of the loan the rationale here is that one asset the cash has been converted into a different asset a promise of repayment deductions are not typically available when an outlay serves to create a new or different asset  the amount paid to satisfy the loan obligation is not deductible from own gross income by the borrower  repayment of the loan is not gross income to the lender in effect the promise of repayment is converted back to cash with no accession to wealth by the lender  interest paid to the lender is included in the lender’s gross income interest paid represents compensation for the use of the lender’s money or property and thus represents profit or an accession to wealth to the lender interest income can be attributed to lenders even if the lender doesn’t charge a minimum amount of interest  interest paid to the lender may be deductible by the borrower in general interest paid in connection with the borrower’s business activity is deductible while interest paid on personal loans are not deductiblethe major exception here is interest paid on a home mortgage income from discharge of indebtednessedit although a loan does not start out as income to the borrower it becomes income to the borrower if the borrower is discharged of indebtedness thus if a debt is discharged then the borrower essentially has received income equal to the amount of the indebtedness the internal revenue code lists income from discharge of indebtedness in section a as a source of gross income example x owes y  if y discharges the indebtedness then x no longer owes y  for purposes of calculating income this is treated the same way as if y gave x  for a more detailed description of the discharge of indebtedness look at section  cancellation of debt
