instituted which composed of his uncle prince nicholas the patriarch miron cristea and the president of the supreme court gheorghe buzdugan the council proved to be ineffective and in  carol returned

again several confiscated properties such as elisabeta palace were eventually returned to his family he is the last surviving monarch or other head of state from the interwar period although often

magda lupescu and renounced his rights to the throne in december  michael was declared heir apparent michael succeeded to the throne of romania upon ferdinands death in july  rule s and the antonescu era michael and marshal ion antonescu on the banks of prut river a regency which included his uncle prince nicolae patriarch miron cristea and the countrys chief justice gheorghe buzdugan from october  constantin sărățeanu functioned on behalf of the yearold michael when he succeeded ferdinand in  in  carol ii returned to the country at the invitation of politicians dissatisfied with the regency and was proclaimed king by the parliament designating michael as crown prince with the title grand voievod of albaiulia in november  michael joined the romanian senate as the  constitution guaranteed him a seat there upon reaching the age of eighteen in september  the progerman antibolshevik régime of prime minister marshal ion antonescu staged a coup détat against carol ii whom the marshal claimed to be antigerman antonescu suspended the constitution dissolved the parliament and reinstalled the yearold michael as king by popular acclaim although the constitution was restored in  and the romanian parliament in  michael did not either subsequently take a formal oath or have his reign approved retroactively by parliament michael was crowned with the steel crown and anointed king of romania by the orthodox patriarch of romania nicodim munteanu in the patriarchal cathedral of bucharest on the day of his accession  september  although king michael was formally the supreme head of the army and entitled to appoint the prime minister with full powers named leader of the people conducător in reality he was forced to remain only a figurehead until august  michael had lunch with adolf hitler twice once with his father in bavaria in  and with his mother in berlin in  he also met benito mussolini in  in italy turning against nazi germany main article king michaels coup romanian stamp from  commemorating the one year anniversary of the liberation of bessarabia from soviet occupation featuring michael and antonescu below the text un an de la desrobire a year since liberation and the fortress of bender in the background in  world war ii was going badly for the axis powers but the military dictator prime minister marshal ion antonescu was still in control of romania by august  the soviet conquest of romania had become inevitable being expected in a few months on  august  michael joined the proallied politicians a number of army officers and armed communistled civilians in staging a coup against antonescu king michael ordered his arrest by the royal palace guard on the same night the new prime minister lt general constantin sănătescu—who was appointed by king michael—gave custody of antonescu to the communists in spite of alleged instructions to the contrary by the king who delivered him to the soviets on  september in a radio broadcast to the romanian nation and army michael issued a ceasefire just as the red army was penetrating the moldavian front proclaimed romanias loyalty to the allies announced the acceptance of the armistice offered by the united kingdom the united states and the ussr and declared war on germany however this did not avert a rapid soviet occupation and capture of about  romanian soldiers who were transported to the soviet union where many perished in prison camps although the countrys alliance with the nazis was ended the coup sped the red armys advance into romania the armistice was signed three weeks later on  september  on terms the soviets virtually dictated under the terms of the armistice romania recognized its defeat by the ussr and was placed under occupation of the allied forces with the soviets as their representative in control of media communication post and civil administration behind the front the coup effectively amounted to a capitulation an unconditional surrender it has been suggested that the coup may have shortened world war ii by six months thus saving hundreds of thousands of lives at the end of the war king michael was awarded the highest degree chief commander of the legion of merit by us president harry s truman he was also decorated with the soviet order of victory by joseph stalin for the courageous act of the radical change in romanias politics towards a breakup from hitlers germany and an alliance with the united nations at the moment when there was no clear sign yet of germanys defeat according to the official description of the decoration with the death of michał rolażymierski in  michael became the sole surviving recipient of the order of victory reign under communism michael in  in march  political pressures forced king michael to appoint a prosoviet government headed by petru groza for the next twoplus years michael functioned again as little more than a figurehead between august  and january  during what was later known as the royal strike king michael tried unsuccessfully to oppose the groza government by refusing to sign its decrees in response to soviet british and american pressures king michael eventually gave up his opposition to the communist government and stopped demanding its resignation he did not pardon former marshal antonescu who was sentenced to death for betrayal of the romanian people for the benefit of nazi germany for the economic and political subjugation of romania to germany for cooperation with the iron guard for murdering his political opponents for the mass murder of civilians and crimes against peace nor did king michael manage to save such leaders of the opposition as iuliu maniu and the bratianus victims of communist political trials as the constitution prevented him from doing so without the countersignature of communist justice minister lucrețiu pătrășcanu who himself was later eliminated by gheorghiudejs opposing communist faction the memoirs of king michaels aunt princess ileana quoted emil bodnăraș — her alleged lover romanias communist minister of defence and a soviet spy—as saying well if the king decides not to sign the death warrant i promise that we will uphold his point of view princess ileana was sceptical you know quite well  that the king will never of his free will sign such an unconstitutional document if he does it will be laid at your door and before the whole nation your government will bear the blame surely you do not wish this additional handicap at this moment forced abdication abdication act  in november  king michael travelled to london for the wedding of his cousins princess elizabeth later queen elizabeth ii and prince philip of greece and denmark an occasion during which he met princess anne of bourbonparma his second cousin once removed who was to become his wife according to his own account king michael rejected any offers of asylum and decided to return to romania contrary to the confidential strong advice of the british ambassador to romania early on the morning of  december  michael was preparing for a new years party at peleș castle in sinaia when groza summoned him back to bucharest michael returned to elisabeta palace in bucharest to find it surrounded by troops from the tudor vladimirescu division an army unit completely loyal to the communists groza and communist party boss gheorghe gheorghiudej were waiting for him and demanded that he sign a pretyped instrument of abdication unable to call in loyal troops due to his telephone lines allegedly being cut and with either groza or gheorghiudej depending on the source holding a gun on him michael signed the document later the same day the communistdominated government announced the permanent abolition of the monarchy and its replacement by a peoples republic broadcasting the kings prerecorded radio proclamation of his own abdication on  january  michael was forced to leave the country followed over a week later by princesses elisabeth and ileana who collaborated so closely with the soviets that they became known as the kings red aunts he was the last monarch behind the iron curtain to lose his throne according to michaels own account groza had threatened him at gun point and warned that the government would shoot  arrested students if the king did not abdicate in an interview with the new york times from  michael recalls the events it was blackmail they said if you dont sign this immediately we are obliged — why obliged i dont know — to kill more than  students that they had in prison according to time groza threatened to arrest thousands of people and order a bloodbath unless michael abdicated however according to the autobiography of the former head of the soviet intelligence agency nkvd major general pavel sudoplatov the deputy soviet foreign commissar andrey vyshinsky personally conducted negotiations with king michael for his abdication guaranteeing part of a pension to be paid to michael in mexico according to a few articles in jurnalul naţional michaels abdication was negotiated with the communist government which allowed him to leave the country with the goods he requested and by some of the royal retinue according to albanian communist leader enver hoxhas account of his conversations with the romanian communist leaders on the monarchs abdication it was gheorghiudej not groza who forced michaels abdication at gunpoint he was allowed to leave the country accompanied by some of his entourage and as confirmed also by the soviet leader nikita khrushchev recounting gheorghiudejs confessions with whatever properties he desired including gold and rubies hoxha also wrote that procommunist troops surrounded the palace to counter army units who were still loyal to the king in march  michael denounced his abdication as illegal and contended he was still the rightful king of romania according to time magazine he would have done so sooner but for much of early  he had been negotiating with the communists over properties he had left in romania there are reports that romanian communist authorities allowed king michael to depart with  valuable crownowned paintings in november  so that he would leave romania faster some of these paintings were reportedly sold through the famed art dealer daniel wildenstein one of the paintings belonging to the romanian crown which was supposedly taken out of the country by king michael in november  returned to romania in  as a donation made by john kreuger the former husband of king michaels daughter princess irina in  romanian prime minister călin popescutăriceanu denied these accusations about king michael stating that the romanian government has no proof of any such action by king michael and that prior to  the government had no official records of any artwork taken over from the former royal residences however according to some historians such records existed as early as april  having been in fact officially published in june  according to ivor porters authorized biography michael of romania the king and the country  which quotes queenmother helens daily diary the romanian royal family took out paintings belonging to the romanian royal crown on their november  trip to london to the wedding of the future queen elizabeth ii two of these paintings signed by el greco were sold in  according to recently declassified foreign office documents when he left romania the exiled king michaels only assets amounted to  swiss francs recently declassified soviet transcripts of talks between joseph stalin and the romanian primeminister petru groza show that shortly before his abdication king michael received from the communist government assets amounting to  swiss francs king michael however repeatedly denied that the communist government had allowed him to take into exile any financial assets or valuable goods besides four personal automobiles loaded on two train cars life in exile the standard of the king michael never met his father carol after the  abdication michael could see no point in meeting his father who had humiliated his mother so many times via his open affairs and did not attend his fathers funeral in  in january  michael began using one of his familys ancestral titles prince of hohenzollern instead of using the title of king of romania after denouncing his abdication as forced and illegal in march  michael resumed use of the kingly title on  june  in athens greece he married princess anne of bourbonparma born paris  september  his second cousin once removed as princess anne was roman catholic the couple asked for a dispensation from pope pius xii for the marriage negotiations with the vatican broke down when michael refused to promise to raise any future children catholic as it would have been deemed illegal under the romanian constitution of  the dispensation was not given by the pope and their marriage was not deemed valid by the roman catholic church until  the couple lived near florence italy until  near lausanne switzerland until  and then in hampshire england until  after that the couple settled near versoix switzerland where they would live for the next  years the communist romanian authorities stripped michael of his romanian citizenship in  during exile michael worked as farmer pilot entrepreneur and broker with his wife he has five daughters born between  and  return and rehabilitation on  december —a year after the revolution which overthrew the communist dictatorship of nicolae ceaușescu—michael accompanied by several members of the royal family landed at otopeni airport and entered romania for the first time in  years using a danish diplomatic passport michael was able to obtain a hour visa he intended to reach curtea de argeș cathedral pray at the tombs of his royal ancestors and attend the christmas religious service however on their way to curtea de argeș the king and his companions were stopped by a police filter taken to the airport and forced to leave the country in  the romanian government allowed michael to return to romania for easter celebrations where he drew large crowds even though the romanian government denied his request to give a speech from the royal palace now the national museum of art of romania his speech from a hotel room drew over a million people to bucharest to see him michael refused the offer of the president of the national liberal party radu câmpeanu to run for elections as president of romania michaels popularity alarmed the government of president ion iliescu and he was forbidden to visit romania being denied entry twice in  and  in  after iliescus defeat by emil constantinescu the romanian government restored michaels citizenship and again allowed him to visit the country he now lives partly in switzerland at aubonne and partly in romania either at săvârșin castle in arad county or in an official residence in bucharest—the elisabeta palace—voted by the romanian parliament by a law concerning arrangements for former heads of state besides săvârșin castle the former private residences peleș castle and pelișor were also restituted while peleș and pelișor are open to the public elisabeta palace and săvârșin are used as private residences peleș castle pelișor castle săvârșin castle later years fresco of king michael i on the walls of sâmbăta monastery michael i and anne on a  romanian stamp michael has neither encouraged nor opposed monarchist agitation in romania and royalist parties have made little impact in postcommunist romanian politics he takes the view that the restoration of the monarchy in romania can only result from a decision by the romanian people if the people want me to come back of course i will come back he said in  romanians have had enough suffering imposed on them to have the right to be consulted on their future king michaels belief is that there is still a role for and value in the monarchy today we are trying to make people understand what the romanian monarchy was and what it can still do for them according to a  opinion poll conducted at the request of the romanian royal family only  of romanians were in favour of the restoration of the monarchy another  poll found that only  of romanians are monarchists michael has undertaken some quasidiplomatic roles on behalf of postcommunist romania in  and  he toured western europe lobbying for romanias admission into nato and the european union and was received by heads of state and government officials in december  allegedly to the stupefaction of the public opinion in romania michael awarded the man of the year  prize to prime minister adrian năstase leader of the social democratic party psd on behalf of the tabloid vip the daily evenimentul zilei subsequently complained that such an activity was unsuited to a king and that michael was wasting away his prestige with the majority of the political analysts considering his gesture as a fresh abdication on  may

kingdoms last democratically approved monarchical constitution of  upon the death of king michael without sons the claim to the crown devolves once again upon the hohenzollern family however on  december  on the th anniversary of his abdication king michael signed the fundamental rules of the royal family of romania by which he designated princess margarita as his heir the document has no legal standing as it regulates an institution that is not extant anymore on the same occasion michael also asked the romanian parliament that should it consider restoring the monarchy it should also abolish the salic law of succession on  may  on a background of lawsuits in germany brought against his family by his german relatives regarding the former name hohenzollernveringen of his soninlaw radu and of fears expressed by some that the german hohenzollerns may claim succession to the headship of the romanian royal house michael severed all of the dynastic and historical ties with the

with magda lupescu in  carol was eventually pressured to renounce his rights to the throne and moved to paris in exile with lupescu in  michael ascended the throne following the death of his grandfather ferdinand i as he was still a minor a regency council was instituted which composed of his uncle prince nicholas the patriarch miron cristea and the president of the supreme court gheorghe buzdugan the council proved to be ineffective and in  carol returned to romania and replaced his son as king as a result michael returned to being heir apparent to the throne and was given the additional title of grand voievod of albaiulia carol ii was deposed in  and michael once again became king under the government led by the military dictator ion antonescu romania became aligned with nazi germany in  michael participated in a coup against antonescu appointed constantin sănătescu as his replacement and subsequently declared an alliance with the allies in march  political pressures

by refusing to sign and endorse its decrees in november michael attended the wedding of his cousins the future queen elizabeth ii of the united kingdom and prince philip of greece in london shortly

year michael attempted to return to romania only to be arrested and forced to leave upon arrival in  michael was allowed to visit romania for easter where he was greeted by huge crowds a speech he gave from his hotel window drew an estimated one million people to bucharest alarmed by michaels popularity the government refused to allow michael further visits in  after iliescus defeat by emil constantinescu michaels citizenship was restored and michael was allowed to visit romania again several confiscated properties such as elisabeta palace were eventually returned to his family he is the

michael succeeded to the throne of romania upon ferdinands death in july  rule s and the antonescu era michael and marshal ion antonescu on the banks of prut river a regency which included his uncle prince nicolae patriarch miron cristea and the countrys chief justice gheorghe buzdugan from october  constantin sărățeanu functioned on behalf of the yearold michael when he succeeded ferdinand in  in  carol ii returned to the country at the invitation of politicians dissatisfied with the regency and was proclaimed king by the parliament designating michael as crown prince with the title grand voievod of albaiulia in november  michael joined the romanian senate as the  constitution guaranteed him a seat there upon reaching the age of eighteen in september  the progerman antibolshevik régime of prime minister marshal ion antonescu staged a coup détat against carol ii whom the marshal claimed to be antigerman antonescu suspended the constitution dissolved the parliament and reinstalled the yearold michael as king by popular acclaim although the constitution was restored in  and the romanian parliament in  michael did not either subsequently take a formal oath or have his reign approved retroactively by parliament michael was crowned with the steel crown and anointed king of romania by the orthodox patriarch of romania nicodim munteanu in the patriarchal cathedral of bucharest on the day of his accession  september  although king michael was formally the supreme head of the army and entitled to appoint the prime minister with full powers named leader of the people conducător in reality he was forced to remain only a figurehead until august  michael had lunch with adolf hitler twice once with his father in bavaria in  and with his mother in berlin in  he also met benito mussolini in  in italy turning against nazi germany main article king michaels coup romanian stamp from  commemorating the one year anniversary of the liberation of bessarabia from soviet occupation featuring michael and antonescu below the text un an de la desrobire a year since liberation and the fortress of bender in the background in  world war ii was going badly for the axis powers but the military dictator prime minister marshal ion antonescu was still in control of romania by august  the soviet conquest of romania had become inevitable being expected in a few months on  august  michael joined the proallied politicians a number of army officers and armed communistled civilians in staging a coup against antonescu king michael ordered his arrest by the royal palace guard on the same night the new prime minister lt general constantin sănătescu—who was appointed by king michael—gave custody of antonescu to the communists in spite of alleged instructions to the contrary by the king who delivered him to the soviets on  september in a radio broadcast to the romanian nation and army michael issued a ceasefire just as the red army was penetrating the moldavian front proclaimed romanias loyalty to the allies announced the acceptance of the armistice offered by the united kingdom the united states and the ussr and declared war on germany however this did not avert a rapid soviet occupation and capture of about  romanian soldiers who were transported to the soviet union where many perished in prison camps although the countrys alliance with the nazis was ended the coup sped the red armys advance into romania the armistice was signed three weeks later on  september  on terms the soviets virtually dictated under the terms of the armistice romania recognized its defeat by the ussr and was placed under occupation of the allied forces with the soviets as their representative in control of media communication post and civil administration behind the front the coup effectively amounted to a capitulation an unconditional surrender it has been suggested that the coup may have shortened world war ii by six months thus saving hundreds of thousands of lives at the end of the war king michael was awarded the highest degree chief commander of the legion of merit by us president harry s truman he was also decorated with the soviet order of victory by joseph stalin for the courageous act of the radical change in romanias politics towards a breakup from hitlers germany and an alliance with the united nations at the moment when there was no clear sign yet of germanys defeat according to the official description of the decoration with the death of michał rolażymierski in  michael became the sole surviving recipient of the order of victory reign under communism michael in  in march  political pressures forced king michael to appoint a prosoviet government headed by petru groza for the next twoplus years michael functioned again as little more than a figurehead between august  and january  during what was later known as the royal strike king michael tried unsuccessfully to oppose the groza government by refusing to sign its decrees in response to soviet british and american pressures king michael eventually gave up his opposition to the communist government and stopped demanding its resignation he did not pardon former marshal antonescu who was sentenced to death for betrayal of the romanian people for the benefit of nazi germany for the economic and political subjugation of romania to germany for cooperation with the iron guard for murdering his political opponents for the mass murder of civilians and crimes against peace nor did king michael manage to save such leaders of the opposition as iuliu maniu and the bratianus victims of communist political trials as the constitution prevented him from doing so without the countersignature of communist justice minister lucrețiu pătrășcanu who himself was later eliminated by gheorghiudejs opposing communist faction the memoirs of king michaels aunt princess ileana quoted emil bodnăraș — her alleged lover romanias communist minister of defence and a soviet spy—as saying well if the king decides not to sign the death warrant i promise that we will uphold his point of view princess ileana was sceptical you know quite well  that the king will never of his free will sign such an unconstitutional document if he does it will be laid at your door and before the whole nation your government will bear the blame surely you do not wish this additional handicap at this moment forced abdication abdication act  in november  king michael travelled to london for the wedding of his cousins princess elizabeth later queen elizabeth ii and prince philip of greece and denmark an occasion during which he met princess anne of bourbonparma his second cousin once removed who was to become his wife according to his own account king michael rejected any offers of asylum and decided to return to romania contrary to the confidential strong advice of the british ambassador to romania early on the morning of  december  michael was preparing for a new years party at peleș castle in sinaia when groza summoned him back to bucharest michael returned to elisabeta palace in bucharest to find it surrounded by troops from the tudor vladimirescu division an army unit completely loyal to the communists groza and communist party boss gheorghe gheorghiudej were waiting for him and demanded that he sign a pretyped instrument of abdication unable to call in loyal troops due to his telephone lines allegedly being cut and with either groza or gheorghiudej depending on the source holding a gun on him michael signed the document later the same day the communistdominated government announced the permanent abolition of the monarchy and its replacement by a peoples republic broadcasting the kings prerecorded radio proclamation of his own abdication on  january  michael was forced to leave the country followed over a week later by princesses elisabeth and ileana who collaborated so closely with the soviets that they became known as the kings red aunts he was the last monarch behind the iron curtain to lose his throne according to michaels own account groza had threatened him at gun point and warned that the government would shoot  arrested students if the king did not abdicate in an interview with the new york times from  michael recalls the events it was blackmail they said if you dont sign this immediately we are obliged — why obliged i dont know — to kill more than  students that they had in prison according to time groza threatened to arrest thousands of people and order a bloodbath unless michael abdicated however according to the autobiography of the former head of the soviet intelligence agency nkvd major general pavel sudoplatov the deputy soviet foreign commissar andrey vyshinsky personally conducted negotiations with king michael for his abdication guaranteeing part of a pension to be paid to michael in mexico according to a few articles in jurnalul naţional michaels abdication was negotiated with the communist government which allowed him to leave the country with the goods he requested and by some of the royal retinue according to albanian communist leader enver hoxhas account of his conversations with the romanian communist leaders on the monarchs abdication it was gheorghiudej not groza who forced michaels abdication at gunpoint he was allowed to leave the country accompanied by some of his entourage and as confirmed also by the soviet leader nikita khrushchev recounting gheorghiudejs confessions with whatever properties he desired including gold and rubies hoxha also wrote that procommunist troops surrounded the palace to counter army units who were still loyal to the king in march  michael denounced his abdication as illegal and contended he was still the rightful king of romania according to time magazine he would have done so sooner but for much of early  he had been negotiating with the communists over properties he had left in romania there are reports that romanian communist authorities allowed king michael to depart with  valuable crownowned paintings in november  so that he would leave romania faster some of these paintings were reportedly sold through the famed art dealer daniel wildenstein one of the paintings belonging to the romanian crown which was supposedly taken out of the country by king michael in november  returned to romania in  as a donation made by john kreuger the former husband of king michaels daughter princess irina in  romanian prime minister călin popescutăriceanu denied these accusations about king michael stating that the romanian government has no proof of any such action by king michael and that prior to  the government had no official records of any artwork taken over from the former royal residences however according to some historians such records existed as early as april  having been in fact officially published in june  according to ivor porters authorized biography michael of romania the king and the country  which quotes queenmother helens daily diary the romanian royal family took out paintings belonging to the romanian royal crown on their november  trip to london to the wedding of the future queen elizabeth ii two of these paintings signed by el greco were sold in  according to recently declassified foreign office documents when he left romania the exiled king michaels only assets amounted to  swiss francs recently declassified soviet transcripts of talks between joseph stalin and the romanian primeminister petru groza show that shortly before his abdication king michael received from the communist government assets amounting to  swiss francs king michael however repeatedly denied that the communist government had allowed him to take into exile any financial assets or valuable goods besides four personal automobiles loaded on two train cars life in exile the standard of the king michael never met his father carol after the  abdication michael could see no point in meeting his father who had humiliated his mother so many times via his open affairs and did not attend his fathers funeral in  in january  michael began using one of his familys ancestral titles prince of hohenzollern instead of using the title of king of romania after denouncing his abdication as forced and illegal in march  michael resumed use of the kingly title on  june  in athens greece he married princess anne of bourbonparma born paris  september  his second cousin once removed as princess anne was roman catholic the couple asked for a dispensation from pope pius xii for the marriage negotiations with the vatican broke down when michael refused to promise to raise any future children catholic as it would have been deemed illegal under the romanian constitution of  the dispensation was not given by the pope and their marriage was not deemed valid by the roman catholic church until  the couple lived near florence italy until  near lausanne switzerland until  and then in hampshire england until  after that the couple settled near versoix switzerland where they would live for the next  years the communist romanian authorities stripped michael of his romanian citizenship in  during exile michael worked as farmer pilot entrepreneur and broker with his wife he has five daughters born between  and  return and rehabilitation on  december —a year after the revolution which overthrew the communist dictatorship of nicolae ceaușescu—michael accompanied by several members of the royal family landed at otopeni airport and entered romania for the first time in  years using a danish diplomatic passport michael was able to obtain a hour visa he intended to reach curtea de argeș cathedral pray at the tombs of his royal ancestors and attend the christmas religious service however on their way to curtea de argeș the king and his companions were stopped by a police filter taken to the airport and forced to leave the country in  the romanian government allowed michael to return to romania for easter celebrations where he drew large crowds even though the romanian government denied his request to give a speech from the royal palace now the national museum of art of romania his speech from a hotel room drew over a million people to bucharest to see him michael refused the offer of the president of the national liberal party radu câmpeanu to run for elections as president of romania michaels popularity alarmed the government of president ion iliescu and he was forbidden to visit romania being denied entry twice in  and  in  after iliescus defeat by emil constantinescu the romanian government restored michaels citizenship and again allowed him to visit the country he now lives partly in switzerland at aubonne and partly in romania either at săvârșin castle in arad county or in an official residence in bucharest—the elisabeta palace—voted by the romanian parliament by a law concerning arrangements for former heads of state besides săvârșin castle the former private residences peleș castle and pelișor were also restituted while peleș and pelișor are open to the public elisabeta palace and săvârșin are used as private residences peleș castle pelișor castle săvârșin castle later years fresco of king michael i on the walls of sâmbăta monastery michael i and anne on a  romanian stamp michael has neither encouraged nor opposed monarchist agitation in romania and royalist parties have made little impact in postcommunist romanian politics he takes the view that the restoration of the monarchy in romania can only result from a decision by the romanian people if the people want me to come back of course i will come back he said in  romanians have had enough suffering imposed on them to have the right to be consulted on their future king michaels belief is that there is still a role for and value in the monarchy today we are trying to make people understand what the romanian monarchy was and what it can still do for them according to a  opinion poll conducted at the request of the romanian royal family only  of romanians were in favour of the restoration of the monarchy another  poll found that only  of romanians are monarchists michael has undertaken some quasidiplomatic roles on behalf of postcommunist romania in  and  he toured western europe lobbying for romanias admission into nato and the european union and was received by heads of state and government officials in december  allegedly to the stupefaction of the public opinion in romania michael awarded the man of the year  prize to prime minister adrian năstase leader of the social democratic party psd on behalf of the tabloid vip the daily evenimentul zilei subsequently complained that such an activity was unsuited to a king and that michael was wasting away his prestige with the majority of the political analysts considering his gesture as a fresh abdication on  may  king michael received the prague society for international cooperation and global panel foundations th annual hanno r ellenbogen citizenship award previously awarded to vladimir ashkenazy madeleine albright václav havel lord robertson and miloš forman on  april  king michael

in popularity on  october  on the occasion of his th birthday he delivered a speech before the assembled chambers of the romanian parliament an opinion poll in january  placed him as the most trusted public figure in romania far ahead of the political leaders later in october  celebrating michaels st birthday a square in bucharest was renamed after him in a july  survey  of romanians had a good or very good opinion of michael with  thinking the opposite the royal family also enjoyed similar numbers with  having a good or very good opinion of it and just  having a poor or very poor one health

also line of succession to the former romanian throne according to the succession provisions of the romanian kingdoms last democratically approved monarchical constitution of  upon the death of king michael without sons the claim to the crown devolves once again upon the hohenzollern family however on  december  on the th anniversary of his abdication king michael signed the fundamental rules of the royal family of romania by which he designated princess margarita as his heir the document has no legal standing as it regulates an institution that is not extant anymore on the same occasion michael also asked the romanian parliament that should it consider restoring the monarchy it should also abolish the salic law of succession on  may  on a background of lawsuits in germany brought against his family by his german relatives regarding the former name hohenzollernveringen of his soninlaw radu and of fears expressed by some that the german hohenzollerns may claim succession to the headship of the romanian royal house michael severed all of the dynastic and historical ties with the princely house of hohenzollern changed the name of his family to of romania and gave up all princely titles conferred upon him and his family by the german hohenzollerns on  august  michael signed a document removing the title prince of romania and the qualification of royal highness from his grandson nicholas medforthmills who was also removed from the line of succession the former king took the decision with an eye on romanias future after the reign and life of his eldest daughter

throne in december  michael was declared heir apparent michael succeeded to the throne of romania upon ferdinands death in july  rule s and the antonescu era michael and marshal ion antonescu on the banks of prut river a regency which included his uncle prince nicolae patriarch miron cristea and the countrys chief justice gheorghe buzdugan from october  constantin sărățeanu functioned on behalf of the yearold michael when he succeeded ferdinand in  in  carol ii returned to the country at the invitation of politicians dissatisfied with the regency and was proclaimed king by the parliament designating michael as crown prince with the title grand voievod of albaiulia in november  michael joined the romanian senate as the  constitution guaranteed him a seat there upon reaching the age of eighteen in september  the progerman antibolshevik régime of prime minister marshal ion antonescu staged a coup détat against carol ii whom the marshal claimed to be antigerman antonescu suspended the constitution dissolved the parliament and reinstalled the yearold michael as king by popular acclaim although the constitution was restored in  and the romanian parliament in  michael did not either subsequently take a formal oath or have his reign approved retroactively by parliament michael was crowned with the steel crown and anointed king of romania by the orthodox patriarch of romania nicodim munteanu in the patriarchal cathedral of bucharest on the day of his accession  september  although king michael was formally the supreme head of the army and entitled to appoint the prime minister with full powers named leader of the people conducător in reality he was forced to remain only a figurehead until august  michael had lunch with adolf hitler twice once with his father in bavaria in  and with his mother in berlin in  he also met benito mussolini in  in italy turning against nazi germany main article king michaels coup romanian stamp from  commemorating the one year anniversary of the liberation of bessarabia from soviet occupation featuring michael and antonescu below the text un an de la desrobire a year since liberation and the fortress of bender in the background in  world war ii was going badly for the axis powers but the military dictator prime minister marshal ion antonescu was still in control of romania by august  the soviet conquest of romania had become inevitable being expected in a few months on  august  michael joined the proallied politicians a number of army officers and armed communistled civilians in staging a coup against antonescu king michael ordered his arrest by the royal palace guard on the same night the new prime minister lt general constantin sănătescu—who was appointed by king michael—gave custody of antonescu to the communists in spite of alleged instructions to the contrary by the king who delivered him to the soviets on  september in a radio broadcast to the romanian nation and army michael issued a ceasefire just as the red army was penetrating the moldavian front proclaimed romanias loyalty to the allies announced the acceptance of the armistice offered by the united kingdom the united states and the ussr and declared war on germany however this did not avert a rapid soviet occupation and capture of about  romanian soldiers who were transported to the soviet union where many perished in prison camps although the countrys alliance with the nazis was ended the coup sped the red armys advance into romania the armistice was signed three weeks later on  september  on terms the soviets virtually dictated under the terms of the armistice romania recognized its defeat by the ussr and was placed under occupation of the allied forces with the soviets as their representative in control of media communication post and civil administration behind the front the coup effectively amounted to a capitulation an unconditional surrender it has been suggested that the coup may have shortened world war ii by six months thus saving hundreds of thousands of lives at the end of the war king michael was awarded the highest degree chief commander of the legion of merit by us president harry s truman he was also decorated with the soviet order of victory by joseph stalin for the courageous act of the radical change in romanias politics towards a breakup from hitlers germany and an alliance with the united nations at the moment when there was no clear sign yet of germanys defeat according to the official description of the decoration with the death of michał rolażymierski in  michael became the sole surviving recipient of the order of victory reign under communism michael in  in march  political pressures forced king michael to appoint a prosoviet government headed by petru groza for the next twoplus years michael functioned again as little more than a figurehead between august  and january  during what was later known as the royal strike king michael tried unsuccessfully to oppose the groza government by refusing to sign its decrees in response to soviet british and american pressures king michael eventually gave up his opposition to the communist government and stopped demanding its resignation he did not pardon former marshal antonescu who was sentenced to death for betrayal of the romanian people for the benefit of nazi germany for the economic and political subjugation of romania to germany for cooperation with the iron guard for murdering his political opponents for the mass murder of civilians and crimes against peace nor did king michael manage to save such leaders of the opposition as iuliu maniu and the bratianus victims of communist political trials as the constitution prevented him from doing so without the countersignature of communist justice minister lucrețiu pătrășcanu who himself was later eliminated by gheorghiudejs opposing communist faction the memoirs of king michaels aunt princess ileana quoted emil bodnăraș — her alleged lover romanias communist minister of defence and a soviet spy—as saying well if the king decides not to sign the death warrant i promise that we will uphold his point of view princess ileana was sceptical you know quite well  that the king will never of his free will sign such an unconstitutional document if he does it will be laid at your door and before the whole nation your government will bear the blame surely you do not wish this additional handicap at this moment forced abdication abdication act  in november  king michael travelled to london for the wedding of his cousins princess elizabeth later queen elizabeth ii and prince philip of greece and denmark an occasion during which he met princess anne of bourbonparma his second cousin once removed who was to become his wife according to his own account king michael rejected any offers of asylum and decided to return to romania contrary to the confidential strong advice of the british ambassador to romania early on the morning of  december  michael was preparing for a new years party at peleș castle in sinaia when groza summoned him back to bucharest michael returned to elisabeta palace in bucharest to find it surrounded by troops from the tudor vladimirescu division an army unit completely loyal to the communists groza and communist party boss gheorghe gheorghiudej were waiting for him and demanded that he sign a pretyped instrument of abdication unable to call in loyal troops due to his telephone lines allegedly being cut and with either groza or gheorghiudej depending on the source holding a gun on him michael signed the document later the same day the communistdominated government announced the permanent abolition of the monarchy and its replacement by a peoples republic broadcasting the kings prerecorded radio proclamation of his own abdication on  january  michael was forced to leave the country followed over a week later by princesses elisabeth and ileana who collaborated so closely with the soviets that they became known as the kings red aunts he was the last monarch behind the iron curtain to lose his throne according to michaels own account groza had threatened him at gun point and warned that the government would shoot  arrested students if the king did not abdicate in an interview with the new york times from  michael recalls the events it was blackmail they said if you dont sign this immediately we are obliged — why obliged i dont know — to kill more than  students that they had in prison according to time groza threatened to arrest thousands of people and order a bloodbath unless michael abdicated however according to the autobiography of the former head of the soviet intelligence agency nkvd major general pavel sudoplatov the deputy soviet foreign commissar andrey vyshinsky personally conducted negotiations with king michael for his abdication guaranteeing part of a pension to be paid to michael in mexico according to a few articles in jurnalul naţional michaels abdication was negotiated with the communist government which allowed him to leave the country with the goods he requested and by some of the royal retinue according to albanian communist leader enver hoxhas account of his conversations with the romanian communist leaders on the monarchs abdication it was gheorghiudej not groza who forced michaels abdication at gunpoint he was allowed to leave the country accompanied by some of his entourage and as confirmed also by the soviet leader nikita khrushchev recounting gheorghiudejs confessions with whatever properties he desired including gold and rubies hoxha also wrote that procommunist troops surrounded the palace to counter army units who were still loyal to the king in march  michael denounced his abdication as illegal and contended he was still the rightful king of romania according to time magazine he would have done so sooner but for much of early  he had been negotiating with the communists over properties he had left in romania there are reports that romanian communist authorities allowed king michael to depart with  valuable crownowned paintings in november  so that he would leave romania faster some of these paintings were reportedly sold through the famed art dealer daniel wildenstein one of the paintings belonging to the romanian crown which was supposedly taken out of the country by king michael in november  returned to romania in  as a donation made by john kreuger the former husband of king michaels daughter princess irina in  romanian prime minister călin popescutăriceanu denied these accusations about king michael stating that the romanian government has no proof of any such action by king michael and that prior to  the government had no official records of any artwork taken over from the former royal residences however according to some historians such records existed as early as april  having been in fact officially published in june  according to ivor porters authorized biography michael of romania the king and the country  which quotes queenmother helens daily diary the romanian royal family took out paintings belonging to the romanian royal crown on their november  trip to london to the wedding of the future queen elizabeth ii two of these paintings signed by el greco were sold in  according to recently declassified foreign office documents when he left romania the exiled king michaels only assets amounted to  swiss francs recently declassified soviet transcripts of talks between joseph stalin and the romanian primeminister petru groza show that shortly before his abdication king michael received from the communist government assets amounting to  swiss francs king michael however repeatedly denied that the communist government had allowed him to take into exile any financial assets or valuable goods besides four personal automobiles loaded on two train cars life in exile the standard of the king michael never met his father carol after the  abdication michael could see no point in meeting his father who had humiliated his mother so many times via his open affairs and did not attend his fathers funeral in  in january  michael began using one of his familys ancestral titles prince of hohenzollern instead of using the title of king of romania after denouncing his abdication as forced and illegal in march  michael resumed use of the kingly title on  june  in athens greece he married princess anne of bourbonparma born paris  september  his second cousin once removed as princess anne was roman catholic the couple asked for a dispensation from pope pius xii for the marriage negotiations with the vatican broke down when michael refused to promise to raise any future children catholic as it would have been deemed illegal under the romanian constitution of  the dispensation was not given by the pope and their marriage was not deemed valid by the roman catholic church until  the couple lived near florence italy until  near lausanne switzerland until  and then in hampshire england until  after that the couple settled near versoix switzerland where they would live for the next  years the communist romanian authorities stripped michael of his romanian citizenship in  during exile michael worked as farmer pilot entrepreneur and broker with his wife he has five daughters born between  and  return and rehabilitation on  december —a year after the revolution which overthrew the communist dictatorship of nicolae ceaușescu—michael accompanied by several members of the royal family landed at otopeni airport and entered romania for the first time in  years using a danish diplomatic passport michael was able to obtain a hour visa he intended to reach curtea de argeș cathedral pray at the tombs of his royal ancestors and attend the christmas religious service however on their way to curtea de argeș the king and his companions were stopped by a police filter taken to the airport and forced to leave the country in  the romanian government allowed michael to return to romania for easter celebrations where he drew large crowds even though the romanian government denied his request to give a speech from the royal palace now the national museum of art of romania his speech from a hotel room drew over a million people to bucharest to see him michael refused the offer of the president of the national liberal party radu câmpeanu to run for elections as president of romania michaels popularity alarmed the government of president ion iliescu and he was forbidden to visit romania being denied entry twice in  and  in  after iliescus defeat by emil constantinescu the romanian government restored michaels citizenship and again allowed him to visit the country he now lives partly in switzerland at aubonne and partly in romania either at săvârșin castle in arad county or in an official residence in bucharest—the elisabeta palace—voted by the romanian parliament by a law concerning arrangements for former heads of state besides săvârșin castle the former private residences peleș castle and pelișor were also restituted while peleș and pelișor are open to the public elisabeta palace and săvârșin are used as private residences peleș castle pelișor castle săvârșin castle later years fresco of king michael i on the walls of sâmbăta monastery michael i and anne on a  romanian stamp michael has neither encouraged nor opposed monarchist agitation in romania and royalist parties have made little impact in postcommunist romanian politics he takes the view that the restoration of the monarchy in romania can only result from a decision by the romanian people if the people want me to come back of course i will come back he said in  romanians have had enough suffering imposed on them to have the right to be consulted on their future king michaels belief is that there is still a role for and value in the monarchy today we are trying to make people understand what the romanian monarchy was and what it can still do for them according to a  opinion poll conducted at the request of the romanian royal family only  of romanians were in favour of the restoration of the monarchy another  poll found that only  of romanians are monarchists michael has undertaken some quasidiplomatic roles on behalf of postcommunist romania in  and  he toured western europe lobbying for romanias admission into nato and the european union and was received by heads of state and government officials in december  allegedly to the stupefaction of the public opinion in romania michael awarded the man of the year  prize to prime minister adrian năstase leader of the social democratic party psd on behalf of the tabloid vip the daily evenimentul zilei subsequently complained that such an activity was unsuited to a king and that michael was wasting away his prestige with the majority of the political analysts considering his gesture as a fresh abdication on  may  king michael received the prague society for international cooperation and global panel foundations th annual hanno r ellenbogen citizenship award previously awarded to vladimir ashkenazy madeleine albright václav havel lord robertson and miloš forman on  april  king michael and patriarch daniel were elected as honorary members of the romanian academy michael participated in the victory parade in moscow in  as

of victory in old age michael has enjoyed a strong revival in popularity on  october  on the occasion of his th birthday he delivered a speech before the assembled chambers of the romanian parliament an opinion poll in january  placed him as the most trusted public figure in romania far ahead of the political leaders later in october  celebrating michaels st birthday a square in bucharest was renamed after him in a july  survey  of romanians had a good or very good opinion of michael with  thinking the opposite the royal family also enjoyed similar numbers with  having a good or very good opinion of it and just  having a poor or very poor one health issues in march  the royal council announced king michaels retirement from public life tasks are assumed by princess margareta his daughter after a surgery earlier this year king michael was diagnosed with chronic leukemia and metastatic epidermoid carcinoma and will face a complex and lengthy treatment on  august  he became a widower when queen anne died at the age of  political inheritance see also line of succession to the former romanian throne according to the succession provisions of the romanian kingdoms last democratically approved monarchical constitution of  upon the death of king michael without sons the claim to the crown devolves once again upon the hohenzollern family however on  december  on the th anniversary of his abdication king michael signed the fundamental rules of the royal family of romania by which he designated princess margarita as his heir the document has no legal standing as it regulates an institution that is not extant anymore on the same occasion michael also asked the romanian parliament that should it consider restoring the monarchy it should also abolish the salic law of succession on  may  on a background of lawsuits in germany brought against his family by his german relatives regarding the former name hohenzollernveringen of his soninlaw radu and of fears expressed by some that the german hohenzollerns may claim succession to the headship of the romanian royal house michael severed all of the dynastic and historical ties with the princely house of hohenzollern changed the name of his family to of romania and gave up all princely titles conferred upon him and his family by the german hohenzollerns on  august  michael signed a document removing the title prince of romania and the qualification of royal highness from his grandson nicholas medforthmills who was also removed from the line of succession the former king took the decision with an eye on romanias future after the reign and life of his eldest daughter margarita the former king hopes that nicholas will find in future years a suitable way to serve the ideals and use the qualities

of prime minister marshal ion antonescu staged a coup détat against carol ii whom the marshal claimed to be antigerman antonescu suspended the constitution dissolved the parliament and reinstalled the yearold michael as king by popular acclaim although the constitution was restored in  and the romanian parliament in  michael did not either subsequently take a formal oath or have his reign approved

military dictator prime minister marshal ion antonescu was still in control of romania by august  the soviet conquest of romania had become inevitable being expected in a few months on  august  michael joined the proallied politicians a number of army officers and armed communistled civilians in staging a coup against antonescu king michael ordered his arrest by the royal palace guard on the same night the new prime minister lt general constantin sănătescu—who was appointed by king michael—gave custody of antonescu to the communists in spite of alleged instructions to the contrary by the king who delivered him to the soviets on  september in a radio broadcast to the romanian nation and army michael issued a ceasefire just as the red army was penetrating the moldavian front proclaimed romanias loyalty to the allies announced the acceptance of the armistice offered by the united kingdom the united states and the ussr and declared war on germany however this did not avert a rapid soviet occupation and capture of about  romanian soldiers who were transported to the soviet union where many perished in prison camps although the countrys alliance with the nazis was ended the coup sped the red armys advance into romania the armistice was signed three weeks later on  september  on terms the soviets virtually dictated under the terms of the armistice romania recognized its defeat by the ussr and was placed under occupation of the allied forces with the soviets as their representative in control of media communication post and civil administration behind the front the coup effectively amounted to a capitulation an unconditional surrender it has been suggested that the coup may have shortened world war ii by six months thus saving hundreds of thousands of lives at the end of the war king michael was awarded the highest degree chief commander of the legion of merit by us president harry s truman he was also decorated with the soviet order of victory by joseph stalin for the courageous act of the radical change in romanias politics towards a breakup from hitlers germany and an alliance with the united nations at the moment when there was no clear sign yet of germanys defeat according to the official description of the decoration with the death of michał rolażymierski in  michael became the sole surviving recipient of the order of victory reign under communism michael in  in march  political pressures forced king michael to appoint a prosoviet government headed by petru groza for the next twoplus years michael functioned again as little more than a figurehead between august  and january  during what was later known as the royal strike king michael tried unsuccessfully to oppose the groza government by refusing to sign its decrees in response to soviet british and american pressures king michael eventually gave up his opposition to the communist government and stopped demanding its resignation he did not pardon former marshal antonescu who was sentenced to death for betrayal of the romanian people for the benefit of nazi germany for the economic and political subjugation of romania to germany for cooperation with the iron guard for murdering his political opponents for the mass murder of civilians and crimes against peace nor did king michael manage to save such leaders of the opposition as iuliu maniu and the bratianus victims of communist political trials as the constitution prevented him from doing so without the countersignature of communist justice minister lucrețiu pătrășcanu who himself was later eliminated by gheorghiudejs opposing communist faction the memoirs of king michaels aunt princess ileana quoted emil bodnăraș — her alleged lover romanias communist minister of defence and a soviet spy—as saying well if the king decides not to sign the death warrant i promise that we will uphold his point of view princess ileana was sceptical you know quite well  that the king will never of his free will sign such an unconstitutional document if he does it will be laid at your door and before the whole nation your government will bear the blame surely you do not wish this additional handicap at this moment forced abdication abdication act  in november  king michael travelled to london for the wedding of his cousins princess elizabeth later queen elizabeth ii and prince philip of greece and denmark an occasion during which he met princess anne of bourbonparma his second cousin once removed who was to become his wife according to his own account king michael rejected any offers of asylum and decided to return to romania contrary to the confidential strong advice of the british ambassador to romania early on the morning of  december  michael was preparing for a new years party at peleș castle in sinaia when groza summoned him back to bucharest michael returned to elisabeta palace in bucharest to find it surrounded by troops from the tudor vladimirescu division an army unit completely loyal to the communists groza and communist party boss gheorghe gheorghiudej were waiting for him and demanded that he sign a pretyped instrument of abdication unable to call in loyal troops due to his telephone lines allegedly being cut and with either groza or gheorghiudej depending on the source holding a gun on him michael signed the document later the same day the communistdominated government announced the permanent abolition of the monarchy and its replacement by a peoples republic broadcasting the kings prerecorded radio proclamation of his own abdication on  january  michael was forced to leave the country followed over a week later by princesses elisabeth and ileana who collaborated so closely with the soviets that they became known as the kings red aunts he was the last monarch behind the iron curtain to lose his throne according to michaels own account groza had threatened him at gun point and warned that the government would shoot  arrested students if the king did not abdicate in an interview with the new york times from  michael recalls the events it was blackmail they said if you dont sign this immediately we are obliged — why obliged i dont know — to kill more than  students that they had in prison according to time groza threatened to arrest thousands of people and order a bloodbath unless michael abdicated however according to the autobiography of the former head of the soviet intelligence agency nkvd major general pavel sudoplatov the deputy soviet foreign commissar andrey vyshinsky personally conducted negotiations with king michael for his abdication guaranteeing part of a pension to be paid to michael in mexico according to a few articles in jurnalul naţional michaels abdication was negotiated with the communist government which allowed him to leave the country with the goods he requested and by some of the royal retinue according to albanian communist leader enver hoxhas account of his conversations with the romanian communist leaders on the monarchs abdication it was gheorghiudej not groza who forced michaels abdication at gunpoint he was allowed to leave the country accompanied by some of his entourage and as confirmed also by the soviet leader nikita khrushchev recounting gheorghiudejs confessions with whatever properties he desired including gold and rubies hoxha also wrote that procommunist troops surrounded the palace to counter army units who were still loyal to the king in march  michael denounced his abdication as illegal and contended he was still the rightful king of romania according to time magazine he would have done so sooner but for much of early  he had been negotiating with the communists over properties he had left in romania there are reports that romanian communist authorities allowed king michael to depart with  valuable crownowned paintings in november  so that he would leave romania faster some of these paintings were reportedly sold through the famed art dealer daniel wildenstein one of the paintings belonging to the romanian crown which was supposedly taken out of the country by king michael in november  returned to romania in  as a donation made by john kreuger the former husband of king michaels daughter princess irina in  romanian prime minister călin popescutăriceanu denied these accusations about king michael stating that the romanian government has no proof of any such action by king michael and that prior to  the government had no official records of any artwork taken over from the former royal residences however according to some historians such records existed as early as april  having been in fact officially published in june  according to ivor porters authorized biography michael of romania the king and the country  which quotes queenmother helens daily diary the romanian royal family took out paintings belonging to the romanian royal crown on their november  trip to london to the wedding of the future queen elizabeth ii two of these paintings signed by el greco were sold in  according to recently declassified foreign office documents when he left romania the exiled king michaels only assets amounted to  swiss francs recently declassified soviet transcripts of talks between joseph stalin and the romanian primeminister petru groza show that shortly before his abdication king michael received from the communist government assets amounting to  swiss francs king michael however repeatedly denied that the communist government had allowed him to take into exile any financial assets or valuable goods besides four personal automobiles loaded on two train cars life in exile the standard of the king michael never met his father carol after the  abdication michael could see no point in meeting his father who had humiliated his mother so many times via his open affairs and did not attend his fathers funeral in  in january  michael began using one of his familys ancestral titles prince of hohenzollern instead of using the title of king of romania after denouncing his abdication as forced and illegal in march  michael resumed use of the kingly title on  june  in athens greece he married princess anne of bourbonparma born paris  september  his second cousin once removed as princess anne was roman catholic the couple asked for a dispensation from pope pius xii for the marriage negotiations with the vatican broke down when michael refused to promise to raise any future children catholic as it would have been deemed illegal under the romanian constitution of  the dispensation was not given by the pope and their marriage was not deemed valid by the roman catholic church until  the couple lived near florence italy until  near lausanne switzerland until  and then in hampshire england until  after that the couple settled near versoix switzerland where they would live for the next  years the communist romanian authorities stripped michael of his romanian citizenship in  during exile michael worked as farmer pilot entrepreneur and broker with his wife he has five daughters born between  and  return and rehabilitation on  december —a year after the revolution which overthrew the communist dictatorship of nicolae ceaușescu—michael accompanied by several members of the royal family landed at otopeni airport and entered romania for the first time in  years using a danish diplomatic passport michael was able to obtain a hour visa he intended to reach curtea de argeș cathedral pray at the tombs of his royal ancestors and attend the christmas religious service however on their way to curtea de argeș the king and his companions were stopped by a police filter taken to the airport and forced to leave the country in  the romanian government allowed michael to return to romania for easter celebrations where he drew large crowds even though the romanian government denied his request to give a speech from the royal palace now the national museum of art of romania his speech from a hotel room drew over a million people to bucharest to see him michael refused the offer of the president of the national liberal party radu câmpeanu to run for elections as president of romania michaels popularity alarmed the government of president ion iliescu and he was forbidden to visit romania being denied entry twice in  and  in  after iliescus defeat by emil constantinescu the romanian government restored michaels citizenship and again allowed him to visit the country he now lives partly in switzerland at aubonne and partly in romania either at săvârșin castle in arad county or in an official residence in bucharest—the elisabeta palace—voted by the romanian parliament by a law concerning arrangements for former heads of state besides săvârșin castle the former private residences peleș castle and pelișor were also restituted while peleș and pelișor are open to the public elisabeta palace and săvârșin are used as private residences peleș castle pelișor castle săvârșin castle later years fresco of king michael i on the walls of sâmbăta monastery michael i and anne on a  romanian stamp michael has neither encouraged nor opposed monarchist agitation in romania and royalist parties have made little impact in postcommunist romanian politics he takes the view that the restoration of the monarchy in romania can only result from a decision by the romanian people if the people want me to come back of course i will come back he said in  romanians have had enough suffering imposed on them to have the right to be consulted on their future king michaels belief is that there is still a role for and value in the monarchy today we are trying to make people understand what the romanian monarchy was and what it can still do for them according to a  opinion poll conducted at the request of the romanian royal family only  of romanians were in favour of the restoration of the monarchy another  poll found that only  of romanians are monarchists michael has undertaken some quasidiplomatic roles on behalf of postcommunist romania in  and  he toured western europe lobbying for romanias admission into nato and the european union and was received by heads of state and government officials in december  allegedly to the stupefaction of the public opinion in romania michael awarded the man of the year  prize to prime minister adrian năstase leader of the social democratic party psd on behalf of the tabloid vip the daily evenimentul zilei subsequently complained that such an activity was unsuited to a king and that michael was wasting away his prestige with the majority of the political analysts considering his gesture as a fresh abdication on  may  king michael received the prague society for international cooperation and global panel foundations th annual hanno r ellenbogen citizenship award previously awarded to vladimir ashkenazy madeleine albright václav havel lord robertson and miloš forman on  april  king michael

in popularity on  october  on the occasion of his th birthday he delivered a speech before the assembled chambers of the romanian parliament an opinion poll in january  placed him as the most trusted public figure in romania far ahead of the political leaders later in october  celebrating michaels st birthday a square in bucharest was renamed after him in a july  survey  of romanians had a good or very good opinion of michael with  thinking the opposite the royal family also enjoyed similar numbers with  having a good or very good opinion of it and just  having a poor or very poor one health

also line of succession to the former romanian throne according to the succession provisions of the romanian kingdoms last democratically approved monarchical constitution of  upon the death of king michael without sons the claim to the crown devolves once again upon the hohenzollern family however on  december  on the th anniversary of his abdication king michael signed the fundamental rules of the royal family of romania by which he designated princess margarita as his heir the document has no legal standing as it regulates an institution that is not extant anymore on the same occasion michael also asked the romanian parliament that should it consider restoring the monarchy it should also abolish the salic law of succession on  may  on a background of lawsuits in germany brought against his family by his german relatives regarding the former name hohenzollernveringen of his soninlaw radu and of fears expressed by some that the german hohenzollerns may claim succession to the headship of the romanian royal house michael severed all of the dynastic and historical ties with the princely house of hohenzollern changed the name of his family to of romania and gave up all princely titles conferred upon him and his family by the german hohenzollerns on  august  michael signed a document removing the title prince of romania and the qualification of royal highness from his grandson nicholas medforthmills who was also removed from the line of succession the former king took the decision with an eye on romanias future after the reign and life of his eldest daughter

cristea and the president of the supreme court gheorghe buzdugan the council proved to be ineffective and in  carol returned to romania and replaced his son as king as a result michael returned to

throne in december  michael was declared heir apparent michael succeeded to the throne of romania upon ferdinands death in july  rule s and the antonescu era michael and marshal ion antonescu on the banks of prut river a regency which included his uncle prince nicolae patriarch miron cristea and the countrys chief justice gheorghe buzdugan from october  constantin sărățeanu functioned on behalf of the yearold michael when he succeeded ferdinand in  in  carol ii returned to the country at the invitation of politicians dissatisfied with the regency and was proclaimed king by the parliament designating michael as crown prince with the title grand voievod of albaiulia in november  michael joined the romanian senate as the  constitution guaranteed him a seat there upon reaching the age of eighteen in september  the progerman antibolshevik régime of prime minister marshal ion antonescu staged a coup détat against carol ii whom the marshal claimed to be antigerman antonescu suspended the constitution dissolved the parliament and reinstalled the yearold michael as king by popular acclaim although the constitution was restored in  and the romanian parliament in  michael did not either subsequently take a formal oath or have his reign approved retroactively by parliament michael was crowned with the steel crown and anointed king of romania by the orthodox patriarch of romania nicodim munteanu in the patriarchal cathedral of bucharest on the day of his accession  september  although king michael was formally the supreme head of the army and entitled to appoint the prime minister with full powers named leader of the people conducător in reality he was forced to remain only a figurehead until august  michael had lunch with adolf hitler twice once with his father in bavaria in  and with his mother in berlin in  he also met benito mussolini in  in italy turning against nazi germany main article king michaels coup romanian stamp from  commemorating the one year anniversary of the liberation of bessarabia from soviet occupation featuring michael and antonescu below the text un an de la desrobire a year since liberation and the fortress of bender in the background in  world war ii was going badly for the axis powers but the military dictator prime minister marshal ion antonescu was still in control of romania by august  the soviet conquest of romania had become inevitable being expected in a few months on  august  michael joined the proallied politicians a number of army officers and armed communistled civilians in staging a coup against antonescu king michael ordered his arrest by the royal palace guard on the same night the new prime minister lt general constantin sănătescu—who was appointed by king michael—gave custody of antonescu to the communists in spite of alleged instructions to the contrary by the king who delivered him to the soviets on  september in a radio broadcast to the romanian nation and army michael issued a ceasefire just as the red army was penetrating the moldavian front proclaimed romanias loyalty to the allies announced the acceptance of the armistice offered by the united kingdom the united states and the ussr and declared war on germany however this did not avert a rapid soviet occupation and capture of about  romanian soldiers who were transported to the soviet union where many perished in prison camps although the countrys alliance with the nazis was ended the coup sped the red armys advance into romania the armistice was signed three weeks later on  september  on terms the soviets virtually dictated under the terms of the armistice romania recognized its defeat by the ussr and was placed under occupation of the allied forces with the soviets as their representative in control of media communication post and civil administration behind the front the coup effectively amounted to a capitulation an unconditional surrender it has been suggested that the coup may have shortened world war ii by six months thus saving hundreds of thousands of lives at the end of the war king michael was awarded the highest degree chief commander of the legion of merit by us president harry s truman he was also decorated with the soviet order of victory by joseph stalin for the courageous act of the radical change in romanias politics towards a breakup from hitlers germany and an alliance with the united nations at the moment when there was no clear sign yet of germanys defeat according to the official description of the decoration with the death of michał rolażymierski in  michael became the sole surviving recipient of the order of victory reign under communism michael in  in march  political pressures forced king michael to appoint a prosoviet government headed by petru groza for the next twoplus years michael functioned again as little more than a figurehead between august  and january  during what was later known as the royal strike king michael tried unsuccessfully to oppose the groza government by refusing to sign its decrees in response to soviet british and american pressures king michael eventually gave up his opposition to the communist government and stopped demanding its resignation he did not pardon former marshal antonescu who was sentenced to death for betrayal of the romanian people for the benefit of nazi germany for the economic and political subjugation of romania to germany for cooperation with the iron guard for murdering his political opponents for the mass murder of civilians and crimes against peace nor did king michael manage to save such leaders of the opposition as iuliu maniu and the bratianus victims of communist political trials as the constitution prevented him from doing so without the countersignature of communist justice minister lucrețiu pătrășcanu who himself was later eliminated by gheorghiudejs opposing communist faction the memoirs of king michaels aunt princess ileana quoted emil bodnăraș — her alleged lover romanias communist minister of defence and a soviet spy—as saying well if the king decides not to sign the death warrant i promise that we will uphold his point of view princess ileana was sceptical you know quite well  that the king will never of his free will sign such an unconstitutional document if he does it will be laid at your door and before the whole nation your government will bear the blame surely you do not wish this additional handicap at this moment forced abdication abdication act  in november  king michael travelled to london for the wedding of his cousins princess elizabeth later queen elizabeth ii and prince philip of greece and denmark an occasion during which he met princess anne of bourbonparma his second cousin once removed who was to become his wife according to his own account king michael rejected any offers of asylum and decided to return to romania contrary to the confidential strong advice of the british ambassador to romania early on the morning of  december  michael was preparing for a new years party at peleș castle in sinaia when groza summoned him back to bucharest michael returned to elisabeta palace in bucharest to find it surrounded by troops from the tudor vladimirescu division an army unit completely loyal to the communists groza and communist party boss gheorghe gheorghiudej were waiting for him and demanded that he sign a pretyped instrument of abdication unable to call in loyal troops due to his telephone lines allegedly being cut and with either groza or gheorghiudej depending on the source holding a gun on him michael signed the document later the same day the communistdominated government announced the permanent abolition of the monarchy and its replacement by a peoples republic broadcasting the kings prerecorded radio proclamation of his own abdication on  january  michael was forced to leave the country followed over a week later by princesses elisabeth and ileana who collaborated so closely with the soviets that they became known as the kings red aunts he was the last monarch behind the iron curtain to lose his throne according to michaels own account groza had threatened him at gun point and warned that the government would shoot  arrested students if the king did not abdicate in an interview with the new york times from  michael recalls the events it was blackmail they said if you dont sign this immediately we are obliged — why obliged i dont know — to kill more than  students that they had in prison according to time groza threatened to arrest thousands of people and order a bloodbath unless michael abdicated however according to the autobiography of the former head of the soviet intelligence agency nkvd major general pavel sudoplatov the deputy soviet foreign commissar andrey vyshinsky personally conducted negotiations with king michael for his abdication guaranteeing part of a pension to be paid to michael in mexico according to a few articles in jurnalul naţional michaels abdication was negotiated with the communist government which allowed him to leave the country with the goods he requested and by some of the royal retinue according to albanian communist leader enver hoxhas account of his conversations with the romanian communist leaders on the monarchs abdication it was gheorghiudej not groza who forced michaels abdication at gunpoint he was allowed to leave the country accompanied by some of his entourage and as confirmed also by the soviet leader nikita khrushchev recounting gheorghiudejs confessions with whatever properties he desired including gold and rubies hoxha also wrote that procommunist troops surrounded the palace to counter army units who were still loyal to the king in march  michael denounced his abdication as illegal and contended he was still the rightful king of romania according to time magazine he would have done so sooner but for much of early  he had been negotiating with the communists over properties he had left in romania there are reports that romanian communist authorities allowed king michael to depart with  valuable crownowned paintings in november  so that he would leave romania faster some of these paintings were reportedly sold through the famed art dealer daniel wildenstein one of the paintings belonging to the romanian crown which was supposedly taken out of the country by king michael in november  returned to romania in  as a donation made by john kreuger the former husband of king michaels daughter princess irina in  romanian prime minister călin popescutăriceanu denied these accusations about king michael stating that the romanian government has no proof of any such action by king michael and that prior to  the government had no official records of any artwork taken over from the former royal residences however according to some historians such records existed as early as april  having been in fact officially published in june  according to ivor porters authorized biography michael of romania the king and the country  which quotes queenmother helens daily diary the romanian royal family took out paintings belonging to the romanian royal crown on their november  trip to london to the wedding of the future queen elizabeth ii two of these paintings signed by el greco were sold in  according to recently declassified foreign office documents when he left romania the exiled king michaels only assets amounted to  swiss francs recently declassified soviet transcripts of talks between joseph stalin and the romanian primeminister petru groza show that shortly before his abdication king michael received from the communist government assets amounting to  swiss francs king michael however repeatedly denied that the communist government had allowed him to take into exile any financial assets or valuable goods besides four personal automobiles loaded on two train cars life in exile the standard of the king michael never met his father carol after the  abdication michael could see no point in meeting his father who had humiliated his mother so many times via his open affairs and did not attend his fathers funeral in  in january  michael began using one of his familys ancestral titles prince of hohenzollern instead of using the title of king of romania after denouncing his abdication as forced and illegal in march  michael resumed use of the kingly title on  june  in athens greece he married princess anne of bourbonparma born paris  september  his second cousin once removed as princess anne was roman catholic the couple asked for a dispensation from pope pius xii for the marriage negotiations with the vatican broke down when michael refused to promise to raise any future children catholic as it would have been deemed illegal under the romanian constitution of  the dispensation was not given by the pope and their marriage was not deemed valid by the roman catholic church until  the couple lived near florence italy until  near lausanne switzerland until  and then in hampshire england until  after that the couple settled near versoix switzerland where they would live for the next  years the communist romanian authorities stripped michael of his romanian citizenship in  during exile michael worked as farmer pilot entrepreneur and broker with his wife he has five daughters born between  and  return and rehabilitation on  december —a year after the revolution which overthrew the communist dictatorship of nicolae ceaușescu—michael accompanied by several members of the royal family landed at otopeni airport and entered romania for the first time in  years using a danish diplomatic passport michael was able to obtain a hour visa he intended to reach curtea de argeș cathedral pray at the tombs of his royal ancestors and attend the christmas religious service however on their way to curtea de argeș the king and his companions were stopped by a police filter taken to the airport and forced to leave the country in  the romanian government allowed michael to return to romania for easter celebrations where he drew large crowds even though the romanian government denied his request to give a speech from the royal palace now the national museum of art of romania his speech from a hotel room drew over a million people to bucharest to see him michael refused the offer of the president of the national liberal party radu câmpeanu to run for elections as president of romania michaels popularity alarmed the government of president ion iliescu and he was forbidden to visit romania being denied entry twice in  and  in  after iliescus defeat by emil constantinescu the romanian government restored michaels citizenship and again allowed him to visit the country he now lives partly in switzerland at aubonne and partly in romania either at săvârșin castle in arad county or in an official residence in bucharest—the elisabeta palace—voted by the romanian parliament by a law concerning arrangements for former heads of state besides săvârșin castle the former private residences peleș castle and pelișor were also restituted while peleș and pelișor are open to the public elisabeta palace and săvârșin are used as private residences peleș castle pelișor castle săvârșin castle later years fresco of king michael i on the walls of sâmbăta monastery michael i and anne on a  romanian stamp michael has neither encouraged nor opposed monarchist agitation in romania and royalist parties have made little impact in postcommunist romanian politics he takes the view that the restoration of the monarchy in romania can only result from a decision by the romanian people if the people want me to come back of course i will come back he said in  romanians have had enough suffering imposed on them to have the right to be consulted on their future king michaels belief is that there is still a role for and value in the monarchy today we are trying to make people understand what the romanian monarchy was and what it can still do for them according to a  opinion poll conducted at the request of the romanian royal family only  of romanians were in favour of the restoration of the monarchy another  poll found that only  of romanians are monarchists michael has undertaken some quasidiplomatic roles on behalf of postcommunist romania in  and  he toured western europe lobbying for romanias admission into nato and the european union and was received by heads of state and government officials in december  allegedly to the stupefaction of the public opinion in romania michael awarded the man of the year  prize to prime minister adrian năstase leader of the social democratic party psd on behalf of the tabloid vip the daily evenimentul zilei subsequently complained that such an activity was unsuited to a king and that michael was wasting away his prestige with the majority of the political analysts considering his gesture as a fresh abdication on  may  king michael received the prague society for international cooperation and global panel foundations th annual hanno r ellenbogen citizenship award previously awarded to vladimir ashkenazy madeleine albright václav havel lord robertson and miloš forman on  april  king michael and patriarch daniel were elected as honorary members of the romanian academy michael participated in the victory parade in moscow in  as

of victory in old age michael has enjoyed a strong revival in popularity on  october  on the occasion of his th birthday he delivered a speech before the assembled chambers of the romanian parliament an opinion poll in january  placed him as the most trusted public figure in romania far ahead of the political leaders later in october  celebrating michaels st birthday a square in bucharest was renamed after him in a july  survey  of romanians had a good or very good opinion of michael with  thinking the opposite the royal family also enjoyed similar numbers with  having a good or very good opinion of it and just  having a poor or very poor one health issues in march  the royal council announced king michaels retirement from public life tasks are assumed by princess margareta his daughter after a surgery earlier this year king michael was diagnosed with chronic leukemia and metastatic epidermoid carcinoma and will face a complex and lengthy treatment on  august  he became a widower when queen anne died at the age of  political inheritance see also line of succession to the former romanian throne according to the succession provisions of the romanian kingdoms last democratically approved monarchical constitution of  upon the death of king michael without sons the claim to the crown devolves once again upon the hohenzollern family however on  december  on the th anniversary of his abdication king michael signed the fundamental rules of the royal family of romania by which he designated princess margarita as his heir the document has no legal standing as it regulates an institution that is not extant anymore on the same occasion michael also asked the romanian parliament that should it consider restoring the monarchy it should also abolish the salic law of succession on  may  on a background of lawsuits in germany brought against his family by his german relatives regarding the former name hohenzollernveringen of his soninlaw radu and of fears expressed by some that the german hohenzollerns may claim succession to the headship of the romanian royal house michael severed all of the dynastic and historical ties with the princely house of hohenzollern changed the name of his family to of romania and gave up all princely titles conferred upon him and his family by the german hohenzollerns on  august  michael signed a document removing the title prince of romania and the qualification of royal highness from his grandson nicholas medforthmills who was also removed from the line of succession the former king took the decision with an eye on romanias future after the reign and life of his eldest daughter margarita the former king hopes that nicholas will find in future years a suitable way to serve the ideals and use the qualities

military dictator prime minister marshal ion antonescu was still in control of romania by august  the soviet conquest of romania had become inevitable being expected in a few months on  august  michael joined the proallied politicians a number of army officers and armed communistled civilians in staging a coup against antonescu king michael ordered his arrest by the royal palace guard on the same night the new prime minister lt general constantin sănătescu—who was appointed by king michael—gave custody of antonescu to the communists in spite of alleged instructions to the contrary by the king who delivered him to the soviets on  september in a radio broadcast to the romanian nation and army michael issued a ceasefire just as the red army was penetrating the moldavian front proclaimed romanias loyalty to the allies announced the acceptance of the armistice offered by the united kingdom the united states and the ussr and declared war on germany however this did not avert a rapid soviet occupation and capture of about  romanian soldiers who were transported to the soviet union where many perished in prison camps although the countrys alliance with the nazis was ended the coup sped the red armys advance into romania the armistice was signed three weeks later on  september  on terms the soviets virtually dictated under the terms of the armistice romania recognized its defeat by the ussr and was placed under occupation of the allied forces with the soviets as their representative in control of media communication post and civil administration behind the front the coup effectively amounted to a capitulation an unconditional surrender it has been suggested that the coup may have shortened world war ii by six months thus saving hundreds of thousands of lives at the end of the war king michael was awarded the highest degree chief commander of the legion of merit by us president harry s truman he was also decorated with the soviet order of victory by joseph stalin for the courageous act of the radical change in romanias politics towards a breakup from hitlers germany and an alliance with the united nations at the moment when there was no clear sign yet of germanys defeat according to the official description of the decoration with the death of michał rolażymierski in  michael became the sole surviving recipient of the order of victory reign under communism michael in  in march  political pressures forced king michael to appoint a prosoviet government headed by petru groza for the next twoplus years michael functioned again as little more than a figurehead between august  and january  during what was later known as the royal strike king michael tried unsuccessfully to oppose the groza government by refusing to sign its decrees in response to soviet british and american pressures king michael eventually gave up his opposition to the communist government and stopped demanding its resignation he did not pardon former marshal antonescu who was sentenced to death for betrayal of the romanian people for the benefit of nazi germany for the economic and political subjugation of romania to germany for cooperation with the iron guard for murdering his political opponents for the mass murder of civilians and crimes against peace nor did king michael manage to save such leaders of the opposition as iuliu maniu and the bratianus victims of communist political trials as the constitution prevented him from doing so without the countersignature of communist justice minister lucrețiu pătrășcanu who himself was later eliminated by gheorghiudejs opposing communist faction the memoirs of king michaels aunt princess ileana quoted emil bodnăraș — her alleged lover romanias communist minister of defence and a soviet spy—as saying well if the king decides not to sign the death warrant i promise that we will uphold his point of view princess ileana was sceptical you know quite well  that the king will never of his free will sign such an unconstitutional document if he does it will be laid at your door and before the whole nation your government will bear the blame surely you do not wish this additional handicap at this moment forced abdication abdication act  in november  king michael travelled to london for the wedding of his cousins princess elizabeth later queen elizabeth ii and prince philip of greece and denmark an occasion during which he met princess anne of bourbonparma his second cousin once removed who was to become his wife according to his own account king michael rejected any offers of asylum and decided to return to romania contrary to the confidential strong advice of the british ambassador to romania early on the morning of  december  michael was preparing for a new years party at peleș castle in sinaia when groza summoned him back to bucharest michael returned to elisabeta palace in bucharest to find it surrounded by troops from the tudor vladimirescu division an army unit completely loyal to the communists groza and communist party boss gheorghe gheorghiudej were waiting for him and demanded that he sign a pretyped instrument of abdication unable to call in loyal troops due to his telephone lines allegedly being cut and with either groza or gheorghiudej depending on the source holding a gun on him michael signed the document later the same day the communistdominated government announced the permanent abolition of the monarchy and its replacement by a peoples republic broadcasting the kings prerecorded radio proclamation of his own abdication on  january  michael was forced to leave the country followed over a week later by princesses elisabeth and ileana who collaborated so closely with the soviets that they became known as the kings red aunts he was the last monarch behind the iron curtain to lose his throne according to michaels own account groza had threatened him at gun point and warned that the government would shoot  arrested students if the king did not abdicate in an interview with the new york times from  michael recalls the events it was blackmail they said if you dont sign this immediately we are obliged — why obliged i dont know — to kill more than  students that they had in prison according to time groza threatened to arrest thousands of people and order a bloodbath unless michael abdicated however according to the autobiography of the former head of the soviet intelligence agency nkvd major general pavel sudoplatov the deputy soviet foreign commissar andrey vyshinsky personally conducted negotiations with king michael for his abdication guaranteeing part of a pension to be paid to michael in mexico according to a few articles in jurnalul naţional michaels abdication was negotiated with the communist government which allowed him to leave the country with the goods he requested and by some of the royal retinue according to albanian communist leader enver hoxhas account of his conversations with the romanian communist leaders on the monarchs abdication it was gheorghiudej not groza who forced michaels abdication at gunpoint he was allowed to leave the country accompanied by some of his entourage and as confirmed also by the soviet leader nikita khrushchev recounting gheorghiudejs confessions with whatever properties he desired including gold and rubies hoxha also wrote that procommunist troops surrounded the palace to counter army units who were still loyal to the king in march  michael denounced his abdication as illegal and contended he was still the rightful king of romania according to time magazine he would have done so sooner but for much of early  he had been negotiating with the communists over properties he had left in romania there are reports that romanian communist authorities allowed king michael to depart with  valuable crownowned paintings in november  so that he would leave romania faster some of these paintings were reportedly sold through the famed art dealer daniel wildenstein one of the paintings belonging to the romanian crown which was supposedly taken out of the country by king michael in november  returned to romania in  as a donation made by john kreuger the former husband of king michaels daughter princess irina in  romanian prime minister călin popescutăriceanu denied these accusations about king michael stating that the romanian government has no proof of any such action by king michael and that prior to  the government had no official records of any artwork taken over from the former royal residences however according to some historians such records existed as early as april  having been in fact officially published in june  according to ivor porters authorized biography michael of romania the king and the country  which quotes queenmother helens daily diary the romanian royal family took out paintings belonging to the romanian royal crown on their november  trip to london to the wedding of the future queen elizabeth ii two of these paintings signed by el greco were sold in  according to recently declassified foreign office documents when he left romania the exiled king michaels only assets amounted to  swiss francs recently declassified soviet transcripts of talks between joseph stalin and the romanian primeminister petru groza show that shortly before his abdication king michael received from the communist government assets amounting to  swiss francs king michael however repeatedly denied that the communist government had allowed him to take into exile any financial assets or valuable goods besides four personal automobiles loaded on two train cars life in exile the standard of the king michael never met his father carol after the  abdication michael could see no point in meeting his father who had humiliated his mother so many times via his open affairs and did not attend his fathers funeral in  in january  michael began using one of his familys ancestral titles prince of hohenzollern instead of using the title of king of romania after denouncing his abdication as forced and illegal in march  michael resumed use of the kingly title on  june  in athens greece he married princess anne of bourbonparma born paris  september  his second cousin once removed as princess anne was roman catholic the couple asked for a dispensation from pope pius xii for the marriage negotiations with the vatican broke down when michael refused to promise to raise any future children catholic as it would have been deemed illegal under the romanian constitution of  the dispensation was not given by the pope and their marriage was not deemed valid by the roman catholic church until  the couple lived near florence italy until  near lausanne switzerland until  and then in hampshire england until  after that the couple settled near versoix switzerland where they would live for the next  years the communist romanian authorities stripped michael of his romanian citizenship in  during exile michael worked as farmer pilot entrepreneur and broker with his wife he has five daughters born between  and  return and rehabilitation on  december —a year after the revolution which overthrew the communist dictatorship of nicolae ceaușescu—michael accompanied by several members of the royal family landed at otopeni airport and entered romania for the first time in  years using a danish diplomatic passport michael was able to obtain a hour visa he intended to reach curtea de argeș cathedral pray at the tombs of his royal ancestors and attend the christmas religious service however on their way to curtea de argeș the king and his companions were stopped by a police filter taken to the airport and forced to leave the country in  the romanian government allowed michael to return to romania for easter celebrations where he drew large crowds even though the romanian government denied his request to give a speech from the royal palace now the national museum of art of romania his speech from a hotel room drew over a million people to bucharest to see him michael refused the offer of the president of the national liberal party radu câmpeanu to run for elections as president of romania michaels popularity alarmed the government of president ion iliescu and he was forbidden to visit romania being denied entry twice in  and  in  after iliescus defeat by emil constantinescu the romanian government restored michaels citizenship and again allowed him to visit the country he now lives partly in switzerland at aubonne and partly in romania either at săvârșin castle in arad county or in an official residence in bucharest—the elisabeta palace—voted by the romanian parliament by a law concerning arrangements for former heads of state besides săvârșin castle the former private residences peleș castle and pelișor were also restituted while peleș and pelișor are open to the public elisabeta palace and săvârșin are used as private residences peleș castle pelișor castle săvârșin castle later years fresco of king michael i on the walls of sâmbăta monastery michael i and anne on a  romanian stamp michael has neither encouraged nor opposed monarchist agitation in romania and royalist parties have made little impact in postcommunist romanian politics he takes the view that the restoration of the monarchy in romania can only result from a decision by the romanian people if the people want me to come back of course i will come back he said in  romanians have had enough suffering imposed on them to have the right to be consulted on their future king michaels belief is that there is still a role for and value in the monarchy today we are trying to make people understand what the romanian monarchy was and what it can still do for them according to a  opinion poll conducted at the request of the romanian royal family only  of romanians were in favour of the restoration of the monarchy another  poll found that only  of romanians are monarchists michael has undertaken some quasidiplomatic roles on behalf of postcommunist romania in  and  he toured western europe lobbying for romanias admission into nato and the european union and was received by heads of state and government officials in december  allegedly to the stupefaction of the public opinion in romania michael awarded the man of the year  prize to prime minister adrian năstase leader of the social democratic party psd on behalf of the tabloid vip the daily evenimentul zilei subsequently complained that such an activity was unsuited to a king and that michael was wasting away his prestige with the majority of the political analysts considering his gesture as a fresh abdication on  may  king michael received the prague society for international cooperation and global panel foundations th annual hanno r ellenbogen citizenship award previously awarded to vladimir ashkenazy madeleine albright václav havel lord robertson and miloš forman on  april  king michael

in popularity on  october  on the occasion of his th birthday he delivered a speech before the assembled chambers of the romanian parliament an opinion poll in january  placed him as the most trusted public figure in romania far ahead of the political leaders later in october  celebrating michaels st birthday a square in bucharest was renamed after him in a july  survey  of romanians had a good or very good opinion of michael with  thinking the opposite the royal family also enjoyed similar numbers with  having a good or very good opinion of it and just  having a poor or very poor one health

also line of succession to the former romanian throne according to the succession provisions of the romanian kingdoms last democratically approved monarchical constitution of  upon the death of king michael without sons the claim to the crown devolves once again upon the hohenzollern family however on  december  on the th anniversary of his abdication king michael signed the fundamental rules of the royal family of romania by which he designated princess margarita as his heir the document has no legal standing as it regulates an institution that is not extant anymore on the same occasion michael also asked the romanian parliament that should it consider restoring the monarchy it should also abolish the salic law of succession on  may  on a background of lawsuits in germany brought against his family by his german relatives regarding the former name hohenzollernveringen of his soninlaw radu and of fears expressed by some that the german hohenzollerns may claim succession to the headship of the romanian royal house michael severed all of the dynastic and historical ties with the princely house of hohenzollern changed the name of his family to of romania and gave up all princely titles conferred upon him and his family by the german hohenzollerns on  august  michael signed a document removing the title prince of romania and the qualification of royal highness from his grandson nicholas medforthmills who was also removed from the line of succession the former king took the decision with an eye on romanias future after the reign and life of his eldest daughter margarita the former king hopes that nicholas will find in future years a suitable way to serve the ideals and use the qualities that god gave him nicholass mother princess helen received notification
